technologie war lange stark dass sich entsprechende unternehmen praktisch alle erlauben konnten datenschutz kartellgefahr nicht wichtig facebook apple und co hatten bisher eine art regulatorischen freifahrtschein nun plotzlich ist diesis privileg bedroht amerikas tech konzernen schlagt ungewohnt viel widerstand entgegen man hat un gesagt dass innovation immer gut ist wetterte der kalifornische abgeordnete brad sherman bei einer anhorung mittwoch us kongress doch dem sei nicht die innovativste sache diesem jahrhundert geschah als osama bin laden die innovative idee hatte zwei flugzeuge turme zu steuern und die libra die geplante digitalwahrung von facebook konnte fur amerika sogar noch gefahrlicher werden als bin laden fugte sherman allen ernstes hinzu es ist das erste mal uberhaupt dass sich der kongress mit dem libra projekt befasst das die art wie wir bezahlen revolutionieren soll die entsprechenden zweitagigen anhorungen gerieten zu einer generalabrechnung mitfacebook die abgeordneten bombardierten den nach washington angereisten libra chef david marcus mit kritik der konzern der lange als amerikanische leuchtturmunternehmen gefeiert wurde wirkte plotzlich eher wie ein hort des bosen ich traue euch jungs nicht beschie die republikanische senatorin martha mcsally libra chef marcus und ich bin nicht allein facebook sei mit uber zwei milliarden nutzern kein unternehmen mehr warnte us senator john kennedy es ist ein staat mit libra wurden facebook und seine partner immense wirtschaftliche macht ausuben die wahrungen und regierungen destabilisieren konne sagte maxine

ausserlich beherrscht uber sich ergehen er antwortete ausgesucht hoflich nur manchmal verzogen sich seine lippen zum dunnen strich und marcus faltete die hande wie zum gebet bringe world close together die welt enger zusammenbringen lautet facebooks selbsterklarte ziel bei der libra scheint das schon vor dem start des projekts gelungen zu sein nur eben ander als es sich die techie aus dem kalifornischen menlo park erhofft hatten vereint ist die welt vor allem widerstand gegen facebook politiker experten und aufsichtsbehorden vielen landern teilen die sorge dass die privatwahrung risiken fur das finanzsystem den wettbewerb und die gesellschaft bringt die g7finanzminister haben ihre bedenken genauso kundgetan wie us notenbankchef jerome powell oder prasident donald trump us kongress verbindet demokraten und republikaner ein wachsende misstrauen gegen einen konzern der datenschutz vielfach ignoriert hat und gegen den die verbraucherschutzbehorde ftc gerade eine strafe von funf milliarden dollar verhangt hat amerika durchlebt einen fall von enttauschter liebe einer umfrage des meinungsinstitutes harris zur reputation der 100 bekanntesten unternehmen ist facebook von platz 51 der rangliste auf platz 94 jahr 2019 abgesturzt traditionell ist den amerikanern datenschutz eher gleichgultig aber nach einer serie von skandalen wird vielen doch zunehmend mulmig die eu habe regelungen beschlossen die ihren burgern kontrolle uber die eigenen daten gebe lobte der republikanische senator mike crapo wir mussen ahnliche verpflichtungen etablieren es passiert nicht oft dass us politiker europa als vorbild zitieren facebook ist gefahrlich sagte senator sherrod brown aus ohio das soziale netzwerk habe den politischen diskur zerstort den journalismus kaputtgemacht die russische wahlkampfeinmischung zugelassen und dabei geholfen einen volkermord auszulosen sie zerstoren unsere demokratie als zuckerberg jungst nancy pelosi kontaktierte war die sprecherin des reprasentantenhauses laut einem bericht der washington post fur den beruhmten grunder nicht zu sprechen und sie rief auch nicht zuruck facebook ist nicht der einzige tech konzern der ungnade fallt vor allem die demokraten die liberalen silicon valley lange naturliche verbundete sahen lehnen sich inzwischen auch gegen andere firmen auf selbst die forderung von prasidentschaftsbewerberin elizabeth warren die internetgiganten amazon google und facebook zu zerschlagen wird zunehmend ernsthaft diskutiert parallel zur libra anhorung beschaftigte sich diese woche noch ein ausschuss mit der macht und den praktiken der tech riesen der facebook konzern zu dem neben dem sozialen netzwerk auch die dienste instagram whatsapp und facebook messenger gehoren geriet auch dort ins visier wenn ein konzern vier der sech weltweit grossten institutionen gemessen aktiven nutzern besitzt dann gibt es dafur ein wort sagte der demokratische abgeordnete joe neguse und zwar monopol das marktdurchdringungsmodell von facebook funktioniere nach der methode catch kill urteilte auch sein senatskollege mark warner immer wenn ein herausforderer dem riesen gefahrlich werde kaufe man dessen technologie oder idee einfach auf ob das auch bei libra laufen sollelibra topmanager marcus blieb nur immer wieder zu beteuern dass man nicht starten werde bevor alle regulatorischen bedenken geklart seien der forderung
