conveniente la nociva desregulacion en la que operan las redes sociales particularmente tiktok en casi todos los paise del mundo los gobiernos mas alla de medidas de proteccion de la seguridad nacional deberian regular el impacto en la salud mental en el desarrollo integral de las nuevas generacione las rede sociale destacandose tiktok tienden convertirse mas en un importante problema de salud publica que en uno de seguridad nacional es menor el hecho divulgado por wall street journal de que los tiktoker entre 13 anos 20 ano destinan 52 minuto diario lo que parece ser una adiccion le

establecio la corte constitucional al garantizar el derecho la libertad de expresion en rede sociale teniendo como excepciones inquebrantable la pornografia infantil la instigacion publica directa al genocidio propaganda de la guerra apologia del odio la violencia el delito adicionalmente la corte ha dicho que existe una situacion de indefension cuando se realizan publicaciones que afectan la honra buen nombre de las personas traves de las distintas redes sociales sobre las que el afectado tiene la posibilidad de reaccionar defenderse es claro entonce que nuestro legislador se ha preocupado por los riesgos asociados la interaccion entre ciudadanos pero descuidando totalmente la relacion entre la empresa de la aplicacion el ciudadano ni la ley ni la jurisprudencia han abordado los principales riesgos que se derivan de las decisiones de las empresas que estan detras de aplicaciones como tiktok dentro de los que sobresalen el acceso control de informacion de menores de edad la evidente ausencia de autorregulacion de las mismas para restringir juegos actividade que pongan en riesgo la integridad humana como es el caso de los retos tiktok que amenazan la salud fisica mental  la desbocada libertad de desarrolladores para involucrar inconsultamente los usuarios de las rede con juegos contenidos interactivos concursos actividade casi impuestas menore de edad las

El sector considera insuficiente la nueva ley de distribución de seguros;Los expertos apuestan por la digitalización y la desregularización en favor de una mayor agilidad en la contratación de pólizas,JULIA F. CADENAS,2020-09-21T00:00:00Z,International,,News,1580,la directiva europea sobre la distribucion de seguros  es insuficiente ha llegado tiempo en espana la norma europea de 2016 entro en vigor en espana el pasado febrero justo ante de la declaracion del estado de alarma como consecuencia de la pandemia del covid19 que catalizo los cambios que ya se venian gestando en el sector al que transforma en un ecosistema omnicanal totalmente digital sin embargo la norma se ha quedado corta ha conseguido sentar las bases para regular el mundo online que ha dejado el coronavirus que ha llegado para quedarse asi lo han valorado los especialistas del sector en un desayuno hibrido presencial telematico organizado por cincodias kpmg bajo el titulo de el impacto de la idd en el modelo de distribucion de seguros en espana para analizar el escenario en el que se debe mover el sector de los seguros tras la trasposicion de la directiva europea el proposito principal de la idd que aun debe convalidarse en el congreso de los diputados es proteg los consumidores de seguros al establecer mayor transparencia e informacion sin embargo se adapta al nivel de digitalizacion actual al que han llegado el sector la sociedad la normativa se proyecta sobre un contexto de mercado totalmente distinto el ecosistema de competidores es mucho mas complejo da la sensacion de que la regulacion va por detras de la evolucion del negocio explica francisco uria socio responsable del sector financiero para kpmg ema socio principal de kpmg abogados moderador del encuentro los expertos opinan que la idd aporta avance relevante en el terreno de juego de los seguros desde que se comenzo debatir el primer borrador en 2016 hasta ahora todo ha cambiado asi lo indica daniel lopez rodriguez responsable de la asesoria juridica corporativa de vidacaixa la ley se ha traspuesto como se ha podido hemos sido los ultimos en europa en incorporarla recuerda el abogado que asegura algo compartido por todos los present en el encuentro la regulacion se ha quedado algo corta si la comparamos con la realidad el covid ha hecho mas que evidenciarlo la norma segun lopez llega cuatro anos tarde para acompanar el proceso de digitalizacion del sector necesitamos una idd mas moderna ajuste en la ley del contrato de seguro que supone un freno procesos de innovacion en el sector anade pilar galan directora en el area de servicios financiero de kpmg abogados con experiencia en procesos de implantacion regulatoria explica que cuando la idd se empezo fraguar estaba ideada para regular un mundo digital menos desarrollado que el de 2020 por eso la norma se ha quedado atra segun galan la ley introduce algunas pautas para la distribucion online pero ninguna que regule la experiencia del cliente en un mundo enteramente digital la normativa ha nacido desfasada abunda oscar merino director de la asesoria juridica de seguros prevision de santander espana secretario del consejo de administracion de santander seguros el compendio de obligaciones que incluye la norma tienen sentido en un mundo donde prima la inmediatez anade los expertos senalan la importancia de encontrar un principio de proporcionalidad para aquellas coberturas que nacen para adaptarse la realidad concreta del consumidor en un momento puntual  que requieren tal exceso de regulacion necesitamos una evolucion normativa en ambito muy diversos apostilla el abogado de vidacaixa nuevos competidore la idd reconoce la presencia de los nuevos actores tecnologicos son las insurtech startups que utilizan la tecnologia para crear nuevas formas de ofrecer seguros al cliente las big tech grandes companias tecnologicas globalizadas como google amazon facebook apple que comienzan introducirse en el sector los nuevos jugadore representan desafio diferentes las insurtech han llegado para colaborar pero las big tech tienen una capacidad disruptiva mas potente afirma lopez que pone un ejemplo google acaba de anunciar que se asociara con una reaseguradora para ofrecer seguros de salud ahi puede estar el reto la competencia el cambio expone carlos falcon director general de ibercaja mediacion de seguros por su parte va mas alla si las insurtech modifican el tablero de juego en el mundo las big tech lo vuelcan boca abajo afirma estamos asistiendo al nacimiento de companias aseguradoras distribuidoras grandes operadores digitale que deberian estar reguladas por las mismas reglas comenta merino que anade que la idd aporta seguridad juridica la cristalizacion de este nuevo entorno sin embargo elena jimenez de andrade presidenta del colegio de mediadores de seguros considera que la normativa europea tendria que haber ahondado en una mayor regulacion de los operadores tecnologicos esta norma se queda un poco corta un poco lejos de lo que el cliente necesita abunda jimenez esta bien regular los comparadore web pero podriamos haber ido un poco mas alla el abogado de vidacaixa coincide con el resto de la mesa anade que la idd regula las estructuras que ya existian en espana desde hace tiempo los comparadores pero preve formula nuevas en cualquier caso lopez cree que las insurtech son una amenaza porque pueden sustituir los agente ya present en el sector tienen una funcion auxiliar aunque tambien disruptiva pero solo porque ayudan seguir evolucionando afirma segun el experto las plataformas tecnologicas ganaran mayor peso con los anos como ya se ha visto durante la pandemia en la distribucion directa de los seguros impacto del coronavirus el virus del covid19 ha acelerado la digitalizacion del sector que ya se adivinaba en el largo plazo la distribucion digital de seguros por canale presenciale ha cobrado fuerza desde marzo aunque el ecosistema empresarial ya estaba preparado para ello desde mucho ante la pandemia nos ha hecho conscientes de la importancia de estar en el movil del cliente para adaptarnos sus necesidade eso es positivo dice jimenez merino afirma que el negocio estuvo la altura de las circunstancias durante los meses mas duros de la crisis sanitaria el confinamiento nos ha puesto prueba ha servido para que el sector implante en tiempo record la oferta digital que tenia prevista medio plazo indica el asesor de santander el sector asegurador ha hecho un esfuerzo titanico para cubrir los siniestros anade sin embargo pesar del impulso que ha tomado la digitalizacion para salvar las restricciones para frenar el virus el negocio de los seguros se enfrenta un reto conseguir adaptarse un cliente 100 digital en un panorama muy regulado donde se debe cumplir con gran cantidad de requisitos de documentacion hay personas que han perdido miedos prejuicios por lo que van demandar mas en el campo digital explica lopez el futuro es omnicanal se podra hacer todo traves de todos los canales cuando el cliente prueba el modelo digital es dificil volverle pedir que llame por telefono que transite por canales burocraticos como ocurria hasta ahora explica falcon por su parte apostilla que la pandemia nos ha servido para ponernos los primeros de la fila la experiencia de cliente ahora esta en la oficina sino en la app en la web expectativas pos covid la pandemia ha cambiado la forma en la que el consumidor se relaciona con la compania en algunas ocasione ha conseguido que pase de un extremo  al otro  hay que estar preparados para el aluvion de clientes digitale que llegaran ahora que ante teniamos advierte lopez ademas la percepcion de la cobertura tambien ha cambiado el consumidor ha entendido lo importante que es comprender bien cual es el riesgo que cubre el seguro que ha contratado por eso tenemos que poner en valor el asesoramiento acompanarlo darle una cobertura integral pero mayor de lo necesario aclara el experto de vidacaixa los productos aseguradore tambien estan evolucionando hacia modelos mas modernos contemporaneos las tendencias actuale que estan influenciadas por el cambio en la apreciacion del riesgo tras la crisis sanitaria el covid nos ha ensenado que estamos mas expuesto lo incierto de lo que nos creiamos por ello ante de tomar cualquier decision nos preocupamos mucho mas que ante del seguro que la cubrira comenta merino nuestra obligacion es completar los productos ampliar la oferta para satisfacer las nuevas necesidades que las relaciones humanas mercantiles van demandar tras la experiencia sufrida por la pandemia concluye el experto de santander adaptarse morir anade falcon todo un desafio acomodarse la era pos covid en el sector de los seguros supone una dificultad extra por su exigente marco regulatorio hasta que punto la regulacion se convierte en un freno para la innovacion la hora de responder de manera agil las demandas de los clientes se pregunta uria galan contesta hay que ir un paso mas alla si queremos unir agilidad garantizar las exigencias del consumidor segun la abogada de kpmg la idd incluye detalle sobre como combinar los dos aspectos por lo que augura que durante un tiempo primara la autorregulacion del sector,Cinco Dias

year steve milunovich make feel home jeremy burton thank last 12 month probably make couple comment first maybe start nature customer conversation drill specifically macro trend work get last year customer conversation interesting think change fairly dramatically never many conversation briefing center business people typically tend talk guy infrastructure increasingly get access executive line business executive probably surprisingly number briefing actually bring team topic conversation increasingly business transformation digital transformation product company enhance product software service company deliver service directly mobile device use software run mobile deviceso conversation quickly get point paraphrase say hey would really like become software company really matter industry see sport retailer see automotive supplier pharmaceutical company conversation different lead conversation tend pivotal familiar might remember set pivotal probably 18 month ago two year ago really design build new application data platform host new kind application business transformation conversation invariably lead conversation around datum center transformation mainstream vmware emc play would tell last 12 month meeting cio head infrastructure without discuss private andor hybrid cloud strategy lead us quite bit work area deliver hybrid cloud finite period time finite amount money business think nature conversation change obviously underpin lot top level driver thing like cloud mobile social big datum four big tech trend like certainly family company pivotal vmware emc think least date able navigate well look last quarter top line grow 9 certainly stack incredibly favorably versus large cap tech peer certainly take last three year consistently grow top line think probably 3 watershed many large cap tech peer fall think ever manage dip mark last 12 quarter one comment specifically around infrastructure kind high level group specifically around infrastructure core part emc information infrastructure business run first trend last 12 month really directly address move towards flash technology datum center think sit last year flash array xtremeio marketplace sit year product exit q3 500 million run rate zero sit last year think bet man would say reach 1 billion fast emc product history include vmware would say probably get 1 billion half time obviously big play us acquire company early year call dssd another play realm flash flash storage array server attach flash product think go big role play memory database new application people build future flash clearly big deal clearly something address get couple big thing roll last year extreme thing people want incredible latency performance want economic trend towards software define storage commodity drive may familiar introduce vipr couple year ago recently package vipr dense commodity hardware something call elastic cloud storage appliance people want object storage infrastructure like amazon s3 want block infrastructure like amazon ebs want stand internally provide self service access application owner provide software define appliance level converged infrastructure big trend might notice bring vce emc information infrastructure joint venture emc vmware pivotal sorry emc vmware cisco recently bring back inside emc continue well last quarter growth 50 2 billion run rate think decision give us lot flexibility converged infrastructure future also announce little bit market hyper converged infrastructure go partner vmware evo rail project whether kind departmental enterprise whether datum center feel evo rail effort vce get basis cover finally cloud late announcement set 15 month ago joint lab emc vmware pivotal prove customer solution solution probably overused term tech let specific mean prove hardware software plus large amount consult intellectual property use prior engagement package together deliver customer hybrid cloud 28 day obviously package service offering allow us start 50yard line instead customer start 50yard line instead 10yard line goal go large department say look virtualize result enough automate provide sell service provide lot public cloud type experience application owner way quickly cost effectively set flash software define storage commodity converge infrastructure cloud macro trend affect infrastructure think probably say last year pretty busy address questions answerssteve milunovich great thank great introduction maybe talk little bit demand side thing macro side feel storage demand generally use efficiency feature forth specifically term product cycle start see accelerate revenue growth get vmax go new year emerge technology group obviously strong put together term expect go forwardjeremy burton yes great question point first kd kill make forward look statement involve risk read sec filing website storage demand environment mean look challenging see prior year continue case see customer certainly leverage efficiency technology thin provisioning de duplication compression ever also use case storage array would get refresh every three four year uncommon see equipment flow five year six year maybe even seven year people certainly sweat asset long think able withstand kind lull demand like well diverse nature portfolio much high end storage vmax drag growth year look something like isilon north 1 billion still grow strongly double digit think plenty headroom isilon team start push new workload isilon familiar scale nas box really come market let us say eight nine year ago focus thing like seismic exploration oil exploration medium entertainment video editing turn system equally good maybe run home directory enterprise consolidate 10 even 100 filer single system start provide access lot datum thing like object hdfs protocol hadoop team start spring organization isilon team start tap  many 10 isilon customer base point actually deploy underneath hadoop instance pivotal well cloudera hortonworks well lull high end vmax able make great performance xtremeioxtremeio say early flash array latency sensitive workload see datum center move flash technology acquire xtremeio back two half year ago lot pressure think bring market hold onto soon emc badge expectation quality think go fairly dramatically people mind see product capable take latency sensitive workload vdi initially database datum field show get five nine availability even late release 30 get 300 install appear rock solid say look kind block storage overall vmax vnx also look xtremeio say look three together grow 3x fast storage market growth go put take think xtremeio think probably 20 business replace exist vmax vnx installation big chunk probably 30 get us new account well diversity think help us weather storm well little bit diversity come line maybe mid next year dssd mention early steve milunovich let us talk little bit federation think call platform 3 view perhaps need closely align vmware particular joe speak last week say something effect time make major correction need tightly align internet thing telecom market could kind give us current emc think term much federation still loosely couple versus often really go go market togetherjeremy burton yes think  give rise smile mean spend large part career oracle mid 1990 tension group pull rein happen loosely couple structure like one right mean would say every big company would tend friction product group mean ignore vmware second look product group look plenty tension get manage time time look think fair say emc big customer often vmware big customer look increasingly buy outcome hey would really like private cloud move hybrid cloud want less vendor involve want single throat choke would tell sponsor number account want strategy federation want federation speak one voice want base strategy around component federation like idea get choice goal lock folk another 20 year diversity lot respect bad would say big good customer long know joe customer come first probably speak customer want us align would probably point big customer align go market many customer emc customer vmware customer vmware customer use somebody else storage tough align mass get fortune 5000 versus fortune 100 much diversity think customer really want us align big customer guy get big spend area think enterprise hybrid cloud solution one example align look deliver outcome steve milunovich yes cio survey find slight edge would prefer vmware separate believable large account probably would prefer together also find way var tend pretty strongly prefer vmware separate term feel time compete emc deal know happen jeremy burton yes might want recheck datum point hear mean know  guy well go survey folk nice first little say really want recently go survey change mind mean use market give data point prove theory reality think one find var think different customer base think get big emc vmware customer man want alignment single message partner get big emc vmware business think go want alignment help internally align strategy less dependent emc less dependent vmware go see little bit flux steve milunovich could talk bit change vce first view importance converged infrastructure positive risk term bring vce housejeremy burton yes vce first know joint venture vmware cisco emc actually intel well first establish vce five year ago well aware joint venture last forever matter well intention day one know point go come decision point us decision point decide five year creation happen october year compelling event like decision point would bake initial contract majority owner lot respect us move want make next upside look believe converged infrastructure three five year infrastructure think buy way people go buy system go buy service component component business five year actually think end world hurt people want outcome stick big company system service vce give us ability build deploy converged infrastructure big good tend like smb sme play tend datum center play case service provider play think say 5 year people consume infrastructure way benefit think bring vce back committed go path vblock spin vmware cisco emc always way ability diversify could block want produce get slightly different ingredient give us great penetration converged infrastructure also think final benefit touch early people customer look converged infrastructure really look outcome deliver quickly get hardware software service need implement solution much short period time never feel pressure business think vce give us packaging distribution capability everything show customer site ready go mean look downside  know gotchas would say look go probably partner cisco partner get long term agreement place committed deliver vblock mean look standpoint partner albeit partner generate pretty large revenue stream ucs clear cut think probably obvious one look second one get take bit expense mind take bit expense capability house provide great diverse range converged infrastructure believe market go good thing steve milunovich let us talk bit cloud think storage vendor wrestle approach public hybrid cloud netapp today talk approach recently announcement could take us emc approach isjeremy burton yes thing hear time time come back directly sale team look conversation cio head infrastructure today without talk private cloud quickly turn hybrid cloud conversation number one hybrid cloud general nebulous term customer general really know entail much cost long take put try first foremost really demystify hybrid cloud announcement really culmination 15 month work conjunction vmware say look let us specific write recipe book around hybrid cloud environment entail hardware software key process within would want automate would want serve self service way would package well deliver definite finite period time enterprise hybrid cloud announcement really say look lay hybrid cloud foundation mr customer 28 day reason 28 day six nine month lot service deliver past year implement  many customer package part overall solution implementation come ready migrate workload vmware vcloud public cloud service future support migration workload place like  well first foremost job really take mystery work lab vmware way category customer talk go go vmware path go go openstack path go see us next year also introduce hybrid cloud stack go openstack control plain top vmc storage also microsoft control plain top vmc storage strategy would get conversation take mystery customer able deliver full solution customer finite period time finite amount money turn next erp implementation everything go public cloud right folk go spend 100 million wait two year order get private hybrid cloud foundation believe least really technology issue point deliver solution customer help customer work organizational change require adopt new process hybrid cloud steve milunovich get essentially converge infrastructure product kind private cloud side clear part product set hardware software go kind public cloud side also company buy think summer gate way facilitate perhaps datum movement cloud fit injeremy burton yes number level track around hybrid cloud look get get data center could pick storage go drop one amazon partner use ec2 storage right hybrid cloud well yes think anything particularly innovative drop emc storage array inside datum center locate next amazon use compete storage people find interesting hey keep storage storage array benefit elastic compute great think niche think  steve milunovich basically talk netapp equinix direct connect right jeremy burton call direct connect see us make big deal think big deal drop emc storage array amazon datacenter grade connect ec2 grade look one option another option would instead put storage amazon leave storage premise maybe trickle datum amazon twinstrata maginatics two company acquire allow us move datum primary storage array backup product across network take advantage potentially public cloud economic implement private cloud premise one transformation think department go maybe could move datum amazon gateway buy twinstrata maginatics could primary storage datum could backup datum could say hey want move storage entirely public cloud environment move equinixs datum center use amazon direct connect get peace mind storage leverage elastic compute ability move entire workload public cloud talk enterprise hybrid cloud five minute ago talk last use case hey mr customer go make environment private cloud pooled resource automation self service go give connectivity vcloud air go stratify workload go make call want run premise go run cloud think go draw line sand say know go manage go manage cost go deliver service level want manage premise regulatory requirement actually think majority hybrid environment workmean tech industry love talk great use case end quarter everything go burst magically public cloud niche people go workload analysis go stay look tier 1 run tier 2 run tier 3 run tier 2 tier 3 think public cloud think long time come tier 1 likely premise line go different depend kind company talk steve milunovich vmware pretty critical strategically high alignment kind view vmware degree cloud strategy separate would able sort thing alliancejeremy burton yes alliance say solution overly use word tech industry would say alliance probably another one guess  would say possible degree difficulty much much high work lot tech alliance last 20 year look difficult get another company unrelated page building technology go market together get kind force function direct response question would say yes vmware play important role go talk company want move towards hybrid cloud environment huge bank last week europe 40000 virtual machine environment right mean like shockingly big look emc vmware stack infrastructure pivotal cloud foundry top next generation application thing although relevant today vmware emc relevant today move future think alliance pivotal become even important next generation application go build kind new development platform really pivotal try provide want infrastructure underneath new development platform well serve annex pivotal way last seven eight year kind annex vmware world still get go small revenue today truly believe enter period time almost like mid 1990 application development go see massive amount custom software build debt platform go like bea application server oracle database like back day go something else pivotal hunt something else want infrastructure underneath something else kind go forward think become arguably important emc vmware today steve milunovich competition currently view landscape change say expect grow three time storage market rate obviously imply continue share gain difficult early mention maybe even focus much traditional competitor go forward game change jeremy burton yes certainly encounter traditional competitor day day basis look growth dollar growth dollar go storage tend new area like flash array like software define kind investment dollar like start go new area mention early think first start workload datum center become incredibly latency sensitive perfect candidate flash array mean guarantee response time less millisecond lot performance issue go away datum center certainly see movement take place whole new set folk compete flash array business traditional competitor really see space ibm tms ibm legacy storage product great think tms point probably still pretty well think still viable competitor believe time exit year flash business big probably next least next two combined probably next three vendor combine stand start back time last year flash big deal lot growth dollar xtremeio one vector innovation intercept trend one talk much dssd think even day go dssdcom get set intense reading session mean really nothing bill moore  zfs one founder 3par andy bechtolsheim build dense name suggest dense ssd dense flash storage offering actually really storage array talk like  weird wonderful protocol use year talk language application talk hdfs talk key value reason thing design real latency monster believe new world head everybody get access application mobile device go get lot stream information instead us transaction processing world come oracle database transaction processing instead processing transaction go process stream stream go need process memory often go deal consumer sit iphones man thing go respond think memory computing go huge deal look go require storage standpoint memory system go need order magnitude well latency order magnitude bandwidth dssd move storage side network service side still share storage plug compute pcie3 think latency performance characteristic think go groundbreake pretty bullish come next year think tap new vector growth storage industry memory big lot new application use memory something think well place tap nobody else able charge premium xtremeio dssd software define component commodity  probably nice word exist emc vocabulary two three year ago let us definitive look get lot company come briefing centre enamor google amazon way work like hey want software define storage strategy run commodity drive vipr project start three four year ago whole bunch team asio microsoft come emc build vipr really still early day version two incarnation start see lot pickup package vipr dense commodity storage department say hey look want stop shadow go amazon s3 want self service environment stand get run minute elastic cloud storage appliance plug go get self service access via developer get amazon s3 like environment though think lot way like new growth vector really see high end pressure get tap new growth vector overall continue grow business grow 3x storage market growth always goal last year steve milunovich okay let pause see investor question jeremy one continue know cfo perhaps kind address investment emc make pretty clear year eps take kind 015 020 hit six seven new investment would imagine next year come still negative apparently go talk analyst meeting probably early next year management think get bottom line leverage long wait see payoffjeremy burton yes ultimate question long wait mean difficult thing think last couple year technology acquire case push distribution channel boom take look period maybe 2008 2010 2011 couple datum domain one isilon another mean thing go 100 million think take isilon seven eight year get 100 million inside emc take four year get 1 billion right something could put distribution channel take even xtremeio might remember probably 15 18 month make investment right clearly dilutive 15 18 month ship product start see pickup look let us face 500 million run rate business overall 25 billion still big enough move needle say xtremeio clearly see make investment three year ago would lot traditional storage competitor today right would receive end hiding right would feel good feel bullish xtremeio business make statement dssd disclose price big investment 18 go almost 18 month unlike xtremeio get revenue right believe differentiate believe one future revenue ramp go lead improvement bottom line keep go talk storage investment mean vipr another one invest big really organically build software define storage strategy commodity drive look revenue ramp  believe future another one world move software define commodity move towards flash get good play start today think would beat pivotal another big investment think world think new app go build differently everything lead us believe want play long term think way stop someone like aws maybe compete commodity infrastructure get build well platform believe folk want lock platform go use next 15 20 year today think choice prefer open platform could deploy many many different cloud invest thinking market go look pivotal revenue today couple hundred million dollar lot ratable grow 24 big enough move needle look look vmware say get airwatch nicira software define network think one future mobile think big look revenue 100 million hundred million dollar quite big enough yet move needle macro point last couple year think invest ahead revenue rightly point impact margin start see lift maybe even pick three lift anything like xtremeio year think stand good chance relevant future today present past steve milunovich yes understanding cto come think two year ago find emc spend fairly low percentage budget emerge technology really shift apparently guy even put aside hundred million dollar maybe come year accelerate thing might buy like dssdjeremy burton yes mean look every large cap tech company go right get exist business keep light pay rent generate cash flow grow slowly get new business hope go make relevant future take money business put risk today revenue cash flow hope make relevant future aggressively move money around one thing pretty maniacal track internally get model use drive spend would tell last three year huge shift internally towards invest xtremeios dssd pivotal vce traditional storage platform today way critical keep storage platform go get world big company run thousand workload go away get keep run got keep innovate time build something future think tech stop invest period time never catch steve milunovich great think need stop jeremy thank much join us jeremy burton right thank,FD (Fair Disclosure) Wire
