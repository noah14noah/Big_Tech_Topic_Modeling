addition year come also believe evolution market highly constructive company give scope scale fleet competitiveness term overall low variable cost heat rate fact need meet load requirement problem province sorry ability repurpose reposition coal fire fleet gas fire fleet even competitive presently capital cost fraction new build term structure may take us get certainty market design government alberta retention energy construct happy retention structure pretty unique compare power market alberta market relatively pure relatively light regulatory intervention experience market outcome dependent demand supply operating cost time return capital bid embed market price expect continue expect regulatory construct permit case order ensure reliability maintain province low marginal cost generator critical today continue critical future competitiveness generally something much focused fleet well positioned compete market blend 0 cost wind hydro dawn show one early slide really one large fleet type province competitive essential thermal generation shift low cost gas also expect alberta continue constructive carbon pricing framework broadly along line currently approximately 30 per co2 tonne price credit exist wind hydro generation province see today change broadly support strategy alberta business emphasize coal gas investment development boiler conversion gas repowere combine cycle facility time supportive believe appropriate pricing alberta average price 57 per megawatt hour range past 18 year would little bit higher probably close 60 range take away 2016 2017 unusual year due role balancing pool play termination historic power purchase arrangement short run marginal cost bidding time period atypical term see time year date price 57 per megawatt hour balance forward price bit 60 megawatt hour also see forward curve 2020 2021 suggest price 56 59 per megawatt hour range respectively slide also show edc associates forecast province edc base alberta understand market well generally consider lead independent forecaster jurisdiction forecast also suggest supportive price well 60 80 range provide strong margin alberta base generate fleet support plan investment thermal fleet brett wayne go talk shortly underpin price forecast historic expect ongoing load growth province average 15 per year since 2009 forecast grow 1700 megawatt 2025 load growth last year talk growth peak peak approximately 33 04 growth quarter quarter first quarter year notwithstanding relatively weak overall economic picture alberta lend support power price province show level incremental supply addition able absorb market large incumbent player province diversified generate fleet supportive gas conversion repowering strategy although see throughout presentation strategy really focused load growth require price significantly high level accustomed see marketplace coal gas repowering conversion strategy much orient towards replace megawatt currently market extend life facility reduce operating cost even far last point remain drive desire reduce per megawatt hour cost generation 2 large input cost really carbon emission fuel brett speak co2 emission reduction focus impact carbon price carbon price saving target see slide large supply natural gas alberta result associated reduction price gas last 15 year also highly supportive gas focus strategy help us even low cost generator province really highlight next slide show expect marginal fuel cost carbon cost time critical energy market much focused marginal cost order competitive blue bar left indicate fleet wide weighted average price generation base current composition fleet include wind hydro asset convert coal fleet gas introduce 2 gas repowere unit expect weighted average marginal cost per megawatt hour fall 35 pretty dramatically approximately 15 per megawatt hour clearly support competitiveness province point would like takeaway today generate fleet need province absolutely critical province load meet require level reliability use alberta electric system operator long range adequacy metric slide show ongoing importance exist coal eventually gas fire supply meet need alberta chart left little busy show blue line peak demand expect iso next 2 year remove dark green think one slide well guess pink think look bit brown yesterday top chart represent capacity available intermittent wind generation intertie importance exist instal coal gas hydro meet need province pretty clear chart right also base iso long term adequacy metric point currently real expectation tight supply period province near term supply cushion represent show difference firm supply firm exclude intermittent uncertain wind intertie supply expect daily peak demand course next year highlight potential supply deficit extended period time forecasted period fact chart probably bit hard see actually show supply cushion actually negative extended period time low dip see reliable generation available province consider supply perspective key take away think keephills sundance unit require meet need province know characterize high consistent industrial load level relatively limited

monetary flow hydro fleet see earn 90 million energy sale 104 million ancillary service sale year pay 56 million balancing pool term ppa capacity payment provide payment disappear end ppa expect go able make bunch lose cash flow increase power price also carbon credit expect receive fleet finally transalta earn another 41 million hydro fleet non ppa hydro asset transmission part segment way report also hydro service provide like water management service black start capability pretty stable cash flow year year cost hydro operation 2018 47 million deduct revenue stream outline chart go would give pro forma ebitda hydro business roughly 240 million 244 million range believe within range would normally expect business provide follow expiry ppa talk little bit next slide however 2018 term ppa pay balancing pool 135 million form annual energy ancillary service payment talk early typically payment equal broadly approximate 100 energy revenue receive 50 ancillary service revenue business would receive would lead report number 109 million year payment 135 million payment go end ppa end 2020in chart present range post ppa ebitda outcome hydro fleet remove impact ppa range alberta flat price range 50 70 price expect hydro business generate ebitda range 200 million 250 million roughly translate ebitda lift 18 million 20 million every 5 per megawatt hour increase price roughly translate turn wind solar fleet 1300 megawatt capacity actually 21 facility additional facility actually solar massachusetts wind locate alberta ontario quebec new brunswick wyoming minnesota currently develop 4 project diverse set location increase size fleet almost 400 megawatt fleet highly contract average capacity weight contract life 11 year provide us predictable grow cash flow around 250 million year large wind generator canada one large platform north america extensive house experience wind farm development aron go speak bit later strong operating model wind operation highly developed remote operation monitor experienced maintenance program team significant datum analytic optimization capability wind fleet really focused greenlight initiative example typically come employee one work develop new weather forecasting model help us way operate wind farm winter time avoid icing blade think go result 1 million 15 million year give sense benefit thing work pretty hard team stanford university course last year deal wake effect yaw farm think work analysis help us go increase output wind farm 1 15 really excited collaboration turn natural gas fleet get 1300 megawatt natural gas generate fleet locate alberta ontario western australia focus meet need diverse set industrial commercial utility customer portfolio asset highly contract average capacity weight contract life 7 year provide us stable set earning company largely base capacity payment arrangement little variability hear aron later presentation see renew interest site generation think go add size generate fleet growth team begin work ramp excited gas team also spend lot time work project greenlight initiative give 1 example couple example actually australia really focused centralize remote operation southern part generation western australia go fold south hedland plant expect reduction labor cost go roughly 1 million 15 million year initiative develop employee another example work gas turbine sarnia one engineer take upon see could reduce load point effectively fast generator effectively run view meet need facility term heat steam also time make sure stay within envelope emission lower fuel consumption burn less gas see significant initiative see us save 3 million maybe little bit million dollar year facility another great example way employee project greenlight think help business want touch contracting believe successful secure extension gas fire facility get 65 year incremental contract life able achieve indicate slide one key focus right contracting talk sarnia 500megawatt sarnia regional cogen plant contract expiry come 2022 2025 period customer contract aeso actively engage discussion government ontario aeso exist customer also prospective customer see get extension even new contract extend cash flow contract cash flow facility overall think important note company pretty highly contract weighted average contract life exclude coal fire generation approximately 11 year upon expiry ppa end 2020 thermal ppa end 2020 majority ebitda still remain tie contract asset uncontracted portion fleet locate primarily alberta think go able realize upside

expect make decision later year early next year also owner engineer board assist us work need combined cycle repowere sun 5 keephills 1 also enter carbon cost benefit sharing agreement balancing pool alberta keephills 1 2 actually allow us co fire fairly heavily 2 unit share benefit ppa finish end 2020 discussion also underway additional pipeline gas supply capacity improve reliability brett touch bit later see overall well implementation also indicate opening remark believe substantial benefit conversion gas firstly provide attractive investment return brett give insight significantly extend life fleet get detail later also substantially lower operating capital ghg compliance cost natural gas abundant supply competitively price also need understand natural gas conversion gas conversion avoid need us engage significant expenditure emission reduction sox nox emission reduction would require plant stay coal boiler gas conversion low capital quick conversion order 6week outage repowere combine cycle plant 40 50 low capital cost greenfield combine cycle plant next slide take detail benefit let us look life extension plant deliver dotted line slide show transalta coal fleet would close 2029 undertake conversion fact closure would commence mid2020 boiler gas conversion extend plant life well mid late 2030 combine cycle repowere combined cycle conversion extend plant live late 2040 far also possible could undertake combine repowere combined cycle gas conversion previously boiler convert unit example plant like k3 would ideal candidate show early slide convert gas plant technically substantially simple plant coal fire plant huge reduction volume equipment service allow elimination need lot routine operation maintenance equipment co firing gas conversion also allow significant reduction material consume chemical lime activated carbon bag replacement bag filter reduction equipment service work associate operation maintenance equipment support significant reduction operation maintenance work force note plant change already implement co fire gas allow workforce transition commence actually commence 2018 already see benefit low omampa cost 2018 also 2019 really term workforce transition really journey fully convert gas workforce transition probably 50 complete already slide next slide show substantial change sustain capital spend expect plant convert gas light blue section slide first bar chart show kind average mining capital cost run rate sustain capital run rate mine 30 million 40 million per annum post gas conversion mine move reclamation mode capital spend largely eliminate reduction amount equipment service talk couple time early need capital replacement element long operate eliminate well finally gas combustion kind much kind plant result lot less tube wastage erosion boiler less tube repair shielding sort capital cost associate plant see slide expect see fairly substantial 40 50 kind run rate reduction use go little bit post conversion summary plan lay today confirm today see us complete minimum 3 boiler gas conversion end 2021 2 repowere combine cycle gas conversion end 2024 considerably simplify plant operation significant reduction opex capex ghg compliance cost move forward substantially extend life exist coal plant plant competitive alberta market go pass brett gellner brett go take detail economic

behind conversion plan show fleet well position energy market go forward go walk expect ebitda impact alberta thermal fleet different energy price fully convert gas conclude section update natural gas strategy dawn indicate conversion plant design energy market really strike balance low marginal cost unit amount capital reinveste alberta fund near medium term source capital todd go take detail later originally initial plan capacity market go go ahead think repowere 1 unit combine cycle rest boiler conversion retention energy market pivot plan look repowere 2 unit combine cycle low operating cost market go walk competitiveness plan marginal cost perspective capital cost perspective first turn marginal cost chart compare coal unit boiler convert unit repowered unit different natural gas price see repowere unit competitive low heat rate virtually low carbon cost go forward boiler conversion also competitive especially gas 250 gj low john show early forward curve go 2020 currently actually 2 gj competitive even boiler convert unit conversion plant competitive capital cost perspective well see chart capital cost per kw capacity boiler convert unit low go walk next slide capital pay 15 year base solely carbon omission saving get convert coal gas cost repowere combine cycle also attractive compare greenfield brand new combine cycle even brand new greenfield cogen see announcement due wayne say go able use exist steam turbine infrastructure already site result competitive marginal capital cost investment convert gas generate strong return even low energy price scenario let take omission saving show omission saving 100 coal unit boiler convert unit top chart show saving per megawatt hour basis total reduction around 18 megawatt hour due carbon also eliminate mercury avoid operating cost meet nox sox go forward bottom chart convert saving per megawatt total annual saving see range 25 million 50 million per year 400 megawatt unit depend capacity factor unit run give capital cost converted unit around 30 million 35 million see emission saving alone result payback 15 year less result low risk investment furthermore analysis factor avoidance 40 million capital would spend per unit meet nox sox stay coal factor low future omampa sustaining mining cost wayne walk go take investment metric repowere combine cycle unit see chart depend energy price investment cost multiple know akin enterprise value ebitda multiple range 26x 73x attractive well new greenfield project would deliver high cost build greenfield see result repowere unit generate

reduction story consultancy slide show actually increase pricing dynamic drive increase pricing major incumbent player actually decrease cost profilesdawn lorraine farrell john want take thatjohn harry kousinioris sure work yes hear okay term increase price marketplace mean think look price think one key factor occur market way actually close market effectively get 5 major competitor compete strongly mind bid marginal cost also look get return noncapital market think key factor think see load growth market think also reduction number supply market mean couple unit actually leave sundance 1 2 unit go think look potentially battle river 3 also leave market think look another 700 750 megawatt think generation leave market much event drive market think tight often see sort price spike thing think notable market renewable think expect see give nature marketplace kind impact penetration renewable see maybe market act reduction pricing think price come term variable cost come think margin continue pretty good even though might get variability pricing andrew kuske maybe follow see rise peaker introduce market future give volatility energy naturejohn harry kousinioris may right see significant kind movement way possible give reduction cost get peaker technology come possibility dawn lorraine farrell yes let add something think look simple boiler conversion peaker 30 million 50 million make peaker compare couple hundred million make brand new peaker look market would look potential exist stock create pretty good peaker pretty good heat rate julien patrick dumoulin smith

dynamic see term retirement especially give consideration convert unit think sort plus minus load growth retirement coal potentially elsewhere also side ledger think peer present instance pretty attractive multiple conversion even greenfield combine cycle multiple ebitda current think roughly current power price perhaps little bit deep dive ledgerand ask second follow sake get talk little bit alberta market give new government potential suppose consolidation different regulatory regime house think msa could happen think future iteration change rule leave broad dawn lorraine farrell okay brett get take first question john second cleanup brett gellner yes plus minus sorry certainly suncor announce cogen plan come say 2023 radar time factor model john show chart edc pretty robust growth

harry kousinioris julien think second question additional change happen market impact might base new government look think 4 thing look net net candidly think go change kind investment thesis term quickly one get certainly carbon pricing expect month second thing look aeso task look price ceiling price floor try make sure get workable regime relate shortage pricing marketplace consultation really begin task provide update government think february 2020 land change rule kind summertime next year sort july 2020 ongoing piece work general think concern make sure enough signal ensure

sound like borrow obviously resolution carbon detail think material change respect market obviously logistical organizational change john harry kousinioris yes think fair fact look key piece legislation regulation kind govern behavior literally like 10 section 10page kind document mention relatively pure market regulatory light continue expect continue dawn lorraine farrell great next question way side robert hope analyst scotiabank global banking markets research division rob hope scotia actually maybe follow term carbon seem plan base 30 carbon see progress 50 include plan talk flexibility coal gas conversion plan depend carbon goesdawn lorraine farrell go ahead would get soapbox talk hour answer john harry kousinioris look great question model look investment variety way think base case basically 30 case sense broadly government alberta right think long term trend perspective look federal government go election place see end happen depend win election whether approach federal government try impose ever increase carbon price among jurisdiction think trend high carbon generally across jurisdiction think even alberta government pretty good understanding excess supply gas jurisdiction frankly come sector pretty good pretty robust carbon price actually increase consumption gas province net net actually help dynamic gas industry province hopefully give bit sense dawn lorraine farrell yes mean would speak crystal clear current federal government definitive rule require province ramp 50 equivalent put backstop place ontario depend happen election john harry kousinioris court hold sorry cut dawn lorraine farrell yes liberal majority current legislation federally alberta want something differently example alberta want negotiate long term 30 framework reason alberta work proactively federal government get deal model 30 model see case less 30 model 40 50 test assumption model upward increase carbon tax rather downward john harry kousinioris yes term plan imagine go 30 gap coal even boiler conversion even get wide even combine cycle plan actually fit nicely price go get remember even gas peaker market today probably range heat rate dramatically different coal unit go also part increase carbon cost could get reflect energy price high cost market benjamin pham analyst bmo capital markets equity research ben pham bmo capital markets slide

tip go 3 unit repoweringbrett gellner yes know 2 unit mothball today mothball till november 21 kind get next year 2021 look market fundamental matter bring back coal unit coal fire know honest go likely run remember coal unit coal fire 400megawatt unit burn 30 gas modification rest coal unit run 30 burn 100 gas pull back coal unit could come market simply could coal fire think market need payback high capital investment could convert boiler conversion decide another hype combine cycle get start kind make way see market change see fundamental look like assess unit make decision term third say section really try balance much fund fund flow also little cost set asset land able 2 combine cycle unit say want make sure clear wayne show unit come boiler unit come convert unit hard date repower mention keephills 3 example combine cycle unit boiler need steam turbine still good shape infrastructure put another gas turbine unit basically run another 20 25 year opportunity later combine

interact chronic stress stem loneliness know stress connect inflammation turn connect high rate heart disease many chronic illness biological mechanism loneliness may effect say probably mechanism understand bottom line look datum loneliness statistic biology leave inescapable conclusion need fundamentally social creature mean introvert extrovert introvert extrovert need degree human connection even differ much prioritize really much society fact say connection important allow self think many thing far important take eye ball invest human relationship consequence term health bernstein well kid tell connect hang friend phone tablet computer samemurthy bottom line technology bad fact think know somebody spend year build technology company use technology lot believe tech think helpful us

lead much long conversation  want take risk right know find sometimes pick say talk right know good hear voice 30 second make difference prioritize relationship protect relationship insidious invasion technology think important strategy help us rebuild connection life bernstein great great advice surgeon general america doctor couple quick question public health issue seem fade possibly make progress possibly ignore hypertension move forward make progress amount salt diet level hypertension united states problem causesmurthy good question know high blood pressure certainly something everyone hear read headline every day read opioid epidemic read violence time time unfortunate high blood pressure cardiovascular disease broadly one lead cause disease death united states one thing think realize time make advance treat high blood pressure understand give rise high blood pressure make much advance actually reduce rate hypertension high blood pressure united states think part think succeed yet take population base approach address high blood pressure population base approach individual approach individual approach would say okay patient come clinic talk diet exercise put right medicine hopefully address hypertension population base approach say thing like reduce overall sodium content food eat work example package food manufacturer work restaurant reduce sodium content know connection sodium content high blood pressureit also involve think strategy increase physical activity create green space walkable space allow people physically active reduce rate hypertension line also benefit office example release call action around walk walkable community reason turn walk average 22 minute day brisk pace reduce risk diabetes 30 risk heart disease 20 really see big investment create walkable space guarantee though tell pharma company pill take day could reduce risk diabetes 30 think would quite well right people would say hey solution invest solution like sit right front us call sidewalk call park call walkable space  know need people make case congress legislator sidewalk actually powerful public health intervention may look like medicine fit bottle quite impact health bernstein manufacturer x reduce sodium product risk taste loss profit loss sale unless know rest manufacturer go get donemurthy think government important role play somebody believe everything government private sector necessarily overregulate think government step play leadership role bring people together make decision ultimately benefit us one example company willing take risk change sodium content product exactly reason mention worried product taste good taste differently people shift consumption company competitor couple thing know one even reduce sodium content food let us say 10 20 might notice difference time fact order week month palate change acclimate new level sodium content actually true sodium true sugar well could similar thing sugar need sodium bring manufacturer together reduce sodium well sugar content food right turn close 75 package food actually sugar well thing may think like pasta sauce bread cracker powerful know part science practical experience office group us team decide go quote unquote sugar detox give sugar period 30 day bernstein cold turkeymurthy cold turkey give give mean take add sugar anything buy consume product sugar add unnatural could eat orange example would drink juice sugar add find really interesting palate change within order couple week fact one man group participate come back lunch half orange say eat whole orange like could eat sweet everything suddenly taste sweet bottom line human worried change sodium sugar content food permanently go change quality food consume palate adapt long term benefit remain government though think need play important role bring manufacturer table collectively make decision reduce sodium sugar content even incremental amount profound effect life million people bernstein sort convince everybody go go along acclimate amount sugar across productsmurthy right yeah bernstein quick question smoking 15 population yet still probably single great risk factor death united states need leave smokingmurthy well make lot progress lot work 1964 predecessor surgeon general luther terry publish first surgeon general report tobacco smoking rate united states around 42 drop way 15 major major public health victory come easily come hard work people community across country build education campaign come together change policy like increase taxis cigarette create smoke tobacco free place important victory say still lose half million people every year united states due tobacco related disease learn tobacco realize illness associate originally think 2014 fact 50th anniversary surgeon general report tobacco publish recognize unlike 64 one cancer see associate smoking lung cancer 13 cancer also increase risk diabetes see people smoke like see add risk smoking need well think sure double public health strategy see work come smoking mean continue increase taxis cigarette profound effect particularly youth utilization want protect kid tax cigarette actually important strategy second thing work well cessation tool already number fda approve cessation tool market work well patient work well patient need well cessation tool people ask e cigarette context cessation tool wait think enough science say clearly think interesting enough merit strong scientific inquiry see fact safe effective tool smoking cessation want e cigarette people start use e cigarette end use e cigarette traditional cigarette situation call dual use happen population way know work study rigorously think something bernstein go back back nutrition twitter question doctor receive little training diet nutrition plant base diet scientifically show prevent improve heart disease diabetesmurthy great question fact tell nutrition education medical school nutrition education consist eight week class offer week evening optional  many people think go class six us think class one instructor whole lot people traditionally huge gap medicine actually several gap traditional medical training one around nutrition another actually around emotional health well profound impact health really talk much medical school fact say parenthetically power impact emotional health well profound health something see clearly office decide come office need really shift culture understanding around emotion could understand role play health also invest cultivate positive emotion teach child regulate emotion see actually reduce rate addiction major problem right also reduce rate violence reduce incarceration rate improve graduation rate grade reduce teen pregnancy power invest emotional well actually quite extraordinary barely tap come office work colleague build institute emotional health well help make journey us place largely ignore emotion one harness improve health part need change medicine around nutrition education slowly happen think wait medicine get fully board train clinician understand good deal nutrition clinic think need addition training doctor need public health strategy around nutrition talk couple work example manufacturer reduce sodium sugar content also need think availability healthy food beverage community know example accessibility whether term affordability also term location paramount people choice work office building restaurant around office cafeteria food office cafeteria go impact choice make healthy option likely make department defense chance work office part national prevention council chair council set affordable care act bring together secretary major federal agency think policy impact prevention one thing department defense actually experiment look cafeteria basis find need simple thing like change location grill salad bar bring salad bar close front cafeteria could significant increase fact people choice healthy food type population base strategy think essential us take want affect large number people quickly possible work physician training nurse conversation patient clinic hospital important think go happen quickly enough us ultimately get need place people make healthy choice affordable rate ultimately live healthy life bernstein gotcha leave us five minute opioid epidemic see glimmer hope cover three year prescription member congress introduce dozen bill finally address kind thing speak speak absolutely nothing upcoming midterm election course overdose probably rise 2017 get datum particularly fentanyl tell us right opioid epidemic see go forwardmurthy well know opioid epidemic many level heart breaking first start see impact practice medicine boston realize patient come struggle addiction opioid realize doctor well train think pain address pain address addiction save addiction medicine specialist number tragedy opioid also reveal something deep deal problem prescribing come see community across country deep pain people experience deep despair life often feed temporarily assuage opioid alcohol substance easily misuse ultimately want address opioid epidemic need change prescribing practice need expand access treatment need get naloxone hand first responder family member also need think deeply root cause addiction know addiction many way much social disease biological disease mean addiction impact us biological level affect prefrontal cortex affect extended amygdala affect basal ganglia area relate ability deal stress reward control

change year senior go save 320 million year also make change part program generic become available senior immediate access wait whole year mean go pay low price already make change senior start feel go low price think outline number different step whether change part whether address incentive thing go work together go one shot work past year go continue cunningham great discussion coverage low income minute want touch coverage 10 million americans get coverage marketplace course write lot colleague write lot pursuit short term association health plan say would provide people cheap lean insurance option worry end draw healthy consumer marketplace essentially leave behind high risk poolverma think look affordable care act impact point triple digit increase price go 100 since affordable care act start high price see high deductible lot folk even afford plan state one choice health plan get 50 county one plan pay get less choice also cost go much lot individual afford coverage get subsidy way get coverage state one cover one insurer county one insurer price go continue go create virtual monopoly short term limited duration plan give people another choice give option lot time choice coverage type short term limited duration plan potentially could lifeline people face coverage cunningham people marketplace leave high premium ever beforeverma think assess impact think actuarial study show impact high concern million americans place afford coverage unfortunately difficult situation congress address issue affordable care act end day need comprehensive solution administration try address problem repeal replace know work cunningham kind end broad question see pretty significant gain lower uninsured rate year right aca provision go effect lately learn uninsured rate creep back fact back 122 much high develop country worried trajectory go continue preventedverma well think go continue say price go obamacare state 200 increase many people subsidize create new pool individual afford coverage hear horror story folk pay couple hundred dollar month healthcare coverage affordable care act pay 900 1000 see price go dramatically point people afford coverage see number uninsured go would anticipate change federal level congress need make change go see number uninsured go think president act see executive around short term limited duration plan association plan suppose give least option individual face uninsured cost high cunningham hold hope still congress go act see sort meltdown last year effort effort seem quite unlikely view situationverma always go remain hopeful look damage obamacare many americans see price hike see lack choice hopeful meantime try focus regulatory level make change payment notice come last year give flexibility state regulate market give new tool hope lower price create choice state cunningham ask one last real wonky question practice silver loading believe refer big marketplace rule release april something go continue allow insurer next year audience probably know practice insurer basically mean consumer could get generous subsidy marketplace silver plan rate increase give us insight thatverma yeah continue look think generally affordable care act seem like move make difficult issue underlying structure obamacare work make one move one area try help one group go impact continue look impact silver loading well lot different thing go market cunningham okay final thought kind would like look back sort big accomplishment end leave cms futureverma think problem long list thing think healthcare system move concern direction broad perspective lot exciting technology innovation new treatment therapy want make sure deliver high quality healthcare beneficiary also understand large role play footprint entire industry recently actuary release report talk cost healthcare go 2026 one every 5 something keep night really need something bend cost curve time deliver give people

mckinsey global interesting work area look 800 different job category find estimate 1 20 job go away entirely ai technology develop 60 800 job category see portion job automate ai technology suggest yes worker entirely retrain need support system public investment ensure support system retrain new job category also need would imagine would compressed training regimen worker nature exist job change already see college university many private program offer six week program 10week program technology continue evolve prepare people cut edge give profession creative thing need well cost education go know year college debt forth example offer legislation would allow private investor invest student whether someone want major electrical engineering datum science standard four year curriculum 12week code program private investor could pay student student would pay back private investor complete program study thus shift risk noncompletion onto private investor put debt burden student land job back end sort creative thing think see emerge increasingly adapt new normal education training romm one idea propose idea robot tax right whether bill gates folk california conversation whether tax robot form technology take place job currently hold human one way federal government help pay retrainingcantwell well probably area might disagree grateful colleague work together yeah would take tax bill put big payment retrain would know even repatriation discussion past talk say go retrain think public private sector together company pretty motivated yes think say one big challenge accelerate right would use whatever incentive could go help us productivity wage growth think seattle something like 23 one city america actually see wage growth go make investment let us figure cost effective way public private sector partner together drive would put table instead element tax bill yes would romm senator robot taxyoung would start tax capital investment new form capital investment could also take maria might disagree stimulus package invest heavily worker training think agree bipartisan way worker training essential new hyperdynamic economy go find way adapt new sort training require romm sure minute left want leave touch one last issue bias come artificial intelligence one thing obama administration warn final report artificial intelligence potential prejudice embed code role washington play space force company change hire practice congress herecantwell well need robust discussion need robust discussion one say stem cell research one big complaint right capital formation sba amount capital little go woman minority mean like 4 sba capital ridiculous number think bias therewell peel back find lot different thing woman like small loan amount program gear towards counseling exist gear towards application woman startup whole bunch issue bias yes bias problem want somebody bake bias algorithm go good try figure proper role make sure happen guarantee many bias exist today policy keep mind broad think institute international stand like ieee organization help us discuss standard know electronic area important tool broad discussion empower somebody like taskforce discussion come idea parameter romm sure unfortunately go last word senator cantwell get run go get hook thank young thank much us romm senator young senator cantwell young yeah thank cantwell thank romm discussion thank everybody would like kick drew harwell colleague  humans machines one one microsoft peggy johnson harwell good morning everyone thank join us draw harwell national tech reporter washington post cover ai big datum honored welcome peggy johnson executive vice president business development microsoft company think long time bill gates talk ai research probably 25 year johnson twenty five year yeah harwell want talk little bit peggy oversee investment microsoft venture capital arm invest million ai startup also engineer spend 24 year qualcomm also news different reason also book lobby microsoft call future compute artificial intelligence role society good smart also tell get start would like remind audience tweet question use transformer make good let us begin microsoft think long time ai research development sort affect people livesjohnson right think lot people think ai new trend actually around quite time bill gates 25 year ago start microsoft research sort prediction back say someday computer go able see us hear us talk us understand us quite prescient come point think reason top mind lot trend converge idea cloud computing big datum ai algorithm mix together momentum behind start see real impact harwell really understand us though help us understand hear us voice recognition facial recognition limit mean really sort comprehend like human onejohnson well interesting long time seem hard problem solve voice recognition image recognition last year really accelerate actually cognitive service voice image recognition test better human voice recognition human image recognition slightly well point tool put place number good use real start early impact space harwell great want riff little bit tony talk johnson sure harwell issue bias issue thing get bake system know ai depend datum compute power data biased go issue compute product company side research side think pave issue try make fair equitable ai product possiblejohnson right important think take seriously imagine pool datum data go use train ai algorithm pool datum perfect right particularly start talk social impact social use want make sure data good datum possible want make sure go know go bias datum still want human involve equation instance mention engineer let us say ai algorithm want train find us successful engineering candidate get ready start company need good engineer might say let search back pool datum engineer let try find attribute would make successful engineer might look skill training sort thing one thing datum would show mostly man know grow industry university time woman room practice engineering rely datum would input datum algorithm algorithm would say successful engineer man know case whole number reason know start understand gender gap engineering solely rely datum would introduce bias would amplify bias end say well computer say computer say successful engineer man sort thing take utmost care ensure human involve equation understand well datum might slightly taint harwell find part really fascinating idea could solve problem sort recruitment bias sort thing computer human oversight provide us keep part check sort guideline would put oversight kind human moderator processjohnson right definitely need deploy technology responsibly couple year ago mid2016 ceo satya nadella think introduce set principle say develop technology need ensure protection place thing like fairness safety security transparency accountabilityyou hear senator bring accountability privacy inclusiveness thing thing think train algorithm core empathy ensure train algorithm dignity say know could use algorithm help us find good candidate job maybe accurately diagnose medical ailment maybe even get loan want ensure sort protection place algorithm spit answer take final answer always balance protection harwell yeah empathy product empathy science find really fascinating think ai especially maybe science fiction skynet movie sort thing like feel like important part development even book talk maybe hippocratic oath ai developer engineer would look like engineer think right think human side equationjohnson think carefully begin build ai team want ensure team look like population way introduce bias team full peggy johnsons would good product peggy johnson maybe anybody else room element empathy equation really core ai tool think talk much good know could doomsday device well sort argument end think tool know simplistic form way wrench help unstick bolt kind augment human strength think ai augment human intelligence tool keep center fact attend world economic forum davos happen lot customer think go 60 70 meeting space three day every meeting start ceo whoever side table say ai tell ai need know essentially come back know tool tool help help ability gain insight datum magic fairy dust right sprinkle across business think thing grow think get little grounded lot good deploy responsibly harwell tool human implication see arizona yesterday uber car talk early tony lesson take either uber side general sort self drive ai deployment protect kind sort fatal loss life bad result respond company something like happen johnson right first tragic accident heart go family involve think first foremost uber right thing stop say okay halt need understand happen right thing anytime technology deploy carefully close enough situation know exactly happen immediately stop right thing analogy something similar happen us involve harm human involve empathetic problem essentially introduce chatbot call tay use try understand natural language input could look inside application really kind tool learn something kind fun create persona young think 19 20year old young woman kind hip drive ai algorithm want understand human would interact could ask question use sort normal language like talk right tay would respond put twitter quickly within hour small group people target tay realize tay could learn train racist immediately course catch attention bring immediately know happen exactly say hurt people offensive come back core empathy hurt user hurt employee take take go back kind analyze everything want share story happen next day interesting team work brilliant team scientist deep natural language processing incredible team internally imagine feel demoralize think happen know product work hard satya ceo send email say look first right thing offend people take want know let us use learning moment let us shelve technology technology good could imagine could answer question maybe elderly people homebound give real world answer question sort thing want continue promote say let us reset let us work understand go wrong know back know good thing technology go keep go think important respond quickly respond empathy something happen hopefully ensure get point take thing air quickly possible shelve thing think important tool help us solve thing like eradicate disease find solution poverty climate change want stop kind progress harwell yeah tay interesting example sort early process still see even youtube elevate video suggest kid parkland crisis actor top trending list sort limited use algorithm case small number seemingly small number bad actor able use technology ill way engineer protect kind misuse platform first placejohnson yeah think way assume happen work back pleased start satya set principle around ai future computed go deep conversation build technology lab unleash world responsible really want take proper step ensure technology use good assume way might work back try instill engineer development team come sense empathy might go wrong let work back prohibit way tay relaunche zo also young woman kik platform proper safeguard place incident since teach us train us  understand sort limit technology human get involve keep thing rail harwell right mention good use case ai probably people know much remind morning see picture jeff bezos boston dynamics robot dog johnson oh yeah harwell feel like probably overexposed photograph robot modern era use technology overlook one sort overexposed way think muchjohnson right already several application ai even instance mapping phone underlying application ai think probably really appreciate know whenever walk around new city already many use case would love highlight release app call seeing ai use ai image recognition blind low vision impair people take phone sort give freedom read currency report folk go grocery store find right spice first time great story young woman say able cook dinner night shop open door people previously maybe rely another human augment ai think one small use case lot people important free opportunity able use another one involve recently adaptive biotechnologies look endgame actually able find able develop universal blood test map auto map immune system imagine could use thing like autoimmune disease early detection cancer reason partnership come together expert area study immune mapping human problem lot datum massive massive amount datum rely sort standard algorithm take long come conclusion want universal blood test team help sort datum use ai work underway think important work eventually idea early blood test early blood test early detection cancer try understand autoimmune disease complex think give us insight able see without ai place harwell yeah okay think get time last sort question think go pay attention ai story next year five year look forjohnson well think last story tell think healthcare area think area lot datum area access reason across go see impact healthcare think financial service area think area like climate change massive amount datum need ability sort ai go tool allow us harwell good right well thank everybody join us next would like welcome colleague anna rothschild peggy johnson thank much johnson thank  future work ai automation rothschild good morning anna rothschild air science reporter washington post also host upcoming science show post call anna science magic show hooray science variety show gear kid parent curious people everywhere honored wonderful guest today would like introduce peter schwartz futurist senior vice president strategic planning salesforce mona vernon chief technology officer thomson reuters labs douglas terrier act chief technologist nasa thank would like remind tweet question us use hashtag transformer go make great talk half hour artificial intelligence future work think ask different scientist actually different definition talk talk artificial intelligence would actually like start sort ask talk ai transform work talk maybe even give example work define schwartz well look think fact mention panel senator think really good way morning think unusually well inform thoughtful say say actually beginning artificial intelligence research start career stanford research institute idea top model ai understand brain put chip behave like human brain problem understand brain take us long time get long way go new model artificial intelligence bottom let machine learn rather teach work many many many instance create opportunity use algorithm make sense datum actually perform useful cognitive function mean ai today old model something look like brain put microchip elon wrong way rothschild go ask guy definition least purpose conversation todayvernon think think piece really important bring peggy mention algorithm get well confluence trend like big datum exactly train bottom view like peter say magic bring intelligent datum understand datum bring human expertise validate insight whole conversation bias happen argue folk forget scientific method like way check work put context around agree think algorithm combination human expertise quality content feed algorithm terrier would agree think really think artificial intelligence augment human effort really something replace substitute think certainly world space every field technology volume veracity velocity datum overwhelming human deal see connected smart device field well need machine help us process volume datum real information knowledge decision help aid human decision making think artificial intelligence really augmenting tool rothschild would say big sort misconception artificial intelligence today apply future work think replacement humansschwartz yeah think right look think absolutely right really talk augment intelligence make people capable instance paper yesterday good article warehouse right fedex et cetera put robot alongside worker make productive rather replace think see think one great myth right example truck driver right go eliminate truck driver taxi cab driver replace robot true first need driving truck driving move delivery economy front house every day least dozen truck go half stop house wife profession al retail researcher call  least half stop house say need truck driving truck driver tomorrow actually go behave like guy fly remote piloted vehicle today outside las vegas building number air force pilot go work every morning fly drone afghanistan syria elsewhere truck driver tomorrow like may go garage get truck drive pod pick first truck pick load put freeway head toward phoenix may pick second load thing head toward las vegas drive around city street supplement ai board ai drive freeway drive five truck one fact company las vegas call starsky robotics actually build right think 10 truck think ambitious let us say five truck productivity truck driver go home get sleep spouse night get know kid suck fume day die accident truck driver tomorrow skill set grand theft auto  rothschild mona know maybe different idea sector go impacted think truck driving sort sector go impacted thoughtvernon go focus sector know thomson reuter serve knowledge worker agree douglas augment fact talk give knowledge worker superpower let give concrete example interestingly data privacy news last couple day one challenge datum privacy expert large company deal increasingly complex datum privacy regulation environment proliferation information survey thousand data privacy expert 44 feel might fail comply get increasingly complex develop tool combine human expertise legal expert quality datum feed algorithm come tool give data privacy expert augmentation superpower make sure instance miss information would otherwise look discovery feature power watson combine datum help make sure research give feeling confidence think translate knowledge work knowledge worker go get superpower combination ai train right datum validate expert go exciting thing perhaps less really boring task similar peter talk think definitely go happen already happen knowledge work rothschild new skill set knowledge worker need gain order job really go take away tedious stuffvernon feel rothschild need learn play grand theft auto vernon think really think design user experience could truly understand lawyer work data privacy expert work get tool give superpower need new skill rather go tedious part work really focus really good schwartz look oh sorry rothschild want pause ipad seem miss schwartz right rothschild wonderful thank much sorry go schwartz look think point make think really quite central go job job go change new skill go need central task would really face educational retain task think single important thing really worried whether go good job whether go opportunity people history support look 1950 60 million people work get 160 million people work united states create hundred million job good real question skill retrain think private sector important think people work us responsibility retrain reskille provide tool people able actually job work opportunity 50year old truck driver play grand theft auto able actually able drive new truck terrier think really really important point something way kind talk like happen important realize happen gradually go continue happen think job today probably half job young people go exist go college go true look future yes job change skill set change also myriad job create exist today think lot opportunity think peter point retaining really important need recognize probably big difference way think career today go college get one skill set good career life probably different model go update skill technology continue change say go continuous process rothschild think need actually change like education system order adapt throughout livesschwartz yes mean learn relearn relearn fortunately one interesting technology trend go massive investment call ed tech educational technology enable people learn context work school back home et cetera spend 15 billion investment private sector invest new technology salesforce invest something call trailhead allow customer anyone else learn technology pace think kind investment every company go need make rothschild right terrier think one thing pint lot people think directly involve one sector see benefit right take work nasa invest example last decade artificial intelligence computer think get today gps phone operate drive go visit relative really benefit many way sector economy benefit introduction technology field rothschild actually want ask particular know much nasa technology end repurpose space travel obviously space exploration use ipad kitchen particular project nasa work talk think big impact life next five ten yearsterrier absolutely think important point case time right first miniaturize computer develop apollo era peter work create capability processing augment human capability orbital mechanic computation human could continue push human space one example think really interesting search earth like planet use lot machine learning artificial intelligence process volume datum human look volume datum sort pattern use artificial intelligence algorithm use big datum set try look pattern would surprised learn example use kind processing line set datum look crop around country look reprogram airplane flight path algorithm apply myriad case vernon think add douglas point itf mean still lot job create let us give example company private sector hire lot datum scientist usually really well front end think first use algorithm would argue need industrial process control full life cycle qualify quality datum assumption base check model improve evolve time great set job probably create fundamentally go important industrialize technology deploy widely rothschild company sort prove customer consumer algorithm work equitably fairly mean need talk actually prevent bias datum mean company express people servingschwartz think go think perhaps one difficult issue worried ai take runaway robot real issue reason especially difficult issue algorithm get sophisticated learn become complex frankly difficult unpack make particular recommendation make recommendation get credit house want know challenge unpack algorithm let say think easy think simply open box look inside go tell much fact algorithm one start evolve think bit challenge industry try figure rule algorithmic transparency vernon way manage stay really close innovation lab cut edge technology research example exact topic peter talk study mit ai lab csail think role continuously ask question also work really closely researcher try unpack difficult question terrier think important say consumer little power might think well right human make decision current system choice free market able choose trust trust peter say go difficult complexity algorithm end day confident market force provider provide capability consumer look rise top schwartz remember likely end get good algorithm actually less biased human algorithm racist attitude man woman look fairly objective look issue raise first panel accident happen tempe important remember day happen probably 99 human kill human accident 99 one favor machine terrier yeah super important point think always go concern software glitch know always concerned certainly tragedy human life think assume benefit far outweigh potential danger rothschild well say know bring early say people like elon musk say ai dangerous nukesschwartz yeah well someday maybe right long way understanding brain sufficient give algorithm robot kind autonomy capacity make judgment human really evil thing get lot bad people deal long get bad robot terrier speak bad people think statement interesting statement unpack yes thing dangerous today system place responsible legislator government control thing need kind process go forward artificial intelligence rothschild mona want commentvernon add  rothschild switch gear little bit much culture generally sort forge workplace wonder future ai change job exist actually job think might change society generally schwartz well great example actually recently play michigan steelcase furniture steelcase one big manufacturer office furniture would surprised everybody sit steelcase chair might possible 1990 rise labor cost grow steelcase move lot job make furniture mexico happen recent year bring lot back michigan pair worker robot machine heavy movement hold place human fine work upgrade job make skilled pay well bring back 80 job lose well high quality job tell us many many instance painful difficult physical boring thing actually wear worker bring decade actually go deal machine area human judgment skill refinement capability control require actually teamwork important skill human human empathy ability work people software programming capacity collaboration skill need develop uniquely human vernon agree think couple thing one knowledge worker right lawyer work finance basically way make money use brain go basis competitive augment tool see happen across industry leave behind piece build really useful ai tool fundamentally require rethink think design really excite think topic design useful tool help knowledge worker effective something today robot one adoption tool go become table stake basis competition change workplace knowledge worker second us build tool really able impact bring design think approach go critical aspect get tool adopt rothschild particular thing think foster know kind silly thing say foster think empathy workplace order create people work better ai futureschwartz well look book emotional intelligence number year ago dan goldman think really quite profound shift recognize intelligence also emotional component develop train test actually work workforce make emotionally intelligent therefore much productive think actually tool able make human workforce much capable collaborate human use machine terrier really interesting think far come short period time one thing alan turing 50 propose test ai distinguish machine human right really interesting concept necessarily way think today important think emotional relationship first generation come live work among intelligent machine integral part team think profound implication society way workplace operate situation nasa many year extend human capability artificial intelligence robot mars observatory space much consider machine part team way team interact really interesting watch evolve time think get sophisticated machine build empathy humanlike quality machine help relationship work well rothschild would love know little bit people actually work machine whether ascribe human emotion point terrier tell really interesting story work primarily career human space flight arena launch dynamic event lot emotion control room concern human life opportunity jet propulsion lab land one curiosity rover one rover mars tension hope prayer emotion room palpable connection people machine would invest decade life designing yeah much real relationship schwartz fact mars lander vehicle come one great ai achievement engineering one time great manage pull first time time every one great achievement nasarothschild thing sort complicate though minute start kind ascribe emotion machine get territory think scare people wonder schwartz well use name car know car guy kid right people name car betsy bill stuff like kind relationship machine share probably name washing machine car kind character identify terrier many people hit computer give trouble right computer actually care rothschild fix terrier well actually make us feel well point emotional component actually function machine something need worry machine actually issue need deal vernon add douglas point early think sit change continuous evolution right many us component ai technology product last 25 year happen reason excitement around buzzword today mature get slow evolution ipad power ai power ai five year ago talk big datum cloud necessarily mean continuous opportunity get use powerful tool augment us terrier yeah think really great point think look know simple thing push button say potato microwave machine lot sensing lot decision time hit brake car hundred time per second car measure rotation speed wheel make decision actually control brake machine get used thing peter say outcome well us stop quick safely schwartz pilot yesterday fly fly plane ai fly except 20 minute take landing ai could say autopilot fly plane across country every one us time never think completely agree continuum move toward long time rothschild great minute leave would love talk impact ai sort internationally first curious know think ai sort transform industry develop world next year schwartz well look first think technology increasingly accessible many people use thing exist laboratory many company amazon microsoft google provide tool public able use mean place like africa southeast asia latin america young academic young start actually pick tool invent new way example distribute medicine africa use drone ai get incredibly remote location would able otherwise see wave young entrepreneur actually pick new tool create new kind product service would possible otherwise terrier yeah really great point think even nasa example one thing outpost put human try put human way mars need put lot intelligence normally would reside control room earth need make available whether doctor medicine technical information artificial intelligence system light time technology available remote medicine austere area people separate great distance enable access technology think many way technology general great equalizer internationally particularly underdeveloped country traditional industrial infrastructure leapfrog jump right arena vernon agree think way think umbrella ai maturity set digital technology really help emerge market leapfrog talk mobile social lot datum connect people proliferation datum ai component bring together really create digital first solution truly innovative across many many sector schwartz look learn develop world like us even important part world actually see opportunity develop new lean technology universally distribute make really remarkable opportunity wikipedia great antipoverty tool ever create kid planet device like world knowledge available think era enable ai enable education learning productivity planet rothschild think help connect kid ipad maybe someplace africa terrier absolutely schwartz absolutely think terrier think already social network borderless right think peter point really important great equalizer kid anywhere access world information remarkable remarkable tool step forward rothschild great well end time want thank much great discussion go take quick break next part program begin momentarily thank much  content softwareorg bsa foundation sponsor segment maximize benefit ai haddad good morning hi everyone tammy haddad victoria espinel put phone guru let us hear victoria  okay somebody leave hint question suppose ask right leave thank much us hear many amazing thing put hone back go want write everything say victoria nation first chief intellectual property enforcement office coordinatorespinel coordinator haddad coordinator officer obama administration run bsa software alliance talk world leader talk great scientist great company go privilege ask first talk artificial intelligence obviously back talk happen itespinel great thank tammy thank everyone today artificial intelligence essence build datum lot lot datum much datum human process although process lot datum tammy datum human process people talk artificial intelligence talk build train correctly lot talk mean make sure information datum use build create train artificial intelligence good possibly make sure accurate complete bebecause datum use train artificial intelligence incomplete way output go skew people talk bias artificial intelligence really talk try make sure information datum use train artificial intelligence good possibly different thing opinion need happen order make sure happen really bias eliminate bias artificial intelligence try make sure datum go good possibly haddad people code mean code ethic itespinel yet code ethic something lot company include softwareorg company talk think thing part people part make sure datum scientist inside company train well possibly haddad train themespinel big part think probably big issue try make sure information good mind least two different component one try much information possible part example try get government share information company use order make sure build good possible another part try make sure train ai diversity background experience something feel strongly software disrupt world artificial intelligence disrupt world develop create build train whatever word want use people table wide range experience perspective order good possibly something need work haddad question work already know stem program variety get diversity really talk diversity opinion experience get program know right agree need diversity agree okay mean talk take entire industry company government everyone around world together try design make decision right add advanceespinel think like anything complicated go single answer idea one think really important government would include united states government rethink educational system make sure young age child expose coding computer science early possible help get girl coding part issue also think help ensure promise economic opportunity come spread across united states dream would young person regardless live united states feasible future go area want reality today part focus gender part think much focus make sure anywhere sit united states opportunity lot work think government big role play term educational curriculum know industry tech industry software industry already lot term program support great continue even also think good society kind tech industry alone think need tech industry government try work together haddad well funny one issue large picture culture today people look company work whether ge armour name help advance give job opportunity success go call daddy ceo situation actually double ai rightespinel right divert moment think one thing really important software industry talk train people new job necessarily talk train get job software company mean happen talk train people get job use tech skill digital skill either company company want join regardless sector every sector use software today training give people help get job across industry sector haddad well want go back economic opportunity application get diverse workforce get buy implement company across worldespinel company right hungry people skill think issue need figure though employer demand people eager get skill yet hopefully something software tech help great matching employer need people people skill want job make sure come togetherand part also think whether think software really helpful spread job opportunity across united states one thing software let us work anywhere really exploit yet opportunity could bring worker try get access job either tech company type company wherever word bring job people rather make people go job haddad gift aiespinel think gift software generally think artificial intelligence one area one benefit artificial intelligence could bring haddad program see right look company government maybe obama administration look bias closely try come solutionsespinel yes definitely people look company work look intensely heres know much time another element want talk haddad two minute espinel talk lot continue talk train artificial intelligence make sure unbiased something absolutely happen haddad thatespinel part make sure information go complete accurate reflect diversity experience create artificial intelligence think also need think talk hear lot discussion okay create use way eliminate bias use artificial intelligence way broaden inclusionso go give one example think really tremendous example many hard pick upset limit one give one company use artificial intelligence help people autism good recognize facial cue able use artificial intelligence interact get correct interpretation emotion person speak happen way seamless transform people autism asperger ability interact world one thing open career opportunity exist today even daily life interaction friend family relationship change life way fundamental one example way artificial intelligence could use broaden inclusion haddad pretty exciting well thing totally change workforce rightespinel completely change workforce haddad bring intelligent people another part society right middle thing espinel one examplehaddad one minute go come another minute espinel right one example really quickly even directly relate workforce company right use artificial intelligence rethink hire strategy include advertise job make sure way seek employee sort hidden bias may entirely unaware way advertise job way seek employee bias skew attractive appealing certain type people use artificial intelligence right look hire practice try ferret hide bias might think another area really exciting thing nascent know either start deploy even deploy yet think tip iceberg term application artificial intelligence reduce bias fundamental need build way unbiased need use way reduce bias haddad thank much victoria espinel terrific job  go hand back washington post thank much use ai responsibly one one ibm dario gil harwell happy introduce time dario gil vice president ai ibm company everybody hear go discuss artificial intelligence responsibility ask use twitter tweet question us use hashtag transformer movie let us get feel like would good time figure ai solve problem probably get reality check status technology go look couple year gil yeah think right tend oscillate enormous level enthusiasm ambition sometimes think ahead much right let us put little bit context aithanks actually fruit many decade progress would say forum narrow form artificial intelligence begin work mean specific task objection like let us say classify may picture able good narrow form speech recognition get technology good enough narrow form aibookend sort like utopian dystopian discussion people refer artificial general intelligence account many many decade away speak form intelligence kind human intelligence solve problem across arbitrary task domain keep learn high degree autonomy action bookend enter new phase refer broad ai go narrow segmented capability today powerful narrow ability solve task meaning give example learn perform task easy perform adjacent task something close every time learn new task start scratch build new ai systemi think able broad broad task partner well people complement expertise make transparent realm broad ai enter harwell even narrow ai right question responsibility develop take responsibility ethic guideline establish create responsibility engineer regulator street consumer sort vote pocketbook debate happeninggil well think need happen multi stakeholder process root ai purpose try solve could discussion raw technology context ai healthcare need able operate within constraint healthcare profession also good reason many stakeholder stakeholder physician regulator part ai need fit context responsibility come across stakeholder creator take responsibility algorithm datum train system lot implication outcome system think enter phase sort like narrow discussion neural network show example good job classify particular task healthcare area get lot headline need move towards responsible use ai profession within specific industry context think get go

replace human intelligence purpose one second one trust basically position okay whose data come train take also position institution provide datum owner datum case individual datum therefore want use adjacent purpose claim provide accountability algorithm develop train itand third dimension skill also invest technology complimentary skill professional individual use harwell right let us dig healthcare little bit find industry especially fascinating touch everybody life yet know still talk move paper digital record sort question data privacy really important hipaa guideline even get doctor buy kind system sit ai healthcare opportunity especially kind peril move quickly thatgil extraordinarily early day think allude fact prior technology advance also know see implication healthcare adopt also see sometimes pace adoption take long long time reality today think undoubtedly know speak research side responsibility lot evidence ai lot profound implication practice medicine implication area discovery life science look sheer amount genomic information available actually go make sense connect disease progression important important implication know area example like radiology oncology value base care make progress get deliver evidence able put system validate scientifically rigorously demonstration result publish result see increase adoption like practice science general right shortcut heavy lifting work prove technology affective solve problem provide value add institution individual physician adoption also element trust physician practitioner believe good interest let us say case patient also consideration financial professional interest hard get adopt barrier overcome doubt big consensus community profound positive impact well harwell want talk tension adoption marketing marketing ai high almost sometimes overlap actual product know ibm watson sort pitched kind revolutionary cancer care solution last year partnership cancel md anderson cancer center big investment ibm point 60 million question whether technology overpromise underdelivere doctor patient help understand think tension point like question effective product help us understand ibm thinking move forward gil yeah time one introduce technology go broad impact world indeed always tension communicate sort broad impact technology society get everybody stakeholder think mean go go think would question fact ai ask today right lead technology player technology player company would rate different technology level sort impact world bet us would rate ai number one position today look today say well impact go across different profession include healthcare think healthcare professional technology company would say also go extraordinary impact question progression right ask honest answer early day early day require pioneer experiment thing try thing demonstrate work course make progress way shortcut chat self drive car well impact go go difficulty yes believe time difficulty overcome answer yes today right know thriving successful business apply ai health ten thousand patient impact benefit partner artificial intelligence case watson solution health practitioner think sort like judge level progress specific project lot convoluted fact take place actual progress make field narrow form ai allude undoubtedly even current capability understand document limited able process image able segment new classification would say life science enormous value create recognize reason healthcare one say mean think bring panel think community speak likelihood big impact likely see ai industry kind everybody say healthcare important lot implication reality pioneer successful business grow harwell riff appreciate point feel like company overpromise sometimes mean feel like problem lot companies gil sure would say general statement ai right extraordinary level hype long run think ai transformative effect society know happen sort see discussion today broadly like say ai new mean project use ascribe information technology analytic automation lump aiso take like narrow definition ai go say well within ai subfield call neural network within technique like deep learning ask category people say ai solve even take narrow form say well use employ solution say neural network example deep learning bet would filter claim make 98 right people claim ai much narrow happen word ai become substitution lot field right lump excitement result tension speak scientific know researcher say well actual rate progress ai popularly talk ai lump sort thing difficult tension rightwell one hand public experience seem like ai everywhere seem ai touch everything lead lot excitement go detail say actual state art ai recognize fact even though amazing progress make still narrow capability mission advance capability keep desire apply harwell late last year make joyful march capitol hill talk senate committee commerce ai regulation say regulatory issue stand way ai important technology industry world today see industry police last couple year see issue come feel like barrier erect line draw create regulation could prevent problem
