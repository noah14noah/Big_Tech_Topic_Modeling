week surely possible even probable federal reserve like government agency get trumpified one american policy last remaining competence expertise soon share general degradation professor krugman back us hold back opinion example trumpified fed pick versus one showcase fed competence expertisekrugman well clear dichotomy right perfectly fine fed chair could reappointe janet yellen probably every indicator stellar job keep hand bet  kind prediction market think likely pick kevin warsh former fed governor lot thing say  one thing track record past decade quite consistent wrong everything fu economic forecast krugman economic forecast worry inflation world slide depression worry terrible thing think fiscal policy go know go turn greece amazing kind almost awesome almost make money take whatever think go happen bet way politically correct republican point view family connection trump would know might still appoint although apparently stock decline little bit weisenthal much weigh concern would see bad pick obviously sound like think kevin warsh would good pick krugman right weisenthal bad pick versus pick perceive trump beck call trump call twitter rate hike stuff like would concern morekrugman well boy mean way think go together think really separate somebody actually good respect within fed respect institution fed person also go particularly pressurable white house somebody real reason except fact trump decide like although go would kind person would worry politicize chatterley see turn many occasion donald trump think chance criticism janet yellen make perhaps would speak people may know monetary policy actually learn subsequently perhaps realize continuity fed might bad thing actually reappoint janet yellen endkrugman well hope mean would good outcome think give happen right chatterley think krugman know turn tend follow turn every time think reach reasonable agreement something find way go back worry even chatterley even weisenthal speak janet yellen speak get away question next fed chair go one notable thing go economy persistent failure fed economy overall get 2 percent inflation hit inflation goal  light see last several year thing try change evolve thinking fed hit inflation learn fed inflation watch persistent short fallkrugman ok two different thing one monetary policy much traction interest rate low still remain true even though fed normalize little bit still kind regime weisenthal right krugman fed attention fed yet fed much less power would use think normal time thing something go inflation process look know whether natural rate unemployment thing exist weigh phillips curve get flat downward nominal wage rigidity something something clearly underlie model use try predict inflation never good look completely useless  weisenthal favorite theory explanation something iskrugman think mix still pen wage cut want happen sort still overhang past think nervousness think people great recession long slow recovery reluctant grant demand wage increase might end lock next slump fu mean federal reserve think approach target 2 percent inflation give targetkrugman oh contrary mean everything see say 2 percent inflation anything low give see hard get inflation low give secularist stagnation guy really need opportunity significantly negative real interest rate fed target 2 percent fu 3 percentkrugman well would mean would old enough old guy remember 4 percent remember reagan second term 4 percent inflation bad give lot room monetary policy would go long way politically acceptable means say trouble get 2 percent
