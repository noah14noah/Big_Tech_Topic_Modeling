secteur comme mtn visa pesa il ete facile de constituer cette alliance une start comme la notre est toujours accueillie avec beaucoup de questionnements de la part des acteur deja present sur le marche le defi le plus important que nous avion etait de leur prouver notre capacite leur apporter de la valeur nous devion aussi prouver quun agregateur comme le notre vient renforcer lecosysteme des services digitaux et financier cela passe par la mise en place dune plateforme fiable un respect de la compliance des agent de distribution une qualite de service au moins egale celle fournie par les

sein de chaque pay cela demande beaucoup dechanges avec les regulateur pour eviter de nous deployer dans un cadre non maitrise ces etude que nous menon dans ces pay ont certainement une incidence dan la duree du deploiement mais sont indispensable pour developper une activite durable dan un pay donne nous ne penson pas que la zleca ira jusquau niveau de la regulation des fintechs mais le cadre harmonise qui sera mis en place devrait certainement faciliter les echange entre les different pay le developpement de nos activite en afrique nest pas toujours simple du fait de la gestion difficile des flux financier entre des pays de zones monetaire differente nous esperon que la zleca va considerablement faciliter cela lire aussi lire aussi le dernier rapport partech sur les levee de fond en afrique montre une forte polarisation geographique des investissements concentre sur quelques pay anglophones et l comment expliquez vous cela et comment une entreprise comme la votre est elle parvenue sortir son epingle du jeu effectivement selon ce rapport plus de 85 des investissement dan les start sont aujourdhui concentre dan quatre pay en afrique  cela est certainement du plusieur facteur certe voit une difference de culture entrepreneuriale importante entre les zones anglophones et francophones mais ce nest pas la seule explication il dabord mon sen une question de taille de

stabilite politique et du cadre de vie attrayant le senegal est devenu un excellent laboratoire pour les entreprise qui souhaitent explorer lafrique subsaharienne francophone un ecosysteme favorable au lancement de start sest construit cependant le senegal peine encore faire emerger de grands champion et nous devron encore oeuvrer mieux structurer lecosysteme dans ce sen meme si nous somme tre
