KIS 2019 – Status und Ausblick,,2019-02-13T00:00:00Z,U.S. Federal; International,,News,1461,arno laxy munchenvor etwa einem jahr hat deloitte eine gross angelegte studie zum status der kis deutschland durchgefuhrt ein wesentliche ergebnis war dass aktuelle systeme die moglichkeiten die die digitalisierung eroffnet nicht ausnutzen ein gesprach mit florian benthin senior manager consulting bereich bei deloitte uber den aktuellen status mampk haben die hersteller seit dem ergebnis der letzten studie konsequenzen gezogen und ihre losungen verbessertflorian benthin die resonanz auf die studie war grossartig viele anwender sind auf uns zugekommen und haben unsere ergebnisse bestatigt wenn man sich allerding die diesjahrigen portfolio updates auf basis der verfugbaren informationen anschaut zeigt sich dass der kis markt recht trage ist und doch hat sich etwa den letzten ein bis zwei jahren geandert neue hersteller mit ausland etablierten produkten betreten den deutschen markt und erzeugen veranderungsdruck wir vermuten dass dieser druck wachst und ggf weitere marktteilnehmer hinzukomman und die hiesigen player reagieren mussen allerding sind die potentiale immer noch sehr gross egal ob etablierter hersteller oder neuer marktteilnehmer beispielsweise bietet kaum ein kis system die native integration von daten von wearables von patienten welche schritte empfehlen sie den herstellern damit sie die noch immer ungelosten aufgaben realistisch und mit einem moglichst rasch spurbaren patientennutzen angehen konnenbenthin zugegeben eine veranderung herbeizufuhren ist nicht kurzfristig machbar dazu sind die systeme zu komplex und historisch gewachsen insgesamt sind aber drei aspekte besonder wichtig ersten sollten hersteller prufen ob die jeweiligen software architekturen und basis technologien noch state art sind haufig basieren kis software systeme auf alten programm codes und module werden immer nur per interne schnittstellen angebunden kis hersteller kaufen immer wieder firmen mit softwareprodukten fur spezifische aufgaben hinzu und integrieren diese produkte nicht richtig die eigene software suite die kis software suite wirkt dann da meist keine einheitliche struktur wie ein flicken teppich mit sehr alten und neuen flicken zweiten sollten hersteller sich starker patienten orientieren viele heutige kis systeme sind aus der administrativen perspektive eine krankenhauses entstanden h es wurden software losungen erschaffen die die abrechnung effektiv erledigen und die gesetzlichen anforderungen erfullen dabei stand jedoch nie der patient vordergrund das muss sich andern beim entwickeln neuer losungen sollte man auch unterstutzende multidisziplinare methoden wie z b design think oder agile software entwicklung nutzen bisher werden diese von vielen herstellern gesundheitswesen noch gar nicht oder nur sehr unzureichend angewandt schliesslich sollten sich einige kis hersteller auch von anderen industrien inspirieren lassen selbst wenn der deutsche gesundheitsmarkt komplex und hochgradig reguliert ist beispielsweise sind bereich der medizintechnik die innovationszyklen kurzer obwohl hi die produkte und deren produktion technisch hochkomplex sind und regularien ebenfall die freiheiten des markte einschranken durch einen globalen wettbewerb werden produkte immer anwenderorientierter wie sieht es bei mobilen anwendungen aus inwieweit ist das kis auf mobilen endgeraten herstellerneutral anwendbar und wie schatzen sie die marktdurchdringung dieser mobilen variante einbenthin jeder hersteller mochte naturlich seine software verkaufen und konzentriert sich bei der mobilen app nur auf die eigene software der anwender hat aber wenig davon wenn sich die app eine kis herstellers nicht das ris pacs des krankenhauses einbinden lasst da dieses ggf nicht vom gleichen hersteller ist letztlich der anwender eine einzige app und nicht funf oder zehn verschiedene mit unterschiedlichem bedienkonzept und design hi ist mehr integration gefragt und letztlich auch interoperabilitat daran hapert es haufig zwischen kis software produkten und unterschiedlichen systemen und auch der kommunikation mit patienten daten zudem haben viele kliniken nur eine ungenugende wlan abdeckung gerade grossen klinik komplexen reicht die verbindung uber mobile internet uber umts lte nicht au hi wird der investitionsstau vieler krankenhauser ersichtlich der immer wieder verschiedenen studien wie dem krankenhaus rating report verdeutlich wird hat sich denn bei der integration von echtzeitdaten etwa bewegt vor einem jahr war ein ganz wesentlicher kritikpunkt dass nur zehn prozent der befragten der meinung waren dass das eingesetzte kis die optimale okonomische steuerung des krankenhauses gut unterstutzt benthin der regel konnen das die kis produkte immer noch nicht letztlich sieht die heutige software architektur vieler kis produkte das auch nicht vor h business warehouse module sind haufig separat weil dazugekauft oder spater entwickelt und somit nicht oder schlecht integriert hi sind hersteller mit produkten auf neuer basis besser aufgestellt patienten erwarten heutzutage digitalisierte angebote seien sie personalisiert smartphone apps oder als online service verfugbar letzte jahr hatten aber 60 der befragten angegeben dass sie keine elektronische unterstutzung wahrend ihrer zeit krankenhaus hatten ist hi eine verbesserung festzustellen und fall nicht muss jetzt geschehen dass sich daran etwa andertbenthin wir sprechen mit einigen kliniken die eine digital strategie aufbauen gerade die kunden denen innovation wichtig ist mochten dienste wie apple health nutzen wenn sie deutschland verfugbar sind und fragen zum thema datenschutz und sicherheit geklart sind immerhin geht es kleinen schritten voran krankenkassen bauen erstmalig portale fur die versicherten auf auf diesen ersten schritt mussen aber weitere folgen es reicht nicht informationen nur digital zur verfugung zu stellen die patienten wollen auch sinnvolle und sichere mehrwertdienste das konnte die anbindung das krankenhaus und die elektronische ubermittlung von daten sein oder die analyse ausgewahlter daten mit neuester forschung hi konnten neue player wie big tech firmen zukunftig eine grosse rolle spielen die bisher nicht gesundheitsmarkt bzw kis markt aufgetreten sind deren losungen konnten den patienten tatsachlich zum herren seiner daten machen und damit den mittelpunkt stellen auch die wirtschaftliche steuerung und das risikomanagement durch kis wy laut ihrer studie letzte jahr schwachen auf die moglichkeiten dazu wurden nur als mittelmassig betrachtet hat sich hier etwa verandertbenthin ahnlich wie bei der integration der echtzeitdaten hat sich wenig verandert hi spielt allerding auch noch ein anderer punkt eine grosse rolle denn die anspruche und anforderungen haben sich geandert fruher wurde ein krankenhaus mit anderen kpis gesteuert als es heute notwendig ist neben den ublichen parametern wie betten auslastung und case mix punkte spielen heute prozesskosten eine grosse rolle dazu sind zudem komplexe kostentragerrechnungen notwendig um patienten und fallgenau sagen zu konnen die einzelnen elemente einer behandlung tatsachlich kosten das lasst sich zwar alles digital abbilden aber kaum nativ einer kis software welche trends sehen sie generell diesem markt mus passieren damit die digitalisierung gesundheitswesen und speziell den kliniken nicht langer mit angezogener handbremse erfolgtbenthin vielen kliniken fehlt es finanzierungskraft und wenn diese doch vorhanden ist dann werden nur lokale oder ggf regionale losungen geschafften makrookonomisch gibt es aber mehrere szenarien wie die digitalisierung forciert werden kann zum einen sind das regulatorische moglichkeiten die bundesregierung sollte sich verstarkt gedanken zu einem ehealth gesetz 20 machen und gerade bereich der forderungen viel starker aktiv sein letztlich hat man den usa meaningful use program gesehen dass investitions und forderprogramme signifikant zur digitalisierung beitragen konnen ein andere szenario ist von den patienten bzw kunden getrieben wenn digitale angebote mehrwerte schaffen und der business case stimmt werden sich solche losungen schnell durchsetzen die dann ebenfall die digitalisierung forcieren zur personflorian benthin ist seit ca drei jahren bei deloitte tatig sein arbeitsschwerpunkt ist die technologie beratung life science und healthcare bereich bevor er zu deloitte kam war benthin management fur verschiedene organisationen

"""Klein-Klein"" hilft nicht weiter;Gegen neue Wettbewerber sollten sich etablierte Versicherer auf ihre eigenen Stärken besinnen","Robert Meitz, Senior Manager bei Berg Lund & Company",2019-07-05T00:00:00Z,International,,News,1296,borsen zeitung 572019mit insurtechs und big techs werden die karten der versicherungsbranche neu gemischt nur wenn etablierte versicherer diese veranderung al chance begreifen konnen sie als gewinner aus diesem umbruch hervorgehen eine bewusste fokussierung des geschaftsmodells ist notwendig mit dem einstieg von insurtechs den versicherungsmarkt prophezeiten einige bereit das ende der etablierten versicherer statt konfrontation setzten sich jedoch uberwiegend kooperationen durch beim b2c onlinemakler knip 2015 noch als star und erklarter gegner der klassischen versicherer gefeiert war nach zwei jahren die party schon wieder vorbei gegensatz dazu hat der onlinemakler wefox das potenzial von kooperationen fruh erkannt seine plattformlosung stellt er auch anderen maklern zur verfugung anfang 2019 konnte das insurtech eine finanzierungsrunde mit der rekordsumme von 110 mill euro abschliessen weltweit steigen die investitionen insurtechs weiter allein von 2017 auf 2018 gab es laut fintech global eine verdoppelung auf weltweit 318 mrd dollar mit big techs wie google amazon und alibaba rollt nun die zweite welle neuen wettbewerbern auf die versicherungsbranche zu sie haben bereit gezielte schritte das versicherungsgewerbe unternomman mitamazon protect bietet der internet riese etwa beim kauf von elektronischen artikeln eine sachversicherung die regulatorik uberlasst amazon heute noch dem kooperationspartner london general insurance company gemeinsam mitjp morgan und der beteiligungsfirma berkshire hathaway von star investor warren buffett geht amazon noch einen schritt weiter zusammen wurde die krankenversicherung gegrundet diese richtet sich zwar vorerst nur die eigenen mitarbeiter jedoch hat die nachricht die ganze branche aufschrecken lassen wo insurtechs mit geringem bekanntheitsgrad begrenztem kapital und fehlender kundenbasis noch zu kampfen hatten punktet big tech gerade dort angesicht diese wettbewerbs und eine veranderten marktes mussen etablierte versicherer ihre rolle neu definieren hohere markttransparenz einfache wechselservices neue innovative angebote und ein veranderte kundenverhalten lassen die wechselhurden brockeln stagnation ist keine option einem dynamischen umfeld allen bereichen mit der entwicklung schritt zu halten scheitert regelmassig oder um friedrich den grossen zu bemuhen wer alle defendieren der defendieret gar nicht eigene ressourcen mussen priorisiert und fokussiert eingesetzt werden vielen unternehmen wird der strategieprozess stiefmutterlich behandelt das funktioniert nur solange das umfeld stabil ist und die organisation lang einstudierte optimierungsmechanismen selbstandig durchfuhren kann grundsatzliche fragen werden selten geklart ein ungeschonter blick nach innen sollte ein umfassende starken und schwachen profil hervorbringen zudem ist eine gemeinsame hypothese zum markt der zukunft eine wichtige gesprachsbasis mogliche geschaftsmodelle konnen drei stossrichtungen unterschieden werden vertrieb produktgeber und provider schulterschluss zahltder personliche vertrieb ist nach wie vor gross vertrauens und verkaufstreiber der trend weist jedoch richtung digitalisierung eine erfolgreiche strategie muss den schulterschluss schaffen der personliche vertrieb ist mit abstand der wichtigste vertriebskanal und sollte auch weiterhin teil der zukunftsstrategie sein bei der schaden und unfallversicherung war allein der ausschliesslichkeitsvertrieb laut gesamtverband der deutschen versicherungswirtschaft 2017 fur knapp die halfte aller abschlusse verantwortlich uber den online kanal kam rund ein funftel der neukunden bei der kranken und lebensversicherung spielt der online kanal dagegen noch kaum eine rolle mit blick auf die gesamte customer journey tauscht die scheinbar geringe relevanz vom erstinteresse bi zum abschlus wechselt der kunde regelmassig zwischen den kanalen zur informationsbeschaffung ist der online tarifrechner oft fester bestandteil die verschiedenen kanale mussen deshalb nahtlos ineinander ubergehen auf ein online berechnete angebot sollte etwa das call center bei ruckfragen des kunden zugriff haben des weiteren ist auch der personliche vertrieb selbst etwa uber kontaktmoglichkeiten via whatsapp oder video chat 21 jahrhundert zu fuhren der direktvertrieb wird sowohl fur anbahnung als auch fur den abschluss immer wichtiger erfolg reiche direktanbieter haben derzeit bereit erweiterte kommunikationskanale eingefuhrt etwa call center videotelefonie und chat ferner kann auch die verwendung neuer technologien das kundenerlebnis stark vereinfachen ein einfache foto des fahrzeugscheins kann ausgelesen und intelligent interpretiert werden und ersetzt die eingabe von daten den online rechner okosysteme werden eine zentrale rolle vertrieb spielen um nicht nur white label produktgeber zu sein mussen versicherer okosysteme selbst aufbauen und orchestrieren allerding mus der kunde uber taglich relevante services gebunden werden das versicherungsprodukt sich eignet sich wenig service rund um pravention bieten sich bei krankenversicherern uber life style apps konnen kunden diesem bereich spielerisch zu einer gesunderen lebensweise motiviert und dafur mit einem geldwerten vorteil belohnt werden wohin geht die reisemit der steigenden relevanz von okosystemen wird auch der raum fur geschaftsmodelle als produktgeber grosser der versicherer schafft sich dadurch zugang zu neuen kunden allein amazon hat laut statista rund 44 millionen regelmassige kunden deutschland um sich auf diesem markt durchsetzen zu konnen ist eine spezialisierung auf die klassischen kernbereiche wie risikomanagement schadenabwicklung und produktentwicklung eine zentrale voraussetzung besonder wichtig sind sowohl die einfache und nahtlose integration des produktes die fremde vertriebsoberflache als auch ein hoher automatisierungsgrad wo hier die reise hingeht zeigt der chinesische versicherer ping bei der schadenabwicklung von autounfallen wird mithilfe von bilderkennung und kunstlicher intelligenz  der schaden laut eigenen angaben mit einer genauigkeit von 955 erfasst grosser digitalisierungsbedarfder bedarf digitalisierung und neuen technologien bei den etablierten versicherern ist gross um der kundenschnittstelle oder als produktgeber schritt zu halten bei der entwicklung stosst die eigene organisation schnell ihre grenzen statt losungen selbst zu entwickeln ist es oft ratsamer diese von dritten einzukaufen viele insurtechs erkennen diese potenzial und stellen etablierten branchenvertretern white label losungen zur verfugung bei denen technische innovationen eine start die eigenen systeme unter eigener marke integriert werden gleiche gilt fur etablierte versicherer die dem markt eigene losungen bereitstellen konnen oft wird das eigene know dieser beziehung unterschatzt die bearbeitung von schadenprozessen konnte beispielsweise auch fur andere versicherer oder insurtechs relevant sein zum einen ware es eine neue ertragsquelle und zum anderen wurde es leichter fall grossere investitionen die automatisierung zu rechtfertigen mit den neuen wettbewerbern wird eine breite vielfalt digitaler neuerungen den markt gespult um erfolgreich zu bestehen reichen keine massnahmen klein klein eine grundsatzdiskussion zur ausrichtung des geschaftsmodells muss stattfinden sind die kernkompetenzen und die stossrichtung klar fallt es leichter die eigenen ressourcen zu
