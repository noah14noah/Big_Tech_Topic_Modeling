95 range joel marcus part drive jay get two significant roll maryland market come second quarter one tenant exit another tenant still unsure get one roll south san francisco work number roll figure dean give guidance kind flow early year late year pretty confident outside maryland market able either lease backfill space pretty successfully certainly past year dean shigenaga yes think last call comment last quarter also highlight boston temporary time space roll lease subject lease today deliver september believe 25000 square foot jay habermann okay maybe follow term outlook capex talk tenant improvement leasing cost year clearly rate 2011 increase versus 2010 help put perspective guess fourth quarter run rate dean shigenaga yes think look think refer generally speak page 23 supplemental highlight leasing activity year renewal average 6 foot ti leasing commission close 13 previously vacant space whether inclusive redevelopment development would generally expect dollar remain range think 10k give pretty good summary capex ti leasing cost relate renewal release space generally 5year average stay within fairly narrow fairly small bandwidth expect 2012 meaningfully different historical average jay habermann okay maybe dig bit deep 499 illinois mention activity guess tech tenant expect something could announce first half year guess tenant look full space portion spacejoel marcus answer first question would hope know sure initial tenant would three floor tenant potentially follow would take rest building potentially look two tenant operator james feldman banc america james feldman analyst bofamerrill lynch hope could talk little bit see recently term tech demand versus life sciences demand guy think main market maybe tip portfolio exposure towards tech give demand prospect sector guy kind think internally joel marcus yes actually pretty great question think life science niche focus reit obviously try change think significant project number market example binney street development look look right outside lab 1 million square foot today demand tech us look run return hurdle might lease tech user 11 million square foot demand real look might work rental rate would obviously somewhat low lab rate tenant improvement allowance infrastructure allowance would considerably less versus lab tenant think look case case basis real desire change tenant base portfolio think look 499 illinois mindful salesforce take 21 million square foot create new hot bed tech tenant interest south market pretty much fire know certainly call sure pay attention goal obviously high quality tenant strong cash flow place give point time get tenant make sense likely consider oppose hold right lab tenant think see big fundamental strategic shift really building build basis tech bubble sort sure facebook ipo come market even poignant remember many year ago internet boom see remember  report think something like rate go 1 2 maybe high 10 12 foot year two later collapse mindful pretty market take advantage selectively good way know james feldman last point understanding big difference get company cash flowing really believe get close bubble term fundamental economic leasesjoel marcus well think valuation standpoint kind believe talk morning look facebook may 100 time earning probably compare google company apple forth stellar operating history seem strike little bit unusual kind fervor unknown think view tech intersection tech pharma bio important core knowledge market think remain market take advantage sector best focused diversify tech sector major strategic change james feldman think active tech market material delta yield base tech rent kind buildout would need versus biotech life sciencesjoel marcus yes think pretty fair say mission bay cambridge number pencil pretty favorably really face seattle san diego maryland new york research triangle park would say bay area cambridge compelling opportunity remember google first campus redevelopment sale leaseback scios nova ultimately get buy buy campus google come pay us back 1997 1998 kind obscene amount want campus mountain view first foothold end gutte infrastructure turn great deal us opportunistic play card good focused create tech sector portfolio james feldman okay thank dean curious notice increase straight line rent assumption 2012 guidance ffo outlook flat prior guidance curious apologize already say dean shigenaga jamie think pick change 6 million 65 million really round anything nothing really drive difference significantly operator philip martin morningstar philip martin analyst morningstar want talk little bit leasing term meaningful change lease term give appear still rather challenging environment see meaningful changesjoel marcus well think strike number build suit redevelopment work think see substantially long lease term able achieve 10 15 even 20 year big well capitalize entity whether big biotech obviously pharma institutional think meat potato lease run small medium still three five seven year substantially change base size space base size entity philip martin give negotiating leverage still less challenge timesjoel marcus well would say talk 2006 2007 would say think today tough think occasionally landlord market willing thing normally would consider rational mindful would say although spectacular quarter really year leasing standpoint never easy always challenging think board entity whether big pharma big biotech institutional board small company board mindful still tough macro environment people make dumb decision think careful competitive focus occasion decide tenant want certain opportunity want certain situation feel worth underwriting tenant happen recently justify economic tenant want pass deal philip martin okay joel marcus would say tough today 2007 sure philip martin yes mean dovetail bit capex question capex go bit know tenant two dotcom era et cetera look trend generally joel marcus yes hard know lot big tenant tend want put capital vary actually truly vary lease lease philip martin lastly confidence among tenant change even last six month incremental discussion tenant redevelopment expansion opportunity obviously say opening remark sound like almost high grade problem internal growth opportunity almost handle joel marcus right think difference philip know sector well let break group pharma area specific requirement specific requirement like pfizer come groton pearl river look 250000 square foot specific requirement see specific requirement pharma generally move group start group cluster location dynamic biotech sector clinical milestone regulatory approval make obviously need take whether additional space shift may become milestone drive see small company really milestone drive begin grow funding tie milestone whether private side public side see develop base milestone relate situation think fundamentally change institutional side usually specific requirement fund whether bond fund particular gift deal sign new york happen endow endowment make long term requirement get generate able secure think thing fundamentally change much maybe pharma situation change past couple year anything else philip martin university certainly economy cause lot group rethink strategy alexandria approach university help manage growth platform biotech life sciences something

hedge place eventually roll part bond issuance elongate maturity schedule fix spend 900 million capital would need raise form equity thatdean shigenaga actually maybe clarify little bit likely happen bond perspective specific use retire 2012 term loan bond event occur maturity date bank term loan 250 million would likely concurrently retire 250 million term loan part legal structuring transaction need think bank agreement provision modify release borrower always contemplate one key chunk bank debt would retire 2012 term loan part answer question michael yes proceed use retire bank debt minimum 250 million term loan remainder obviously depend size transaction much incremental capital ultimately go work retire bank debt replace long term fix rate debt several year think difficult us much
