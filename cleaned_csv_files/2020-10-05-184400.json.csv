world excess 10 year old mostly compress air pump hydro need really geographically bless order implement see scant investment technology much energy storage system go include base battery base lithium ion battery part reason volumetric density requirement performance safety also lithium ion industry reduce price 50 last 18 month part reason station storage application small fraction overall manufacturing capacity large battery company world word energy storage benefit investment go consumer electronic electric vehicle expect continue well give sense energy storage technology company battery company think big difference two like like chipset either amd intel think important ticket ball game say united states lot thing relate integration use case software optimization need come greensmith really decide 2008 really build competency across entire value chain give good example software say software software control asset incredible amount potential energy contain really design sort angry bird software thermal runaway vent pretty serious stuff unless understand battery unless understand grid interconnect substation unless understand intermittency associate solar different wind integrate different piece although buy think transaction close july 3 last year also invest rather large company like eon  really set sight build technology credible big power company world feel like last 9 year learn need learn order quickly hit ground run part wartsila organization go give 2 real example already deliver result guess get notice little bit deliver 30 people within organization turnkey 13 total energy source deploy 2016 terawatts energy storage anything like essence ge siemens abb combine think definition disruptive technology matter many engineer matter kind brand matter kind balance sheet technology idea well execute well somebody else obviously even conservative industry power industry go utilize technology well really cut tooth first would say grid scale energy storage market pjm wholesale market believe large wholesale market world think gen capacity 160 gigawatt gen first one experiment different type asset respond frequency regulation problem wholesale operator give signal every 2 second establish new signal call regd try understand value fast respond asset solve frequency regulation problem successful exercise successful think would need 1 overall gen capacity address different consumer regulation issue successful 07 gen capacity course expand california market go lot capacity issue nuclear power plant combine cycle gas peaker thing get retire technology agnostic company start battery day single battery appropriate use case energy storage battery much like car engine ferrari engine volkswagen engine two job institute vehicle different thing energy storage much way become almost fashionable say one battery agnostic actually integrate 16 different battery since inception think apply grid asset also integrate battery include wind generation solar generation fossil generation fossil generation wartsila also people like caterpillar island azores bring piece together download load datum predict weather base weather datum basically operate entire island grid different use javier talk around future integrator choice course cut tooth evaluate big power company world also benefit early day go concept product apri sandia

analyst 2 camp camp 1 wartsila camp say engine mean production side become flexible way go camp say production flexible battery take volatility run indeed stable production meaning gas turbine 2 way win camp wartsila camp battery plus gas turbine campjavier cavada camino tell think say gas turbine dead god bless gas turbine unidentified analyst say mean  excel spreadsheet clear javier cavada camino yes yes mean think super benefit listen bob later tell see everywhere say 177 country think meet often think every 3 month something like normally helsinki live weekend normally everywhere see graphs investment go investment combine cycle course see 2 year investment combine cycle reduce 50 50 sale know increase 69 2 year energy solutions effect come renewable take efficiency holy grail anymore sustainability mean come renewable course cost electricity fuel flexibility replace old grail efficiency flexibility let solar wind grid say point make good question mean lot country speed different sell baseload solution country 0 renewable place know buy invest renewable brain invest combine cycle today indeed mean make rhetoric question like invest nuclear plant today unidentified analyst understand situation renewable close 100 capacity matter anymore hardly use efficiency simply matter long way 80 efficiency play still important role help really make simple gas turbine diejavier cavada camino want repeat try tell another angle mention tipping point renewable penetration allocation 20 mathematical place 12 enough place need 30 disturbance grid due wind due cloud due night heavy gas turbine far mechanical engineer efficient source electricity run full capacity unidentified analyst friend say battery good john jung friendjavier cavada camino john jung want check javier cavada camino yes yes  battery camp john wartsila camp misjudge one john jung couple perspective give care electron come kind stuff perhaps market although 17 67 terawatt generate planet little bit ahead curve think ceo big power company basically say see within next couple year another investment ccgt back retirement united states across also germany make investment decision like 4 year ago headline top mean 38 gigawatt order last year engine think develop country gdp growth 7 8 well place actually load decrease become efficient think bit false choice whether 1 camp another camp think wartsila well positioned either eventuality although think bold us really 100 renewable vision truth go lot financial success matter real sort outcome look like well javier cavada camino say friend think friend make gas turbine friend mine feel pity today indeed mention market disappear know come back bring company make gas turbine develop flexible solution engine invest engine well engine fact say energy storage one top 3 integrator energy storage wartsila  wartsila want see figure bloomberg quite neutral would say quite renewable friendly would say analyst like even see growth engine market 10x  course storage 100x fold little today want lead unidentified analyst okay finally tell show  flexible capacity installment year define flexible capacity engine simple cycle turbine well itjavier cavada camino mean flexible capacity something respond intermittency renewable  today engineer open cycle turbine able respond quickly time enough time technology develop run constantly stable stop start reduce maintenance period increase  energy massively unidentified analyst yes yes product definition flexible product engine simple cycle turbinesjavier cavada camino simple cycle flexibility flexible unidentified analyst enginesjavier cavada camino engine massively engine solution second get grid john jung energy storage respond 40 millisecond need javier cavada camino top john jung yes yes top think talk flexibility general attach particular piece hardware asset grid today product solution offer today allow continuous kind response time intermittency become big issue think well 100 think tipping point base real  modeling ipp territory even single country like philippines around 20 penetration lot different part world get well hope answer question javier cavada camino thank good question tomi railo analyst seb research division tomi railo seb talk little bit financial much megawatts order intake example last year revenue profitable business sort room expansion monetary term head 100 million level 200 million level financial potential greensmith come yearsjavier cavada camino refer energy storage tomi railo greensmith javier cavada camino yes yes tell give go indicate figure several business line greensmith energy storage integration solar engine gas infrastructure make difference give figure globally energy storage integrate whole planet 2017 700 megawatt wartsila deliver 3 gigawatt close 4 gigawatt 37 something last year tell could really compare megawatt monetary value john jung expect lot revenue growth much end beginning nice part diversity lot engine reciprocate engine revenue sale allow us grow energy storage new technology infantile market clear energy service javier cavada camino exactly storage go grow huge angle engine go grow positive angle different one unidentified analyst okay choose 2 talk competitive landscape john say 30 market share 70 remain much big number 2 put global scale guess javier slightly answer say 700 really get think 3 4 gigawatt talk kind rest competition space john jung sure first let kind explain math count entire value chain supply energy storage market right look battery market instance probably 3 player stationary storage supply 80 overall battery company like lg chem samsung byd sort depend calculate energy storage one market beginning lot call forward integrator show piece equipment try integrate system et cetera retrench back sell battery inverter look javier point act integrate system much like integrate phone integrate kind energy system also talk software touch place like united states 1 2 depend upon calculate aes capacity united states energy storage course aes power company utility sell lot energy storage system independent technology company  quite sure apple apple comparison include company like tesla recently deploy large system 1 notably south australia anyway hope give sense top competitor thing want mention big difference business model associate competitor term role play along value chain business model comprehensive except fact want manufacture battery inverter global commodity available like freedom select right component really integrate turnkey system integrator combine energy storage lot asset pretty much entire job integrate energy storage order position proud also think scratch surface give instal base 68 gigawatt sale

"Was Googles 137-Milliarden-Imperium droht, wenn es den Kampf mit den Kartellbehörden verliert",Nick Bastone,2019-06-06T00:00:00Z,U.S. Federal; International,,News,1625,egal ob us prasident donald trump oder die linke demokratin elizabeth warren inzwischen glauben viele us politiker dass google zu machtig geworden ist aber wenn es darum geht gegen die ubermacht von google getan werden kann gibt es keine einfache antwort der internetgigant kontrolliert mehr als 37 prozent des online werbemarkts den usa und mehr als 92 prozent des markts fur suchmaschinen fur deutschland durften ahnliche zahlen gelten dem konzern gehort die weltweit grosste video plattform  und er erstellt die software fur acht von zehn smartphones weltweit diese allgegenwart hat zu aufrufen gefuhrt die macht von google einzudamman laut einem kurzlich wall street journal veroffentlichten bericht bereitet das us justizministerium eine kartellrechtliche untersuchung gegen google vor den usa erhielt google bisher nur geringe geldstrafenes ist noch unklar auf welchen teil von googles geschaft die untersuchung des justizministeriums abzielen wird geschweige denn welche art von sanktionen frage kaman angesicht der massiven und vielfaltigen geschafte von google einschliesslich der tatsache dass google selbst teil der grosseren holding alphabet ist kann das regulatorische vorgehen eine reihe von folgen haben moglich waren zum beispiel eine verstarkte aufsicht neue beschrankungen fur die geschaftsausweitung und sogar eine zerschlagung wie sie derzeit auch bei facebook diskutiert wird die us ausgabe von business insider sprach mit mehreren kartellexperten und wall street analysten um sich ein bild von den moglichen auswirkungen und den risiken fur google zu machen das folgende konnte google passieren wenn festgestellt wird dass es gegen die kartellvorschriften verstosst seit seiner grundung vor zwei jahrzehnten hatte google die grossten probleme mit den staatlichen aufsichtsbehorden form von geldstrafen den usa wurde gegen google eine reihe von bescheidenen bussgeldern fur verstosse gegen datenschutzbestimmungen verhangt europa waren die strafen hingegen strenger die europaische kommission hat google laufe der jahre zu geldstrafen hohe von insgesamt rund 10 milliarden us dollar fur verschiedene wettbewerbswidrige praktiken verdonnert experte glaubt nicht dass ein bussgeld frage kommte steht zur debatte ob diese sanktionen bei einem unternehmen wirksam sind dessen bilanzsumme uber 100 milliarden us dollar liegt nach ansicht vieler experten mit denen business insider gesprochen hat steht die jedoch diesmal kaum zur diskussion ich glaube nicht dass ein bussgeld frage kommt sagte robert lande rechtsprofessor der universitat baltimore zu business insider das liegt daran dass das us justizministerium wie lande erklarte keine geldstrafe gegen google erheben kann es sei denn das unternehmen hat gegen eine bereit bestehende vereinbarung verstossen und bisher gibt es keine solche vereinbarung zwischen google und dem justizministerium ein weiter grund warum sich google keine sorgen um hohe bussgelder den usa machen muss ist die art und weise der die us aufsichtsbehorden den durch wettbewerbswidrige verhalten verursachten schaden vergleich zu dem europa beurteilen das vorgehen der eu bietet dem us justizministerium eine gute vorlagedie eu konzentriert sich mehr auf die schadigung von wettbewerbern wahrend sich die usa auf die schadigung von verbrauchern konzentriert sagt michael carrier rechtsprofessor der rutgers university einer welt mit kostenlosen webdiensten fur verbraucher von google mail bi android ist es schwierig die schadigung von verbrauchern zu begrunden doch das vorgehen der eu jenseit des atlantiks bietet eine gute vorlage fur die teile von googles geschaft die das hoheitsgebiet des us justizministeriums fall insbesondere das werbegeschaft von google das geschaft mit den suchmaschinen und die android software haben sich als erfolgreiche untersuchungsziele der eu behorden erwiesen ich wurde damit anfangen mich mit dem eu verfahren gegen google zu befassen sagte carrier hat google bei der suche seine eigenen einkaufsdienste den konkurrenten vorgezogen welche auswirkung hatten exklusivitatsklauseln auf anzeigen und ist bei android mit der bundelung von google software mit androidfruhere kartellrechtliche untersuchung wurde al leichter klaps auf die hand von google verspottetobwohl diese bereiche vergangener verstosse moglicherweise ein ausgangspunkt fur das justizministerium sind sagte eine quelle auf dem capitol hill die kurzlich mit business insider gesprochen hat dass die untersuchung wahrscheinlich offen dabei sein wird alle uber google zu untersuchen die grosse frage ist ob eine potenzielle massnahme des us justizministeriums gegen google mehr biss haben wurde als die kartellrechtliche untersuchung der federal trade commission 2013 uber die geschaftspraktiken von google den bereichen suche und smartphone lest auch tesla amazon und co bei diesen 13 unternehmen verdienen praktikanten tausende dollar pro monatgoogle hat diese begegnung ohne finanzielle nachteile hinter sich gelassen und sich nur vagen versprechungen verpflichtet einige geschaftspraktiken zu andern von vielen kritikern al ein leichter klaps auf die hand von google verspottet wurde die macht der big techunternehman wird thema wahlkampf 2020in anbetracht des aktuellen politischen klimas und der rhetorik mit der big tech zerschlagen werden soll wird es diesmal vielleicht ander sein zum ersten mal seit dem fruhen 20 jahrhundert ist die konzentration der macht der unternehmen ein wichtige thema bei den anstehenden prasidentschaftswahlen den usabekannte politiker wie die prasidentschaftskandidatin elizabeth warren forderten eine zerschlagung der wichtigsten akteure der technologiebranche darunter google apple facebook und amazon fall von google sagte warren um den suchgiganten abzuwickeln wurde sie damit beginnen dass das unternehmen grossere zukaufe wie den kartendienst waze das smart home hardware unternehmen nest und die werbeplattform doubleclick veraussern mus das ist vielleicht leichter gesagt als getan mehrere kartellexperten die diese woche mit business insider gesprochen haben sagten die wahrscheinlichkeit einer zerschlagung sei gering zerschlagung von google ist kaum mogliches ist sehr schwierig fruhere zukaufe ruckgangig zu machen sagte carrier von der rutgers university die unternehmen sind verschmolzen und die bestandteile lassen sich nicht mehr voneinander trennen wurde das smart home unternehmen nest das 2014 von google ubernomman wurde nun vollstandig den hardwarebereich des unternehmens aufgenomman mai kundigte das unternehmen auf der diesjahrigen entwicklerkonferenz dass das branding fur seine smart home produkte jetzt google nest lauten wird wie google nest learning thermostat und google nest secure alarm lest auch diese 20 unternehmen beherrschen das internet deutschlandblockaden zwischen dem ehemaligen nest team und googles eigener hardware abteilung sind ebenfall verschwunden teilte rishi chandra vizeprasident des nest produktmanagements business insider kurzlich einem interview mit es ist jetzt ein team eine roadmap fur die gesamte organisation aufgrund der schwierigkeiten die mit einer echten zerschlagung einhergingen sagten experten dass ein plausiblere ergebnis fur die untersuchung des justizministeriums die blockierung zukunftiger geschafte fur google sei und fur den technologieriesen konnte die ein potenzielle risiko darstellen das verbot von zukaufen konnte googles cloud dienst schmerzlich treffen  kann zukaufe naturlich blockieren sagte michael pachter manager bei wedbush securities zu business insider diese woche bezweifle dass es viele unternehmen gibt die google kaufen muss  das blockieren zukunftiger kaufe ist immer ein risiko fur jede grosse unternehmen auf die frage wo es google meisten weh tue wenn das us justizministerium sich fur eine strategie der blockade statt einer zerschlagung entscheidet sieht dan ives ebenfall manager bei wedbush securities ehesten das cloud computing geschaft des unternehmens betroffen die google cloud platform  rangiert heute auf dem markt abgeschlagen auf platz drei hinter amazon web services und microsoft azure das hauptproblem hierbei ist ob die den fokus von google auf zukaufe zusammenhang mit der gcp einschrankt sagte ives als  kurian zu google kam war die der trommelwirbel fur viel wichtigere transaktionen cloud bereich untersuchung wirft ihre schatten auf googlekurian wurde januar als cloud chef von google engagiert und loste diane greene ab nach 22 jahren bei oracle sollte kurian das cloud geschaft des unternehmens wettbewerb mit unternehmen wie amazon und microsoft unterstutzen analysten gehen davon aus dass ein teil der aufholung auf dem cloud markt durch fusionen und ubernahmen erfolgen konnte jetzt sagte ives dass das potenzial der untersuchung des justizministeriums google moglicherweise vor einer aggressiveren zukaufstrategie zuruckschreckt selbst wenn eine solche auflage gar nicht erhoben wird es fuhlt sich als wurden die flugel von den schatten der kartellrechtlichen ermittlungen beschnitten sagte ives es wurde mich wundern wenn sie sich aggressiv um fusionen und ubernahmen bemuhen wurden jetzt wo sie rampenlicht stehen dieser text wurde aus dem englischen ubersetzt und leicht gekurzt die originalversion findet ihr hi weblink,Business Insider Germany
