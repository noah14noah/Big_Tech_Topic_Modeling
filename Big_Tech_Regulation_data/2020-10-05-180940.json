Plus, a major development in the New Jersey Bridge scandal story and the 12-year-old changing the world one bow tie at a time. But first, on the battlefield of politics, why you must sweat the small stuff.</p><p>Good morning. I`m Melissa Harris-Perry. This week we`ve got a little news on an issue we`ve been covering here on MHP show for nearly two years. This week in voter suppression and this week the news is actually kind of good. Thursday a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation that would restore some of the protections in the Voting Rights Act that were struck down by the Supreme Court last year. And on Friday, a Pennsylvania judge struck down that state`s voter id law. Saying it placed an unreasonable burden on the fundamental right to vote. Now, these are small, but critical steps in the right direction. Returning us to our traditional value of expanding the franchise rather than limiting it. Every vote matters. Our nation`s recent experiences remind us that even a fraction of votes in a single location can have, well, history defining effects on national elections. So if you care who will occupy the White House after 2016, you`d better pay attention to who holds offices in the states, which means you`d better know a little something about the communities that make those states up. Case in point, North Carolina.</p><p>The political significance of the tar heels state was underscored this week when <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>visited to promote his efforts to boost the manufacturing industry. It was his first policy related trip of 2014. Now, remember, North Carolina is a battleground state that by a razor`s edge margin went for <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>in 2008 and then turned back to red in 2012. In between, a political revolution happened in North Carolina. Republicans won control of both houses of the state legislature. For the first time in 140 years. And in 2012, the state elected a Republican governor, giving one party control to the state. Now, the state`s laws are among the most conservative in the country. North Carolina has passed some of the nation`s most restrictive voting laws, which disproportionately affect the poor and racial minorities, groups that traditionally vote Democratic. It cut unemployment benefits by as much that it was disqualified from a federal compensation program for long term jobless benefits. North Carolina eliminated its earned income tax credit, essentially raising taxes on more than 900,000 households earning less than $49,000 a year. State lawmakers also passed a law that could close most of North Carolina`s 16 abortion clinics. And the governor, Pat McCrory, he signed the law despite his campaign promise not to approve any new abortion restrictions.</p><p>But these changes did not start at the top of the political ticket. Instead, they started at the bottom. In 2009, in the Wake County School board election, conservative board members were elected with the support of multi-million air conservative and supermarket magnet Art Pope. The new board promptly eliminated a school bussing program, which had been lauded as a model for school integration, and Pope`s work on the school board attracted national attention. By 2010, he had the attention of the conservative strategist Ed Gillespie. Gillespie was working on his red map plan, and putting state legislatures and their redistricting duties under Republican control and Art Pope quickly became a key part of Gillespie`s efforts in North Carolina. Pope, his family, and the groups backed by him spent more than $2 million on General Assembly races in 2010, and of the 22 races Pope targeted Republicans won 18 and took control of the legislature.</p><p>Pope is now North Carolina`s state budget director and Ed Gillespie announced this week that he will challenge Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner. And this key player in the Republican takeover of North Carolina, which has raised taxes on some of its poor citizens and cut unemployment benefits, well, he`s running on a platform. You`ve just got to listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED GILLESPIE, VIRGINIA SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: If elected I`ll be a servant to the people of Virginia and a leader for policies that grow the middle class and foster upward mobility, enabling people to lift themselves out of poverty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: To be fair, Gillespie didn`t himself cut unemployment or passed voter restrictions in North Carolina. But he did help orchestrate the Republican takeover of the legislature that did. And just as his efforts began at the lower levels of American politics, so, too, has the opposition to North Carolina`s sharp rightward turn. The grassroots \"Moral Monday\" protests last year gained momentum every week as hundreds of peaceful protesters were arrested for occupying the state legislature and demanding an end to these particular conservative policies. Their next big rally is set for Raleigh, on February 8th. And the movement is spreading. Organizers from a dozen states traveled to Raleigh in December to learn how to start their own \"Moral Mondays.\" And this week, the first \"Moral Monday\" in Georgia was held at the state capital in Atlanta where about 200 people urged the Republican governor there to expand Medicaid and on Tuesday in South Carolina demonstrators carried a white coffin up the state house steps to represent the people they say could die. The state refuses to expand Medicaid. This is where the real progressive movement is going to have to start. I mean it can`t come whole cloth from the populist mayor of New York City or even from the tough on bank senator from Massachusetts. It must take root among the people in places like Raleigh and Atlanta and Columbia.</p><p>Joining me now is Representative Keith Ellison, Democratic congressman from Minnesota, Anthea Butler, professor of religious studies at the University of Pennsylvania, Nancy Giles, contributor to \"CBS Sunday Morning\" and a writer and social commentator. And Katon Dawson, a Republican consultant and former chair of the South Carolina GOP. Thanks to you all for being here.</p><p>REP. KEITH ELLISON, (D) MINNESOTA: Thank you.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: So, congressman, I want to start with you. Because before going to the U.S. House of Representatives you serve in your state legislature .</p><p>ELLISON: Sure.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: And you write about it in your book. Talk to me about -- if I`m an ordinary citizen living somewhere who doesn`t normally watch cable news politics, right? How important is the state legislature versus this federal levels?</p><p>ELLISON: They define voter qualifications, so we have 50 or more different ways to elect people. So like in the last election in Minnesota, the conservatives put on a valid measure that would require a photographic identification card from the government, issued by the government before anyone could vote. And people said we could not possibly beat it, but we did beat it and we beat it by a wide margin because we organized and talked to people on the grassroots and we had a multitude of arguments. We said it cost too much, it was unwieldy. We said it didn`t have any factual basis, because there was no voter and posture voting .</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Right.</p><p>ELLISON: Going on. And - but we cobbled all of those logical arguments together and we came up with a winning coalition. So let me tell you. At the state level, that`s where the action is when it comes to who gets to vote and who doesn`t from voter - from disenfranchisement, voter I.D., access to voter polls, to the number of machines, the state is what`s happening.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Right. And this - and that point, Anthea, I want to pick up on in part because I think it felt for many - you know, for many again, ordinary folks living their lives, balancing their checkbooks, driving their kids to school it felt like all of a sudden in 2010 there was this Republican takeover, this wave, that came out of nowhere. But it didn`t come out of nowhere, right? It had been built off from like door-catchers to the Senate at that point.</p><p>ANTHEA BUTLER, PROF., UNIV. OF PENNSYLVANIA: Exactly. And what people don`t realize as this probably - almost I would say maybe almost a 50-year history of people being put in the school board, the mayor`s office.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p>BUTLER: The state legislature, and, you know right wing conservatives being asked to run not just because of political duty, but of religious duty and we`ll get to that when we talk about reproductive rights.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p>BUTLER: But in this particular case, when you have conservatives who are motivated, on the liberal side everybody thought, we`ll just go out and we`ll vote and we`ll have an occasional candidate and that`s really great. But what they haven`t thought about is the structural issues that make it very important that you have to be in every place in government. All politics is local.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BUTLER: And it is very true. All of this starts at a local level. And by the time you get to the national level, these states` rights issues, the kinds of things that make these structures happen have already come out of people`s hands and they go what just happened. You know, and I`m sure everybody in North Carolina is saying the same thing.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: How does this happen? So, Katon, it does seem to be the part of the answer, though, to what happened in North Carolina. I mean, you know, I`d love to just point to Art Pope and say it`s all his fault and his big money. But part of it - takeover was possible in part, because the Democratic Party in North Carolina was vulnerable, right, to this kind of takeover to these challenges. It seems to me that you all do a really good job of being profoundly organized on one message. How do you guys do that? Do you have like internal memos at the meetings? Is there a hash tag? What is going on with you guys?</p><p>KATON DAWSON, REPUBICAN CONSULTANT: It started years and years ago when the Democrats controlled both South Carolina and North Carolina and you - when I was - in the state houses, and South Carolina`s 16 years ahead of North Carolina as far as taking over the bodies. So, we .</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Taking over the bodies indeed.</p><p>DAWSON: We`ll get into that later. But when I was chairman, we didn`t have full majority, so I went after sheriff`s races and changed nine sheriffs from Democrats to Republican .</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Right.</p><p>DAWSON: And then with that you go to solicitors. Solicitor named Trey Gowdy who became a U.S. congressman.</p><p>ELLISON: That`s my colleague.</p><p>DAWSON: Your colleague. So, when you look at the foreign team, a lot of people think these candidates should show up. From my standpoint, you get them on record early. You find out where they are and you start electing them, and in the south, the pro-life movement is the base of a lot of these elections, it did, and it`s a proud base that I`m with, but what I`m telling you is that - right. You don`t just show up. Politics doesn`t change overnight. Art Pope`s $2 million didn`t change that. What really changed North Carolina was an influx of people and retires. Conservative. That`s one of the things that changed it. The second thing changed was national Democrat politics were not matching up. I ran the last cycle in North Carolina when <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>had about 42 bricks and mortars in there and we put about 450 people in there fighting that fight, and what we found out in North Carolina was it was different. As everybody was working persuadable voters. It was the Republican base we had to go the last three weeks to, and we had to go, because they were sitting on the sidelines.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: OK. So I love that you said we split sheriffs and the next thing you know we`re flipping whole state bodies, right? Because, you know, those are those low information elections where 100 people, 200 people can make all the difference in who becomes your sheriff in New Orleans. We vote on the coroner, God help us. I know. But - I know, it is. There`s a lot to be said about that, right? It`s a Southern thing. I do want to look, though, at the Medicaid gap, right? Because you talked about who can be persuaded, right? And in Georgia there are more than 400,000 people who would have gotten Medicaid in North Carolina, more than 300,000 people. In South Carolina, nearly 200,000 people. And that looks to me like a group of people who are not getting Medicaid, who could have gotten it, if, in fact, their governors had been willing to extend it. If I`m a Democrat sitting in those states, I start thinking about how I start flipping it based on that.</p><p>NANCY GILES, CONTRIBUTOR, \"CBS SUNDAY MORNING\": Exactly. And we were talking about this in the green room. People voting against their own interests. And I can`t underscore enough what`s been said at the table as someone who considers herself bright, college educated and never really paid much attention to the smaller votes.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p>GILES: You know, the school board, you know. I don`t have children, so I wouldn`t have really think about that. The local votes. And I know so many people who maybe will pay more attention if it`s a mayoral vote.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Sure.</p><p>GILES: Or if it`s a Senate vote or presidential campaign, but we`ve got to get boots on the ground just like you`re an evil genius.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes, yes.</p><p>GILES: I want to incorporate everything that`s being said. We`ve got to make sure the people know that the stakes are high.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Stick with me. OK, we`ll let your polite southern evil genius reign when we get back. We`re going to take a break right now. And while we go to break we`re going to be listening to music inspired by the \"Moral Monday\" protests. This is \"My Body Politics\" by the North Carolina Music Love Army.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Six months ago the Supreme Court struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act. The court took issue specifically with the formula for determining, which states and jurisdictions have such problematic history on voting rights that they need his federal approval for any changes to their voting laws before they go into effect. The justices had said the formula was outdated and invited Congress to create a new one. Now, for the first time since the ruling a bipartisan group of lawmakers has an actual proposal. And the bill was introduced Thursday by Senator Patrick Leahy and Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner and Congressman John Conyers, and co-sponsored by Congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis. Under the bill, states that have had five or more violations of federal voting laws in the past 15 years will need preclearance from the Feds before changing local voting rules. Currently that would cover Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Five fewer states then were previously fully covered. And local jurisdiction would need the preclearance if they had three violations in the past 15 years or if they had persistent extremely low minority turnout over that time. The bill would also make it easier to get a preliminary injunction to brock a problematic law pending trial. One caveat, though. The bill specifically exempts voter I.D. laws saying such requirements are not a violation of the Voting Rights Act and at this point, it does not cover North Carolina, which has some of the most restrictive voting laws in the country.</p><p>So, Anthea, this is like one of those good news/bad news stories.</p><p>BUTLER: Yeah.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Where, OK, bipartisan, looks like we might get a new formula, we don`t just have to walk around with a two slid section five forever, but it also gives away the ghost with the notion that I.D. is inherently not part of the VRA problem.</p><p>BUTLER: I know. And that`s really - what it does is it leaves it up to state judges and things like that. That what just happened in Pennsylvania with Governor Corbett having a bad day yesterday finding out that, you know, we won`t have to use our voter I.D. But I am thinking about states like Texas where, you know, voter I.D., you can use your gun permit, you can use your concealed carry permit to get .</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: But not your student ..</p><p>BUTLER: But not your student I.D. card, right? So what kind of sense does that make? So, I`m hopeful that this will, you know, help bridge a little bit of a gap. Because I see Texas is almost being the worst in that bunch for a lot of respects, but they`re all equally bad, but the question is, can we find enough consensus to have that voted upon in the House?</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p>BUTLER: And that`s where I`m worried about it. Because if we don`t, I think that what we`re going to see in 2014 is a lot more people being taken off the rolls and this won`t get fixed, you know, by November `14, which will make it very problematic.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: So, and Katon, this is precisely where I want to come with you, then. Because I love the story that you tell about we have good strategy, we`ve got demographic changes, we go get those voters, we pound the pavement. If that is what -- if that`s the issue, then I would be like well, God bless the Republicans because if people agree with you and you get your voters out.</p><p>DAWSON: You get one more than they do.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Right. Then that`s what democracy is. But then this is something different. Because this isn`t about we go convince the voters to be on our side. This is we suppress the voters most likely to choose the other side and that to me doesn`t feel like it`s healthy for democracy.</p><p>DAWSON: Well, the arguments are going to go on, the courts are going to continue. Some states are going to do, others - some laws are going to be more egregious than others, but it`s going to get down to the voter I.D. again, whether it`s right or not. And whether the citizens in the states - will there be protests on the streets? There`s some. But, again, it takes a voter I.D. to get in about everywhere. And that`s where I think sometimes the argument gets lost. It took me one to get in here. Four times - to get in ..</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: But you don`t have a constitutional right to be in here.</p><p>DAWSON: Well, I don`t. You invited me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DAWSON: Thank you. You are exactly right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DAWSON: Or you could turn me away.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yeah. No. Right. I mean - right, nor do I. But - and yet, Congressman, I guess the other point is - I actually also don`t have a constitutional right to vote. In that it is state by state, right? And so what I`m wondering, given your point that there are at least 50 separate and unequal rules and procedures for voting, is it time, congressman, to have a -- an amendment to the U.S. Constitution providing at the federal level the right to vote for every citizen and wipe this mess away?</p><p>ELLISON: Yes. And Mark Pocan who`s from Wisconsin and I have a bill to make the right to vote a constitutional amendment and we`re moving it as well as we can, and I think it only makes sense because we really don`t live in the kind of country that was -- we had when we put this voting scheme together. Things have changed in the amount of just inequality and disparity and the way people are treated is just so wide - that it`s just not fair. And so, it`s time to amend the constitution and grant a right to vote to all citizens. But I will say this. You know. Grassroots activism really is the key here.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p>ELLISON: And people getting involved like \"Moral Mondays\" and it`s spreading. You know, in Wisconsin people were out on the streets. In Minnesota we get things on the street. I think this is good for democracy and I`m excited about it.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: OK. And you took us exactly where we are going next, because when we come back, I`ve got somebody from \"Moral Mondays\" right here, because up next, the trouble in district 12 that not even Katniss can fix.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Welcome back. You know, district 12 just can`t catch a break. No, no, no, not that district 12. This district 12. North Carolina`s 12TH congressional district. Last weekend we told you about the decision by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory to hold off on filling the 12th district seat just vacated by Mel Watt who`s now heading a Federal Housing Agency until the general election in November, so that leaves the seat in a solidly democratic majority and minority district without a representative for almost a year. Governor McCrory was asked about his decision Wednesday during an interview with a host of MSNBC`s \"The Daily Rundown\" Chuck Todd.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK TODD, MSNBC ANCHOR: I know people have a low opinion of Congress, but to have basically to disenfranchise nearly a million people and not having a representation in the U.S. House of Representatives, that is not a healthy thing for a year.</p><p>GOV. PAT MCCRORY (R ), NORTH CAROLINA: Well, Chuck, I`m sworn to uphold the constitutional laws of North Carolina and I can`t change those laws between now and that election, and, again, I have to uphold the election laws and I made the good decision.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Joining us now from Washington, D.C. is the Reverend William Barber, president of the North CarolinaNAACP and leader of the \"Moral Mondays\" movement which has been protesting among other things North Carolina`s voter restrictions and who also sent a letter to Governor McCrory about this question of District 12. Reverend Barber, thank you for being here.</p><p>REV. WILLIAM BARBER, NAACP NATIONAL BOARD MEMBER: Thank you so much, Dr. Perry. You know, it`s utterly ridiculous the government says about the law, the fact of the matter is we have the people who can get together and actually comply with the law, you know. Representative Price, Representative Butterfield actually wrote the governor and said we can do better than this. 700,000 people, Republicans, Democrats, black and white, will be left without a representative. It`s just wrong. Over 300 days in a time when the Congress will be dealing with the VRA bill, you know, farm bills, all the things that impact that particular district. And, you know, it took us 90 years, Melissa, from 1900 to 1990 to even get representation in the African American community.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yeah, I mean it`s a crazy little district. You know, it`s worth looking at it again. Congressman Ellis (ph) was sitting here at the table and when he saw how gerrymandered that district was.</p><p>BARBER: Right.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: His mouth kind of fell open. And, of course, we know district 12 was challenged on racial gerrymandering, was redrawn to be a clearly part of then gerrymandered districts, which is legal and constitutional, but that said, you know, I guess I`m wondering, Reverend Barber, if I went down today to a barbershop in Greensboro and asked people, you know, do you know that you live in district 12 and do you know that you are not going to have a representative, what would they say about that?</p><p>BARBER: Well, people are livid about it. I mean, they really are, because they recognize that this is taxation without representation. Now, the other part of that, Melissa, is that if we had free clearance in place, this decision of the governor would have to be pre-cleared. The fact is now that we don`t because we`re looking for this reauthorization of section four, it makes this even more problematic. The Republicans stalled on Mayor Watt being appointed and now governor McCrory is again being the governor of denial. He has denied Medicaid, denied unemployment, he`s tried to deny voting rights and now he`s trying to deny representation tor this district.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Hold on one second. I want to come out to you, Nancy, because you`re having this reaction.</p><p>GILES: I feel sick.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yeah. That feels to me like the kind of every woman, every man reaction, must be when they hear this story. So, tell me what you`re thinking of this?</p><p>GILES: Number one, how can the governor just say no with a little laugh in his voice, yeah, I`m complying with the law and not have a representative for that - for that area, for so many people, how is that allowed? I mean, again, I tell you one thing that`s really interesting about this president because a lot of it filters down from that. I have learned more about how the government works on the lower, lower, lower, local, local levels than I have ever learned before and I`m just shocked that this many people cannot have a representative at such a crucial time for people to be represented.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Let`s listen. Because I want to listen to this. Because Governor McCrory said it wasn`t a particularly crucial time. He said it`s a couple of months and it doesn`t make any difference. Let`s take a listen to that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. MCCRORY: My decision was even supported by the very liberal editorial page of the Charlotte \"Observer\" and it was also supported by three of the African-American Democratic candidates that are running for Mel Watt`s seat.</p><p>I think the only difference in any other option was about two months. And Chuck, you know and I know that not much goes on in Washington between July and the election anyway, which is a sad commentary on Washington politics.</p><p>TODD: I know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Representative Ellison, you`ll be doing anything there between July and November?</p><p>ELLISON: I think we`ll be pretty busy. We`ve been busy every single year. I`ve been in Congress. And here`s the other thing. Just being in Washington and voting is not the only thing members of Congress do. Being in the district, listening to people, talking to them, holding meetings, talking about, you know, we`re doing constituent services, helping people get passports and Social Security checks and VHS. It`s all critical. This is one of the more amazing abdications of responsibility I`ve ever seen.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Well, I will say in terms of not abdicating responsibility, Mel Watt`s team is staying in place in that district office to do some of that constituent service, because they clearly do care about that, but Reverend Barber, let me ask you about the other part of it we heard Governor McCrory say when he says hey, three of the six North Carolina 12 Democratic candidates, all of them African American, are down with the November election. We checked. That does seem to be true. Why would those candidates support this timing?</p><p>BARBER: Well, that`s why in the NAACP we have no permanent - there is no permanent enemies on the permanent interest. It doesn`t matter if someone wants to, you know, even stay in bondage. All of us don`t want to stay in bondage. What we want is constitutional representation. So that doesn`t matter. He`s called to govern for the best interest of the people, not to pick out two or three people and then decide to implement something that`s going to cause taxation without representation. Melissa, here we are in North Carolina. He is denying this. We have the worst redistricting law since the 19th century. He passed the worst voters oppression law that we`ve seen since Jim Crow and now we are in the middle of this discussion about section 4 that`s actually going to leave North Carolina uncovered, South Carolina uncovered, Alabama uncovered. These actions are unacceptable. This - we happen to have an amendment. It`s sad that one day after the actual birthday of Dr. King we`re having a discussion about voting rights that have taken us backwards add not forward.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: And particularly, I mean I just want to point out again for folks who may not know the North Carolina map. That district in part runs through Greensboro. Greensboro is where we saw those initial sit-ins of African-American men from North Carolina ANT sitting there on those Woolworth`s counters, challenging precisely this sort of things. This was ground zero on the civil rights movement. It is ground zero now.</p><p>BARBER: Franklin Graham - Franklin McCain was buried just yesterday who was a part of those civil rights movements. This district and the first district are the districts that were carved out as a result of the Voting Rights Act, but it took 90 years. I want people to hear this. 90 years for North Carolina to get representation African Americans in the U.S. Congress after George White was the last one pushed out in 1901 at the end of reconstruction. That`s why we`ve got to be very serious. And you keep hearing me push on this issue about this section for the voter rights and what`s been proposed. It is not good for us. We have to - anything that does not cover, pre-clear North Carolina, Alabama, Virginia and South Carolina, anything that gives people five chances to violate the law before we can be pre-cleared and anything that undermines the voter - says that voter I.D. is not a part of what can be used to decide pre-clear is just wrong, it`s backwards. And we`ve got to spend .</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: That`s not enough. I`ll tell you what, Reverend Barber. I`ve got a little time on Tuesday. I think I`m going to come down to North Carolina and say hey to you. All right. Rev. Barber, thank you so much. We have much more to get to this morning, including Congressman Ellison`s new memoirs. But first when we come back, my colleague Steve Kornacki, he has a major development in the New Jersey bridge story. Local politics matter, people.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: This morning we have new reporting connected to the administration of New Jersey Governor <person><nameText>Chris Christie, </nameText></person>and it`s a story that broke right here on MSNBC only hours ago on \"Up with Steve Kornacki.\" The mayor of Hoboken told Steve in an exclusive television interview why she believes her city is being denied critical Hurricane Sandy aid. Now, you remember that the city of Hoboken in the aftermath of the storm was 80 percent under water. Hoboken remains vulnerable to another storm and the mayor says the reason her city is not getting the funds it needs has nothing to do with the fact that she didn`t endorse <person><nameText>Chris Christie </nameText></person>for reelection. Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer says members of Christie`s administration warned her that her town would be starved of hurricane relief money unless she approved a lucrative redevelopment plan favored by the governor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAWN ZIMMER, MAYOR OF HOBOKEN: The bottom line is, it`s not fair for the governor to hold Sandy funds hostage for the city of Hoboken, because he wants me to give back to one private developer and it`s important that -- I know it`s very complicated for the public to really understand all of this, but I have a legal obligation to follow the law, to bring balanced development to Hoboken. I cannot give a windfall to one property owner because the governor wants me to in exchange for the Sandy fund, so I`ll tell you, I feel like I`m literally between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: We should note that a spokesman for Governor Christie issued this statement. Quote, \"Mayor Zimmer has been effusive in her public praise of the governor`s office and the assistance we`ve provided in terms of economic development and Sandy aid. What or who is driving her only now to say such outlandishly false things is anyone`s guess.\" And \"Up with Steve Kornacki\" received this statement from the director of strategic communications with the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs. She say, quote, \"Mayor Zimmer`s allegation that on May 16th, 2013 Commissioner Constable conditioned Hoboken`s receipt of Sandy aid on her moving forward with a development project is categorically false.\" Joining the table now is Steve Kornacki, host of \"Up with Steve Kornacki.\" All right, Steve, these are major claims. It`s also very complicated. So, I tried to get a general idea of it. What do you see as the key issue in this moment?</p><p>STEVE KORNACKI, MSNBC ANCHOR: So, there are several things and the story line itself connects high ranking people in Christie`s administration. It connects the Port Authority and the law firm that is run by the chairman of the Port Authority, David Samson, and Chris Christie`s, you know, close confidant David Samson. And so, basically, what happened was, there`s this plot of the land in Hoboken that`s right for - potentially right for some kind of development. This group, the Rockefeller Group owns it and they`re represented by Wolff and Samsons. The name of law firm is David Samson`s law firm. He`s the chairman of the Port Authority. Port Authority paid for a study on redeveloping on whether this land should be declared, you know, an area need a redevelopment -- it`s a developer`s dream to get this designation.</p><p>The planning board in Hoboken did not go along with that designation, and when that happened, the mayor of Hoboken got a phone call from the governor`s office, saying Lieutenant Governor is going to be in town in a couple of days. He wants to do an event sharp right with you. So they did the event at the sharp right, hey, business is open, posting - she says lieutenant governor pulled her aside after said and said, listen, this is not right, this is not the way it`s supposed to be. But if you want your Sandy aid, all (inaudible) is being held, but if you want it, you have to move forward on this development project. You have to move forward on it.</p><p>A couple of days later, she`s doing this event, the mayor is doing this event on public television at Monmouth University, a Sandy anniversary event, and the Department - or the commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, you saw her quoted there, is on stage next to her. And she says they`re both miked up, they`re waiting to go on and he makes the same explicit threat to her, linking Sandy funds to this development project.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: OK, so a couple of things I want to be sure that we get on the table here. There`s not at this point any allegation that the Rockefeller Group itself has been -- they just seem to be part of this, but not that they commissioned anyone to say this or to do this. Is that right?</p><p>KORNACKI: That`s right. And in terms of what you have, there`s no evidence pointing to like any kind of wrongdoing right now by like David Samson. What we know is his law firm represents the Rockefeller group. You have - we have emails from people of his law firm copying Davis Samson, the chairman of the Port Authority, and writing to the people in Hoboken trying to apply pressure to get this thing moving on, you know.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: No, obviously this mayor is now going to come under - Mayor Zimmer is going to come under significant scrutiny about whether or not there are reasons beyond just sort of her saying in this moment, look, I`m trying to do what is right. Right? In part because this is occurring at the time that the bridge scandal has become national news. But this is not linked directly to the bridge scandal. So, folks are going to ask, why talk about this now, why not tell it when it happened. How do you see this proceeding in terms of the fundamental questions that are going to be asked of her on what she`s alleging here?</p><p>KORNACKI: I have to say just as we`re reviewing the story this week that I find her very credible for a few reasons. And one of the reasons is, I think people looking at this nationally might be inclined to say it`s a Democratic mayor, Republican governor, he`s down. Oh, of course, this is Democratic way doing a pile on. There`s been - there`s a faction of Democrats in New Jersey who are pro <person><nameText>Chris Christie </nameText></person>Democrats. And Dawn Zimmer in many ways was the face of the pro-<person><nameText>Chris Christie </nameText></person>Democrats. When she came to office in Hoboken, she endorsed his local property tax initiative. This is controversial among Democrats. His first town hall meeting on the subject, she invited him to Hoboken to have it. He was her partner in many ways on many projects in Hoboken. She continues to this day.</p><p>On our show, we asked her about <person><nameText>Chris Christie, </nameText></person>she believes his first four years as governor, there were a lot of good things. She believes that were accomplished during that. It`s just that she got caught up in this redevelopment issue. It was on opposite side of him, and it`s apparently, this project was apparently so important to him and then there`s the fact of this diary. I mean she recorded this in her diary at the time. She shared the diary with us. And, you`ve got, you know, mundane entries in the diary and then she`s talking, just pouring her heart out about trying to grapple with the <person><nameText>Chris Christie </nameText></person>she believed in versus the <person><nameText>Chris Christie </nameText></person>who`s now making - his administration making threats.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Can you stay with us? We`ve got a table of folks here including a Republican who I want to ask in part does this ever get hot enough that Republicans are going to want <person><nameText>Chris Christie </nameText></person>to step down as the head of RGA? I also want to just sort of open up, because these are new revelations, and I think there are questions that all of us have about it. So, stick with us for just a little bit longer.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: We`re back and talking about the new developments in the question of <person><nameText>Chris Christie </nameText></person>and his use of - potentially use of political influence that were alleged today on \"Up with Steve Kornacki.\" And I just wanted to give you all an opportunity to ask Steve some of the question about what we`ve learned.</p><p>GILES: Well, to start with, Steve, I`ve lived in (INAUDIBLE). I`ve been here 13 years, which is the neighboring county to Hoboken. So, I know and I have a lot of friends that live there how damaged they were during Sandy and how they`re still struggling, so I guess I would say is that do you think why Dawn Zimmer comes out now and talks about the disparity between the money that she asks for and the money that she got? The town is still suffering.</p><p>KORNACKI: Yeah, I mean, look, there`s one last chance, realistically speaking now. That Christie got a second pot of money from HUD, that he can get out in grants, but there`s one realistic last chance for Hoboken to get the money that it`s looking for to save itself from a future storm and it comes from this sort of a race to the top style competition that HUD has. And Hoboken is a finalist thread, there were one of ten finalists for that, so it may be that, you know, this attracts a little bit of attention to it. Because we didn`t have time on the air, but they took me through off the air. The resiliency planning that they`ve done, you know, she actually - she sits on - she was appointed by <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>to his climate change panel at the end of December. She has spoken around the world on resiliency issues. They have some topnotch, you know, internationally respected resiliency work and proposals the place.</p><p>GILES: Right.</p><p>KORNACKI: So they are hopefully they can get this grant.</p><p>ELLISON: Let me ask you about political resiliency.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p>ELLISON: So after the news broke on the bridge thing, he comes and does this long press conference and everybody`s thinking, wow, maybe he`s going to survive this. Can he survive this?</p><p>KORNACKI: Well, this is - we talk about like hardball politics in New Jersey, and, you know, that governor, whoever was going to take what leverage here she has and they are going to use it to get what they want. And people kind of accept that, but this is Sandy. This is Sandy. This is a governor who part of his political rehab this past week, goes down to the shore.</p><p>ELLISON: That`s right.</p><p>KORNACKI: Goes down to the Sandy towns and he`s like - hey, everybody. Do you remember me? I`m the guy who led you through Sandy.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: And we`re all willing to put up with varieties of kind of corruption. I mean that`s, you know, I`ve lived in Chicago, I`ve lived now in New Orleans, right? There is this like - when Blagojevich appear to be selling a Senate seat that was, right, kind of the end of it and you know we will send the governor in Louisiana to jail. Like I mean so corruption and hardball politics is one thing, but like when you get to a certain level, and these are all still allegations at this point, but they do seem potentially harmful in a way to me, Katon, that I mean this is the man who`s the head of the RGA. And it`s going to come to a point where he`s going to get a phone call saying you`ve been the head of the RGA. It`s bad for us.</p><p>GILES: Republican Governors Association?</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Oh, sorry, Republican Governors Association.</p><p>DAWSON: Well, one thing I can tell you about Republican Party politics and especially presidential primary politics, and go back to Mark Sanford meeting his fair, apologizing and immediately resigning from the RGA. He didn`t want his personal situation to impact what is to me the most important thing in politics. Much more important the last thing than presidential politics or governor seats. That`s where redistricting happens, that`s where rubber meets the road. That`s where we govern as Republicans, the 157 million Americans who control in GOP controlled states. We don`t control .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: I`m frightened.</p><p>DAWSON: But you should be, but my part - my part is this apology -- and I talked to Steve. I`ve listened to other people thinking this is Jersey, this is the Jersey shore. The Republicans did watch him call the president in the end, which we saw was very unusual in the middle of a presidential race. We saw that as cementing his re-election. That`s what - that`s how I saw it. We`re going to go and cement. So my point is, you know, this is one more shoe to drop on this. And you can apologize, but you can`t cover up the fact that if you didn`t tell the truth and that`s what`s coming next.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Steve, this has been amazing reporting. These are real issues. This is not like made up sort of outrage and so I appreciate your reporting and that of your team. Thank you to Steve Kornacki. Your team are delivering great reporting on this. And up next, what I found so moving about this book by Congressman Ellison. For all the bad we`ve been saying there`s a lot of optimism about America in this book.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Congressman Keith Ellison`s mom is from Louisiana. And she makes gumbo. And on nights when young Keith would bring friends for dinner, his mother never turned anyone away. Instead she`d just some water to the gumbo so that there would be enough for all. Today, Representative Keith Ellison says we need to do the same thing in our national policy. Rather than turn the hungry away, we need to add some water to the gumbo and practice what he calls the politics of generosity. Now, in his new book called \"My Country to the V: My Faith, My Family, Our Future, \" Ellison shares his story from his Detroit roots to being the first non- white person Minnesota has ever elected to Congress, and the first Muslim American ever elected to Congress. He also outlines what the politics of generosity look like. So Representative Keith Ellison, tell me what are the politics of generosity? What does it look like?</p><p>ELLISON: Well, the politics of generosity stem from the idea that we all need to eat, we all need to retire, we all want to see our kids get a good education and develop our minds. Our country is the richest country in the history of the world and this country has never been richer than it is now.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yeah.</p><p>ELLISON: We can make sure that there is a reliable path toward economic security for every American.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: There literally is enough gumbo in the pot for everybody.</p><p>ELLISON: There`s enough.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: We just have got to share it.</p><p>ELLISON: We don`t have to send anybody out. And the thing is, is that we have a politics of scarcity and the politics of scarcity is there`s not enough, we have got to cut Head Start, we`ve got to have chained CPI, so this - because the seniors are getting too much money. But this is all driven by the idea that there`s not enough, but I believe that there is enough. And, as a matter of fact, there is enough. And the only question is shall we share it. So like, you know, this issue of low wages and the minimum wage, we`ve seen dramatic profits being reaped from our nation`s corporations, in McDonald`s, Walmart. These are wildly profitable companies and yet they are paying people $7.25. $8.25. Stuff like that. It`s like look, you know, you may not have as massive a profit as you had.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yeah.</p><p>ELLISON: But maybe if the people who work for you could, you know, afford the hamburgers that they are cooking.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yeah. It would stimulate the economy. We know that when poor folks have a little bit more, they spend it and it stimulates the economy. In addition to our politics of generosity. You also outlined the politics of courage. And specifically look to Representative Barbara Lee. And I`d like to listen to the moment that you signal us to here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BARBARA LEE (D) CALIFORNIA: September 11th changed the world. Our deepest fears now haunt us. Yet I am convinced that military action will not prevent further acts of international terrorism against the United States. Some of us must say let`s step back for a moment, let`s just pause, just for a minute, and think through the implications of our actions today so that this does not spiral out of control.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Your response is there.</p><p>ELLISON: Well, it spiraled out of control a little bit, didn`t it?</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yep. ELLISON: You know, I mean Iraq, longest - you know, longer than Vietnam. All kinds of domestic issues were unraveling, these NSA issues to this moment that stem from the Patriot Act, which was sparked by that tragic moment in September 11, 2001. I think Barbara Lee is an amazing example of courage. Because you can listen to that tape. And tell she`s scared.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: She can feel it.</p><p>ELLISON: You can feel it, because if you`ve had the pleasure of being in her presence, you know, she`s bold, she`s always got a wonderful smile, but in that moment she is feeling the weak of the moment, but she -- that`s courage, right? Courage isn`t not being scared.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p>ELLISON: It`s moving through your fear and Barbara Lee, Paul Wellstone, you know, these people, you know, they inspire me, you know, and that`s who I want to be like when I grow up.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: We`re basically out of time, but I don`t want to leave without pointing to a moment of courage of your own. Part of what that post-9/11 and the spiraling out of control Iraq was also the - the kind of generation of an anti-Muslim bias in the country.</p><p>ELLISON: Yes.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: that was articulated more frequently and yet you in the moment of being sworn into the U.S. Congress put your hand on Thomas Jefferson`s Koran, which I see as an act of courage and the reaffirmation of the faith of the American people that we can have differing faith and be one people.</p><p>ELLISON: Yeah, I mean that`s the idea - from many to one. E Pluribus Unum, we are united in our belief that all Americans have due process, have the right, have equal dignity and yet we come from very diverse places and it`s all right. You know, the bottom line is that nothing - none of the great things about America are guaranteed. We have to fight for these things. People have laid their lives on the line for them. And if you look at the reverend down there with the \"Moral Mondays\", they`re laying their life on the line for the great America now. All I want to say -- I know we`ve got to wrap is that look, you know, the pessimists are not the realists. Because good things happen all the time. We were in slavery, now we`re not. We were in Jim Crow, now we are not. Women couldn`t vote. Now they can. My point is the people of this time have got to buck up and make a better world for the people to come.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Because the better always happens, but it only happens.</p><p>ELLISON: Only happens.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: through struggle.</p><p>ELLISON: That`s it.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: To read an excerpt of the congressman`s new book please stop by the Grio.com. Congressman Keith Ellison, thank you for spending time with us this morning.</p><p>ELLISON: Thanks.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: And coming up next, turning the tide on reproductive rights, how women are fighting back against the mounting restrictions and the frank discussion about the ugly and even threatening harassment that someone is faced online. There`s, of course, more Nerdland at the top of the hour.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: (AUDIO GAP) Melissa Harris-Perry.</p><p>Nerdland, I know that as nerds, we would rather be lovers and thinker, not fighters. But today, I want us to channel our inner Sun Tzu, because I want to talk about \"The Art of War\".</p><p>Now, make no mistake -- the reproductive health policies we have seen emerge from statehouses all across the country amount to nothing short of an all-out assault to take back the gains made by Roe v. Wade.</p><p>This is no brute force, smash and grab operation we`re talking about it here. Uh-uh. This is an efficient, methodical and so far, highly effective effort to a road of reproductive choice protections guaranteed to women by the Supreme Court`s decision in Roe.</p><p>In an article in this month`s \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, the president of the anti-reproductive rights group Americans United for Life is quoted sounding like she`s taking a page straight out of Sun Tzu`s book. According to the magazine, in a 2011 interview, she said, \"We don`t make frontal attacks. Never attack where the enemy is strongest.\"</p><p>Pay attention here to the strategy because if you don`t look closely, you might not see it until it`s too late. It is a slow loss of liberty and autonomy by a thousand tiny attacks from a steady onslaught of policies mostly from Republican-led state legislatures, more abortion restrictions passed in the last three years than in the last two decades, according to the Guttmacher Institute.</p><p>Everything from Trap laws that impose burdensome and medical unnecessary requirements on abortion providers that can force them out of business to attacks on health care coverage that prevent women from paying for abortions using private insurance or policies purchased on the new health exchanges. Even mandatory counseling that can sometimes include information that is irrelevant or misleading. That visit often followed by a 24-hour waiting period and an additional trip to a provider before the procedure can be performed, requirements that women seeking abortions must first undergo ultrasounds to listen to the beat of its heart. Then, there are 20-week abortion bans that posed a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade allowance for abortions, up to the point of viability at 24 weeks.</p><p>These aggressive policies attempt to lay bare the big picture for the final decisive battle, a Supreme Court showdown to roll back the gains of Roe v. Wade. And this week when the enemies of reproductive rights came knocking at the gates, the court refused to let them in. The justices punted on considering Arizona`s 20-week abortion ban, a case that could have forced a challenge to Roe v. Wade. But that was this time advocates for reproductive justice, no it`s not going to last.</p><p>That`s why they`re devising a new tactical approach of their own, going on offense in this policy fight and using that same weapon, policy to fight back. Think of it as like political judo, it`s a martial arts practice that enable a smaller fighter to defeat a bigger stronger opponent using a key strategy, turning the opponent`s size and strength from an asset into a liability.</p><p>NARAL Pro-choice America is taking all of those restrictive abortion measures and making this pledge to the governors who signed for the law. You stood for these laws, you signed these laws, now, if you`re up for re- election this year, you`re going to have to run on them.</p><p>This week in \"The Nation\" magazine, NARAL president Elise Hogue told the writer Zoey Carpenter that the strategy is to shift the momentum and the reproductive justice fight to, quote, \"force these anti-choice extremists who hold political office to actually run on and defend anti-choice records.\"</p><p>Joining me now David S. Cohen, professor of law at Drexel University, Anthea Butler, professor of religious studies and graduate chair of the religion of the University of Pennsylvania, Nancy Northup, who is president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, and Katon Dawson, national Republican consultant, and former chair of the South Carolina Republican Party.</p><p>So, Nancy, self-defense teaches women get on the ground, kick with your legs, don`t try to go right -- you know, don`t try to go arm to arm because that`s not necessarily where the strength is. Is this what this new strategy is, all right, you guys want to sign this, run on this?</p><p>NANCY NORTHUP, CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS: Well, right. I think we`re going to see that last year was an absolute turnaround point in the fight over women`s access to reproductive health care. We saw going on offense right and left.</p><p>We saw Wendy Davis do that filibuster in Texas, and she is now soaring in her run for governor of Texas. We saw Albuquerque voters turn down a 20- week ban. When they got a chance to go to the poll instead of the politicians, they said, no, we don`t want these kind of extreme measures.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p>NORTHUP: We saw the introduction in the U.S. Congress, the Women`s Health Protection Act with 33 cosponsors in the Senate, more than 90 in the House, which says we even got to stop these restrictions at the state level. Your zip code can`t determine whether you have constitutional rights.</p><p>So, last year was a turnaround and it`s going keep on going.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: All right. So, I want to go back for a second to the actual strategy of opponents of reproductive rights for a moment, because it does feels to me, David, as though the actual Roe v. Wade decision itself is part of what opens up and allows this possibility that the multiple trimesters, the notion that there is a point in which the state has an interest.</p><p>So, talk to me. Is Roe a sufficient decision for us to continue to rest reproductive rights on?</p><p>DAVID S. COHEN, DREXEL UNIVERSITY: Well, Roe had promised but the problem was it was cut back in Casey in 1992, because Casey allowed -- Casey was the Supreme Court case that allowed a lot more restrictions from the state. It was basically the Supreme Court saying that you can do things that are burdensome on women`s rights as long as they`re not unduly burdensome and ever since Casey, we`ve seen the courts and lower courts be more receptive to infringement on women`s rights and women`s access to abortion.</p><p>So, Casey has really opened up the floodgates and with Justice Kennedy who`s perceived as the swing vote really seemingly approving almost any restriction, as long as it`s not an absolute criminalization of abortion, it`s really troublesome what Casey has allowed.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: So, Katon, as much as we talked in the last hour about the ways in which Democrats often kind of can`t hold themselves completely together to have a clear strategy, in the case of women`s reproductive rights, I`ve got to say. I got to agree with Nancy, this was the moment when on the left, you saw clear language, war on women. It became the framework. Republicans had to address whether or not they were, in fact, committing a war on women, right, and once you give up the framing, you start to lose.</p><p>Are you guys going to lose? I mean really begin to lose, if this is the central issue on which the Republicans are forced to run.</p><p>KATON DAWSON, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, Republicans will lose in the primaries if they back up on the pro-life movement. That`s what will happen. It is the basis especially in the Southeast corridor where I practice my business. It`s the basis that among other thing it`s in every party`s platform. It`s in the national party`s platform. It`s one of things that divides the two parties. There are pro-life Democrats but they don`t vote at the ballot box.</p><p>Pro-life Republicans vote that at the ballot box, whether it`d be a presidential election or any other election. And those are just facts.</p><p>It`s also -- you hear politicians and I do a lot of times when they have divisive crowds talk about the civil rights of the unborn and the civil rights -- and I know that that will start a whole other discussion, but we -- this is -- this is the terminology we use. We live in a country that spends enormous resources on trying to save nine coal miners in Pennsylvania, enormous resources on trying to talk somebody off the Brooklyn Bridge.</p><p>And this is -- the pro-life movement didn`t stand down. They`re still there. They`re still so strong and they will hold you accountable. So, it will be a fight but it`s going to cross both parties` lines.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: All right. All right. Stick with me. You`ve drawn some things that I think have become central parts of how we talk about this. I don`t want to say I disagree with you on the civil rights.</p><p>DAWSON: I think.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: In fact, actually what I want to do is when we come back, I want to make the claim if that`s going to be the discourse, if discourse is the personhood and that from the beginning fertilized eggs have civilized rights, let`s go ahead and do that and let`s talk about what the civil rights of all children ought to be and whether or not Republicans can get on that set of policy agenda. Stay right there when we come back.</p><p>Also, why 35-B is so critical in the debate over reproductive rights.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Years ago, I accompanied a friend to an appointment to end an unwanted pregnancy. Now, I expected to hold her hand, to sit with her, to hug her, to cry with her if it came to that.</p><p>But what I hadn`t anticipated, with having to shield her while we walked the gauntlet just to get in the door. A crowd of people, some shouting, some quietly imploring, some trying to condemn her, others trying to convince to change her mind, showing images, all turning her from a woman simply seeking a medical procedure into a target.</p><p>That was a day I first became aware of the vulnerability of woman who lacked the resources to end a pregnancy quietly and privately to a personal position. This week, these women, those whose reproductive choices are subject to public scrutiny in abortion clinics were the heart of the case considered by the Supreme Court. At issue was a Massachusetts law passed in 2007 to create a buffer zone, 35 feet of safe space outside of clinics, to separate patients from protesters.</p><p>The question before the court was whether the buffer zones were a reasonable response to a history of violence and harassment outside the clinics, or an unconstitutional intrusion into the right of free speech.</p><p>So, for me, part of working as an escort experience was going to that whole point that Katon was bringing up earlier, about, oh, civil rights and the civil rights of the unborn and I keep thinking, but what about the rights of the born, of those who are walking around and experiencing life. What about the rights of these women, of their children who are often already preexisting before they made the decision to terminate this pregnancy.</p><p>Can we possibly push the right to have to respond to that?</p><p>ANTHEA BUTLER, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA: Yes, exactly. I think part of what`s going on is that we have sacralized this one piece so much that real people, real life women who are in a position where they have to make these decisions are being ignored.</p><p>The whole thing about being in front of the clinics where you see the fetuses and chopped up stuff and everything else, this is the scare tactic. But what was so interesting about that \"Rolling Stone\" article by Janet Rottman (ph) is that she says, you know, Randall Terry news, like we couldn`t get any traction doing this one thing, so we changed it this way, it will be easier.</p><p>And I think we need a buffer zone. It`s not about taking away anybody`s free speech. You can stand outside in 35 feet and do what you want. But when women are being accosted, you know, presented with screaming and yelling and saying you`re killing your baby, and all this other kind of stuff, you`re impinging upon their rights as well. And I thing that the people who feel so strongly pro-life don`t realize they`re infringing on the rights of others who are trying to exercise their rights to do what they want to.</p><p>Rights go both ways. They don`t go one way just because you have a hardened ideology.</p><p>And I think to go back to Katon`s point, for a minute, I think that you may say pro, but if we start putting this the negative and making people run on the negative part of what is happening, the negative piece that women can`t get prenatal care, they can`t get gynecological examinations, they can`t get all the kind of care that they would need, not to be in a position the get pregnant in the first place, then that makes it a different kind of run. It`s not just pro-life. It`s pro \"you don`t want these women to have a life\". And that`s the point.</p><p>It`s like if you change this conversation, it becomes something else different altogether and that`s where I think there`s an attraction, especially with younger women who want to keep their reproductive rights, who might be conservative but they don`t want to have to deal with this whole thing about you`re going to tell me what to do with my body.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: And one aspect of that, I mean, I think, you know, what you`re saying there is key, and this, you know, we typically think of it as the protesters versus the women who are seeking medical services. But there`s also the clinic providers, there`s the doctors and the nurses and the receptionists who themselves have been in danger. That`s part of that 35 feet buffer zone too as well.</p><p>COHEN: Buffer zones are good because they protect women who are seeking basic medical care from being harassed but they also prevent violence and help to ensure safety of clinical workers. We`re not talking just doctors. We`re talking anyone who works at a clinic, who suffers harassment daily, threats daily. And we have to remember that in Massachusetts in particular, there`s a real history of violence.</p><p>In 1994, two clinic receptionists at Planned Parenthood, in pre-term, Shannon Lowney (ph) and Leann Nichols (ph), were murdered because they were abortion providers. That has happened to six other people working in abortion in this country`s history. Most recently, Dr. George Tiller in 2009.</p><p>This is a real risk that people suffer through every day to get to work and to work, and buffer zones don`t cure the problem, but they provide a space. Paul Hill who was one of the protesters who killed a doctor in Florida stood right outside the clinic. He was able to get close access to the clinic in Pensacola, Florida. There was no buffer zone. Buffer zones help protect people`s safety.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Nancy --</p><p>NORTHUP: Well, I was just going to say, they also allow -- if you think about it, you know, we have a history of people who want to prevent others from exercising their constitutional rights -- their right to go to school, their right to vote, their right to access with respective health services and all the buffer zone is saying stand aside, let people through. You should haven`t to go through a gauntlet of protesters to vote, or to go to school or to get health care.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: And the people who have to walk that gauntlet are a subset of all the women who have terminations. I just -- I just want to always kind of point this out, that if you are wealthy and have either private insurance or the capacity to pay individually, you can walk into a doctor`s office. It is not targeted in this way. You can walk into a hospital that is not targeted this way.</p><p>It is a very specific group of people who end up with this kind of shaming, potential violence, angst, sort of directed at them.</p><p>NORTUP: Oh, that`s right. And also, people who are also coming to get their, you know, their --</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Their pap smears and their birth control pills.</p><p>NORTHUP: Birth control pills and all that.</p><p>And again, this does -- I have protested many times in my life. Of course, I support the right to express an opinion.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Of course, of course.</p><p>NORTHUP: This is just a law about not blockading, not obstructing, not congregating in front of the clinic. Step aside, let the people through, express your opinions peacefully.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: So, that does feel like to me like that is consistent, Katon, with Republican values. Or conservative values, that -- of course we can have differences of opinion. Of course, we know that the issue of reproductive rights is a central dividing line but that your opinion doesn`t, in fact, give you the right to stand there and block someone from something that is constitutional protected.</p><p>DAWNSON: You`re exactly right. And it would be my personal opinion, especially I think in the home state that I live, that anybody that puts their hands on a woman at any time, or -- I can pretty well assure you that in South, they`ll go to jail almost immediately.</p><p>And if that`s the tactic they want to take, then there`s a good chance we`ll put them in jail. Now, I understand the protests. I understand that. But when you start infringing on these zones we`re talking about, attacking a woman for making that decision, you can attack in all kind of ways.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: I mean, no, these are mostly verbal attacks. These are shaming and yelling and sort of narrating and showing the images. They`re not -- I mean, we do know they can be attached to acts of violence but I`m not suggesting that those protesters inside those 35 feet are necessarily reaching out and grabbing but you do feel when you`re walking with someone, when you`re serving as a guide, you do sort of put your hands up over that person in part to put your head down.</p><p>But that I mean, like can you imagine if you`re going for kidney dialysis, or for a podiatrist appointment, or for any other medical appointment, and you have to work through that sort of you know, sort of shaming experience?</p><p>NORTHUP: And Massachusetts is saying everybody step aside.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes. The pro and --</p><p>NORTHUP: Pro-choice, step aside.</p><p>DAWSON: Both sides. True.</p><p>NORTHUP: Just let people through. Make your points to the side. The First Amendment`s protected, but you can`t congregate and block access.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: More on this when we come back, the question of whether or not it is time to be on offense and what offense looks like.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Supporters of reproductive right got a victory in North Carolina on Friday. A federal judge struck down a North Carolina law that required abortion providers to give women an ultrasound and describe the image even if a woman asks them not to. The judge ruled that the law was a violation of free speech.</p><p>So, David, why -- how is that a free speech violation there?</p><p>COHEN: Well, in this regard, it`s telling doctors what to say, and it`s infringing on the doctor/patient relationship, because if a doctor says that I can treat this women and I can have -- ensure her health in a particular way and the state saying you have to do something different, then that`s an infringement on that relationship.</p><p>And also, it goes beyond that, though. It`s also about the state saying that we know what`s best for women. Women don`t know what`s best for women. Doctors don`t know what`s best for women. Counselors don`t know what`s best for women.</p><p>But we, the legislators, who have probably never been in an abortion clinic, have never -- a lot of them -- ever been pregnant or can`t get pregnant since most of them are men, they say, we know what`s best for women, when it`s really -- women who know what`s best for women, in consultation with their doctors and anyone else they`re talking about.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes, Nancy, to me the ultrasound laws felt like they presume that women do not know what is happening. And it`s hard for me to tell whether they`re talking sincerely like, oh, honey, you just don`t know, let me explain it to you, or if it`s just about shaming you so that a difficult circumstance becomes even more difficult.</p><p>But is there some reason we cannot simply trust that women are fully moral agents as citizens capable of making hard choices, easy choices, all kinds of choices, including this choice?</p><p>NORTHUP: Well, you`re right and that`s, of course, what the Supreme Court has said again and again, is that there is a zone of privacy around which people can make the important decisions of their lives. That`s what this is about and whether those decisions are about -- who to marry, the size of your family, how you raise your children, your religious beliefs, that`s what the promise of het Constitution is, and that`s what the stakes are here.</p><p>In a free society, we make these critical decisions for ourselves. I would say the ultrasound laws, and the judge really got this in the North Carolina case. We`re thrilled with yesterday`s win.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p>NORTHUP: It`s not even just that they`re saying that women don`t know what they`re doing. It`s plain punitive because the North Carolina law said if the woman says, \"I don`t want to see this and I don`t want to hear this,\" she turns away, she covers her ears, the doctor is supposed to keep on napping at her and yapping at her, and so that shows that it`s not about information. It`s about some kind of a punitive performance that the doctor`s supposed to go through, in violation of her or his ethics as well as the patient`s wishes.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: You know, your point is just well-taken, that I like this image of a zone of privacy. It`s very much like the buffer zone law, but in a kind of broader sense, because similarly we would not presume that if an ultrasound showed certain kinds of field deformities that one should be required to have an abortion, right?</p><p>NORTHUP: Of course, of course.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: So the question of making difficult choices ought to be left within that buffer zone, right, of our privacy where we are allowed to make tough choices that concur with our morals, with our ethics, with our situation.</p><p>David S. Cohen and Nancy Northup, Katon Dawson, thank you so much.</p><p>Anthea is sticking around a little longer. I want to tell you about special online event this Wednesday at 2:00 p.m. Eastern. MSNBC national reporter Irin Carmon will take your questions on the 41st anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Go to MHP.MSNBC.com to submit your questions right now.</p><p>Up next, the frightening side of social media and why so many women are being harassed online.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Last month, a Pew Research study found that 73 percent of adults now use social networking sites. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are the new tools of our professional and personal lives. We use them to get information to stay connected to friends, to connect with those who share our interest, and sometimes just to kill time while wait in line.</p><p>Our virtual lives are an important part of our real lives. The places where we work and learn and play and relax are increasingly mediated and affected by our online selves. Behind the avatars and 140 characters are flesh and blood people. That mean that what happens online matters, and what is happening to women online should give us pause.</p><p>According to the volunteer organization working to halt online abuse, of the nearly 4,000 people reporting online stalking and harassment from 2000 to 2012, 72.5 percent were women, harassment of women. And what was being done and not done to stop it is a subject of the cover story of the \"Pacific-Standard\" magazine, entitled \"Why Women Aren`t Welcome on the Internet\". The author, Amanda Hess, is herself a victim of online stalking and harassment.</p><p>And her article includes -- or maybe survivor of it. Her article includes several of the specific attacks that she has received via social media. They are so gruesome and so vulgar that I`m nothing going to read them verbatim here. But they include threats of sexual assault and murder.</p><p>Amanda writes, \"No matter how hard we attempt to ignore it, this type of gender harassment and the sheer volume of it, a severe implication for women status on the Internet, threats of rape, death, and stalking can overpower our emotional bandwidth, take up our time and cost us money through legal fees, online protection services and missed wages.</p><p>Joining me today is Amanda Hess, contributor to \"Pacific-Standard\". Also here, Anthea Butler, professor of religious studies and graduate chair of religion at the University of Pennsylvania. Nancy Giles, contributor to \"CBS Sunday Morning.\" \"Feministe\" editor and \"Guardian\" columnist Gil Filipovic. And from San Francisco, Elon James White, managing director and host of \"This Week in Blackness.\"</p><p>So happy to have you all here.</p><p>NANCY GILES, CBS SUNDAY MORNING: Thank you.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: So, I want to talk to you about this article and the response you`ve been getting.</p><p>AMANDA HESS, CONTRIBUTOR, PACIFIC STANDARD: I wrote this article after I received my most recent sort of bouts this past summer and the threats were obviously distressing. It was an anonymous person on Twitter threatening to come to my house to rape me, to cut off my head.</p><p>On the one hand, that`s so completely ludicrous thing to say and that`s, you know, probably not going to happen. But on the other hand, it`s so confusing when you receive threats like that because people are telling you, don`t worry about it, it`s just the Internet, it`s not going to happen. Others are saying it`s your responsibility to track this person down and to prosecute them. And some people are saying if it`s so bad then why don`t you just quit Twitter.</p><p>And so, the threats are bad. What`s really confusing is how as person you`re supposed to deal with them.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes. You know, we were just talking about the gauntlet that women have to walk in order to receive termination services for pregnancy. And these are the gauntlets you have to walk on when you log onto the Internet, right? And does feel to me, like we have to keep making claim that what occurs online matters in the real world, like even if we were trying to think of the segment, I keep think there just are going to be people who feel like, turn it off. Don`t go over there, stop going over there in virtual world because that world does not matter.</p><p>Why does it matter?</p><p>JILL FILIPOVIC, EDITOR, FEMINISTE: Well, I think the big disconnect is exactly what you`re say and what Amanda`s piece highlighted, is that there is a sense, I think especially among law enforcement and U.S. laws, that what happens on the Internet is some sort of virtual reality, or as increasingly, we live our lives online. We see photos of our friends` babies on Facebook.</p><p>We interact on Twitter. I initially met Amanda online --</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p>FILIPOVIC: -- through Feministe blogging. You know, I followed you on Twitter before I ever met you on your show or meet you. So, we increasingly network online. My career is writing online. I don`t write for a newspaper. I write for a blog and for the \"Guardians\" Web site. You can`t tell us to just get off the Internet.</p><p>And when you have people coming into your online spaces, coming at you in Twitter and comments on your blogs, essentially telling you, you deserve to be sexually assaulted or even killed for what you`re saying, that`s just as intimidating as, you know, walking through a hallway at work and having somebody hiss at you through a doorway that you should be raped or killed.</p><p>I think that`s what people don`t necessarily fully appreciate about the lives that women live and what we receive online in terms of harassment.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Jill, your point is about us knowing one another initially virtually. It`s also true with my friendship with Elon.</p><p>I mean, Elon, you and I became actual sort of friends, colleagues, following one another`s work all in the virtual world before actually getting to know one another, and, you know, I was saying that part of my life is over. It so ugly in that world now that I just can`t engage in the ways that I initially engaged in social media that, in fact, led to valuable, you know, professional relationships because it is so ugly there.</p><p>Talk to me a little bit about how then you can begin to navigate something that is that ugly.</p><p>ELON JAMES WHITE, THIS WEEK IN BLACKNESS: I`m not exactly sure, especially with how women are spoken to. Even when they say, the whole thing about, oh, just don`t be there, it`s like that`s -- it`s a terrible idea because like for me personally, my entire career right now is based on the social media platforms that I`ve been using, that I use for my company, for the relationships I use. So, basically you`re telling women you`re not allowed to have that opportunity.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Right, exactly.</p><p>WHITE: And it`s unfair and it`s unreasonable. And when people say that, it`s literally just ignoring the reality of the world that we`re currently living in. And so, to actually try to navigate those things, a lot of people do things for their own mental health, like blocking people in a heartbeat. Just like, no, that`s just -- that`s not sometimes enough because if you go to an environment and you just know when you go into that environment, you`re going to be abused, whether it`s, quote/unquote, \"fake or not fake,\" it`s still abuse and you don`t want to do it.</p><p>Heck, these days, I don`t want to log onto Twitter, let alone if someone was threatening to rape me.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes, yes, absolutely.</p><p>Anthea, you have -- you have tweeted pretty honestly and openly about how these cyber bullies jump off the page, jump off, jump off the 140 characters of Facebook or the blog comments and show up in your real life, that it is part of the active attempt to destroy people`s credibility, their capacity to have jobs, that these have very real consequences.</p><p>BUTLER: Yes, they do. I can say to you that and you know this and a lot of other academics know this, that once you say something that somebody doesn`t like, they start calling them off. They call your provost`s office, they call your dean`s office. We want to get them off, you want to shut them up, we want to do all kinds of things.</p><p>But what they don`t seem to understand is that we are real life people. If they walk up to me and wanted to say this to my face, I`m like, come on, because basically, I`m like, I dare you. Because I bet you won`t say it to my face first of all, and second of all, the Penn University police will not let you get that close to me, OK? So, that`s part of it.</p><p>But the other part of it is that sometimes, this is very coordinated and I think one of the things we have to talk about are how other bloggers, other twitters, other people who are active in social media actually attack other people and there are sites and we all know this one by somebody who just got sold to Salem Communications and everybody knows who that is, who`d send people to come and attack you, when they don`t like what they do.</p><p>So, these are coordinated attacks. These are not just the random guys sit around his boxer shorts saying \"I hate this woman.\" But they are also coordinate. They are paid for. They are people who say let`s go do this to this person because we want to take them down.</p><p>And so, what I want people to understand, especially Twitter to understand, is that this service that was so great two or three years ago is now a cesspool of crap, and it`s so hard to use it the way we used to be able to use it, to talk and reduce it.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Right, right. So, I do want -- I do want to be careful that -- this isn`t exclusively a Twitter issue.</p><p>BUTLER: No.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: And that part of -- I think as we come back, we`ll talk a little bit about solutions in part because, again, I met Jill on Twitter, I met Elon on Twitter.</p><p>And not only that, but in a world where there is so much information, I use the signaling effort. I want to follow people I disagree with, I want to follow people I agree with, because it`s valuable to me to get that information. So, when I get back, we`ll talk a little bit about the solutions look like and whether or not we can redeem the value, right, all the positive values in this context.</p><p>(CXOMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: We`re back to talk about the \"Pacific Standard\" article, why women are not welcome on the Internet and sort of all the questions about online harassment, that it raises.</p><p>Nancy, I want to get you in here.</p><p>GILES: Well, you know, it`s so funny. I mean, among other things, I`m a woman, I love being a woman. It`s hard being a woman. It`s just hard, all right?</p><p>And CBS pays me because they value my opinions, which is lovely. And you have me on for the same reason. If your opinion isn`t something that matches up with people, I`ll say men for the most part because I can`t believe other women are saying the same kind of things back at us, the kind of sexual violent imagery, the kind of violent attacking on how you look, how you smell, these really vicious things that just are exponentially over the top and beyond the pale, it`s fascinating.</p><p>As a woman, I wouldn`t say something like that to a man that I disagreed with, but the vitriol, it`s just -- it`s astounding. It`s shocking.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: I found, when those moments happen and you`re suddenly being attacked, sometimes it`s the one person who is obsessing over you and you`re getting that. But sometimes it`s kind of broader sort of tidal waves of it.</p><p>And I find it to be very triggering. Find the very sense of -- that what we`re told to do is what rape survivors are often told do, which is don`t say anything because if you say anything, right, if you push back, then you are at risk for greater violence and you are at risk that the people you care and love about will be violated as well. So, if people jump in your defense, then they do will -- and so, you just feel like, oh, I`m going to go at this corner and hide, and that is that emotion of assault and of survival.</p><p>HESS: Yes. And that`s sort of the paradox of writing the story to begin with. But one of these sort of important things I think to come out of this, is that it should not be a problem that women are dealing with on their own. That there are legal institutions and there are technology companies that really sort of have a responsibility to make our communities safe for women.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Is this a Title 7 employment discrimination issue?</p><p>FILIPOVIC: I think it is. You know, the Internet is where many people work. It`s where we socialize. And when women are so unwelcomed and so harassed out of these spaces, it has a real impact on our livelihoods and our lives.</p><p>I mean, you know, it is very comparable to not letting, having, not letting someone have a seat at a diner, even thought it`s a private institution, you know? Or not letting a woman into a workplace even though it might be a private company.</p><p>These things, it is gender discrimination and it`s very, very harmful.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: So, Elon, help me through this for a second, because it feels to me like one possibility are a set of new policies, regulations and laws, but part one of what we love about the Internet is its relative freedom. It`s a kind of libertarian space.</p><p>But I also worried about just turning the rules of that space back on itself. So, like getting other kinds of gang violence online to mess with the gang violence and it`s occurring like that also feels unproductive to me. Are there ways to protect the liberty, protect, you know, questions of levels of anonymity that we care about, but also somehow make this space safer for people to engage?</p><p>WHITE: I believe so. And the fact is that the companies, the big tech companies have to take into consideration what people need for their own safety. Like, for example, with Google+, they weren`t allowing people to have an account without have -- unless they put their real name not acknowledging the fact that, you know what? Some people don`t want their real names out there, because they don`t want those attacks to possibly become real.</p><p>The tech companies have to actually start to look at how this is happening, what`s happening, and try to implement certain types of solutions that can actually allow for conversation because no one doesn`t want conversation, because that`s the first thing people want. Just want to stop free speech. Like no, everyone wants free speech but you know what? You`ve got to see what`s being said. And we`re talking around women.</p><p>And especially, let`s be honest here around women of color. They get the double dose of sexism and racism at the exact same time. So, they have to take those things into consideration and not just completely shut everything off, but constantly, constantly be looking for new and interesting ways that can allow for the conversation to happen. But at the same time, keep people safe.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes. With just 15 seconds left here, Amanda. I do want to point out, you made such a strong point that there is, that that anonymity question, often women who make their lives in public space are not anonymous online, are actual names and jobs and places and where we work and often where we live, are available. But the folks who are doing the stocking or the harassing are quite anonymous.</p><p>And it feels like there`s got to be something we can do to change that imbalance.</p><p>HESS: Right. I mean, one of the problems is that, you know, the people who are saying the Internet isn`t real, it`s very easy to say that if you`re hiding in your basement, threatening people, it`s easy to say that if you`re a police officer who doesn`t want to take a report. It`s a lot harder to say that if you`re a woman just trying to do her job on the Internet.</p><p>So, it`s difficult to know how to approach that. On the one hand, you know, police officers don`t have a lot of resources and information. Technology companies have all the resources in the world, and I think the problem that you`re seeing in both of those places is that they`re extremely male-dominated.</p><p>You know, we look to tech companies to innovate, to sort of bring us things that we never could have imagined and so I think we can ask them to bring us solutions on this problem as well.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Right. To address this asymmetry with the resources and intelligence and innovation that they have.</p><p>HESS: Right.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Amanda Hess, Anthea Butler, Nancy Giles, Jill Filipovic, and Elon James White -- who, of course, joined us virtually, just to prove the point that virtual relationships exist.</p><p>Up next, we`re going make a happy moment at the end of this show. The 12- year-old bow tie mogul making a difference in kids` lives. My foot soldier joins me live, and you`re not going want to miss it.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Skinny ties, white ties, Ascots bowties, silk knit ties, whatever the type of tie, men`s neck wear is usually reserved for special occasions and uniforms or the office. But our foot soldier this week is designing bowties that aid his community and make formal wear fashionable anywhere, even on the playground.</p><p>Twelve-year-old Mo Bridges launched his bowtie company, Mo`s Bows in 2011, after his great grandmother, a seamstress for 60 years, taught him how to sew. The sixth grader now uses his $80,000 company to sell one of a kind bowties and change the lives of other children in his community.</p><p>For the past three years, Mo has had one bowtie a year called the Go Mo Summer Camp Bowtie. Proceeds from the sale of that tie go to a scholarship fund that sends Memphis kids to summer camp, where, as Mo says, they not only get to have fun, they get to have a meal.</p><p>This week, Mo is launching the 2014 Go Mo scholarship bowtie.</p><p>Joining me now from Memphis, Tennessee, is the 12-year-old CEO of Mo`s Bows, Mo Bridges, and with him is his mother, and his words, monager, Tramica Morris (ph).</p><p>So, nice to have you with us.</p><p>TRAMICA BRIDGES, MO`S MOTHER: Hello. Thank you for having us.</p><p>MO BRIDGES, CEO, MO`S BOWS: Hey.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Hey, Mo. So tell me about the tie you`re wearing. Is that this year`s Go Mo bowtie?</p><p>M. BRIDGES: Yes, it is this year`s go mo bowtie. And I want to wish you a happy New Year and thank you for having me on your show.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Oh, thank you. I appreciate the happy New Year.</p><p>Now, tell me, so, you started this business at 9 years old. What made you decide to start a business?</p><p>M. BRIDGES: Well, I started business because I really like to dress up, and I couldn`t find any other bowties I really liked. So, I reached out to my grandmother and she showed me how to sew. After that, I wore my bow ties. When I was out, people would just say, hey, I like that bowtie. And that was the demand for my business.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Ms. Morris, whenever I see young people who are doing amazing things, almost always, there is an adult who actually listened to them and supported them. So when you have a 9-year-old coming to you and saying, first of all, I want to learn to sew, and I want to learn to sell - - how do you make that decision that this isn`t just a kind of side item, this is something to really support your child in?</p><p>T. BRIDGES: Well, actually, Melissa, the fact that Mo has always been -- when I allowed him to dress himself, he chose to wear a suit and tie. So, on a Saturday going to the grocery store, I am in flip flops and a dress or something. And Mo is in a complete suit.</p><p>So, I knew there was a sense of style and a sense of fashion early on. So I was not surprised when he said, hey, I want to start a business, and I want to sell ties. I thought that was just perfect for him.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Now, Mo, starting a business is one thing. And having a sense of fashion is one thing. But you also decided to start the summer camp scholarship.</p><p>That`s something else. What made you want to give back?</p><p>M. BRIDGES: Well, you know, Melissa, I figure, why not help a kid? Because kids are fun, and they`re cool. You just have to -- you have to be generous because -- and I also like to give back to my community at the same time.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: I love that. So what happens at that camp that is valuable? Why do you think of camp as an important place for kids to go?</p><p>M. BRIDGES: Well, I figured that if I went there, then other kids will like it, because I liked it. And, you know, it`s hot in Memphis and kids just need to go swimming and they need to be a kid.</p><p>And it`s also -- it`s also the highest at child hunger in Memphis. And -- because kids need a meal, and they don`t have a meal in summer, so I figured that if they go to summer camp, then they can have a meal.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: I love all of that.</p><p>One last thing I want to ask you. My grandmother was a seamstress. And my mother is wonderful at sewing. There`s such important parts.</p><p>Tell me about your relationship with your great grandmother. How has she inspired you?</p><p>M. BRIDGES: Well, my grandmother inspired me, because she -- she taught me how to sew, and she like -- she was -- she -- everybody will come to her and I used to grow up playing in her sewing room and I saw these really cool fabrics. And so I asked her how to teach me how to sew and she did.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Tramica Morris, I just want to thank you for being a mom who has stood up behind that young man and made sure he could be his full self, because he is pretty amazing.</p><p>T. BRIDGES: Thank you.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY: And thank you to Mo Bridges for that fashion style, for that sense of generosity and for that business acumen -- I can`t wait to see the multimillionaire magnate you`re going to become and the good you`re going to do in the world.</p><p>That`s our show for today. Thanks to you at home for watching. I`m going to see you tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>CeCe McDonald will join us for her first television interview since she was released from reason.

Plus, a major  development in the New Jersey Bridge scandal story and the 12-year-old  changing the world one bow tie at a time.  But first, on the battlefield of  politics, why you must sweat the small stuff.</p><p>Good morning.  I'm Melissa Harris-Perry.  This week we've got a little news  on an issue we've been covering here on MHP show for nearly two years.   This week in voter suppression and this week the news is actually kind of  good.  Thursday a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation that  would restore some of the protections in the Voting Rights Act that were  struck down by the Supreme Court last year.  And on Friday, a Pennsylvania  judge struck down that state's voter id law.  Saying it placed an  unreasonable burden on the fundamental right to vote.  Now, these are  small, but critical steps in the right direction.  Returning us to our  traditional value of expanding the franchise rather than limiting it.   Every vote matters.  Our nation's recent experiences remind us that even a  fraction of votes in a single location can have, well, history defining  effects on national elections.  So if you care who will occupy the White  House after 2016, you'd better pay attention to who holds offices in the  states, which means you'd better know a little something about the  communities that make those states up.  Case in point, North Carolina.</p><p>The political significance of the tar heels state was underscored this week  when President Obama visited to promote his efforts to boost the  manufacturing industry.  It was his first policy related trip of 2014.   Now, remember, North Carolina is a battleground state that by a razor's  edge margin went for President Obama in 2008 and then turned back to red in  2012.  In between, a political revolution happened in North Carolina.   Republicans won control of both houses of the state legislature.  For the  first time in 140 years.  And in 2012, the state elected a Republican  governor, giving one party control to the state.  Now, the state's laws are  among the most conservative in the country.  North Carolina has passed some  of the nation's most restrictive voting laws, which disproportionately  affect the poor and racial minorities, groups that traditionally vote  Democratic.  It cut unemployment benefits by as much that it was  disqualified from a federal compensation program for long term jobless  benefits. North Carolina eliminated its earned income tax credit,  essentially raising taxes on more than 900,000 households earning less than  $49,000 a year.  State lawmakers also passed a law that could close most of  North Carolina's 16 abortion clinics.  And the governor, Pat McCrory, he  signed the law despite his campaign promise not to approve any new abortion  restrictions.</p><p>But these changes did not start at the top of the political ticket.   Instead, they started at the bottom.  In 2009, in the Wake County School  board election, conservative board members were elected with the support of  multi-million air conservative and supermarket magnet Art Pope.  The new  board promptly eliminated a school bussing program, which had been lauded  as a model for school integration, and Pope's work on the school board  attracted national attention.  By 2010, he had the attention of the  conservative strategist Ed Gillespie.  Gillespie was working on his red map  plan, and putting state legislatures and their redistricting duties under  Republican control and Art Pope quickly became a key part of Gillespie's  efforts in North Carolina.  Pope, his family, and the groups backed by him  spent more than $2 million on General Assembly races in 2010, and of the 22  races Pope targeted Republicans won 18 and took control of the legislature.</p><p>Pope is now North Carolina's state budget director and Ed Gillespie  announced this week that he will challenge Virginia Democratic Senator Mark  Warner.  And this key player in the Republican takeover of North Carolina,  which has raised taxes on some of its poor citizens and cut unemployment  benefits, well, he's running on a platform.  You've just got to listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED GILLESPIE, VIRGINIA SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: If elected I'll be a servant  to the people of Virginia and a leader for policies that grow the middle  class and foster upward mobility, enabling people to lift themselves out of  poverty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  To be fair, Gillespie didn't himself cut unemployment or  passed voter restrictions in North Carolina.  But he did help orchestrate  the Republican takeover of the legislature that did.  And just as his  efforts began at the lower levels of American politics, so, too, has the  opposition to North Carolina's sharp rightward turn.  The grassroots \"Moral  Monday\" protests last year gained momentum every week as hundreds of  peaceful protesters were arrested for occupying the state legislature and  demanding an end to these particular conservative policies.  Their next big  rally is set for Raleigh, on February 8th.  And the movement is spreading.   Organizers from a dozen states traveled to Raleigh in December to learn how  to start their own \"Moral Mondays.\"  And this week, the first \"Moral  Monday\" in Georgia was held at the state capital in Atlanta where about 200  people urged the Republican governor there to expand Medicaid and on  Tuesday in South Carolina demonstrators carried a white coffin up the state  house steps to represent the people they say could die.  The state refuses  to expand Medicaid.  This is where the real progressive movement is going  to have to start.  I mean it can't come whole cloth from the populist mayor  of New York City or even from the tough on bank senator from Massachusetts.   It must take root among the people in places like Raleigh and Atlanta and  Columbia.</p><p>Joining me now is Representative Keith Ellison, Democratic congressman from  Minnesota, Anthea Butler, professor of religious studies at the University  of Pennsylvania, Nancy Giles, contributor to \"CBS Sunday Morning\" and a  writer and social commentator.  And Katon Dawson, a Republican consultant  and former chair of the South Carolina GOP.  Thanks to you all for being  here.</p><p>REP. KEITH ELLISON, (D) MINNESOTA:  Thank you.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  So, congressman, I want to start with you.  Because before  going to the U.S. House of Representatives you serve in your state  legislature .</p><p>ELLISON:  Sure.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  And you write about it in your book.  Talk to me about -- if  I'm an ordinary citizen living somewhere who doesn't normally watch cable  news politics, right?  How important is the state legislature versus this  federal levels?</p><p>ELLISON:  They define voter qualifications, so we have 50 or more different  ways to elect people.  So like in the last election in Minnesota, the  conservatives put on a valid measure that would require a photographic  identification card from the government, issued by the government before  anyone could vote.  And people said we could not possibly beat it, but we  did beat it and we beat it by a wide margin because we organized and talked  to people on the grassroots and we had a multitude of arguments.  We said  it cost too much, it was unwieldy.  We said it didn't have any factual  basis, because there was no voter and posture voting .</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:   Right.</p><p>ELLISON:  Going on.  And - but we cobbled all of those logical arguments  together and we came up with a winning coalition.  So let me tell you.  At  the state level, that's where the action is when it comes to who gets to  vote and who doesn't from voter - from disenfranchisement, voter I.D.,  access to voter polls, to the number of machines, the state is what's  happening.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Right.  And this - and that point, Anthea, I want to pick up  on in part because I think it felt for many - you know, for many again,  ordinary folks living their lives, balancing their checkbooks, driving  their kids to school it felt like all of a sudden in 2010 there was this  Republican takeover, this wave, that came out of nowhere.  But it didn't  come out of nowhere, right?  It had been built off from like door-catchers  to the Senate at that point.</p><p>ANTHEA BUTLER, PROF., UNIV. OF PENNSYLVANIA:  Exactly.  And what people  don't realize as this probably - almost I would say maybe almost a 50-year  history of people being put in the school board, the mayor's office.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>BUTLER:  The state legislature, and, you know right wing conservatives  being asked to run not just because of political duty, but of religious  duty and we'll get to that when we talk about reproductive rights.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>BUTLER:  But in this particular case, when you have conservatives who are  motivated, on the liberal side everybody thought, we'll just go out and  we'll vote and we'll have an occasional candidate and that's really great.   But what they haven't thought about is the structural issues that make it  very important that you have to be in every place in government.  All  politics is local.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BUTLER:  And it is very true.  All of this starts at a local level.  And by  the time you get to the national level, these states' rights issues, the  kinds of things that make these structures happen have already come out of  people's hands and they go what just happened.  You know, and I'm sure  everybody in North Carolina is saying the same thing.  </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  How does this happen?  So, Katon, it does seem to be the  part of the answer, though, to what happened in North Carolina.  I mean,  you know, I'd love to just point to Art Pope and say it's all his fault and  his big money.  But part of it - takeover was possible in part, because the  Democratic Party in North Carolina was vulnerable, right, to this kind of  takeover to these challenges.  It seems to me that you all do a really good  job of being profoundly organized on one message.  How do you guys do that?   Do you have like internal memos at the meetings?  Is there a hash tag?   What is going on with you guys?</p><p>KATON DAWSON, REPUBICAN CONSULTANT:  It started years and years ago when  the Democrats controlled both South Carolina and North Carolina and you -  when I was - in the state houses, and South Carolina's 16 years ahead of  North Carolina as far as taking over the bodies.  So, we .</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Taking over the bodies indeed.</p><p>DAWSON:  We'll get into that later.  But when I was chairman, we didn't  have full majority, so I went after sheriff's races and changed nine  sheriffs from Democrats to Republican .</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Right.</p><p>DAWSON:  And then with that you go to solicitors. Solicitor named Trey  Gowdy who became a U.S. congressman.</p><p>ELLISON:  That's my colleague.</p><p>DAWSON:  Your colleague.  So, when you look at the foreign team, a lot of  people think these candidates should show up.  From my standpoint, you get  them on record early.  You find out where they are and you start electing  them, and in the south, the pro-life movement is the base of a lot of these  elections, it did, and it's a proud base that I'm with, but what I'm  telling you is that - right.  You don't just show up.  Politics doesn't  change overnight.  Art Pope's $2 million didn't change that.  What really  changed North Carolina was an influx of people and retires.  Conservative.   That's one of the things that changed it.  The second thing changed was  national Democrat politics were not matching up.  I ran the last cycle in  North Carolina when President Obama had about 42 bricks and mortars in  there and we put about 450 people in there fighting that fight, and what we  found out in North Carolina was it was different.  As everybody was working  persuadable voters.  It was the Republican base we had to go the last three  weeks to, and we had to go, because they were sitting on the sidelines.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  OK.  So I love that you said we split sheriffs and the next  thing you know we're flipping whole state bodies, right?  Because, you  know, those are those low information elections where 100 people, 200  people can make all the difference in who becomes your sheriff in New  Orleans.  We vote on the coroner, God help us.  I know.  But - I know, it  is.  There's a lot to be said about that, right?  It's a Southern thing.  I  do want to look, though, at the Medicaid gap, right?  Because you talked  about who can be persuaded, right?  And in Georgia there are more than  400,000 people who would have gotten Medicaid in North Carolina, more than  300,000 people.  In South Carolina, nearly 200,000 people.  And that looks  to me like a group of people who are not getting Medicaid, who could have  gotten it, if, in fact, their governors had been willing to extend it.  If  I'm a Democrat sitting in those states, I start thinking about how I start  flipping it based on that. </p><p>NANCY GILES, CONTRIBUTOR, \"CBS SUNDAY MORNING\":  Exactly.  And we were  talking about this in the green room.  People voting against their own  interests.  And I can't underscore enough what's been said at the table as  someone who considers herself bright, college educated and never really  paid much attention to the smaller votes.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>GILES:  You know, the school board, you know.  I don't have children, so I  wouldn't have really think about that.  The local votes.  And I know so  many people who maybe will pay more attention if it's a mayoral vote.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Sure.</p><p>GILES:  Or if it's a Senate vote or presidential campaign, but we've got to  get boots on the ground just like you're an evil genius.  </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yes, yes.</p><p>GILES:  I want to incorporate everything that's being said.  We've got to  make sure the people know that the stakes are high.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Stick with me.  OK, we'll let your polite southern evil  genius reign when we get back.  We're going to take a break right now.  And  while we go to break we're going to be listening to music inspired by the  \"Moral Monday\" protests.  This is \"My Body Politics\" by the North Carolina  Music Love Army.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Six months ago the Supreme Court struck down a key part of  the Voting Rights Act.  The court took issue specifically with the formula  for determining, which states and jurisdictions have such problematic  history on voting rights that they need his federal approval for any  changes to their voting laws before they go into effect.  The justices had  said the formula was outdated and invited Congress to create a new one.   Now, for the first time since the ruling a bipartisan group of lawmakers  has an actual proposal.  And the bill was introduced Thursday by Senator  Patrick Leahy and Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner and Congressman John  Conyers, and co-sponsored by Congressman and civil rights leader John  Lewis.  Under the bill, states that have had five or more violations of  federal voting laws in the past 15 years will need preclearance from the  Feds before changing local voting rules.  Currently that would cover  Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.  Five fewer states then were  previously fully covered.  And local jurisdiction would need the  preclearance if they had three violations in the past 15 years or if they  had persistent extremely low minority turnout over that time.  The bill  would also make it easier to get a preliminary injunction to brock a  problematic law pending trial.  One caveat, though.  The bill specifically  exempts voter I.D. laws saying such requirements are not a violation of the  Voting Rights Act and at this point, it does not cover North Carolina,  which has some of the most restrictive voting laws in the country. </p><p>So, Anthea, this is like one of those good news/bad news stories.</p><p>BUTLER:  Yeah.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Where, OK, bipartisan, looks like we might get a new  formula, we don't just have to walk around with a two slid section five  forever, but it also gives away the ghost with the notion that I.D. is  inherently not part of the VRA problem.</p><p>BUTLER:  I know.  And that's really - what it does is it leaves it up to  state judges and things like that.  That what just happened in Pennsylvania  with Governor Corbett having a bad day yesterday finding out that, you  know, we won't have to use our voter I.D.  But I am thinking about states  like Texas where, you know, voter I.D., you can use your gun permit, you  can use your concealed carry permit to get .</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  But not your student ..</p><p>BUTLER:  But not your student I.D. card, right?  So what kind of sense does  that make?  So, I'm hopeful that this will, you know, help bridge a little  bit of a gap.  Because I see Texas is almost being the worst in that bunch  for a lot of respects, but they're all equally bad, but the question is,  can we find enough consensus to have that voted upon in the House?</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>BUTLER:  And that's where I'm worried about it.  Because if we don't, I  think that what we're going to see in 2014 is a lot more people being taken  off the rolls and this won't get fixed, you know, by November '14, which  will make it very problematic.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  So, and Katon, this is precisely where I want to come with  you, then.  Because I love the story that you tell about we have good  strategy, we've got demographic changes, we go get those voters, we pound  the pavement.  If that is what -- if that's the issue, then I would be like  well, God bless the Republicans because if people agree with you and you  get your voters out.</p><p>DAWSON:  You get one more than they do.  </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Right.  Then that's what democracy is.  But then this is  something different.  Because this isn't about we go convince the voters to  be on our side.  This is we suppress the voters most likely to choose the  other side and that to me doesn't feel like it's healthy for democracy.</p><p>DAWSON:  Well, the arguments are going to go on, the courts are going to  continue.  Some states are going to do, others - some laws are going to be  more egregious than others, but it's going to get down to the voter I.D.  again, whether it's right or not.  And whether the citizens in the states -  will there be protests on the streets?  There's some.  But, again, it takes  a voter I.D. to get in about everywhere.  And that's where I think  sometimes the argument gets lost.  It took me one to get in here.  Four  times - to get in ..</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  But you don't have a constitutional right to be in here.</p><p>DAWSON:  Well, I don't.  You invited me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DAWSON:  Thank you.  You are exactly right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DAWSON:  Or you could turn me away.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yeah.  No.  Right.  I mean - right, nor do I.  But - and  yet, Congressman, I guess the other point is - I actually also don't have a  constitutional right to vote.  In that it is state by state, right?  And so  what I'm wondering, given your point that there are at least 50 separate  and unequal rules and procedures for voting, is it time, congressman, to  have a -- an amendment to the U.S. Constitution providing at the federal  level the right to vote for every citizen and wipe this mess away?</p><p>ELLISON:  Yes.  And Mark Pocan who's from Wisconsin and I have a bill to  make the right to vote a constitutional amendment and we're moving it as  well as we can, and I think it only makes sense because we really don't  live in the kind of country that was -- we had when we put this voting  scheme together.  Things have changed in the amount of just inequality and  disparity and the way people are treated is just so wide - that it's just  not fair.  And so, it's time to amend the constitution and grant a right to  vote to all citizens.  But I will say this.  You know.  Grassroots activism  really is the key here.  </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yes.  </p><p>ELLISON:  And people getting involved like \"Moral Mondays\" and it's  spreading.  You know, in Wisconsin people were out on the streets.  In  Minnesota we get things on the street.  I think this is good for democracy  and I'm excited about it.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  OK.  And you took us exactly where we are going next,  because when we come back, I've got somebody from \"Moral Mondays\" right  here, because up next, the trouble in district 12 that not even Katniss can  fix.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Welcome back.  You know, district 12 just can't catch a  break.  No, no, no, not that district 12.  This district 12.  North  Carolina's 12TH congressional district.  Last weekend we told you about the  decision by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory to hold off on filling the  12th district seat just vacated by Mel Watt who's now heading a Federal  Housing Agency until the general election in November, so that leaves the  seat in a solidly democratic majority and minority district without a  representative for almost a year.  Governor McCrory was asked about his  decision Wednesday during an interview with a host of MSNBC's \"The Daily  Rundown\" Chuck Todd. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK TODD, MSNBC ANCHOR:  I know people have a low opinion of Congress,  but to have basically to disenfranchise nearly a million people and not  having a representation in the U.S. House of Representatives, that is not a  healthy thing for a year.</p><p>GOV. PAT MCCRORY (R ), NORTH CAROLINA:  Well, Chuck, I'm sworn to uphold  the constitutional laws of North Carolina and I can't change those laws  between now and that election, and, again, I have to uphold the election  laws and I made the good decision. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Joining us now from Washington, D.C. is the Reverend William  Barber, president of the North Carolina NAACP and leader of the \"Moral  Mondays\" movement which has been protesting among other things North  Carolina's voter restrictions and who also sent a letter to Governor  McCrory about this question of District 12.  Reverend Barber, thank you for  being here.</p><p>REV. WILLIAM BARBER, NAACP NATIONAL BOARD MEMBER:  Thank you so much, Dr.  Perry.  You know, it's utterly ridiculous the government says about the  law, the fact of the matter is we have the people who can get together and  actually comply with the law, you know.  Representative Price,  Representative Butterfield actually wrote the governor and said we can do  better than this.  700,000 people, Republicans, Democrats, black and white,  will be left without a representative.  It's just wrong.  Over 300 days in  a time when the Congress will be dealing with the VRA bill, you know, farm  bills, all the things that impact that particular district.  And, you know,  it took us 90 years, Melissa, from 1900 to 1990 to even get representation  in the African American community.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yeah, I mean it's a crazy little district.  You know, it's  worth looking at it again.  Congressman Ellis (ph) was sitting here at the  table and when he saw how gerrymandered that district was.</p><p>BARBER:  Right.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  His mouth kind of fell open.  And, of course, we know  district 12 was challenged on racial gerrymandering, was redrawn to be a  clearly part of then gerrymandered districts, which is legal and  constitutional, but that said, you know, I guess I'm wondering, Reverend  Barber, if I went down today to a barbershop in Greensboro and asked  people, you know, do you know that you live in district 12 and do you know  that you are not going to have a representative, what would they say about  that?</p><p>BARBER:  Well, people are livid about it.  I mean, they really are, because  they recognize that this is taxation without representation.  Now, the  other part of that, Melissa, is that if we had free clearance in place,  this decision of the governor would have to be pre-cleared.  The fact is  now that we don't because we're looking for this reauthorization of section  four, it makes this even more problematic.  The Republicans stalled on  Mayor Watt being appointed and now governor McCrory is again being the  governor of denial.  He has denied Medicaid, denied unemployment, he's  tried to deny voting rights and now he's trying to deny representation tor  this district.  </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Hold on one second.  I want to come out to you, Nancy,  because you're having this reaction.</p><p>GILES:  I feel sick.  </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yeah.  That feels to me like the kind of every woman, every  man reaction, must be when they hear this story.  So, tell me what you're  thinking of this?</p><p>GILES:  Number one, how can the governor just say no with a little laugh in  his voice, yeah, I'm complying with the law and not have a representative  for that - for that area, for so many people, how is that allowed?  I mean,  again, I tell you one thing that's really interesting about this president  because a lot of it filters down from that.  I have learned more about how  the government works on the lower, lower, lower, local, local levels than I  have ever learned before and I'm just shocked that this many people cannot  have a representative at such a crucial time for people to be represented. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Let's listen.  Because I want to listen to this.  Because  Governor McCrory said it wasn't a particularly crucial time.  He said it's  a couple of months and it doesn't make any difference.  Let's take a listen  to that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. MCCRORY:  My decision was even supported by the very liberal editorial  page of the Charlotte \"Observer\" and it was also supported by three of the  African-American Democratic candidates that are running for Mel Watt's  seat.</p><p>I think the only difference in any other option was about two months.  And  Chuck, you know and I know that not much goes on in Washington between July  and the election anyway, which is a sad commentary on Washington politics.</p><p>TODD:  I know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Representative Ellison, you'll be doing anything there  between July and November?</p><p>ELLISON:  I think we'll be pretty busy.  We've been busy every single year.   I've been in Congress.  And here's the other thing.  Just being in  Washington and voting is not the only thing members of Congress do.  Being  in the district, listening to people, talking to them, holding meetings,  talking about, you know, we're doing constituent services, helping people  get passports and Social Security checks and VHS.  It's all critical.  This  is one of the more amazing abdications of responsibility I've ever seen.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Well, I will say in terms of not abdicating responsibility,  Mel Watt's team is staying in place in that district office to do some of  that constituent service, because they clearly do care about that, but  Reverend Barber, let me ask you about the other part of it we heard  Governor McCrory say when he says hey, three of the six North Carolina 12  Democratic candidates, all of them African American, are down with the  November election.  We checked.  That does seem to be true.  Why would  those candidates support this timing?</p><p>BARBER:  Well, that's why in the NAACP we have no permanent - there is no  permanent enemies on the permanent interest.  It doesn't matter if someone  wants to, you know, even stay in bondage.  All of us don't want to stay in  bondage.  What we want is constitutional representation.  So that doesn't  matter.  He's called to govern for the best interest of the people, not to  pick out two or three people and then decide to implement something that's  going to cause taxation without representation.  Melissa, here we are in  North Carolina.  He is denying this.  We have the worst redistricting law  since the 19th century.  He passed the worst voters oppression law that  we've seen since Jim Crow and now we are in the middle of this discussion  about section 4 that's actually going to leave North Carolina uncovered,  South Carolina uncovered, Alabama uncovered.  These actions are  unacceptable.  This - we happen to have an amendment.  It's sad that one  day after the actual birthday of Dr. King we're having a discussion about  voting rights that have taken us backwards add not forward.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  And particularly, I mean I just want to point out again for  folks who may not know the North Carolina map.  That district in part runs  through Greensboro.  Greensboro is where we saw those initial sit-ins of  African-American men from North Carolina ANT sitting there on those  Woolworth's counters, challenging precisely this sort of things.  This was  ground zero on the civil rights movement.  It is ground zero now.</p><p>BARBER:  Franklin Graham - Franklin McCain was buried just yesterday who  was a part of those civil rights movements.  This district and the first  district are the districts that were carved out as a result of the Voting  Rights Act, but it took 90 years.  I want people to hear this.  90 years  for North Carolina to get representation African Americans in the U.S.  Congress after George White was the last one pushed out in 1901 at the end  of reconstruction.  That's why we've got to be very serious.  And you keep  hearing me push on this issue about this section for the voter rights and  what's been proposed.  It is not good for us.  We have to - anything that  does not cover, pre-clear North Carolina, Alabama, Virginia and South  Carolina, anything that gives people five chances to violate the law before  we can be pre-cleared and anything that undermines the voter - says that  voter I.D. is not a part of what can be used to decide pre-clear is just  wrong, it's backwards.  And we've got to spend .</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  That's not enough.  I'll tell you what, Reverend Barber.   I've got a little time on Tuesday.  I think I'm going to come down to North  Carolina and say hey to you.  All right.  Rev. Barber, thank you so much.   We have much more to get to this morning, including Congressman Ellison's  new memoirs.  But first when we come back, my colleague Steve Kornacki, he  has a major development in the New Jersey bridge story.  Local politics  matter, people.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  This morning we have new reporting connected to the  administration of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and it's a story that  broke right here on MSNBC only hours ago on \"Up with Steve Kornacki.\"  The  mayor of Hoboken told Steve in an exclusive television interview why she  believes her city is being denied critical Hurricane Sandy aid.  Now, you  remember that the city of Hoboken in the aftermath of the storm was 80  percent under water.  Hoboken remains vulnerable to another storm and the  mayor says the reason her city is not getting the funds it needs has  nothing to do with the fact that she didn't endorse Chris Christie for  reelection.  Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer says members of Christie's  administration warned her that her town would be starved of hurricane  relief money unless she approved a lucrative redevelopment plan favored by  the governor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAWN ZIMMER, MAYOR OF HOBOKEN:  The bottom line is, it's not fair for the  governor to hold Sandy funds hostage for the city of Hoboken, because he  wants me to give back to one private developer and it's important that -- I  know it's very complicated for the public to really understand all of this,  but I have a legal obligation to follow the law, to bring balanced  development to Hoboken.  I cannot give a windfall to one property owner  because the governor wants me to in exchange for the Sandy fund, so I'll  tell you, I feel like I'm literally between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  We should note that a spokesman for Governor Christie issued  this statement.  Quote, \"Mayor Zimmer has been effusive in her public  praise of the governor's office and the assistance we've provided in terms  of economic development and Sandy aid.  What or who is driving her only now  to say such outlandishly false things is anyone's guess.\"  And \"Up with  Steve Kornacki\" received this statement from the director of strategic  communications with the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs.  She  say, quote, \"Mayor Zimmer's allegation that on May 16th, 2013 Commissioner  Constable conditioned Hoboken's receipt of Sandy aid on her moving forward  with a development project is categorically false.\"  Joining the table now  is Steve Kornacki, host of \"Up with Steve Kornacki.\"  All right, Steve,  these are major claims.  It's also very complicated.  So, I tried to get a  general idea of it.  What do you see as the key issue in this moment?</p><p>STEVE KORNACKI, MSNBC ANCHOR:  So, there are several things and the story  line itself connects high ranking people in Christie's administration.  It  connects the Port Authority and the law firm that is run by the chairman of  the Port Authority, David Samson, and Chris Christie's, you know, close  confidant David Samson.  And so, basically, what happened was, there's this  plot of the land in Hoboken that's right for - potentially right for some  kind of development.  This group, the Rockefeller Group owns it and they're  represented by Wolff and Samsons.  The name of law firm is David Samson's  law firm.  He's the chairman of the Port Authority.  Port Authority paid  for a study on redeveloping on whether this land should be declared, you  know, an area need a redevelopment -- it's a developer's dream to get this  designation.  </p><p>The planning board in Hoboken did not go along with that designation, and  when that happened, the mayor of Hoboken got a phone call from the  governor's office, saying Lieutenant Governor is going to be in town in a  couple of days.  He wants to do an event sharp right with you.  So they did  the event at the sharp right, hey, business is open, posting - she says  lieutenant governor pulled her aside after said and said, listen, this is  not right, this is not the way it's supposed to be.  But if you want your  Sandy aid, all (inaudible) is being held, but if you want it, you have to  move forward on this development project.  You have to move forward on it.  </p><p>A couple of days later, she's doing this event, the mayor is doing this  event on public television at Monmouth University, a Sandy anniversary  event, and the Department - or the commissioner of the Department of  Community Affairs, you saw her quoted there, is on stage next to her.  And  she says they're both miked up, they're waiting to go on and he makes the  same explicit threat to her, linking Sandy funds to this development  project.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  OK, so a couple of things I want to be sure that we get on  the table here.  There's not at this point any allegation that the  Rockefeller Group itself has been -- they just seem to be part of this, but  not that they commissioned anyone to say this or to do this.  Is that  right?</p><p>KORNACKI:  That's right.  And in terms of what you have, there's no  evidence pointing to like any kind of wrongdoing right now by like David  Samson.  What we know is his law firm represents the Rockefeller group.   You have - we have emails from people of his law firm copying Davis Samson,  the chairman of the Port Authority, and writing to the people in Hoboken  trying to apply pressure to get this thing moving on, you know.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  No, obviously this mayor is now going to come under - Mayor  Zimmer is going to come under significant scrutiny about whether or not  there are reasons beyond just sort of her saying in this moment, look, I'm  trying to do what is right.   Right?  In part because this is occurring at  the time that the bridge scandal has become national news.  But this is not  linked directly to the bridge scandal.  So, folks are going to ask, why  talk about this now, why not tell it when it happened.  How do you see this  proceeding in terms of the fundamental questions that are going to be asked  of her on what she's alleging here?</p><p>KORNACKI:  I have to say just as we're reviewing the story this week that I  find her very credible for a few reasons.  And one of the reasons is, I  think people looking at this nationally might be inclined to say it's a  Democratic mayor, Republican governor, he's down.  Oh, of course, this is  Democratic way doing a pile on.  There's been - there's a faction of  Democrats in New Jersey who are pro Chris Christie Democrats.  And Dawn  Zimmer in many ways was the face of the pro-Chris Christie Democrats.  When  she came to office in Hoboken, she endorsed his local property tax  initiative.  This is controversial among Democrats.  His first town hall  meeting on the subject, she invited him to Hoboken to have it.  He was her  partner in many ways on many projects in Hoboken.  She continues to this  day.  </p><p>On our show, we asked her about Chris Christie, she believes his first four  years as governor, there were a lot of good things.  She believes that were  accomplished during that.  It's just that she got caught up in this  redevelopment issue.  It was on opposite side of him, and it's apparently,  this project was apparently so important to him and then there's the fact  of this diary.  I mean she recorded this in her diary at the time.  She  shared the diary with us.  And, you've got, you know, mundane entries in  the diary and then she's talking, just pouring her heart out about trying  to grapple with the Chris Christie she believed in versus the Chris  Christie who's now making - his administration making threats.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Can you stay with us?  We've got a table of folks here  including a Republican who I want to ask in part does this ever get hot  enough that Republicans are going to want Chris Christie to step down as  the head of RGA?  I also want to just sort of open up, because these are  new revelations, and I think there are questions that all of us have about  it.  So, stick with us for just a little bit longer.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  We're back and talking about the new developments in the  question of Chris Christie and his use of - potentially use of political  influence that were alleged today on \"Up with Steve Kornacki.\"  And I just  wanted to give you all an opportunity to ask Steve some of the question  about what we've learned.</p><p>GILES:  Well, to start with, Steve, I've lived in (INAUDIBLE).  I've been  here 13 years, which is the neighboring county to Hoboken.  So, I know and  I have a lot of friends that live there how damaged they were during Sandy  and how they're still struggling, so I guess I would say is that do you  think why Dawn Zimmer comes out now and talks about the disparity between  the money that she asks for and the money that she got?  The town is still  suffering.</p><p>KORNACKI:  Yeah, I mean, look, there's one last chance, realistically  speaking now.  That Christie got a second pot of money from HUD, that he  can get out in grants, but there's one realistic last chance for Hoboken to  get the money that it's looking for to save itself from a future storm and  it comes from this sort of a race to the top style competition that HUD  has.  And Hoboken is a finalist thread, there were one of ten finalists for  that, so it may be that, you know, this attracts a little bit of attention  to it.  Because we didn't have time on the air, but they took me through  off the air.  The resiliency planning that they've done, you know, she  actually - she sits on - she was appointed by President Obama to his  climate change panel at the end of December.  She has spoken around the  world on resiliency issues.  They have some topnotch, you know,  internationally respected resiliency work and proposals the place.</p><p>GILES:  Right.</p><p>KORNACKI:  So they are hopefully they can get this grant.</p><p>ELLISON:  Let me ask you about political resiliency.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>ELLISON:  So after the news broke on the bridge thing, he comes and does  this long press conference and everybody's thinking, wow, maybe he's going  to survive this.  Can he survive this?</p><p>KORNACKI:  Well, this is - we talk about like hardball politics in New  Jersey, and, you know, that governor, whoever was going to take what  leverage here she has and they are going to use it to get what they want.   And people kind of accept that, but this is Sandy.  This is Sandy.  This is  a governor who part of his political rehab this past week, goes down to the  shore.</p><p>ELLISON:  That's right.</p><p>KORNACKI:  Goes down to the Sandy towns and he's like - hey, everybody.  Do  you remember me?  I'm the guy who led you through Sandy.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  And we're all willing to put up with varieties of kind of  corruption.  I mean that's, you know, I've lived in Chicago, I've lived now  in New Orleans, right?  There is this like - when Blagojevich appear to be  selling a Senate seat that was, right, kind of the end of it and you know  we will send the governor in Louisiana to jail.  Like I mean so corruption  and hardball politics is one thing, but like when you get to a certain  level, and these are all still allegations at this point, but they do seem  potentially harmful in a way to me, Katon, that I mean this is the man  who's the head of the RGA.  And it's going to come to a point where he's  going to get a phone call saying you've been the head of the RGA.  It's bad  for us.</p><p>GILES:  Republican Governors Association?</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Oh, sorry, Republican Governors Association.</p><p>DAWSON:  Well, one thing I can tell you about Republican Party politics and  especially presidential primary politics, and go back to Mark Sanford  meeting his fair, apologizing and immediately resigning from the RGA.  He  didn't want his personal situation to impact what is to me the most  important thing in politics.  Much more important the last thing than  presidential politics or governor seats.  That's where redistricting  happens, that's where rubber meets the road.  That's where we govern as  Republicans, the 157 million Americans who control in GOP controlled  states.  We don't control .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  I'm frightened.</p><p>DAWSON:  But you should be, but my part - my part is this apology -- and I  talked to Steve.  I've listened to other people thinking this is Jersey,  this is the Jersey shore.  The Republicans did watch him call the president  in the end, which we saw was very unusual in the middle of a presidential  race.  We saw that as cementing his re-election.  That's what - that's how  I saw it.  We're going to go and cement.  So my point is, you know, this is  one more shoe to drop on this.  And you can apologize, but you can't cover  up the fact that if you didn't tell the truth and that's what's coming  next.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Steve, this has been amazing reporting.  These are real  issues.  This is not like made up sort of outrage and so I appreciate your  reporting and that of your team.  Thank you to Steve Kornacki.  Your team  are delivering great reporting on this.  And up next, what I found so  moving about this book by Congressman Ellison.  For all the bad we've been  saying there's a lot of optimism about America in this book.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Congressman Keith Ellison's mom is from Louisiana.  And she  makes gumbo.  And on nights when young Keith would bring friends for  dinner, his mother never turned anyone away.  Instead she'd just some water  to the gumbo so that there would be enough for all.  Today, Representative  Keith Ellison says we need to do the same thing in our national policy.   Rather than turn the hungry away, we need to add some water to the gumbo  and practice what he calls the politics of generosity.  Now, in his new  book called \"My Country to the V:  My Faith, My Family, Our Future, \"  Ellison shares his story from his Detroit roots to being the first non- white person Minnesota has ever elected to Congress, and the first Muslim  American ever elected to Congress.  He also outlines what the politics of  generosity look like.  So Representative Keith Ellison, tell me what are  the politics of generosity?  What does it look like?</p><p>ELLISON:  Well, the politics of generosity stem from the idea that we all  need to eat, we all need to retire, we all want to see our kids get a good  education and develop our minds.  Our country is the richest country in the  history of the world and this country has never been richer than it is now.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yeah.</p><p>ELLISON:  We can make sure that there is a reliable path toward economic  security for every American.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  There literally is enough gumbo in the pot for everybody.</p><p>ELLISON:  There's enough.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  We just have got to share it.</p><p>ELLISON:  We don't have to send anybody out.  And the thing is, is that we  have a politics of scarcity and the politics of scarcity is there's not  enough, we have got to cut Head Start, we've got to have chained CPI, so  this - because the seniors are getting too much money.  But this is all  driven by the idea that there's not enough, but I believe that there is  enough.  And, as a matter of fact, there is enough.  And the only question  is shall we share it.  So like, you know, this issue of low wages and the  minimum wage, we've seen dramatic profits being reaped from our nation's  corporations, in McDonald's, Walmart.  These are wildly profitable  companies and yet they are paying people $7.25.  $8.25.  Stuff like that.   It's like look, you know, you may not have as massive a profit as you had.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yeah.</p><p>ELLISON:  But maybe if the people who work for you could, you know, afford  the hamburgers that they are cooking.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yeah.  It would stimulate the economy.  We know that when  poor folks have a little bit more, they spend it and it stimulates the  economy.  In addition to our politics of generosity.  You also outlined the  politics of courage.  And specifically look to Representative Barbara Lee.   And I'd like to listen to the moment that you signal us to here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BARBARA LEE (D) CALIFORNIA:  September 11th changed the world.  Our  deepest fears now haunt us.  Yet I am convinced that military action will  not prevent further acts of international terrorism against the United  States.  Some of us must say let's step back for a moment, let's just  pause, just for a minute, and think through the implications of our actions  today so that this does not spiral out of control.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Your response is there.</p><p>ELLISON:  Well, it spiraled out of control a little bit, didn't it?</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yep. ELLISON:  You know, I mean Iraq, longest - you know, longer than Vietnam.   All kinds of domestic issues were unraveling, these NSA issues to this  moment that stem from the Patriot Act, which was sparked by that tragic  moment in September 11, 2001.  I think Barbara Lee is an amazing example of  courage.  Because you can listen to that tape.  And tell she's scared.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  She can feel it.</p><p>ELLISON:  You can feel it, because if you've had the pleasure of being in  her presence, you know, she's bold, she's always got a wonderful smile, but  in that moment she is feeling the weak of the moment, but she -- that's  courage, right?  Courage isn't not being scared.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>ELLISON:  It's moving through your fear and Barbara Lee, Paul Wellstone,  you know, these people, you know, they inspire me, you know, and that's who  I want to be like when I grow up. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  We're basically out of time, but I don't want to leave  without pointing to a moment of courage of your own.  Part of what that  post-9/11 and the spiraling out of control Iraq was also the - the kind of  generation of an anti-Muslim bias in the country.</p><p>ELLISON:  Yes.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  that was articulated more frequently and yet you in the  moment of being sworn into the U.S. Congress put your hand on Thomas  Jefferson's Koran, which I see as an act of courage and the reaffirmation  of the faith of the American people that we can have differing faith and be  one people.</p><p>ELLISON:  Yeah, I mean that's the idea - from many to one.  E Pluribus  Unum, we are united in our belief that all Americans have due process, have  the right, have equal dignity and yet we come from very diverse places and  it's all right.  You know, the bottom line is that nothing - none of the  great things about America are guaranteed.  We have to fight for these  things.  People have laid their lives on the line for them.  And if you  look at the reverend down there with the \"Moral Mondays\", they're laying  their life on the line for the great America now.  All I want to say -- I  know we've got to wrap is that look, you know, the pessimists are not the  realists.  Because good things happen all the time.  We were in slavery,  now we're not.  We were in Jim Crow, now we are not.  Women couldn't vote.   Now they can.  My point is the people of this time have got to buck up and  make a better world for the people to come.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Because the better always happens, but it only happens.</p><p>ELLISON:  Only happens.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  through struggle.</p><p>ELLISON:  That's it.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  To read an excerpt of the congressman's new book please stop  by the Grio.com.  Congressman Keith Ellison, thank you for spending time  with us this morning.</p><p>ELLISON:  Thanks.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  And coming up next, turning the tide on reproductive rights,  how women are fighting back against the mounting restrictions and the frank  discussion about the ugly and even threatening harassment that someone is  faced online.  There's, of course, more Nerdland at the top of the hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  (AUDIO GAP) Melissa Harris-Perry.</p><p>Nerdland, I know that as nerds, we would rather be lovers and thinker, not  fighters.  But today, I want us to channel our inner Sun Tzu, because I  want to talk about \"The Art of War\".</p><p>Now, make no mistake -- the reproductive health policies we have seen  emerge from statehouses all across the country amount to nothing short of  an all-out assault to take back the gains made by Roe v. Wade. </p><p>This is no brute force, smash and grab operation we're talking about it  here.  Uh-uh.  This is an efficient, methodical and so far, highly  effective effort to a road of reproductive choice protections guaranteed to  women by the Supreme Court's decision in Roe.</p><p>In an article in this month's \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, the president of  the anti-reproductive rights group Americans United for Life is quoted  sounding like she's taking a page straight out of Sun Tzu's book.   According to the magazine, in a 2011 interview, she said, \"We don't make  frontal attacks.  Never attack where the enemy is strongest.\"</p><p>Pay attention here to the strategy because if you don't look closely, you  might not see it until it's too late.  It is a slow loss of liberty and  autonomy by a thousand tiny attacks from a steady onslaught of policies  mostly from Republican-led state legislatures, more abortion restrictions  passed in the last three years than in the last two decades, according to  the Guttmacher Institute. </p><p>Everything from Trap laws that impose burdensome and medical unnecessary  requirements on abortion providers that can force them out of business to  attacks on health care coverage that prevent women from paying for  abortions using private insurance or policies purchased on the new health  exchanges.  Even mandatory counseling that can sometimes include  information that is irrelevant or misleading.  That visit often followed by  a 24-hour waiting period and an additional trip to a provider before the  procedure can be performed, requirements that women seeking abortions must  first undergo ultrasounds to listen to the beat of its heart.  Then, there  are 20-week abortion bans that posed a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade  allowance for abortions, up to the point of viability at 24 weeks. </p><p>These aggressive policies attempt to lay bare the big picture for the final  decisive battle, a Supreme Court showdown to roll back the gains of Roe v.  Wade.  And this week when the enemies of reproductive rights came knocking  at the gates, the court refused to let them in.  The justices punted on  considering Arizona's 20-week abortion ban, a case that could have forced a  challenge to Roe v. Wade.  But that was this time advocates for  reproductive justice, no it's not going to last.</p><p>That's why they're devising a new tactical approach of their own, going on  offense in this policy fight and using that same weapon, policy to fight  back.  Think of it as like political judo, it's a martial arts practice  that enable a smaller fighter to defeat a bigger stronger opponent using a  key strategy, turning the opponent's size and strength from an asset into a  liability. </p><p>NARAL Pro-choice America is taking all of those restrictive abortion  measures and making this pledge to the governors who signed for the law.   You stood for these laws, you signed these laws, now, if you're up for re- election this year, you're going to have to run on them. </p><p>This week in \"The Nation\" magazine, NARAL president Elise Hogue told the  writer Zoey Carpenter that the strategy is to shift the momentum and the  reproductive justice fight to, quote, \"force these anti-choice extremists  who hold political office to actually run on and defend anti-choice  records.\"</p><p>Joining me now David S. Cohen, professor of law at Drexel University,  Anthea Butler, professor of religious studies and graduate chair of the  religion of the University of Pennsylvania, Nancy Northup, who is president  and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, and Katon Dawson, national  Republican consultant, and former chair of the South Carolina Republican  Party.</p><p>So, Nancy, self-defense teaches women get on the ground, kick with your  legs, don't try to go right -- you know, don't try to go arm to arm because  that's not necessarily where the strength is.  Is this what this new  strategy is, all right, you guys want to sign this, run on this?</p><p>NANCY NORTHUP, CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS:  Well, right.  I think we're  going to see that last year was an absolute turnaround point in the fight  over women's access to reproductive health care.  We saw going on offense  right and left. </p><p>We saw Wendy Davis do that filibuster in Texas, and she is now soaring in  her run for governor of Texas.  We saw Albuquerque voters turn down a 20- week ban.  When they got a chance to go to the poll instead of the  politicians, they said, no, we don't want these kind of extreme measures. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>NORTHUP:  We saw the introduction in the U.S. Congress, the Women's Health  Protection Act with 33 cosponsors in the Senate, more than 90 in the House,  which says we even got to stop these restrictions at the state level.  Your  zip code can't determine whether you have constitutional rights. </p><p>So, last year was a turnaround and it's going keep on going. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  All right.  So, I want to go back for a second to the actual  strategy of opponents of reproductive rights for a moment, because it does  feels to me, David, as though the actual Roe v. Wade decision itself is  part of what opens up and allows this possibility that the multiple  trimesters, the notion that there is a point in which the state has an  interest. </p><p>So, talk to me.  Is Roe a sufficient decision for us to continue to rest  reproductive rights on?</p><p>DAVID S. COHEN, DREXEL UNIVERSITY:  Well, Roe had promised but the problem  was it was cut back in Casey in 1992, because Casey allowed -- Casey was  the Supreme Court case that allowed a lot more restrictions from the state.   It was basically the Supreme Court saying that you can do things that are  burdensome on women's rights as long as they're not unduly burdensome and  ever since Casey, we've seen the courts and lower courts be more receptive  to infringement on women's rights and women's access to abortion.</p><p>So, Casey has really opened up the floodgates and with Justice Kennedy  who's perceived as the swing vote really seemingly approving almost any  restriction, as long as it's not an absolute criminalization of abortion,  it's really troublesome what Casey has allowed. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  So, Katon, as much as we talked in the last hour about the  ways in which Democrats often kind of can't hold themselves completely  together to have a clear strategy, in the case of women's reproductive  rights, I've got to say.  I got to agree with Nancy, this was the moment  when on the left, you saw clear language, war on women.  It became the  framework.  Republicans had to address whether or not they were, in fact,  committing a war on women, right, and once you give up the framing, you  start to lose. </p><p>Are you guys going to lose?  I mean really begin to lose, if this is the  central issue on which the Republicans are forced to run. </p><p>KATON DAWSON, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Well, Republicans will lose in the  primaries if they back up on the pro-life movement.  That's what will  happen.  It is the basis especially in the Southeast corridor where I  practice my business.  It's the basis that among other thing it's in every  party's platform.  It's in the national party's platform.  It's one of  things that divides the two parties.  There are pro-life Democrats but they  don't vote at the ballot box.  </p><p>Pro-life Republicans vote that at the ballot box, whether it'd be a  presidential election or any other election.  And those are just facts. </p><p>It's also -- you hear politicians and I do a lot of times when they have  divisive crowds talk about the civil rights of the unborn and the civil  rights -- and I know that that will start a whole other discussion, but we  -- this is -- this is the terminology we use.  We live in a country that  spends enormous resources on trying to save nine coal miners in  Pennsylvania, enormous resources on trying to talk somebody off the  Brooklyn Bridge.</p><p>And this is -- the pro-life movement didn't stand down.  They're still  there.  They're still so strong and they will hold you accountable.  So, it  will be a fight but it's going to cross both parties' lines. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  All right.  All right.  Stick with me.  You've drawn some  things that I think have become central parts of how we talk about this.  I  don't want to say I disagree with you on the civil rights. </p><p>DAWSON:  I think. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  In fact, actually what I want to do is when we come back, I  want to make the claim if that's going to be the discourse, if discourse is  the personhood and that from the beginning fertilized eggs have civilized  rights, let's go ahead and do that and let's talk about what the civil  rights of all children ought to be and whether or not Republicans can get  on that set of policy agenda.  Stay right there when we come back.</p><p>Also, why 35-B is so critical in the debate over reproductive rights.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Years ago, I accompanied a friend to an appointment to end  an unwanted pregnancy.  Now, I expected to hold her hand, to sit with her,  to hug her, to cry with her if it came to that. </p><p>But what I hadn't anticipated, with having to shield her while we walked  the gauntlet just to get in the door.  A crowd of people, some shouting,  some quietly imploring, some trying to condemn her, others trying to  convince to change her mind, showing images, all turning her from a woman  simply seeking a medical procedure into a target. </p><p>That was a day I first became aware of the vulnerability of woman who  lacked the resources to end a pregnancy quietly and privately to a personal  position.  This week, these women, those whose reproductive choices are  subject to public scrutiny in abortion clinics were the heart of the case  considered by the Supreme Court.  At issue was a Massachusetts law passed  in 2007 to create a buffer zone, 35 feet of safe space outside of clinics,  to separate patients from protesters. </p><p>The question before the court was whether the buffer zones were a  reasonable response to a history of violence and harassment outside the  clinics, or an unconstitutional intrusion into the right of free speech. </p><p>So, for me, part of working as an escort experience was going to that whole  point that Katon was bringing up earlier, about, oh, civil rights and the  civil rights of the unborn and I keep thinking, but what about the rights  of the born, of those who are walking around and experiencing life.  What  about the rights of these women, of their children who are often already  preexisting before they made the decision to terminate this pregnancy. </p><p>Can we possibly push the right to have to respond to that? </p><p>ANTHEA BUTLER, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA:  Yes, exactly.  I think part of  what's going on is that we have sacralized this one piece so much that real  people, real life women who are in a position where they have to make these  decisions are being ignored. </p><p>The whole thing about being in front of the clinics where you see the  fetuses and chopped up stuff and everything else, this is the scare tactic.   But what was so interesting about that \"Rolling Stone\" article by Janet  Rottman (ph) is that she says, you know, Randall Terry news, like we  couldn't get any traction doing this one thing, so we changed it this way,  it will be easier. </p><p>And I think we need a buffer zone.  It's not about taking away anybody's  free speech.  You can stand outside in 35 feet and do what you want.  But  when women are being accosted, you know, presented with screaming and  yelling and saying you're killing your baby, and all this other kind of  stuff, you're impinging upon their rights as well.  And I thing that the  people who feel so strongly pro-life don't realize they're infringing on  the rights of others who are trying to exercise their rights to do what  they want to. </p><p>Rights go both ways.  They don't go one way just because you have a  hardened ideology. </p><p>And I think to go back to Katon's point, for a minute, I think that you may  say pro, but if we start putting this the negative and making people run on  the negative part of what is happening, the negative piece that women can't  get prenatal care, they can't get gynecological examinations, they can't  get all the kind of care that they would need, not to be in a position the  get pregnant in the first place, then that makes it a different kind of  run.  It's not just pro-life.  It's pro \"you don't want these women to have  a life\".  And that's the point.</p><p>It's like if you change this conversation, it becomes something else  different altogether and that's where I think there's an attraction,  especially with younger women who want to keep their reproductive rights,  who might be conservative but they don't want to have to deal with this  whole thing about you're going to tell me what to do with my body. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  And one aspect of that, I mean, I think, you know, what  you're saying there is key, and this, you know, we typically think of it as  the protesters versus the women who are seeking medical services.  But  there's also the clinic providers, there's the doctors and the nurses and  the receptionists who themselves have been in danger.  That's part of that  35 feet buffer zone too as well.</p><p>COHEN:  Buffer zones are good because they protect women who are seeking  basic medical care from being harassed but they also prevent violence and  help to ensure safety of clinical workers.  We're not talking just doctors.   We're talking anyone who works at a clinic, who suffers harassment daily,  threats daily.  And we have to remember that in Massachusetts in  particular, there's a real history of violence. </p><p>In 1994, two clinic receptionists at Planned Parenthood, in pre-term,  Shannon Lowney (ph) and Leann Nichols (ph), were murdered because they were  abortion providers.  That has happened to six other people working in  abortion in this country's history.  Most recently, Dr. George Tiller in  2009. </p><p>This is a real risk that people suffer through every day to get to work and  to work, and buffer zones don't cure the problem, but they provide a space.   Paul Hill who was one of the protesters who killed a doctor in Florida  stood right outside the clinic.  He was able to get close access to the  clinic in Pensacola, Florida.  There was no buffer zone.  Buffer zones help  protect people's safety.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Nancy --  </p><p>NORTHUP:  Well, I was just going to say, they also allow -- if you think  about it, you know, we have a history of people who want to prevent others  from exercising their constitutional rights -- their right to go to school,  their right to vote, their right to access with respective health services  and all the buffer zone is saying stand aside, let people through.  You  should haven't to go through a gauntlet of protesters to vote, or to go to  school or to get health care. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  And the people who have to walk that gauntlet are a subset  of all the women who have terminations.  I just -- I just want to always  kind of point this out, that if you are wealthy and have either private  insurance or the capacity to pay individually, you can walk into a doctor's  office.  It is not targeted in this way.  You can walk into a hospital that  is not targeted this way.</p><p>It is a very specific group of people who end up with this kind of shaming,  potential violence, angst, sort of directed at them.</p><p>NORTUP:  Oh, that's right.  And also, people who are also coming to get  their, you know, their --  </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Their pap smears and their birth control pills. </p><p>NORTHUP:  Birth control pills and all that.</p><p>And again, this does -- I have protested many times in my life.  Of course,  I support the right to express an opinion. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Of course, of course.</p><p>NORTHUP:  This is just a law about not blockading, not obstructing, not  congregating in front of the clinic.  Step aside, let the people through,  express your opinions peacefully. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  So, that does feel like to me like that is consistent,  Katon, with Republican values.  Or conservative values, that -- of course  we can have differences of opinion.  Of course, we know that the issue of  reproductive rights is a central dividing line but that your opinion  doesn't, in fact, give you the right to stand there and block someone from  something that is constitutional protected. </p><p>DAWNSON:  You're exactly right.  And it would be my personal opinion,  especially I think in the home state that I live, that anybody that puts  their hands on a woman at any time, or -- I can pretty well assure you that  in South, they'll go to jail almost immediately. </p><p>And if that's the tactic they want to take, then there's a good chance  we'll put them in jail.  Now, I understand the protests.  I understand  that.  But when you start infringing on these zones we're talking about,  attacking a woman for making that decision, you can attack in all kind of  ways.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  I mean, no, these are mostly verbal attacks.  These are  shaming and yelling and sort of narrating and showing the images.  They're  not -- I mean, we do know they can be attached to acts of violence but I'm  not suggesting that those protesters inside those 35 feet are necessarily  reaching out and grabbing but you do feel when you're walking with someone,  when you're serving as a guide, you do sort of put your hands up over that  person in part to put your head down. </p><p>But that I mean, like can you imagine if you're going for kidney dialysis,  or for a podiatrist appointment, or for any other medical appointment, and  you have to work through that sort of you know, sort of shaming experience?</p><p>NORTHUP:  And Massachusetts is saying everybody step aside. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yes.  The pro and --  </p><p>NORTHUP:  Pro-choice, step aside.</p><p>DAWSON:  Both sides.  True.</p><p>NORTHUP:  Just let people through.  Make your points to the side.  The  First Amendment's protected, but you can't congregate and block access. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  More on this when we come back, the question of whether or  not it is time to be on offense and what offense looks like. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Supporters of reproductive right got a victory in North  Carolina on Friday.  A federal judge struck down a North Carolina law that  required abortion providers to give women an ultrasound and describe the  image even if a woman asks them not to.  The judge ruled that the law was a  violation of free speech. </p><p>So, David, why -- how is that a free speech violation there? </p><p>COHEN:  Well, in this regard, it's telling doctors what to say, and it's  infringing on the doctor/patient relationship, because if a doctor says  that I can treat this women and I can have -- ensure her health in a  particular way and the state saying you have to do something different,  then that's an infringement on that relationship.</p><p>And also, it goes beyond that, though.  It's also about the state saying  that we know what's best for women.  Women don't know what's best for  women.  Doctors don't know what's best for women.  Counselors don't know  what's best for women.</p><p>But we, the legislators, who have probably never been in an abortion  clinic, have never -- a lot of them -- ever been pregnant or can't get  pregnant since most of them are men, they say, we know what's best for  women, when it's really -- women who know what's best for women, in  consultation with their doctors and anyone else they're talking about.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yes, Nancy, to me the ultrasound laws felt like they presume  that women do not know what is happening.  And it's hard for me to tell  whether they're talking sincerely like, oh, honey, you just don't know, let  me explain it to you, or if it's just about shaming you so that a difficult  circumstance becomes even more difficult. </p><p>But is there some reason we cannot simply trust that women are fully moral  agents as citizens capable of making hard choices, easy choices, all kinds  of choices, including this choice?</p><p>NORTHUP:  Well, you're right and that's, of course, what the Supreme Court  has said again and again, is that there is a zone of privacy around which  people can make the important decisions of their lives.  That's what this  is about and whether those decisions are about -- who to marry, the size of  your family, how you raise your children, your religious beliefs, that's  what the promise of het Constitution is, and that's what the stakes are  here. </p><p>In a free society, we make these critical decisions for ourselves.  I would  say the ultrasound laws, and the judge really got this in the North  Carolina case.  We're thrilled with yesterday's win. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>NORTHUP:  It's not even just that they're saying that women don't know what  they're doing.  It's plain punitive because the North Carolina law said if  the woman says, \"I don't want to see this and I don't want to hear this,\"  she turns away, she covers her ears, the doctor is supposed to keep on  napping at her and yapping at her, and so that shows that it's not about  information.  It's about some kind of a punitive performance that the  doctor's supposed to go through, in violation of her or his ethics as well  as the patient's wishes. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  You know, your point is just well-taken, that I like this  image of a zone of privacy.  It's very much like the buffer zone law, but  in a kind of broader sense, because similarly we would not presume that if  an ultrasound showed certain kinds of field deformities that one should be  required to have an abortion, right?</p><p>NORTHUP:  Of course, of course.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  So the question of making difficult choices ought to be left  within that buffer zone, right, of our privacy where we are allowed to make  tough choices that concur with our morals, with our ethics, with our  situation. </p><p>David S. Cohen and Nancy Northup, Katon Dawson, thank you so much.</p><p>Anthea is sticking around a little longer.  I want to tell you about  special online event this Wednesday at 2:00 p.m. Eastern.  MSNBC national  reporter Irin Carmon will take your questions on the 41st anniversary of  Roe v. Wade.  Go to MHP.MSNBC.com to submit your questions right now. </p><p>Up next, the frightening side of social media and why so many women are  being harassed online. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Last month, a Pew Research study found that 73 percent of  adults now use social networking sites.  Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram  are the new tools of our professional and personal lives.  We use them to  get information to stay connected to friends, to connect with those who  share our interest, and sometimes just to kill time while wait in line.</p><p>Our virtual lives are an important part of our real lives.  The places  where we work and learn and play and relax are increasingly mediated and  affected by our online selves.  Behind the avatars and 140 characters are  flesh and blood people.  That mean that what happens online matters, and  what is happening to women online should give us pause. </p><p>According to the volunteer organization working to halt online abuse, of  the nearly 4,000 people reporting online stalking and harassment from 2000  to 2012, 72.5 percent were women, harassment of women.  And what was being  done and not done to stop it is a subject of the cover story of the  \"Pacific-Standard\" magazine, entitled \"Why Women Aren't Welcome on the  Internet\".  The author, Amanda Hess, is herself a victim of online stalking  and harassment. </p><p>And her article includes -- or maybe survivor of it.  Her article includes  several of the specific attacks that she has received via social media.   They are so gruesome and so vulgar that I'm nothing going to read them  verbatim here.  But they include threats of sexual assault and murder. </p><p>Amanda writes, \"No matter how hard we attempt to ignore it, this type of  gender harassment and the sheer volume of it, a severe implication for  women status on the Internet, threats of rape, death, and stalking can  overpower our emotional bandwidth, take up our time and cost us money  through legal fees, online protection services and missed wages. </p><p>Joining me today is Amanda Hess, contributor to \"Pacific-Standard\".  Also  here, Anthea Butler, professor of religious studies and graduate chair of  religion at the University of Pennsylvania.  Nancy Giles, contributor to  \"CBS Sunday Morning.\"  \"Feministe\" editor and \"Guardian\" columnist Gil  Filipovic.  And from San Francisco, Elon James White, managing director and  host of \"This Week in Blackness.\" </p><p>So happy to have you all here.</p><p>NANCY GILES, CBS SUNDAY MORNING:  Thank you.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  So, I want to talk to you about this article and the  response you've been getting.</p><p>AMANDA HESS, CONTRIBUTOR, PACIFIC STANDARD:  I wrote this article after I  received my most recent sort of bouts this past summer and the threats were  obviously distressing.  It was an anonymous person on Twitter threatening  to come to my house to rape me, to cut off my head. </p><p>On the one hand, that's so completely ludicrous thing to say and that's,  you know, probably not going to happen.  But on the other hand, it's so  confusing when you receive threats like that because people are telling  you, don't worry about it, it's just the Internet, it's not going to  happen.  Others are saying it's your responsibility to track this person  down and to prosecute them.  And some people are saying if it's so bad then  why don't you just quit Twitter. </p><p>And so, the threats are bad.  What's really confusing is how as person  you're supposed to deal with them. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yes.  You know, we were just talking about the gauntlet that  women have to walk in order to receive termination services for pregnancy.   And these are the gauntlets you have to walk on when you log onto the  Internet, right?  And does feel to me, like we have to keep making claim  that what occurs online matters in the real world, like even if we were  trying to think of the segment, I keep think there just are going to be  people who feel like, turn it off.  Don't go over there, stop going over  there in virtual world because that world does not matter. </p><p>Why does it matter? </p><p>JILL FILIPOVIC, EDITOR, FEMINISTE:  Well, I think the big disconnect is  exactly what you're say and what Amanda's piece highlighted, is that there  is a sense, I think especially among law enforcement and U.S. laws, that  what happens on the Internet is some sort of virtual reality, or as  increasingly, we live our lives online.  We see photos of our friends'  babies on Facebook. </p><p>We interact on Twitter.  I initially met Amanda online --  </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>FILIPOVIC:  -- through Feministe blogging.  You know, I followed you on  Twitter before I ever met you on your show or meet you.  So, we  increasingly network online.  My career is writing online.  I don't write  for a newspaper.  I write for a blog and for the \"Guardians\" Web site.  You  can't tell us to just get off the Internet. </p><p>And when you have people coming into your online spaces, coming at you in  Twitter and comments on your blogs, essentially telling you, you deserve to  be sexually assaulted or even killed for what you're saying, that's just as  intimidating as, you know, walking through a hallway at work and having  somebody hiss at you through a doorway that you should be raped or killed. </p><p>I think that's what people don't necessarily fully appreciate about the  lives that women live and what we receive online in terms of harassment.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Jill, your point is about us knowing one another initially  virtually.  It's also true with my friendship with Elon.</p><p>I mean, Elon, you and I became actual sort of friends, colleagues,  following one another's work all in the virtual world before actually  getting to know one another, and, you know, I was saying that part of my  life is over.  It so ugly in that world now that I just can't engage in the  ways that I initially engaged in social media that, in fact, led to  valuable, you know, professional relationships because it is so ugly there. </p><p>Talk to me a little bit about how then you can begin to navigate something  that is that ugly.</p><p>ELON JAMES WHITE, THIS WEEK IN BLACKNESS:  I'm not exactly sure, especially  with how women are spoken to.  Even when they say, the whole thing about,  oh, just don't be there, it's like that's -- it's a terrible idea because  like for me personally, my entire career right now is based on the social  media platforms that I've been using, that I use for my company, for the  relationships I use.  So, basically you're telling women you're not allowed  to have that opportunity.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Right, exactly. </p><p>WHITE:  And it's unfair and it's unreasonable.  And when people say that,  it's literally just ignoring the reality of the world that we're currently  living in.  And so, to actually try to navigate those things, a lot of  people do things for their own mental health, like blocking people in a  heartbeat.  Just like, no, that's just -- that's not sometimes enough  because if you go to an environment and you just know when you go into that  environment, you're going to be abused, whether it's, quote/unquote, \"fake  or not fake,\" it's still abuse and you don't want to do it.</p><p>Heck, these days, I don't want to log onto Twitter, let alone if someone  was threatening to rape me. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yes, yes, absolutely. </p><p>Anthea, you have -- you have tweeted pretty honestly and openly about how  these cyber bullies jump off the page, jump off, jump off the 140  characters of Facebook or the blog comments and show up in your real life,  that it is part of the active attempt to destroy people's credibility,  their capacity to have jobs, that these have very real consequences. </p><p>BUTLER:  Yes, they do.  I can say to you that and you know this and a lot  of other academics know this, that once you say something that somebody  doesn't like, they start calling them off.  They call your provost's  office, they call your dean's office.  We want to get them off, you want to  shut them up, we want to do all kinds of things.</p><p>But what they don't seem to understand is that we are real life people.  If  they walk up to me and wanted to say this to my face, I'm like, come on,  because basically, I'm like, I dare you.  Because I bet you won't say it to  my face first of all, and second of all, the Penn University police will  not let you get that close to me, OK?  So, that's part of it. </p><p>But the other part of it is that sometimes, this is very coordinated and I  think one of the things we have to talk about are how other bloggers, other  twitters, other people who are active in social media actually attack other  people and there are sites and we all know this one by somebody who just  got sold to Salem Communications and everybody knows who that is, who'd  send people to come and attack you, when they don't like what they do. </p><p>So, these are coordinated attacks.  These are not just the random guys sit  around his boxer shorts saying \"I hate this woman.\"  But they are also  coordinate.  They are paid for.  They are people who say let's go do this  to this person because we want to take them down. </p><p>And so, what I want people to understand, especially Twitter to understand,  is that this service that was so great two or three years ago is now a  cesspool of crap, and it's so hard to use it the way we used to be able to  use it, to talk and reduce it.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Right, right.  So, I do want -- I do want to be careful that  -- this isn't exclusively a Twitter issue. </p><p>BUTLER:  No. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  And that part of -- I think as we come back, we'll talk a  little bit about solutions in part because, again, I met Jill on Twitter, I  met Elon on Twitter. </p><p>And not only that, but in a world where there is so much information, I use  the signaling effort.  I want to follow people I disagree with, I want to  follow people I agree with, because it's valuable to me to get that  information.  So, when I get back, we'll talk a little bit about the  solutions look like and whether or not we can redeem the value, right, all  the positive values in this context.</p><p>(CXOMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  We're back to talk about the \"Pacific Standard\" article, why  women are not welcome on the Internet and sort of all the questions about  online harassment, that it raises.</p><p>Nancy, I want to get you in here. </p><p>GILES:  Well, you know, it's so funny.  I mean, among other things, I'm a  woman, I love being a woman.  It's hard being a woman.  It's just hard, all  right?</p><p>And CBS pays me because they value my opinions, which is lovely.  And you  have me on for the same reason.  If your opinion isn't something that  matches up with people, I'll say men for the most part because I can't  believe other women are saying the same kind of things back at us, the kind  of sexual violent imagery, the kind of violent attacking on how you look,  how you smell, these really vicious things that just are exponentially over  the top and beyond the pale, it's fascinating.</p><p>As a woman, I wouldn't say something like that to a man that I disagreed  with, but the vitriol, it's just -- it's astounding.  It's shocking. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  I found, when those moments happen and you're suddenly being  attacked, sometimes it's the one person who is obsessing over you and  you're getting that.  But sometimes it's kind of broader sort of tidal  waves of it.</p><p>And I find it to be very triggering.  Find the very sense of -- that what  we're told to do is what rape survivors are often told do, which is don't  say anything because if you say anything, right, if you push back, then you  are at risk for greater violence and you are at risk that the people you  care and love about will be violated as well.  So, if people jump in your  defense, then they do will -- and so, you just feel like, oh, I'm going to  go at this corner and hide, and that is that emotion of assault and of  survival. </p><p>HESS:  Yes.  And that's sort of the paradox of writing the story to begin  with.  But one of these sort of important things I think to come out of  this, is that it should not be a problem that women are dealing with on  their own.  That there are legal institutions and there are technology  companies that really sort of have a responsibility to make our communities  safe for women. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Is this a Title 7 employment discrimination issue? </p><p>FILIPOVIC:  I think it is.  You know, the Internet is where many people  work.  It's where we socialize.  And when women are so unwelcomed and so  harassed out of these spaces, it has a real impact on our livelihoods and  our lives. </p><p>I mean, you know, it is very comparable to not letting, having, not letting  someone have a seat at a diner, even thought it's a private institution,  you know?  Or not letting a woman into a workplace even though it might be  a private company. </p><p>These things, it is gender discrimination and it's very, very harmful. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  So, Elon, help me through this for a second, because it  feels to me like one possibility are a set of new policies, regulations and  laws, but part one of what we love about the Internet is its relative  freedom.  It's a kind of libertarian space. </p><p>But I also worried about just turning the rules of that space back on  itself.  So, like getting other kinds of gang violence online to mess with  the gang violence and it's occurring like that also feels unproductive to  me.  Are there ways to protect the liberty, protect, you know, questions of  levels of anonymity that we care about, but also somehow make this space  safer for people to engage? </p><p>WHITE:  I believe so.  And the fact is that the companies, the big tech  companies have to take into consideration what people need for their own  safety.  Like, for example, with Google+, they weren't allowing people to  have an account without have -- unless they put their real name not  acknowledging the fact that, you know what?  Some people don't want their  real names out there, because they don't want those attacks to possibly  become real.</p><p>The tech companies have to actually start to look at how this is happening,  what's happening, and try to implement certain types of solutions that can  actually allow for conversation because no one doesn't want conversation,  because that's the first thing people want.  Just want to stop free speech.   Like no, everyone wants free speech but you know what?  You've got to see  what's being said.  And we're talking around women.</p><p>And especially, let's be honest here around women of color.  They get the  double dose of sexism and racism at the exact same time.  So, they have to  take those things into consideration and not just completely shut  everything off, but constantly, constantly be looking for new and  interesting ways that can allow for the conversation to happen.  But at the  same time, keep people safe.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Yes.  With just 15 seconds left here, Amanda.  I do want to  point out, you made such a strong point that there is, that that anonymity  question, often women who make their lives in public space are not  anonymous online, are actual names and jobs and places and where we work  and often where we live, are available.  But the folks who are doing the  stocking or the harassing are quite anonymous. </p><p>And it feels like there's got to be something we can do to change that  imbalance. </p><p>HESS:  Right.  I mean, one of the problems is that, you know, the people  who are saying the Internet isn't real, it's very easy to say that if  you're hiding in your basement, threatening people, it's easy to say that  if you're a police officer who doesn't want to take a report. It's a lot  harder to say that if you're a woman just trying to do her job on the  Internet.</p><p>So, it's difficult to know how to approach that.  On the one hand, you  know, police officers don't have a lot of resources and information.   Technology companies have all the resources in the world, and I think the  problem that you're seeing in both of those places is that they're  extremely male-dominated. </p><p>You know, we look to tech companies to innovate, to sort of bring us things  that we never could have imagined and so I think we can ask them to bring  us solutions on this problem as well.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Right.  To address this asymmetry with the resources and  intelligence and innovation that they have.</p><p>HESS:  Right.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Amanda Hess, Anthea Butler, Nancy Giles, Jill Filipovic, and  Elon James White -- who, of course, joined us virtually, just to prove the  point that virtual relationships exist. </p><p>Up next, we're going make a happy moment at the end of this show.  The 12- year-old bow tie mogul making a difference in kids' lives.  My foot soldier  joins me live, and you're not going want to miss it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Skinny ties, white ties, Ascots bowties, silk knit ties,  whatever the type of tie, men's neck wear is usually reserved for special  occasions and uniforms or the office.  But our foot soldier this week is  designing bowties that aid his community and make formal wear fashionable  anywhere, even on the playground. </p><p>Twelve-year-old Mo Bridges launched his bowtie company, Mo's Bows in 2011,  after his great grandmother, a seamstress for 60 years, taught him how to  sew.  The sixth grader now uses his $80,000 company to sell one of a kind  bowties and change the lives of other children in his community. </p><p>For the past three years, Mo has had one bowtie a year called the Go Mo  Summer Camp Bowtie.  Proceeds from the sale of that tie go to a scholarship  fund that sends Memphis kids to summer camp, where, as Mo says, they not  only get to have fun, they get to have a meal. </p><p>This week, Mo is launching the 2014 Go Mo scholarship bowtie. </p><p>Joining me now from Memphis, Tennessee, is the 12-year-old CEO of Mo's  Bows, Mo Bridges, and with him is his mother, and his words, monager,  Tramica Morris (ph). </p><p>So, nice to have you with us. </p><p>TRAMICA BRIDGES, MO'S MOTHER:  Hello.  Thank you for having us.  </p><p>MO BRIDGES, CEO, MO'S BOWS:  Hey. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Hey, Mo.  So tell me about the tie you're wearing.  Is that  this year's Go Mo bowtie? </p><p>M. BRIDGES:  Yes, it is this year's go mo bowtie.  And I want to wish you a  happy New Year and thank you for having me on your show. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Oh, thank you.  I appreciate the happy New Year.</p><p>Now, tell me, so, you started this business at 9 years old.  What made you  decide to start a business? </p><p>M. BRIDGES:  Well, I started business because I really like to dress up,  and I couldn't find any other bowties I really liked.  So, I reached out to  my grandmother and she showed me how to sew.  After that, I wore my bow  ties.  When I was out, people would just say, hey, I like that bowtie.  And  that was the demand for my business. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Ms. Morris, whenever I see young people who are doing  amazing things, almost always, there is an adult who actually listened to  them and supported them.  So when you have a 9-year-old coming to you and  saying, first of all, I want to learn to sew, and I want to learn to sell - - how do you make that decision that this isn't just a kind of side item,  this is something to really support your child in? </p><p>T. BRIDGES:  Well, actually, Melissa, the fact that Mo has always been --  when I allowed him to dress himself, he chose to wear a suit and tie.  So,  on a Saturday going to the grocery store, I am in flip flops and a dress or  something.  And Mo is in a complete suit. </p><p>So, I knew there was a sense of style and a sense of fashion early on.  So  I was not surprised when he said, hey, I want to start a business, and I  want to sell ties.  I thought that was just perfect for him. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Now, Mo, starting a business is one thing.  And having a  sense of fashion is one thing.  But you also decided to start the summer  camp scholarship. </p><p>That's something else.  What made you want to give back? </p><p>M. BRIDGES:  Well, you know, Melissa, I figure, why not help a kid?   Because kids are fun, and they're cool.  You just have to -- you have to be  generous because -- and I also like to give back to my community at the  same time. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  I love that.  So what happens at that camp that is valuable?   Why do you think of camp as an important place for kids to go? </p><p>M. BRIDGES:  Well, I figured that if I went there, then other kids will  like it, because I liked it.  And, you know, it's hot in Memphis and kids  just need to go swimming and they need to be a kid. </p><p>And it's also -- it's also the highest at child hunger in Memphis.  And --  because kids need a meal, and they don't have a meal in summer, so I  figured that if they go to summer camp, then they can have a meal. </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  I love all of that. </p><p>One last thing I want to ask you.  My grandmother was a seamstress.  And my  mother is wonderful at sewing.  There's such important parts. </p><p>Tell me about your relationship with your great grandmother.  How has she  inspired you? </p><p>M. BRIDGES:  Well, my grandmother inspired me, because she -- she taught me  how to sew, and she like -- she was -- she -- everybody will come to her  and I used to grow up playing in her sewing room and I saw these really  cool fabrics.  And so I asked her how to teach me how to sew and she did.  </p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  Tramica Morris, I just want to thank you for being a mom who  has stood up behind that young man and made sure he could be his full self,  because he is pretty amazing. </p><p>T. BRIDGES:  Thank you.</p><p>HARRIS-PERRY:  And thank you to Mo Bridges for that fashion style, for that  sense of generosity and for that business acumen -- I can't wait to see the  multimillionaire magnate you're going to become and the good you're going  to do in the world. </p><p>That's our show for today.

Plus, a major development in the New Jersey Bridge scandal story and the 12-year-old changing the world one bow tie at a time. But first, on the battlefield of politics, why you must sweat the small stuff.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p>Good morning. I'm Melissa Harris-Perry. This week we've got a little news on an issue we've been covering here on MHP show for nearly two years. This week in voter suppression and this week the news is actually kind of good. Thursday a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation that would restore some of the protections in the Voting Rights Act that were struck down by the Supreme Court last year. And on Friday, a Pennsylvania judge struck down that state's voter id law. Saying it placed an unreasonable burden on the fundamental right to vote. Now, these are small, but critical steps in the right direction. Returning us to our traditional value of expanding the franchise rather than limiting it. Every vote matters. Our nation's recent experiences remind us that even a fraction of votes in a single location can have, well, history defining effects on national elections. So if you care who will occupy the White House after 2016, you'd better pay attention to who holds offices in the states, which means you'd better know a little something about the communities that make those states up. Case in point, North Carolina.</p><p/><p>The political significance of the tar heels state was underscored this week when <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>visited to promote his efforts to boost the manufacturing industry. It was his first policy related trip of 2014. Now, remember, North Carolina is a battleground state that by a razor's edge margin went for <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>in 2008 and then turned back to red in 2012. In between, a political revolution happened in North Carolina. Republicans won control of both houses of the state legislature. For the first time in 140 years. And in 2012, the state elected a Republican governor, giving one party control to the state. Now, the state's laws are among the most conservative in the country. North Carolina has passed some of the nation's most restrictive voting laws, which disproportionately affect the poor and racial minorities, groups that traditionally vote Democratic. It cut unemployment benefits by as much that it was disqualified from a federal compensation program for long term jobless benefits. North Carolina eliminated its earned income tax credit, essentially raising taxes on more than 900,000 households earning less than $49,000 a year. State lawmakers also passed a law that could close most of North Carolina's 16 abortion clinics. And the governor, Pat McCrory, he signed the law despite his campaign promise not to approve any new abortion restrictions.</p><p/><p>But these changes did not start at the top of the political ticket. Instead, they started at the bottom. In 2009, in the Wake County School board election, conservative board members were elected with the support of multi-million air conservative and supermarket magnet Art Pope. The new board promptly eliminated a school bussing program, which had been lauded as a model for school integration, and Pope's work on the school board attracted national attention. By 2010, he had the attention of the conservative strategist Ed Gillespie. Gillespie was working on his red map plan, and putting state legislatures and their redistricting duties under Republican control and Art Pope quickly became a key part of Gillespie's efforts in North Carolina. Pope, his family, and the groups backed by him spent more than $2 million on General Assembly races in 2010, and of the 22 races Pope targeted Republicans won 18 and took control of the legislature.</p><p/><p>Pope is now North Carolina's state budget director and Ed Gillespie announced this week that he will challenge Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner. And this key player in the Republican takeover of North Carolina, which has raised taxes on some of its poor citizens and cut unemployment benefits, well, he's running on a platform. You've just got to listen.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>ED GILLESPIE, VIRGINIA SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: If elected I'll be a servant to the people of Virginia and a leader for policies that grow the middle class and foster upward mobility, enabling people to lift themselves out of poverty.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: To be fair, Gillespie didn't himself cut unemployment or passed voter restrictions in North Carolina. But he did help orchestrate the Republican takeover of the legislature that did. And just as his efforts began at the lower levels of American politics, so, too, has the opposition to North Carolina's sharp rightward turn. The grassroots \"Moral Monday\" protests last year gained momentum every week as hundreds of peaceful protesters were arrested for occupying the state legislature and demanding an end to these particular conservative policies. Their next big rally is set for Raleigh, on February 8th. And the movement is spreading. Organizers from a dozen states traveled to Raleigh in December to learn how to start their own \"Moral Mondays.\" And this week, the first \"Moral Monday\" in Georgia was held at the state capital in Atlanta where about 200 people urged the Republican governor there to expand Medicaid and on Tuesday in South Carolina demonstrators carried a white coffin up the state house steps to represent the people they say could die. The state refuses to expand Medicaid. This is where the real progressive movement is going to have to start. I mean it can't come whole cloth from the populist mayor of New York City or even from the tough on bank senator from Massachusetts. It must take root among the people in places like Raleigh and Atlanta and Columbia.</p><p/><p>Joining me now is Representative Keith Ellison, Democratic congressman from Minnesota, Anthea Butler, professor of religious studies at the University of Pennsylvania, Nancy Giles, contributor to \"CBS Sunday Morning\" and a writer and social commentator. And Katon Dawson, a Republican consultant and former chair of the South Carolina GOP. Thanks to you all for being here.</p><p/><p>REP. KEITH ELLISON, (D) MINNESOTA: Thank you.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: So, congressman, I want to start with you. Because before going to the U.S. House of Representatives you serve in your state legislature .</p><p/><p>ELLISON: Sure.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: And you write about it in your book. Talk to me about -- if I'm an ordinary citizen living somewhere who doesn't normally watch cable news politics, right? How important is the state legislature versus this federal levels?</p><p/><p>ELLISON: They define voter qualifications, so we have 50 or more different ways to elect people. So like in the last election in Minnesota, the conservatives put on a valid measure that would require a photographic identification card from the government, issued by the government before anyone could vote. And people said we could not possibly beat it, but we did beat it and we beat it by a wide margin because we organized and talked to people on the grassroots and we had a multitude of arguments. We said it cost too much, it was unwieldy. We said it didn't have any factual basis, because there was no voter and posture voting .</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Right.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: Going on. And - but we cobbled all of those logical arguments together and we came up with a winning coalition. So let me tell you. At the state level, that's where the action is when it comes to who gets to vote and who doesn't from voter - from disenfranchisement, voter I.D., access to voter polls, to the number of machines, the state is what's happening.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Right. And this - and that point, Anthea, I want to pick up on in part because I think it felt for many - you know, for many again, ordinary folks living their lives, balancing their checkbooks, driving their kids to school it felt like all of a sudden in 2010 there was this Republican takeover, this wave, that came out of nowhere. But it didn't come out of nowhere, right? It had been built off from like door-catchers to the Senate at that point.</p><p/><p>ANTHEA BUTLER, PROF., UNIV. OF PENNSYLVANIA: Exactly. And what people don't realize as this probably - almost I would say maybe almost a 50-year history of people being put in the school board, the mayor's office.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p/><p>BUTLER: The state legislature, and, you know right wing conservatives being asked to run not just because of political duty, but of religious duty and we'll get to that when we talk about reproductive rights.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p/><p>BUTLER: But in this particular case, when you have conservatives who are motivated, on the liberal side everybody thought, we'll just go out and we'll vote and we'll have an occasional candidate and that's really great. But what they haven't thought about is the structural issues that make it very important that you have to be in every place in government. All politics is local.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BUTLER: And it is very true. All of this starts at a local level. And by the time you get to the national level, these states' rights issues, the kinds of things that make these structures happen have already come out of people's hands and they go what just happened. You know, and I'm sure everybody in North Carolina is saying the same thing.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: How does this happen? So, Katon, it does seem to be the part of the answer, though, to what happened in North Carolina. I mean, you know, I'd love to just point to Art Pope and say it's all his fault and his big money. But part of it - takeover was possible in part, because the Democratic Party in North Carolina was vulnerable, right, to this kind of takeover to these challenges. It seems to me that you all do a really good job of being profoundly organized on one message. How do you guys do that? Do you have like internal memos at the meetings? Is there a hash tag? What is going on with you guys?</p><p/><p>KATON DAWSON, REPUBICAN CONSULTANT: It started years and years ago when the Democrats controlled both South Carolina and North Carolina and you - when I was - in the state houses, and South Carolina's 16 years ahead of North Carolina as far as taking over the bodies. So, we .</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Taking over the bodies indeed.</p><p/><p>DAWSON: We'll get into that later. But when I was chairman, we didn't have full majority, so I went after sheriff's races and changed nine sheriffs from Democrats to Republican .</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Right.</p><p/><p>DAWSON: And then with that you go to solicitors. Solicitor named Trey Gowdy who became a U.S. congressman.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: That's my colleague.</p><p/><p>DAWSON: Your colleague. So, when you look at the foreign team, a lot of people think these candidates should show up. From my standpoint, you get them on record early. You find out where they are and you start electing them, and in the south, the pro-life movement is the base of a lot of these elections, it did, and it's a proud base that I'm with, but what I'm telling you is that - right. You don't just show up. Politics doesn't change overnight. Art Pope's $2 million didn't change that. What really changed North Carolina was an influx of people and retires. Conservative. That's one of the things that changed it. The second thing changed was national Democrat politics were not matching up. I ran the last cycle in North Carolina when <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>had about 42 bricks and mortars in there and we put about 450 people in there fighting that fight, and what we found out in North Carolina was it was different. As everybody was working persuadable voters. It was the Republican base we had to go the last three weeks to, and we had to go, because they were sitting on the sidelines.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: OK. So I love that you said we split sheriffs and the next thing you know we're flipping whole state bodies, right? Because, you know, those are those low information elections where 100 people, 200 people can make all the difference in who becomes your sheriff in New Orleans. We vote on the coroner, God help us. I know. But - I know, it is. There's a lot to be said about that, right? It's a Southern thing. I do want to look, though, at the Medicaid gap, right? Because you talked about who can be persuaded, right? And in Georgia there are more than 400,000 people who would have gotten Medicaid in North Carolina, more than 300,000 people. In South Carolina, nearly 200,000 people. And that looks to me like a group of people who are not getting Medicaid, who could have gotten it, if, in fact, their governors had been willing to extend it. If I'm a Democrat sitting in those states, I start thinking about how I start flipping it based on that.</p><p/><p>NANCY GILES, CONTRIBUTOR, \"CBS SUNDAY MORNING\": Exactly. And we were talking about this in the green room. People voting against their own interests. And I can't underscore enough what's been said at the table as someone who considers herself bright, college educated and never really paid much attention to the smaller votes.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p/><p>GILES: You know, the school board, you know. I don't have children, so I wouldn't have really think about that. The local votes. And I know so many people who maybe will pay more attention if it's a mayoral vote.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Sure.</p><p/><p>GILES: Or if it's a Senate vote or presidential campaign, but we've got to get boots on the ground just like you're an evil genius.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes, yes.</p><p/><p>GILES: I want to incorporate everything that's being said. We've got to make sure the people know that the stakes are high.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Stick with me. OK, we'll let your polite southern evil genius reign when we get back. We're going to take a break right now. And while we go to break we're going to be listening to music inspired by the \"Moral Monday\" protests. This is \"My Body Politics\" by the North Carolina Music Love Army.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Six months ago the Supreme Court struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act. The court took issue specifically with the formula for determining, which states and jurisdictions have such problematic history on voting rights that they need his federal approval for any changes to their voting laws before they go into effect. The justices had said the formula was outdated and invited Congress to create a new one. Now, for the first time since the ruling a bipartisan group of lawmakers has an actual proposal. And the bill was introduced Thursday by Senator Patrick Leahy and Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner and Congressman John Conyers, and co-sponsored by Congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis. Under the bill, states that have had five or more violations of federal voting laws in the past 15 years will need preclearance from the Feds before changing local voting rules. Currently that would cover Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Five fewer states then were previously fully covered. And local jurisdiction would need the preclearance if they had three violations in the past 15 years or if they had persistent extremely low minority turnout over that time. The bill would also make it easier to get a preliminary injunction to brock a problematic law pending trial. One caveat, though. The bill specifically exempts voter I.D. laws saying such requirements are not a violation of the Voting Rights Act and at this point, it does not cover North Carolina, which has some of the most restrictive voting laws in the country.</p><p/><p>So, Anthea, this is like one of those good news/bad news stories.</p><p/><p>BUTLER: Yeah.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Where, OK, bipartisan, looks like we might get a new formula, we don't just have to walk around with a two slid section five forever, but it also gives away the ghost with the notion that I.D. is inherently not part of the VRA problem.</p><p/><p>BUTLER: I know. And that's really - what it does is it leaves it up to state judges and things like that. That what just happened in Pennsylvania with Governor Corbett having a bad day yesterday finding out that, you know, we won't have to use our voter I.D. But I am thinking about states like Texas where, you know, voter I.D., you can use your gun permit, you can use your concealed carry permit to get .</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: But not your student ..</p><p/><p>BUTLER: But not your student I.D. card, right? So what kind of sense does that make? So, I'm hopeful that this will, you know, help bridge a little bit of a gap. Because I see Texas is almost being the worst in that bunch for a lot of respects, but they're all equally bad, but the question is, can we find enough consensus to have that voted upon in the House?</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p/><p>BUTLER: And that's where I'm worried about it. Because if we don't, I think that what we're going to see in 2014 is a lot more people being taken off the rolls and this won't get fixed, you know, by November '14, which will make it very problematic.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: So, and Katon, this is precisely where I want to come with you, then. Because I love the story that you tell about we have good strategy, we've got demographic changes, we go get those voters, we pound the pavement. If that is what -- if that's the issue, then I would be like well, God bless the Republicans because if people agree with you and you get your voters out.</p><p/><p>DAWSON: You get one more than they do.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Right. Then that's what democracy is. But then this is something different. Because this isn't about we go convince the voters to be on our side. This is we suppress the voters most likely to choose the other side and that to me doesn't feel like it's healthy for democracy.</p><p/><p>DAWSON: Well, the arguments are going to go on, the courts are going to continue. Some states are going to do, others - some laws are going to be more egregious than others, but it's going to get down to the voter I.D. again, whether it's right or not. And whether the citizens in the states - will there be protests on the streets? There's some. But, again, it takes a voter I.D. to get in about everywhere. And that's where I think sometimes the argument gets lost. It took me one to get in here. Four times - to get in ..</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: But you don't have a constitutional right to be in here.</p><p/><p>DAWSON: Well, I don't. You invited me.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>DAWSON: Thank you. You are exactly right.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>DAWSON: Or you could turn me away.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yeah. No. Right. I mean - right, nor do I. But - and yet, Congressman, I guess the other point is - I actually also don't have a constitutional right to vote. In that it is state by state, right? And so what I'm wondering, given your point that there are at least 50 separate and unequal rules and procedures for voting, is it time, congressman, to have a -- an amendment to the U.S. Constitution providing at the federal level the right to vote for every citizen and wipe this mess away?</p><p/><p>ELLISON: Yes. And Mark Pocan who's from Wisconsin and I have a bill to make the right to vote a constitutional amendment and we're moving it as well as we can, and I think it only makes sense because we really don't live in the kind of country that was -- we had when we put this voting scheme together. Things have changed in the amount of just inequality and disparity and the way people are treated is just so wide - that it's just not fair. And so, it's time to amend the constitution and grant a right to vote to all citizens. But I will say this. You know. Grassroots activism really is the key here.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: And people getting involved like \"Moral Mondays\" and it's spreading. You know, in Wisconsin people were out on the streets. In Minnesota we get things on the street. I think this is good for democracy and I'm excited about it.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: OK. And you took us exactly where we are going next, because when we come back, I've got somebody from \"Moral Mondays\" right here, because up next, the trouble in district 12 that not even Katniss can fix.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Welcome back. You know, district 12 just can't catch a break. No, no, no, not that district 12. This district 12. North Carolina's 12TH congressional district. Last weekend we told you about the decision by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory to hold off on filling the 12th district seat just vacated by Mel Watt who's now heading a Federal Housing Agency until the general election in November, so that leaves the seat in a solidly democratic majority and minority district without a representative for almost a year. Governor McCrory was asked about his decision Wednesday during an interview with a host of MSNBC's \"The Daily Rundown\" Chuck Todd.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>CHUCK TODD, MSNBC ANCHOR: I know people have a low opinion of Congress, but to have basically to disenfranchise nearly a million people and not having a representation in the U.S. House of Representatives, that is not a healthy thing for a year.</p><p/><p>GOV. PAT MCCRORY (R ), NORTH CAROLINA: Well, Chuck, I'm sworn to uphold the constitutional laws of North Carolina and I can't change those laws between now and that election, and, again, I have to uphold the election laws and I made the good decision.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Joining us now from Washington, D.C. is the Reverend William Barber, president of the North CarolinaNAACP and leader of the \"Moral Mondays\" movement which has been protesting among other things North Carolina's voter restrictions and who also sent a letter to Governor McCrory about this question of District 12. Reverend Barber, thank you for being here.</p><p/><p>REV. WILLIAM BARBER, NAACP NATIONAL BOARD MEMBER: Thank you so much, Dr. Perry. You know, it's utterly ridiculous the government says about the law, the fact of the matter is we have the people who can get together and actually comply with the law, you know. Representative Price, Representative Butterfield actually wrote the governor and said we can do better than this. 700,000 people, Republicans, Democrats, black and white, will be left without a representative. It's just wrong. Over 300 days in a time when the Congress will be dealing with the VRA bill, you know, farm bills, all the things that impact that particular district. And, you know, it took us 90 years, Melissa, from 1900 to 1990 to even get representation in the African American community.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yeah, I mean it's a crazy little district. You know, it's worth looking at it again. Congressman Ellis (ph) was sitting here at the table and when he saw how gerrymandered that district was.</p><p/><p>BARBER: Right.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: His mouth kind of fell open. And, of course, we know district 12 was challenged on racial gerrymandering, was redrawn to be a clearly part of then gerrymandered districts, which is legal and constitutional, but that said, you know, I guess I'm wondering, Reverend Barber, if I went down today to a barbershop in Greensboro and asked people, you know, do you know that you live in district 12 and do you know that you are not going to have a representative, what would they say about that?</p><p/><p>BARBER: Well, people are livid about it. I mean, they really are, because they recognize that this is taxation without representation. Now, the other part of that, Melissa, is that if we had free clearance in place, this decision of the governor would have to be pre-cleared. The fact is now that we don't because we're looking for this reauthorization of section four, it makes this even more problematic. The Republicans stalled on Mayor Watt being appointed and now governor McCrory is again being the governor of denial. He has denied Medicaid, denied unemployment, he's tried to deny voting rights and now he's trying to deny representation tor this district.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Hold on one second. I want to come out to you, Nancy, because you're having this reaction.</p><p/><p>GILES: I feel sick.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yeah. That feels to me like the kind of every woman, every man reaction, must be when they hear this story. So, tell me what you're thinking of this?</p><p/><p>GILES: Number one, how can the governor just say no with a little laugh in his voice, yeah, I'm complying with the law and not have a representative for that - for that area, for so many people, how is that allowed? I mean, again, I tell you one thing that's really interesting about this president because a lot of it filters down from that. I have learned more about how the government works on the lower, lower, lower, local, local levels than I have ever learned before and I'm just shocked that this many people cannot have a representative at such a crucial time for people to be represented.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Let's listen. Because I want to listen to this. Because Governor McCrory said it wasn't a particularly crucial time. He said it's a couple of months and it doesn't make any difference. Let's take a listen to that.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>GOV. MCCRORY: My decision was even supported by the very liberal editorial page of the Charlotte \"Observer\" and it was also supported by three of the African-American Democratic candidates that are running for Mel Watt's seat.</p><p/><p>I think the only difference in any other option was about two months. And Chuck, you know and I know that not much goes on in Washington between July and the election anyway, which is a sad commentary on Washington politics.</p><p/><p>TODD: I know.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Representative Ellison, you'll be doing anything there between July and November?</p><p/><p>ELLISON: I think we'll be pretty busy. We've been busy every single year. I've been in Congress. And here's the other thing. Just being in Washington and voting is not the only thing members of Congress do. Being in the district, listening to people, talking to them, holding meetings, talking about, you know, we're doing constituent services, helping people get passports and Social Security checks and VHS. It's all critical. This is one of the more amazing abdications of responsibility I've ever seen.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Well, I will say in terms of not abdicating responsibility, Mel Watt's team is staying in place in that district office to do some of that constituent service, because they clearly do care about that, but Reverend Barber, let me ask you about the other part of it we heard Governor McCrory say when he says hey, three of the six North Carolina 12 Democratic candidates, all of them African American, are down with the November election. We checked. That does seem to be true. Why would those candidates support this timing?</p><p/><p>BARBER: Well, that's why in the NAACP we have no permanent - there is no permanent enemies on the permanent interest. It doesn't matter if someone wants to, you know, even stay in bondage. All of us don't want to stay in bondage. What we want is constitutional representation. So that doesn't matter. He's called to govern for the best interest of the people, not to pick out two or three people and then decide to implement something that's going to cause taxation without representation. Melissa, here we are in North Carolina. He is denying this. We have the worst redistricting law since the 19th century. He passed the worst voters oppression law that we've seen since Jim Crow and now we are in the middle of this discussion about section 4 that's actually going to leave North Carolina uncovered, South Carolina uncovered, Alabama uncovered. These actions are unacceptable. This - we happen to have an amendment. It's sad that one day after the actual birthday of Dr. King we're having a discussion about voting rights that have taken us backwards add not forward.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: And particularly, I mean I just want to point out again for folks who may not know the North Carolina map. That district in part runs through Greensboro. Greensboro is where we saw those initial sit-ins of African-American men from North Carolina ANT sitting there on those Woolworth's counters, challenging precisely this sort of things. This was ground zero on the civil rights movement. It is ground zero now.</p><p/><p>BARBER: Franklin Graham - Franklin McCain was buried just yesterday who was a part of those civil rights movements. This district and the first district are the districts that were carved out as a result of the Voting Rights Act, but it took 90 years. I want people to hear this. 90 years for North Carolina to get representation African Americans in the U.S. Congress after George White was the last one pushed out in 1901 at the end of reconstruction. That's why we've got to be very serious. And you keep hearing me push on this issue about this section for the voter rights and what's been proposed. It is not good for us. We have to - anything that does not cover, pre-clear North Carolina, Alabama, Virginia and South Carolina, anything that gives people five chances to violate the law before we can be pre-cleared and anything that undermines the voter - says that voter I.D. is not a part of what can be used to decide pre-clear is just wrong, it's backwards. And we've got to spend .</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: That's not enough. I'll tell you what, Reverend Barber. I've got a little time on Tuesday. I think I'm going to come down to North Carolina and say hey to you. All right. Rev. Barber, thank you so much. We have much more to get to this morning, including Congressman Ellison's new memoirs. But first when we come back, my colleague Steve Kornacki, he has a major development in the New Jersey bridge story. Local politics matter, people.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: This morning we have new reporting connected to the administration of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and it's a story that broke right here on MSNBC only hours ago on \"Up with Steve Kornacki.\" The mayor of Hoboken told Steve in an exclusive television interview why she believes her city is being denied critical Hurricane Sandy aid. Now, you remember that the city of Hoboken in the aftermath of the storm was 80 percent under water. Hoboken remains vulnerable to another storm and the mayor says the reason her city is not getting the funds it needs has nothing to do with the fact that she didn't endorse Chris Christie for reelection. Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer says members of Christie's administration warned her that her town would be starved of hurricane relief money unless she approved a lucrative redevelopment plan favored by the governor.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>DAWN ZIMMER, MAYOR OF HOBOKEN: The bottom line is, it's not fair for the governor to hold Sandy funds hostage for the city of Hoboken, because he wants me to give back to one private developer and it's important that -- I know it's very complicated for the public to really understand all of this, but I have a legal obligation to follow the law, to bring balanced development to Hoboken. I cannot give a windfall to one property owner because the governor wants me to in exchange for the Sandy fund, so I'll tell you, I feel like I'm literally between a rock and a hard place.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: We should note that a spokesman for Governor Christie issued this statement. Quote, \"Mayor Zimmer has been effusive in her public praise of the governor's office and the assistance we've provided in terms of economic development and Sandy aid. What or who is driving her only now to say such outlandishly false things is anyone's guess.\" And \"Up with Steve Kornacki\" received this statement from the director of strategic communications with the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs. She say, quote, \"Mayor Zimmer's allegation that on May 16th, 2013 Commissioner Constable conditioned Hoboken's receipt of Sandy aid on her moving forward with a development project is categorically false.\" Joining the table now is Steve Kornacki, host of \"Up with Steve Kornacki.\" All right, Steve, these are major claims. It's also very complicated. So, I tried to get a general idea of it. What do you see as the key issue in this moment?</p><p/><p>STEVE KORNACKI, MSNBC ANCHOR: So, there are several things and the story line itself connects high ranking people in Christie's administration. It connects the Port Authority and the law firm that is run by the chairman of the Port Authority, David Samson, and Chris Christie's, you know, close confidant David Samson. And so, basically, what happened was, there's this plot of the land in Hoboken that's right for - potentially right for some kind of development. This group, the Rockefeller Group owns it and they're represented by Wolff and Samsons. The name of law firm is David Samson's law firm. He's the chairman of the Port Authority. Port Authority paid for a study on redeveloping on whether this land should be declared, you know, an area need a redevelopment -- it's a developer's dream to get this designation.</p><p/><p>The planning board in Hoboken did not go along with that designation, and when that happened, the mayor of Hoboken got a phone call from the governor's office, saying Lieutenant Governor is going to be in town in a couple of days. He wants to do an event sharp right with you. So they did the event at the sharp right, hey, business is open, posting - she says lieutenant governor pulled her aside after said and said, listen, this is not right, this is not the way it's supposed to be. But if you want your Sandy aid, all (inaudible) is being held, but if you want it, you have to move forward on this development project. You have to move forward on it.</p><p/><p>A couple of days later, she's doing this event, the mayor is doing this event on public television at Monmouth University, a Sandy anniversary event, and the Department - or the commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, you saw her quoted there, is on stage next to her. And she says they're both miked up, they're waiting to go on and he makes the same explicit threat to her, linking Sandy funds to this development project.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: OK, so a couple of things I want to be sure that we get on the table here. There's not at this point any allegation that the Rockefeller Group itself has been -- they just seem to be part of this, but not that they commissioned anyone to say this or to do this. Is that right?</p><p/><p>KORNACKI: That's right. And in terms of what you have, there's no evidence pointing to like any kind of wrongdoing right now by like David Samson. What we know is his law firm represents the Rockefeller group. You have - we have emails from people of his law firm copying Davis Samson, the chairman of the Port Authority, and writing to the people in Hoboken trying to apply pressure to get this thing moving on, you know.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: No, obviously this mayor is now going to come under - Mayor Zimmer is going to come under significant scrutiny about whether or not there are reasons beyond just sort of her saying in this moment, look, I'm trying to do what is right. Right? In part because this is occurring at the time that the bridge scandal has become national news. But this is not linked directly to the bridge scandal. So, folks are going to ask, why talk about this now, why not tell it when it happened. How do you see this proceeding in terms of the fundamental questions that are going to be asked of her on what she's alleging here?</p><p/><p>KORNACKI: I have to say just as we're reviewing the story this week that I find her very credible for a few reasons. And one of the reasons is, I think people looking at this nationally might be inclined to say it's a Democratic mayor, Republican governor, he's down. Oh, of course, this is Democratic way doing a pile on. There's been - there's a faction of Democrats in New Jersey who are pro Chris Christie Democrats. And Dawn Zimmer in many ways was the face of the pro-Chris Christie Democrats. When she came to office in Hoboken, she endorsed his local property tax initiative. This is controversial among Democrats. His first town hall meeting on the subject, she invited him to Hoboken to have it. He was her partner in many ways on many projects in Hoboken. She continues to this day.</p><p/><p>On our show, we asked her about Chris Christie, she believes his first four years as governor, there were a lot of good things. She believes that were accomplished during that. It's just that she got caught up in this redevelopment issue. It was on opposite side of him, and it's apparently, this project was apparently so important to him and then there's the fact of this diary. I mean she recorded this in her diary at the time. She shared the diary with us. And, you've got, you know, mundane entries in the diary and then she's talking, just pouring her heart out about trying to grapple with the Chris Christie she believed in versus the Chris Christie who's now making - his administration making threats.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Can you stay with us? We've got a table of folks here including a Republican who I want to ask in part does this ever get hot enough that Republicans are going to want Chris Christie to step down as the head of RGA? I also want to just sort of open up, because these are new revelations, and I think there are questions that all of us have about it. So, stick with us for just a little bit longer.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: We're back and talking about the new developments in the question of Chris Christie and his use of - potentially use of political influence that were alleged today on \"Up with Steve Kornacki.\" And I just wanted to give you all an opportunity to ask Steve some of the question about what we've learned.</p><p/><p>GILES: Well, to start with, Steve, I've lived in (INAUDIBLE). I've been here 13 years, which is the neighboring county to Hoboken. So, I know and I have a lot of friends that live there how damaged they were during Sandy and how they're still struggling, so I guess I would say is that do you think why Dawn Zimmer comes out now and talks about the disparity between the money that she asks for and the money that she got? The town is still suffering.</p><p/><p>KORNACKI: Yeah, I mean, look, there's one last chance, realistically speaking now. That Christie got a second pot of money from HUD, that he can get out in grants, but there's one realistic last chance for Hoboken to get the money that it's looking for to save itself from a future storm and it comes from this sort of a race to the top style competition that HUD has. And Hoboken is a finalist thread, there were one of ten finalists for that, so it may be that, you know, this attracts a little bit of attention to it. Because we didn't have time on the air, but they took me through off the air. The resiliency planning that they've done, you know, she actually - she sits on - she was appointed by <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>to his climate change panel at the end of December. She has spoken around the world on resiliency issues. They have some topnotch, you know, internationally respected resiliency work and proposals the place.</p><p/><p>GILES: Right.</p><p/><p>KORNACKI: So they are hopefully they can get this grant.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: Let me ask you about political resiliency.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: So after the news broke on the bridge thing, he comes and does this long press conference and everybody's thinking, wow, maybe he's going to survive this. Can he survive this?</p><p/><p>KORNACKI: Well, this is - we talk about like hardball politics in New Jersey, and, you know, that governor, whoever was going to take what leverage here she has and they are going to use it to get what they want. And people kind of accept that, but this is Sandy. This is Sandy. This is a governor who part of his political rehab this past week, goes down to the shore.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: That's right.</p><p/><p>KORNACKI: Goes down to the Sandy towns and he's like - hey, everybody. Do you remember me? I'm the guy who led you through Sandy.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: And we're all willing to put up with varieties of kind of corruption. I mean that's, you know, I've lived in Chicago, I've lived now in New Orleans, right? There is this like - when Blagojevich appear to be selling a Senate seat that was, right, kind of the end of it and you know we will send the governor in Louisiana to jail. Like I mean so corruption and hardball politics is one thing, but like when you get to a certain level, and these are all still allegations at this point, but they do seem potentially harmful in a way to me, Katon, that I mean this is the man who's the head of the RGA. And it's going to come to a point where he's going to get a phone call saying you've been the head of the RGA. It's bad for us.</p><p/><p>GILES: Republican Governors Association?</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Oh, sorry, Republican Governors Association.</p><p/><p>DAWSON: Well, one thing I can tell you about Republican Party politics and especially presidential primary politics, and go back to Mark Sanford meeting his fair, apologizing and immediately resigning from the RGA. He didn't want his personal situation to impact what is to me the most important thing in politics. Much more important the last thing than presidential politics or governor seats. That's where redistricting happens, that's where rubber meets the road. That's where we govern as Republicans, the 157 million Americans who control in GOP controlled states. We don't control .</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: I'm frightened.</p><p/><p>DAWSON: But you should be, but my part - my part is this apology -- and I talked to Steve. I've listened to other people thinking this is Jersey, this is the Jersey shore. The Republicans did watch him call the president in the end, which we saw was very unusual in the middle of a presidential race. We saw that as cementing his re-election. That's what - that's how I saw it. We're going to go and cement. So my point is, you know, this is one more shoe to drop on this. And you can apologize, but you can't cover up the fact that if you didn't tell the truth and that's what's coming next.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Steve, this has been amazing reporting. These are real issues. This is not like made up sort of outrage and so I appreciate your reporting and that of your team. Thank you to Steve Kornacki. Your team are delivering great reporting on this. And up next, what I found so moving about this book by Congressman Ellison. For all the bad we've been saying there's a lot of optimism about America in this book.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Congressman Keith Ellison's mom is from Louisiana. And she makes gumbo. And on nights when young Keith would bring friends for dinner, his mother never turned anyone away. Instead she'd just some water to the gumbo so that there would be enough for all. Today, Representative Keith Ellison says we need to do the same thing in our national policy. Rather than turn the hungry away, we need to add some water to the gumbo and practice what he calls the politics of generosity. Now, in his new book called \"My Country to the V: My Faith, My Family, Our Future, \" Ellison shares his story from his Detroit roots to being the first non- white person Minnesota has ever elected to Congress, and the first Muslim American ever elected to Congress. He also outlines what the politics of generosity look like. So Representative Keith Ellison, tell me what are the politics of generosity? What does it look like?</p><p/><p>ELLISON: Well, the politics of generosity stem from the idea that we all need to eat, we all need to retire, we all want to see our kids get a good education and develop our minds. Our country is the richest country in the history of the world and this country has never been richer than it is now.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yeah.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: We can make sure that there is a reliable path toward economic security for every American.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: There literally is enough gumbo in the pot for everybody.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: There's enough.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: We just have got to share it.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: We don't have to send anybody out. And the thing is, is that we have a politics of scarcity and the politics of scarcity is there's not enough, we have got to cut Head Start, we've got to have chained CPI, so this - because the seniors are getting too much money. But this is all driven by the idea that there's not enough, but I believe that there is enough. And, as a matter of fact, there is enough. And the only question is shall we share it. So like, you know, this issue of low wages and the minimum wage, we've seen dramatic profits being reaped from our nation's corporations, in McDonald's, Walmart. These are wildly profitable companies and yet they are paying people $7.25. $8.25. Stuff like that. It's like look, you know, you may not have as massive a profit as you had.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yeah.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: But maybe if the people who work for you could, you know, afford the hamburgers that they are cooking.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yeah. It would stimulate the economy. We know that when poor folks have a little bit more, they spend it and it stimulates the economy. In addition to our politics of generosity. You also outlined the politics of courage. And specifically look to Representative Barbara Lee. And I'd like to listen to the moment that you signal us to here.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>REP. BARBARA LEE (D) CALIFORNIA: September 11th changed the world. Our deepest fears now haunt us. Yet I am convinced that military action will not prevent further acts of international terrorism against the United States. Some of us must say let's step back for a moment, let's just pause, just for a minute, and think through the implications of our actions today so that this does not spiral out of control.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Your response is there.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: Well, it spiraled out of control a little bit, didn't it?</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yep. ELLISON: You know, I mean Iraq, longest - you know, longer than Vietnam. All kinds of domestic issues were unraveling, these NSA issues to this moment that stem from the Patriot Act, which was sparked by that tragic moment in September 11, 2001. I think Barbara Lee is an amazing example of courage. Because you can listen to that tape. And tell she's scared.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: She can feel it.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: You can feel it, because if you've had the pleasure of being in her presence, you know, she's bold, she's always got a wonderful smile, but in that moment she is feeling the weak of the moment, but she -- that's courage, right? Courage isn't not being scared.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: It's moving through your fear and Barbara Lee, Paul Wellstone, you know, these people, you know, they inspire me, you know, and that's who I want to be like when I grow up.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: We're basically out of time, but I don't want to leave without pointing to a moment of courage of your own. Part of what that post-9/11 and the spiraling out of control Iraq was also the - the kind of generation of an anti-Muslim bias in the country.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: Yes.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: that was articulated more frequently and yet you in the moment of being sworn into the U.S. Congress put your hand on Thomas Jefferson's Koran, which I see as an act of courage and the reaffirmation of the faith of the American people that we can have differing faith and be one people.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: Yeah, I mean that's the idea - from many to one. E Pluribus Unum, we are united in our belief that all Americans have due process, have the right, have equal dignity and yet we come from very diverse places and it's all right. You know, the bottom line is that nothing - none of the great things about America are guaranteed. We have to fight for these things. People have laid their lives on the line for them. And if you look at the reverend down there with the \"Moral Mondays\", they're laying their life on the line for the great America now. All I want to say -- I know we've got to wrap is that look, you know, the pessimists are not the realists. Because good things happen all the time. We were in slavery, now we're not. We were in Jim Crow, now we are not. Women couldn't vote. Now they can. My point is the people of this time have got to buck up and make a better world for the people to come.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Because the better always happens, but it only happens.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: Only happens.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: through struggle.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: That's it.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: To read an excerpt of the congressman's new book please stop by the Grio.com. Congressman Keith Ellison, thank you for spending time with us this morning.</p><p/><p>ELLISON: Thanks.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: And coming up next, turning the tide on reproductive rights, how women are fighting back against the mounting restrictions and the frank discussion about the ugly and even threatening harassment that someone is faced online. There's, of course, more Nerdland at the top of the hour.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: (AUDIO GAP) Melissa Harris-Perry.</p><p/><p>Nerdland, I know that as nerds, we would rather be lovers and thinker, not fighters. But today, I want us to channel our inner Sun Tzu, because I want to talk about \"The Art of War\".</p><p/><p>Now, make no mistake -- the reproductive health policies we have seen emerge from statehouses all across the country amount to nothing short of an all-out assault to take back the gains made by Roe v. Wade.</p><p/><p>This is no brute force, smash and grab operation we're talking about it here. Uh-uh. This is an efficient, methodical and so far, highly effective effort to a road of reproductive choice protections guaranteed to women by the Supreme Court's decision in Roe.</p><p/><p>In an article in this month's \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, the president of the anti-reproductive rights group Americans United for Life is quoted sounding like she's taking a page straight out of Sun Tzu's book. According to the magazine, in a 2011 interview, she said, \"We don't make frontal attacks. Never attack where the enemy is strongest.\"</p><p/><p>Pay attention here to the strategy because if you don't look closely, you might not see it until it's too late. It is a slow loss of liberty and autonomy by a thousand tiny attacks from a steady onslaught of policies mostly from Republican-led state legislatures, more abortion restrictions passed in the last three years than in the last two decades, according to the Guttmacher Institute.</p><p/><p>Everything from Trap laws that impose burdensome and medical unnecessary requirements on abortion providers that can force them out of business to attacks on health care coverage that prevent women from paying for abortions using private insurance or policies purchased on the new health exchanges. Even mandatory counseling that can sometimes include information that is irrelevant or misleading. That visit often followed by a 24-hour waiting period and an additional trip to a provider before the procedure can be performed, requirements that women seeking abortions must first undergo ultrasounds to listen to the beat of its heart. Then, there are 20-week abortion bans that posed a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade allowance for abortions, up to the point of viability at 24 weeks.</p><p/><p>These aggressive policies attempt to lay bare the big picture for the final decisive battle, a Supreme Court showdown to roll back the gains of Roe v. Wade. And this week when the enemies of reproductive rights came knocking at the gates, the court refused to let them in. The justices punted on considering Arizona's 20-week abortion ban, a case that could have forced a challenge to Roe v. Wade. But that was this time advocates for reproductive justice, no it's not going to last.</p><p/><p>That's why they're devising a new tactical approach of their own, going on offense in this policy fight and using that same weapon, policy to fight back. Think of it as like political judo, it's a martial arts practice that enable a smaller fighter to defeat a bigger stronger opponent using a key strategy, turning the opponent's size and strength from an asset into a liability.</p><p/><p>NARAL Pro-choice America is taking all of those restrictive abortion measures and making this pledge to the governors who signed for the law. You stood for these laws, you signed these laws, now, if you're up for re- election this year, you're going to have to run on them.</p><p/><p>This week in \"The Nation\" magazine, NARAL president Elise Hogue told the writer Zoey Carpenter that the strategy is to shift the momentum and the reproductive justice fight to, quote, \"force these anti-choice extremists who hold political office to actually run on and defend anti-choice records.\"</p><p/><p>Joining me now David S. Cohen, professor of law at Drexel University, Anthea Butler, professor of religious studies and graduate chair of the religion of the University of Pennsylvania, Nancy Northup, who is president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, and Katon Dawson, national Republican consultant, and former chair of the South Carolina Republican Party.</p><p/><p>So, Nancy, self-defense teaches women get on the ground, kick with your legs, don't try to go right -- you know, don't try to go arm to arm because that's not necessarily where the strength is. Is this what this new strategy is, all right, you guys want to sign this, run on this?</p><p/><p>NANCY NORTHUP, CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS: Well, right. I think we're going to see that last year was an absolute turnaround point in the fight over women's access to reproductive health care. We saw going on offense right and left.</p><p/><p>We saw Wendy Davis do that filibuster in Texas, and she is now soaring in her run for governor of Texas. We saw Albuquerque voters turn down a 20- week ban. When they got a chance to go to the poll instead of the politicians, they said, no, we don't want these kind of extreme measures.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p/><p>NORTHUP: We saw the introduction in the U.S. Congress, the Women's Health Protection Act with 33 cosponsors in the Senate, more than 90 in the House, which says we even got to stop these restrictions at the state level. Your zip code can't determine whether you have constitutional rights.</p><p/><p>So, last year was a turnaround and it's going keep on going.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: All right. So, I want to go back for a second to the actual strategy of opponents of reproductive rights for a moment, because it does feels to me, David, as though the actual Roe v. Wade decision itself is part of what opens up and allows this possibility that the multiple trimesters, the notion that there is a point in which the state has an interest.</p><p/><p>So, talk to me. Is Roe a sufficient decision for us to continue to rest reproductive rights on?</p><p/><p>DAVID S. COHEN, DREXEL UNIVERSITY: Well, Roe had promised but the problem was it was cut back in Casey in 1992, because Casey allowed -- Casey was the Supreme Court case that allowed a lot more restrictions from the state. It was basically the Supreme Court saying that you can do things that are burdensome on women's rights as long as they're not unduly burdensome and ever since Casey, we've seen the courts and lower courts be more receptive to infringement on women's rights and women's access to abortion.</p><p/><p>So, Casey has really opened up the floodgates and with Justice Kennedy who's perceived as the swing vote really seemingly approving almost any restriction, as long as it's not an absolute criminalization of abortion, it's really troublesome what Casey has allowed.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: So, Katon, as much as we talked in the last hour about the ways in which Democrats often kind of can't hold themselves completely together to have a clear strategy, in the case of women's reproductive rights, I've got to say. I got to agree with Nancy, this was the moment when on the left, you saw clear language, war on women. It became the framework. Republicans had to address whether or not they were, in fact, committing a war on women, right, and once you give up the framing, you start to lose.</p><p/><p>Are you guys going to lose? I mean really begin to lose, if this is the central issue on which the Republicans are forced to run.</p><p/><p>KATON DAWSON, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, Republicans will lose in the primaries if they back up on the pro-life movement. That's what will happen. It is the basis especially in the Southeast corridor where I practice my business. It's the basis that among other thing it's in every party's platform. It's in the national party's platform. It's one of things that divides the two parties. There are pro-life Democrats but they don't vote at the ballot box.</p><p/><p>Pro-life Republicans vote that at the ballot box, whether it'd be a presidential election or any other election. And those are just facts.</p><p/><p>It's also -- you hear politicians and I do a lot of times when they have divisive crowds talk about the civil rights of the unborn and the civil rights -- and I know that that will start a whole other discussion, but we -- this is -- this is the terminology we use. We live in a country that spends enormous resources on trying to save nine coal miners in Pennsylvania, enormous resources on trying to talk somebody off the Brooklyn Bridge.</p><p/><p>And this is -- the pro-life movement didn't stand down. They're still there. They're still so strong and they will hold you accountable. So, it will be a fight but it's going to cross both parties' lines.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: All right. All right. Stick with me. You've drawn some things that I think have become central parts of how we talk about this. I don't want to say I disagree with you on the civil rights.</p><p/><p>DAWSON: I think.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: In fact, actually what I want to do is when we come back, I want to make the claim if that's going to be the discourse, if discourse is the personhood and that from the beginning fertilized eggs have civilized rights, let's go ahead and do that and let's talk about what the civil rights of all children ought to be and whether or not Republicans can get on that set of policy agenda. Stay right there when we come back.</p><p/><p>Also, why 35-B is so critical in the debate over reproductive rights.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Years ago, I accompanied a friend to an appointment to end an unwanted pregnancy. Now, I expected to hold her hand, to sit with her, to hug her, to cry with her if it came to that.</p><p/><p>But what I hadn't anticipated, with having to shield her while we walked the gauntlet just to get in the door. A crowd of people, some shouting, some quietly imploring, some trying to condemn her, others trying to convince to change her mind, showing images, all turning her from a woman simply seeking a medical procedure into a target.</p><p/><p>That was a day I first became aware of the vulnerability of woman who lacked the resources to end a pregnancy quietly and privately to a personal position. This week, these women, those whose reproductive choices are subject to public scrutiny in abortion clinics were the heart of the case considered by the Supreme Court. At issue was a Massachusetts law passed in 2007 to create a buffer zone, 35 feet of safe space outside of clinics, to separate patients from protesters.</p><p/><p>The question before the court was whether the buffer zones were a reasonable response to a history of violence and harassment outside the clinics, or an unconstitutional intrusion into the right of free speech.</p><p/><p>So, for me, part of working as an escort experience was going to that whole point that Katon was bringing up earlier, about, oh, civil rights and the civil rights of the unborn and I keep thinking, but what about the rights of the born, of those who are walking around and experiencing life. What about the rights of these women, of their children who are often already preexisting before they made the decision to terminate this pregnancy.</p><p/><p>Can we possibly push the right to have to respond to that?</p><p/><p>ANTHEA BUTLER, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA: Yes, exactly. I think part of what's going on is that we have sacralized this one piece so much that real people, real life women who are in a position where they have to make these decisions are being ignored.</p><p/><p>The whole thing about being in front of the clinics where you see the fetuses and chopped up stuff and everything else, this is the scare tactic. But what was so interesting about that \"Rolling Stone\" article by Janet Rottman (ph) is that she says, you know, Randall Terry news, like we couldn't get any traction doing this one thing, so we changed it this way, it will be easier.</p><p/><p>And I think we need a buffer zone. It's not about taking away anybody's free speech. You can stand outside in 35 feet and do what you want. But when women are being accosted, you know, presented with screaming and yelling and saying you're killing your baby, and all this other kind of stuff, you're impinging upon their rights as well. And I thing that the people who feel so strongly pro-life don't realize they're infringing on the rights of others who are trying to exercise their rights to do what they want to.</p><p/><p>Rights go both ways. They don't go one way just because you have a hardened ideology.</p><p/><p>And I think to go back to Katon's point, for a minute, I think that you may say pro, but if we start putting this the negative and making people run on the negative part of what is happening, the negative piece that women can't get prenatal care, they can't get gynecological examinations, they can't get all the kind of care that they would need, not to be in a position the get pregnant in the first place, then that makes it a different kind of run. It's not just pro-life. It's pro \"you don't want these women to have a life\". And that's the point.</p><p/><p>It's like if you change this conversation, it becomes something else different altogether and that's where I think there's an attraction, especially with younger women who want to keep their reproductive rights, who might be conservative but they don't want to have to deal with this whole thing about you're going to tell me what to do with my body.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: And one aspect of that, I mean, I think, you know, what you're saying there is key, and this, you know, we typically think of it as the protesters versus the women who are seeking medical services. But there's also the clinic providers, there's the doctors and the nurses and the receptionists who themselves have been in danger. That's part of that 35 feet buffer zone too as well.</p><p/><p>COHEN: Buffer zones are good because they protect women who are seeking basic medical care from being harassed but they also prevent violence and help to ensure safety of clinical workers. We're not talking just doctors. We're talking anyone who works at a clinic, who suffers harassment daily, threats daily. And we have to remember that in Massachusetts in particular, there's a real history of violence.</p><p/><p>In 1994, two clinic receptionists at Planned Parenthood, in pre-term, Shannon Lowney (ph) and Leann Nichols (ph), were murdered because they were abortion providers. That has happened to six other people working in abortion in this country's history. Most recently, Dr. George Tiller in 2009.</p><p/><p>This is a real risk that people suffer through every day to get to work and to work, and buffer zones don't cure the problem, but they provide a space. Paul Hill who was one of the protesters who killed a doctor in Florida stood right outside the clinic. He was able to get close access to the clinic in Pensacola, Florida. There was no buffer zone. Buffer zones help protect people's safety.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Nancy --</p><p/><p>NORTHUP: Well, I was just going to say, they also allow -- if you think about it, you know, we have a history of people who want to prevent others from exercising their constitutional rights -- their right to go to school, their right to vote, their right to access with respective health services and all the buffer zone is saying stand aside, let people through. You should haven't to go through a gauntlet of protesters to vote, or to go to school or to get health care.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: And the people who have to walk that gauntlet are a subset of all the women who have terminations. I just -- I just want to always kind of point this out, that if you are wealthy and have either private insurance or the capacity to pay individually, you can walk into a doctor's office. It is not targeted in this way. You can walk into a hospital that is not targeted this way.</p><p/><p>It is a very specific group of people who end up with this kind of shaming, potential violence, angst, sort of directed at them.</p><p/><p>NORTUP: Oh, that's right. And also, people who are also coming to get their, you know, their --</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Their pap smears and their birth control pills.</p><p/><p>NORTHUP: Birth control pills and all that.</p><p/><p>And again, this does -- I have protested many times in my life. Of course, I support the right to express an opinion.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Of course, of course.</p><p/><p>NORTHUP: This is just a law about not blockading, not obstructing, not congregating in front of the clinic. Step aside, let the people through, express your opinions peacefully.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: So, that does feel like to me like that is consistent, Katon, with Republican values. Or conservative values, that -- of course we can have differences of opinion. Of course, we know that the issue of reproductive rights is a central dividing line but that your opinion doesn't, in fact, give you the right to stand there and block someone from something that is constitutional protected.</p><p/><p>DAWNSON: You're exactly right. And it would be my personal opinion, especially I think in the home state that I live, that anybody that puts their hands on a woman at any time, or -- I can pretty well assure you that in South, they'll go to jail almost immediately.</p><p/><p>And if that's the tactic they want to take, then there's a good chance we'll put them in jail. Now, I understand the protests. I understand that. But when you start infringing on these zones we're talking about, attacking a woman for making that decision, you can attack in all kind of ways.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: I mean, no, these are mostly verbal attacks. These are shaming and yelling and sort of narrating and showing the images. They're not -- I mean, we do know they can be attached to acts of violence but I'm not suggesting that those protesters inside those 35 feet are necessarily reaching out and grabbing but you do feel when you're walking with someone, when you're serving as a guide, you do sort of put your hands up over that person in part to put your head down.</p><p/><p>But that I mean, like can you imagine if you're going for kidney dialysis, or for a podiatrist appointment, or for any other medical appointment, and you have to work through that sort of you know, sort of shaming experience?</p><p/><p>NORTHUP: And Massachusetts is saying everybody step aside.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes. The pro and --</p><p/><p>NORTHUP: Pro-choice, step aside.</p><p/><p>DAWSON: Both sides. True.</p><p/><p>NORTHUP: Just let people through. Make your points to the side. The First Amendment's protected, but you can't congregate and block access.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: More on this when we come back, the question of whether or not it is time to be on offense and what offense looks like.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Supporters of reproductive right got a victory in North Carolina on Friday. A federal judge struck down a North Carolina law that required abortion providers to give women an ultrasound and describe the image even if a woman asks them not to. The judge ruled that the law was a violation of free speech.</p><p/><p>So, David, why -- how is that a free speech violation there?</p><p/><p>COHEN: Well, in this regard, it's telling doctors what to say, and it's infringing on the doctor/patient relationship, because if a doctor says that I can treat this women and I can have -- ensure her health in a particular way and the state saying you have to do something different, then that's an infringement on that relationship.</p><p/><p>And also, it goes beyond that, though. It's also about the state saying that we know what's best for women. Women don't know what's best for women. Doctors don't know what's best for women. Counselors don't know what's best for women.</p><p/><p>But we, the legislators, who have probably never been in an abortion clinic, have never -- a lot of them -- ever been pregnant or can't get pregnant since most of them are men, they say, we know what's best for women, when it's really -- women who know what's best for women, in consultation with their doctors and anyone else they're talking about.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes, Nancy, to me the ultrasound laws felt like they presume that women do not know what is happening. And it's hard for me to tell whether they're talking sincerely like, oh, honey, you just don't know, let me explain it to you, or if it's just about shaming you so that a difficult circumstance becomes even more difficult.</p><p/><p>But is there some reason we cannot simply trust that women are fully moral agents as citizens capable of making hard choices, easy choices, all kinds of choices, including this choice?</p><p/><p>NORTHUP: Well, you're right and that's, of course, what the Supreme Court has said again and again, is that there is a zone of privacy around which people can make the important decisions of their lives. That's what this is about and whether those decisions are about -- who to marry, the size of your family, how you raise your children, your religious beliefs, that's what the promise of het Constitution is, and that's what the stakes are here.</p><p/><p>In a free society, we make these critical decisions for ourselves. I would say the ultrasound laws, and the judge really got this in the North Carolina case. We're thrilled with yesterday's win.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p/><p>NORTHUP: It's not even just that they're saying that women don't know what they're doing. It's plain punitive because the North Carolina law said if the woman says, \"I don't want to see this and I don't want to hear this,\" she turns away, she covers her ears, the doctor is supposed to keep on napping at her and yapping at her, and so that shows that it's not about information. It's about some kind of a punitive performance that the doctor's supposed to go through, in violation of her or his ethics as well as the patient's wishes.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: You know, your point is just well-taken, that I like this image of a zone of privacy. It's very much like the buffer zone law, but in a kind of broader sense, because similarly we would not presume that if an ultrasound showed certain kinds of field deformities that one should be required to have an abortion, right?</p><p/><p>NORTHUP: Of course, of course.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: So the question of making difficult choices ought to be left within that buffer zone, right, of our privacy where we are allowed to make tough choices that concur with our morals, with our ethics, with our situation.</p><p/><p>David S. Cohen and Nancy Northup, Katon Dawson, thank you so much.</p><p/><p>Anthea is sticking around a little longer. I want to tell you about special online event this Wednesday at 2:00 p.m. Eastern. MSNBC national reporter Irin Carmon will take your questions on the 41st anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Go to MHP.MSNBC.com to submit your questions right now.</p><p/><p>Up next, the frightening side of social media and why so many women are being harassed online.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Last month, a Pew Research study found that 73 percent of adults now use social networking sites. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are the new tools of our professional and personal lives. We use them to get information to stay connected to friends, to connect with those who share our interest, and sometimes just to kill time while wait in line.</p><p/><p>Our virtual lives are an important part of our real lives. The places where we work and learn and play and relax are increasingly mediated and affected by our online selves. Behind the avatars and 140 characters are flesh and blood people. That mean that what happens online matters, and what is happening to women online should give us pause.</p><p/><p>According to the volunteer organization working to halt online abuse, of the nearly 4,000 people reporting online stalking and harassment from 2000 to 2012, 72.5 percent were women, harassment of women. And what was being done and not done to stop it is a subject of the cover story of the \"Pacific-Standard\" magazine, entitled \"Why Women Aren't Welcome on the Internet\". The author, Amanda Hess, is herself a victim of online stalking and harassment.</p><p/><p>And her article includes -- or maybe survivor of it. Her article includes several of the specific attacks that she has received via social media. They are so gruesome and so vulgar that I'm nothing going to read them verbatim here. But they include threats of sexual assault and murder.</p><p/><p>Amanda writes, \"No matter how hard we attempt to ignore it, this type of gender harassment and the sheer volume of it, a severe implication for women status on the Internet, threats of rape, death, and stalking can overpower our emotional bandwidth, take up our time and cost us money through legal fees, online protection services and missed wages.</p><p/><p>Joining me today is Amanda Hess, contributor to \"Pacific-Standard\". Also here, Anthea Butler, professor of religious studies and graduate chair of religion at the University of Pennsylvania. Nancy Giles, contributor to \"CBS Sunday Morning.\" \"Feministe\" editor and \"Guardian\" columnist Gil Filipovic. And from San Francisco, Elon James White, managing director and host of \"This Week in Blackness.\"</p><p/><p>So happy to have you all here.</p><p/><p>NANCY GILES, CBS SUNDAY MORNING: Thank you.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: So, I want to talk to you about this article and the response you've been getting.</p><p/><p>AMANDA HESS, CONTRIBUTOR, PACIFIC STANDARD: I wrote this article after I received my most recent sort of bouts this past summer and the threats were obviously distressing. It was an anonymous person on Twitter threatening to come to my house to rape me, to cut off my head.</p><p/><p>On the one hand, that's so completely ludicrous thing to say and that's, you know, probably not going to happen. But on the other hand, it's so confusing when you receive threats like that because people are telling you, don't worry about it, it's just the Internet, it's not going to happen. Others are saying it's your responsibility to track this person down and to prosecute them. And some people are saying if it's so bad then why don't you just quit Twitter.</p><p/><p>And so, the threats are bad. What's really confusing is how as person you're supposed to deal with them.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes. You know, we were just talking about the gauntlet that women have to walk in order to receive termination services for pregnancy. And these are the gauntlets you have to walk on when you log onto the Internet, right? And does feel to me, like we have to keep making claim that what occurs online matters in the real world, like even if we were trying to think of the segment, I keep think there just are going to be people who feel like, turn it off. Don't go over there, stop going over there in virtual world because that world does not matter.</p><p/><p>Why does it matter?</p><p/><p>JILL FILIPOVIC, EDITOR, FEMINISTE: Well, I think the big disconnect is exactly what you're say and what Amanda's piece highlighted, is that there is a sense, I think especially among law enforcement and U.S. laws, that what happens on the Internet is some sort of virtual reality, or as increasingly, we live our lives online. We see photos of our friends' babies on Facebook.</p><p/><p>We interact on Twitter. I initially met Amanda online --</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes.</p><p/><p>FILIPOVIC: -- through Feministe blogging. You know, I followed you on Twitter before I ever met you on your show or meet you. So, we increasingly network online. My career is writing online. I don't write for a newspaper. I write for a blog and for the \"Guardians\" Web site. You can't tell us to just get off the Internet.</p><p/><p>And when you have people coming into your online spaces, coming at you in Twitter and comments on your blogs, essentially telling you, you deserve to be sexually assaulted or even killed for what you're saying, that's just as intimidating as, you know, walking through a hallway at work and having somebody hiss at you through a doorway that you should be raped or killed.</p><p/><p>I think that's what people don't necessarily fully appreciate about the lives that women live and what we receive online in terms of harassment.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Jill, your point is about us knowing one another initially virtually. It's also true with my friendship with Elon.</p><p/><p>I mean, Elon, you and I became actual sort of friends, colleagues, following one another's work all in the virtual world before actually getting to know one another, and, you know, I was saying that part of my life is over. It so ugly in that world now that I just can't engage in the ways that I initially engaged in social media that, in fact, led to valuable, you know, professional relationships because it is so ugly there.</p><p/><p>Talk to me a little bit about how then you can begin to navigate something that is that ugly.</p><p/><p>ELON JAMES WHITE, THIS WEEK IN BLACKNESS: I'm not exactly sure, especially with how women are spoken to. Even when they say, the whole thing about, oh, just don't be there, it's like that's -- it's a terrible idea because like for me personally, my entire career right now is based on the social media platforms that I've been using, that I use for my company, for the relationships I use. So, basically you're telling women you're not allowed to have that opportunity.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Right, exactly.</p><p/><p>WHITE: And it's unfair and it's unreasonable. And when people say that, it's literally just ignoring the reality of the world that we're currently living in. And so, to actually try to navigate those things, a lot of people do things for their own mental health, like blocking people in a heartbeat. Just like, no, that's just -- that's not sometimes enough because if you go to an environment and you just know when you go into that environment, you're going to be abused, whether it's, quote/unquote, \"fake or not fake,\" it's still abuse and you don't want to do it.</p><p/><p>Heck, these days, I don't want to log onto Twitter, let alone if someone was threatening to rape me.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes, yes, absolutely.</p><p/><p>Anthea, you have -- you have tweeted pretty honestly and openly about how these cyber bullies jump off the page, jump off, jump off the 140 characters of Facebook or the blog comments and show up in your real life, that it is part of the active attempt to destroy people's credibility, their capacity to have jobs, that these have very real consequences.</p><p/><p>BUTLER: Yes, they do. I can say to you that and you know this and a lot of other academics know this, that once you say something that somebody doesn't like, they start calling them off. They call your provost's office, they call your dean's office. We want to get them off, you want to shut them up, we want to do all kinds of things.</p><p/><p>But what they don't seem to understand is that we are real life people. If they walk up to me and wanted to say this to my face, I'm like, come on, because basically, I'm like, I dare you. Because I bet you won't say it to my face first of all, and second of all, the Penn University police will not let you get that close to me, OK? So, that's part of it.</p><p/><p>But the other part of it is that sometimes, this is very coordinated and I think one of the things we have to talk about are how other bloggers, other twitters, other people who are active in social media actually attack other people and there are sites and we all know this one by somebody who just got sold to Salem Communications and everybody knows who that is, who'd send people to come and attack you, when they don't like what they do.</p><p/><p>So, these are coordinated attacks. These are not just the random guys sit around his boxer shorts saying \"I hate this woman.\" But they are also coordinate. They are paid for. They are people who say let's go do this to this person because we want to take them down.</p><p/><p>And so, what I want people to understand, especially Twitter to understand, is that this service that was so great two or three years ago is now a cesspool of crap, and it's so hard to use it the way we used to be able to use it, to talk and reduce it.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Right, right. So, I do want -- I do want to be careful that -- this isn't exclusively a Twitter issue.</p><p/><p>BUTLER: No.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: And that part of -- I think as we come back, we'll talk a little bit about solutions in part because, again, I met Jill on Twitter, I met Elon on Twitter.</p><p/><p>And not only that, but in a world where there is so much information, I use the signaling effort. I want to follow people I disagree with, I want to follow people I agree with, because it's valuable to me to get that information. So, when I get back, we'll talk a little bit about the solutions look like and whether or not we can redeem the value, right, all the positive values in this context.</p><p/><p>(CXOMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: We're back to talk about the \"Pacific Standard\" article, why women are not welcome on the Internet and sort of all the questions about online harassment, that it raises.</p><p/><p>Nancy, I want to get you in here.</p><p/><p>GILES: Well, you know, it's so funny. I mean, among other things, I'm a woman, I love being a woman. It's hard being a woman. It's just hard, all right?</p><p/><p>And CBS pays me because they value my opinions, which is lovely. And you have me on for the same reason. If your opinion isn't something that matches up with people, I'll say men for the most part because I can't believe other women are saying the same kind of things back at us, the kind of sexual violent imagery, the kind of violent attacking on how you look, how you smell, these really vicious things that just are exponentially over the top and beyond the pale, it's fascinating.</p><p/><p>As a woman, I wouldn't say something like that to a man that I disagreed with, but the vitriol, it's just -- it's astounding. It's shocking.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: I found, when those moments happen and you're suddenly being attacked, sometimes it's the one person who is obsessing over you and you're getting that. But sometimes it's kind of broader sort of tidal waves of it.</p><p/><p>And I find it to be very triggering. Find the very sense of -- that what we're told to do is what rape survivors are often told do, which is don't say anything because if you say anything, right, if you push back, then you are at risk for greater violence and you are at risk that the people you care and love about will be violated as well. So, if people jump in your defense, then they do will -- and so, you just feel like, oh, I'm going to go at this corner and hide, and that is that emotion of assault and of survival.</p><p/><p>HESS: Yes. And that's sort of the paradox of writing the story to begin with. But one of these sort of important things I think to come out of this, is that it should not be a problem that women are dealing with on their own. That there are legal institutions and there are technology companies that really sort of have a responsibility to make our communities safe for women.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Is this a Title 7 employment discrimination issue?</p><p/><p>FILIPOVIC: I think it is. You know, the Internet is where many people work. It's where we socialize. And when women are so unwelcomed and so harassed out of these spaces, it has a real impact on our livelihoods and our lives.</p><p/><p>I mean, you know, it is very comparable to not letting, having, not letting someone have a seat at a diner, even thought it's a private institution, you know? Or not letting a woman into a workplace even though it might be a private company.</p><p/><p>These things, it is gender discrimination and it's very, very harmful.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: So, Elon, help me through this for a second, because it feels to me like one possibility are a set of new policies, regulations and laws, but part one of what we love about the Internet is its relative freedom. It's a kind of libertarian space.</p><p/><p>But I also worried about just turning the rules of that space back on itself. So, like getting other kinds of gang violence online to mess with the gang violence and it's occurring like that also feels unproductive to me. Are there ways to protect the liberty, protect, you know, questions of levels of anonymity that we care about, but also somehow make this space safer for people to engage?</p><p/><p>WHITE: I believe so. And the fact is that the companies, the big tech companies have to take into consideration what people need for their own safety. Like, for example, with Google+, they weren't allowing people to have an account without have -- unless they put their real name not acknowledging the fact that, you know what? Some people don't want their real names out there, because they don't want those attacks to possibly become real.</p><p/><p>The tech companies have to actually start to look at how this is happening, what's happening, and try to implement certain types of solutions that can actually allow for conversation because no one doesn't want conversation, because that's the first thing people want. Just want to stop free speech. Like no, everyone wants free speech but you know what? You've got to see what's being said. And we're talking around women.</p><p/><p>And especially, let's be honest here around women of color. They get the double dose of sexism and racism at the exact same time. So, they have to take those things into consideration and not just completely shut everything off, but constantly, constantly be looking for new and interesting ways that can allow for the conversation to happen. But at the same time, keep people safe.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Yes. With just 15 seconds left here, Amanda. I do want to point out, you made such a strong point that there is, that that anonymity question, often women who make their lives in public space are not anonymous online, are actual names and jobs and places and where we work and often where we live, are available. But the folks who are doing the stocking or the harassing are quite anonymous.</p><p/><p>And it feels like there's got to be something we can do to change that imbalance.</p><p/><p>HESS: Right. I mean, one of the problems is that, you know, the people who are saying the Internet isn't real, it's very easy to say that if you're hiding in your basement, threatening people, it's easy to say that if you're a police officer who doesn't want to take a report. It's a lot harder to say that if you're a woman just trying to do her job on the Internet.</p><p/><p>So, it's difficult to know how to approach that. On the one hand, you know, police officers don't have a lot of resources and information. Technology companies have all the resources in the world, and I think the problem that you're seeing in both of those places is that they're extremely male-dominated.</p><p/><p>You know, we look to tech companies to innovate, to sort of bring us things that we never could have imagined and so I think we can ask them to bring us solutions on this problem as well.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Right. To address this asymmetry with the resources and intelligence and innovation that they have.</p><p/><p>HESS: Right.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Amanda Hess, Anthea Butler, Nancy Giles, Jill Filipovic, and Elon James White -- who, of course, joined us virtually, just to prove the point that virtual relationships exist.</p><p/><p>Up next, we're going make a happy moment at the end of this show. The 12- year-old bow tie mogul making a difference in kids' lives. My foot soldier joins me live, and you're not going want to miss it.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Skinny ties, white ties, Ascots bowties, silk knit ties, whatever the type of tie, men's neck wear is usually reserved for special occasions and uniforms or the office. But our foot soldier this week is designing bowties that aid his community and make formal wear fashionable anywhere, even on the playground.</p><p/><p>Twelve-year-old Mo Bridges launched his bowtie company, Mo's Bows in 2011, after his great grandmother, a seamstress for 60 years, taught him how to sew. The sixth grader now uses his $80,000 company to sell one of a kind bowties and change the lives of other children in his community.</p><p/><p>For the past three years, Mo has had one bowtie a year called the Go Mo Summer Camp Bowtie. Proceeds from the sale of that tie go to a scholarship fund that sends Memphis kids to summer camp, where, as Mo says, they not only get to have fun, they get to have a meal.</p><p/><p>This week, Mo is launching the 2014 Go Mo scholarship bowtie.</p><p/><p>Joining me now from Memphis, Tennessee, is the 12-year-old CEO of Mo's Bows, Mo Bridges, and with him is his mother, and his words, monager, Tramica Morris (ph).</p><p/><p>So, nice to have you with us.</p><p/><p>TRAMICA BRIDGES, MO'S MOTHER: Hello. Thank you for having us.</p><p/><p>MO BRIDGES, CEO, MO'S BOWS: Hey.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Hey, Mo. So tell me about the tie you're wearing. Is that this year's Go Mo bowtie?</p><p/><p>M. BRIDGES: Yes, it is this year's go mo bowtie. And I want to wish you a happy New Year and thank you for having me on your show.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Oh, thank you. I appreciate the happy New Year.</p><p/><p>Now, tell me, so, you started this business at 9 years old. What made you decide to start a business?</p><p/><p>M. BRIDGES: Well, I started business because I really like to dress up, and I couldn't find any other bowties I really liked. So, I reached out to my grandmother and she showed me how to sew. After that, I wore my bow ties. When I was out, people would just say, hey, I like that bowtie. And that was the demand for my business.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Ms. Morris, whenever I see young people who are doing amazing things, almost always, there is an adult who actually listened to them and supported them. So when you have a 9-year-old coming to you and saying, first of all, I want to learn to sew, and I want to learn to sell - - how do you make that decision that this isn't just a kind of side item, this is something to really support your child in?</p><p/><p>T. BRIDGES: Well, actually, Melissa, the fact that Mo has always been -- when I allowed him to dress himself, he chose to wear a suit and tie. So, on a Saturday going to the grocery store, I am in flip flops and a dress or something. And Mo is in a complete suit.</p><p/><p>So, I knew there was a sense of style and a sense of fashion early on. So I was not surprised when he said, hey, I want to start a business, and I want to sell ties. I thought that was just perfect for him.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Now, Mo, starting a business is one thing. And having a sense of fashion is one thing. But you also decided to start the summer camp scholarship.</p><p/><p>That's something else. What made you want to give back?</p><p/><p>M. BRIDGES: Well, you know, Melissa, I figure, why not help a kid? Because kids are fun, and they're cool. You just have to -- you have to be generous because -- and I also like to give back to my community at the same time.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: I love that. So what happens at that camp that is valuable? Why do you think of camp as an important place for kids to go?</p><p/><p>M. BRIDGES: Well, I figured that if I went there, then other kids will like it, because I liked it. And, you know, it's hot in Memphis and kids just need to go swimming and they need to be a kid.</p><p/><p>And it's also -- it's also the highest at child hunger in Memphis. And -- because kids need a meal, and they don't have a meal in summer, so I figured that if they go to summer camp, then they can have a meal.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: I love all of that.</p><p/><p>One last thing I want to ask you. My grandmother was a seamstress. And my mother is wonderful at sewing. There's such important parts.</p><p/><p>Tell me about your relationship with your great grandmother. How has she inspired you?</p><p/><p>M. BRIDGES: Well, my grandmother inspired me, because she -- she taught me how to sew, and she like -- she was -- she -- everybody will come to her and I used to grow up playing in her sewing room and I saw these really cool fabrics. And so I asked her how to teach me how to sew and she did.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: Tramica Morris, I just want to thank you for being a mom who has stood up behind that young man and made sure he could be his full self, because he is pretty amazing.</p><p/><p>T. BRIDGES: Thank you.</p><p/><p>HARRIS-PERRY: And thank you to Mo Bridges for that fashion style, for that sense of generosity and for that business acumen -- I can't wait to see the multimillionaire magnate you're going to become and the good you're going to do in the world.</p><p/><p>That's our show for today. Thanks to you at home for watching.

Elizabeth Warren proposed a policy at the Heartland forum last week that would break apart corporate farms and agribusinesses, members of Iowa's agriculture sector say her policies don't completely touch on what is currently wrong in agriculture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warren's plan would end contract farming, address farm consolidation, and break down agribusiness that are vertically integrated - meaning a company owns the supply chains and can control numerous areas of a market.</p><p>Warren also said her plan would level the playing field for small family farms.</p><p>Lindsay Greiner, the president of the Iowa Soybean Association, said he has a lot of reservations regarding Warren's plan. Most corporate farms started out small, he said, and the markets can work for anybody if small farmers can find their niches.</p><p>\"There are people who are making a good living on small farms,\" he said. \"I really see them growing ... people will buy what they like to buy, and if that's from a small produce farmer, then that's where they're going to buy their food.\"</p><p>Greiner said his association represents members whose farm sizes range from the 250 minimum bushels of soybeans to larger corporate farms.</p><p>While he liked to see a Democrat talking about agriculture, he said, a bigger issue in the sector is the ongoing trade disputes with China and Mexico. Warren's plan would put regulations on markets, and the best thing to do is to leave markets alone because \"markets take care of themselves,\" he avered.</p><p>\"We need good trade deals because the U.S. is really the bread basket of the world,\" Greiner said. \"We need export markets.\"</p><p>The soybean market has been on a decline over the last several years, and China imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products last summer, which has reduced foreign markets for soybean farmers.</p><p>Mark Stutsman, the chief operating officer of Eldon C. Stutsman Inc., an equipment supplier in eastern Iowa, said that if there's agriculture monopolization, it's on the meatpacking side rather than the farmers' end, because of how vertically integrated the meatpacking industry is.</p><p>Contract farming, which Warren said she wants to end, gives young people an opportunity to start farming with less production risk, he said. As farms continue to grow in size, he said, it's \"sadly going to be devastating to rural Iowa\" because fewer people will be able to populate the region.</p><p>\"I just don't know what policy would even come close to reversing that, unless you want to put a ban on all new technology,\" Stutsman said, referring to new technology as being responsible for farmers farming more land at a time. \"We want to continue to enjoy new products and new technologies to be made available to us. I just don't see any other options.\"</p><p>Warren, a Democratic U.S. senator from Massachusetts, has campaigned largely on going after big-tech companies such as Amazon and Google for monopolizing the technology industry and not paying their fair share in taxes.</p><p>Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said in an interview with The Daily Iowan on March 27 that one of her priorities leading up to her re-election run is strengthening agriculture markets in Iowa. She said she would like to see tariffs lifted.</p><p>\"Trade ties in so much with the ag economy and [making] sure that we [focus] on opening new markets,\" Ernst said.</p><p>RELATED: 2020 presidential hopeful John Delaney outlines climate change strategy in Iowa City</p><p>Comments</p><p>comments</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4125719</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVH-8M01-JBSN-30ST-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"576\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Iowan: University of Iowa</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 3, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0003NMQ</classCode><className>ELDON C STUTSMAN INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Iowa City</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>IA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00095A2</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00095A0</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000265</classCode><className>CAUCUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00090NW</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES MARKETS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001600</classCode><className>SOYBEAN MARKETS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001654</classCode><className>SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX000679</classCode><className>EXPORT TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001742</classCode><className>TRADE DISPUTES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001673</classCode><className>TARIFFS &amp;

It is among a precious handful of rich countries whose people are more likely to buy a newspaper than follow current affairs on Twitter or Facebook. Scarcely two out of five Germans have a social network account, compared with two out of three Britons and Americans. It is not that they don't like the internet: more than 90 per cent of them are online, and they spend just as much time watching videos of skateboarding pugs, or browsing for remaindered shoes as their European neighbours. It is more that they are specifically reluctant to hawk out their lives for public consumption. My German friends' Facebook accounts are like a fleet of digital </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                   Mary Celeste                   </p><p>s. There might be a profile picture taken on a holiday in Sri Lanka six years ago and the odd status update wishing the world a happy new year, but that is more or less that.</p><p>The country's broader social networking culture is unusually stunted. A few dozen \"influencers\" - including Adrienne Koleszar, a blonde, gym-honed 34-year-old from Dresden who is f\u00eated by the tabloids as \"Germany's most gorgeous policewoman\" - are fortunate enough to scrape a living together from their YouTube or Instagram accounts, but they are very much in the minority. The German Twittersphere is a niche habitat dominated by strange benthic fauna, such as political geeks, journalists, and right-wing obsessives.</p><p>Peter Mannion, a fictional Tory MP in the television political satire</p><p>                    The Thick of It                   </p><p>, has three times as many followers as the real-life German home secretary. Angela Merkel does not even have a presence. \"If you look at how frequently Europeans use social networks, out of all 28 European Union member states the Germans are truly bottom of the pile,\" said Sabine Trepte, a media psychologist at Hohenheim University in Stuttgart. \"Only a third of Germans look at Facebook on a daily basis,\" she notes, compared with about 60 per cent of internet users in the UK.</p><p>I used to have a small menagerie of pet theories on this subject. One: Germans pride themselves on their lack of small talk, which rules out pretty much 85 per cent of social media interactions. Two: big tech has built a business model the size of the Norwegian economy on Andy Warhol's insight that everyone will be famous for 15 minutes. Most people seem perfectly content to sacrifice their privacy in order to get a bit of attention. But perhaps the Germans are simply not that bothered. Three: maybe they just don't care for being bossed around by evangelical Americans with big ideas.</p><p>Over dinner a couple of months ago, though, a German friend politely dismissed all this fanciful speculation. \"Erm, I don't think so,\" she said. \"It's actually because of the Stasi.\"</p><p>It was less than three decades ago that half the country was in the grip of a totalitarian surveillance state that maintained an informant for every seven ordinary people. The roots of Germany's itchy anxiety about being watched run deeper than that, though. Before the Stasi, there was the Gestapo. And even before the Gestapo, the Prussians riddled Berlin with a formidable network of secret police in the early 19th century.</p><p>\"Perhaps it is really down to our past,\" Professor Trepte said. \"The German fear of surveillance is deeply anchored in German history and in many families' sense of identity. You have to bear in mind that our mothers and fathers can still recall how they or other families were snooped on and persecuted. It was not all that long ago. First came the Nazis, then the Stasi. At the very least, the Germans are cautious and critical.\"</p><p>These ancient psychological scars have far-reaching consequences in the 21st century. Germany's privacy laws are among the strictest in the world.</p><p>With Berlin's blessing, the European Union's competition commissioner has become the only heavyweight regulator to take on Silicon Valley in earnest, imposing fines running to hundreds of millions of euros on previously untouchable companies such as Facebook, Google and Apple.</p><p>A year ago Germany's ingrained wariness of social media might have seemed fusty and paranoid.

Congratulations, everyone, and still partying at 4:30 in the morning in St. Louis.</p><p>Welcome back to EARLY START. I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p>ROMANS: And I'm Christine Romans. It is exactly 31 minutes past the hour.</p><p>Breaking overnight out of Tennessee, two dozen police officers injured in Memphis during clashes with protesters after a fatal shooting by police.</p><p>Now, police cars vandalized. There's other damage, including shattered windows at a fire station.</p><p>Memphis police say the police shooting happened after officers tried to stop a man they say was wanted on multiple warrants.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELI MCALISTER, PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER, TENNESSEE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION: While attempting to stop the individual, he reportedly rammed his vehicle into the officers' vehicles multiple times before exiting with a weapon.</p><p>The officers fired, striking and killing the individual. No officers were injured.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) ROMANS: City officials say then six of the two dozen officers injured later in the melee were taken to the hospital and that two journalists were injured as well.</p><p>BRIGGS: President Trump says he would not necessarily report it to the FBI if a foreign government, like Russia, approached his campaign again with damaging information about an opponent.</p><p>In an interview with George Stephanopoulos, the president disputed the idea that such an offer amounted to election interference, and he said there would not be, quote, \"anything wrong with listening.\"</p><p>The president was asked whether Donald Trump, Jr. should have gone to the FBI when he got an e-mail offering dirt on Hillary Clinton from the Russians.</p><p>Here, now, the entire exchange with Stephanopoulos.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: OK, let's put yourself in a position. You're a congressman. Somebody comes up and says hey, I have information on your opponent.</p><p>Do you call the FBI? I don't think --</p><p>GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, ABC NEWS, ANCHOR, \"GOOD MORNING AMERICA\": If it's coming from Russia you do.</p><p>TRUMP: I'll tell you what, I've seen a lot of things over my life. I don't think in my whole life I've ever called the FBI -- in my whole life.</p><p>I don't -- you don't call the FBI, you throw somebody out of your office. You do whatever you --</p><p>STEPHANOPOULOS: Al Gore got a stolen briefing book. He called the FBI.</p><p>TRUMP: Well, that's different -- a stolen briefing book. This isn't a stolen -- this is somebody that said we have information on your opponent. Oh, let me call the FBI.</p><p>Give me a break. Life doesn't work that way.</p><p>STEPHANOPOULOS: The FBI director says that's what should happen.</p><p>TRUMP: The FBI director is wrong.</p><p>STEPHANOPOULOS: Your campaign this time around -- if foreigners, if Russia, if China, if someone else offers you information on opponents, should they accept it or should they call the FBI?</p><p>TRUMP: I think maybe you do both. I think you might want to listen. I don't -- there's nothing wrong with listening.</p><p>If somebody called from a country -- Norway -- we have information on your opponent. Oh, I think I'd want to hear it.</p><p>STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you want that kind of interference in our elections?</p><p>TRUMP: It's not an interference. They have information. I think I'd take it. If I thought there was something wrong, I'd go, maybe, to the FBI.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: All right, one important note for context. It is a crime for a campaign to knowingly solicit or accept anything of value from foreign nationals.</p><p>That and the danger of election interference were recurring themes in the furious reaction to President Trump's comments. Many of his Democratic opponents tweeted their outrage or were asked about it by reporters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's the commander in chief and has a duty and a responsibility to the American people to be a defender, if not the greatest defender, of our democracy. And -- but, to quite the contrary, what we hear tonight is that he is, yet again, open to the idea of working with foreign governments to undermine the integrity of our election system.</p><p>It's outrageous and it tells me the guy just can't -- doesn't understand the job and can't do it very well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: House Judiciary chairman Jerry Nadler, who is leading multiple investigations into Mr. Trump, tweeted, \"It is shocking to hear the president say outright that he is willing to put himself in debt to a foreign power.\"</p><p>One other person who said foreign dirt should be reported to the FBI, Attorney General William Barr, last month at a Senate Judiciary hearing -- listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Going forward, what if a foreign adversary -- let's now say North Korea -- offers a presidential candidate dirt on a competitor in 2020, do you agree with me the campaign should immediately contact the FBI?</p><p>[05:35:00] If a foreign --</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: A foreign government? A foreign intelligence service?</p><p>COONS: -- intelligence service -- a representative of a foreign government -- BARR: Yes.</p><p>COONS: -- says we have dirt on your opponent --</p><p>BARR: Yes.</p><p>COONS: -- should they say, \"I love it, let's meet\" or should they contact the FBI?</p><p>BARR: If a foreign intelligence -- if a foreign intelligence service does, yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Now, if he is determined to cover for the president yet again, perhaps he draws that again -- that distinction about foreign intelligence service versus a government. We shall see.</p><p>Let's talk about this with \"Washington Post\" White House correspondent Toluse Olorunnipa, joining us live from Washington this morning.</p><p>ROMANS: Good morning.</p><p>BRIGGS: Good to see you, sir.</p><p>TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE WASHINGTON POST: Good morning.</p><p>BRIGGS: So look, we've heard it 17 times and it is still a stunning sound bite. It's clearly unethical, it is clearly unpatriotic, but he, again, says his FBI director is wrong.</p><p>Here's what Chris Wray said in front of Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTOPHER WRAP, DIRECTOR, FBI: My view is that if any public official or member of any campaign is contacted by any nation-state or anybody acting on behalf of a nation-state about influencing or interfering with our election, then that's something that the FBI would want to know about.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: So, how will, Toluse, the FBI and Congress react?</p><p>OLORUNNIPA: Well, so far, with silence, at least on the Republican side of Congress and the FBI. They have not put out any statement. They've declined to comment.</p><p>They basically tried to sweep this under the rug and not approach these explosive comments by the president where on the one hand, you have the FBI and the Intelligence Community say they're very serious about making sure that there is not foreign interference in the upcoming election -- that they're working hard on this issue. And then you have the president saying that he welcomes foreign interference.</p><p>He's saying that there's no problem with what his son did back in 2016 where he said I love it if Russia was able to bring information that was dirt on Hillary Clinton to help the Trump campaign. The president's trying to cover for his son but pinning himself squarely at odds with his own Intelligence Community, which has said pretty forcefully that if a foreign government or if a foreign individual tries to offer dirt to a political campaign that they should offer that information to the FBI.</p><p>And that's something that the president is very much opposed to his own government on -- one of several issues where we've seen the president split with his FBI and other parts of his government.</p><p>ROMANS: You know --</p><p>BRIGGS: And to your point, real quickly, about Republican reaction. I searched just about every Republican senator and congressman I could find. Not a single word of criticism yet about this stunning statement.</p><p>ROMANS: I mean, James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, on our air last night, said he's running out of adjectives -- shocking, appalling, unpatriotic. I mean, these are all things that you're hearing critics of this president and this administration's position say.</p><p>It could be that this is a -- this is a father trying to protect his son from taking that meeting with the Russians and not alerting authorities --</p><p>BRIGGS:</p><p>ROMANS: -- and like doubling down on there.</p><p>But, let me read the FEC rule on foreign interference. There are election violations -- there are election legalities on the books here.</p><p>\"Commission regulations prohibit foreign nationals from directing, dictating, controlling, or directly or indirectly participating in the decision-making process of any person with regard to election-related activities.\"</p><p>Yet, the president, Toluse, was trying to paint this as, like, run of the mill congressional oppo research -- like hiring some sleazy firm to find out the sealed divorce proceedings of your opponent, right? That's not what this is.</p><p>OLORUNNIPA: Yes, and we've heard even some Republicans in the past, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, talk about how people should go to the FBI if anyone from a foreign government or any foreign official tries to offer dirt to a political campaign. He said it very clearly, even during some of those hearings with Dir. Wray.</p><p>And it will be very interesting to see what they saw now, especially as we've seen a number of Republicans being much less willing to cross the president and much less willing to get on his bad side.</p><p>You just heard the president say the FBI director is wrong, very clearly.</p><p>And several Republican lawmakers, even though previously, they've spoken out against this type of activity -- now it seems like they're much more willing to accept it or at least bite their tongues when it comes to the president.</p><p>And it will be interesting to see as they're asked by reporters about this interview today how they respond and whether or not they try to parse the president's language and try to find something --</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>OLORUNNIPA: -- in there that they like. And it will be very interesting to see how they respond to this.</p><p>BRIGGS: It sounds pretty clear they're open for business.</p><p>Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, was asked about this by Axios. \"Would you call the FBI if it happened again?\" And he said, \"I don't know. It's hard to do hypotheticals.\"</p><p>So it sure sounds like the Trump campaign and the administration is open for business as we move forward.</p><p>Curious, do you think Democrats will propose legislation to make it clear this is illegal or at the very least, unethical?</p><p>OLORUNNIPA: Yes. There is already some legislation out there being considered that would basically force anyone who is part of that -- a part of a campaign to contact the FBI if they are basically given or offered negative information about their opponents or political dirt -- any efforts by a foreign individual to interfere with the U.S. elections.</p><p>I don't know that it will go anywhere in this divided Congress and with the fact that Republicans do not want any more focus on the fact that the president's son did basically do that in 2016. He did basically say that he was much open -- very much open to getting political dirt from the Russians as part of the Trump campaign to support their efforts against Hillary Clinton.</p><p>[05:40:15] So because of that, I don't think that will move anywhere. But you will expect this to become more -- a more significant part of the 2020 elections with several --</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>OLORUNIPPA: -- Democratic candidates calling out the president what he did. And for Democrats in the House also pushing forward on investigating what the president said and investigating what happened with Russia --</p><p>BRIGGS: Sure. OLORUNIPPA: -- in 2016.</p><p>ROMANS: Also in that interview, this sort of stunner as we're at -- let's see, 10,796 lies or misstatements as of June seventh, according to your publication, \"The Washington Post.\"</p><p>The president declares he loves the truth -- listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I like the truth. You know, I'm actually a very honest guy. If I thought they were correct, I wouldn't be complaining at all. I understand that.</p><p>It's like the witch hunt that goes on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: \"If I thought they were correct\" -- he's referring to this internal polling that leaked. There was some reporting about -- that showed that he would lose to Joe Biden in several key states. The president says that's not true, that's fake news, and he loves the truth.</p><p>This -- no little -- no irony at all here.</p><p>OLORUNNIPA: Yes, we've heard the president saying several things that are not true and my paper has documented more than 10,000 of those misleading statements or falsehoods. And I think it's very clear that this is a president that has a very loose relationship with the truth.</p><p>This is a president who likes polls that show him up. And when the polls show him sort of struggling or show a large number of Americans disapprove of his job in office, he dismisses those polls as fake news or suppression polls.</p><p>So this is a president that likes certain versions of the truth --</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>OLORUNIPPA: -- as long as it's in favor of his position --</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>OLORUNIPPA: -- but is not so comfortable with information that is not backing up his previously-held positions.</p><p>ROMANS: I think we know the fake news is just news he doesn't like --</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: -- or information he doesn't like.</p><p>BRIGGS: And fact-checking the president is now a cottage industry in 2019.</p><p>ROMANS: That's true.</p><p>BRIGGS: Toluse, great to see you, sir. Thank you.</p><p>OLORUNIPPA: Thank you.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, breaking news. The operator of a chemical tanker in the Gulf of Oman says it was attacked with some sort of shell. The Kokuka Courageous was one of two tankers involved in a security incident in the Gulf.</p><p>Now, officials say the crews of both the Courageous and the Front Altair were evacuated with one injury.</p><p>CNN's Nic Robertson monitoring the situation live in London.</p><p>We know the American Fifth Fleet is in the -- in the region. We know there have been rescues of those sailors. The Iranians say that they have rescued these sailors.</p><p>And what is the latest?</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: The latest appears to be, and not clear at the moment whether this image has been cleared for our air -- that we've been able to thoroughly check up on it.</p><p>But the image of the Front Altair that is on social media that requires us to do some further checking appears to show a large oil tanker with a fire coming from the middle of it as if it was hit in the middle of the ship.</p><p>Now, this is concurrent with what the captain of the ship describes. That the ship was hit by projectiles, that a fire broke out, and that's when he decided to get himself and all the crew off the ship. And that's what has also happened with the Kokuka Courageous as well -- both ships hit while on the move.</p><p>And the Iranian Navy saying that they have rescued those 44 people. That they now have them on an Iranian island.</p><p>The U.S. Fifth Fleet is in the area doing what it can in the way of assistance at the moment.</p><p>But this comes just a month after an attack on four commercial vessels that have certain similarities, but some differences, off the coast of the Emirates a month ago. What's different here is this seems to be an escalation.</p><p>That these ships were hit by projectiles while on the move. What we saw a month ago was ships hit while they were at anchor and targeted with mines that were put on the ships, it seemed to be, overnight.</p><p>The U.N.'s conclusion about that attack a month ago was that a state actor was involved. The United States and the Saudis have both said that Iran was the state actor.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, we'll continue to watch this.</p><p>Oil prices up about three percent because of that -- tensions there in the region.</p><p>Thanks, Nic Robertson.</p><p>BRIGGS: OK. Ahead, a tearful personal revelation from a Hollywood star.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIRA SORVINO, ACTRESS, RAPE SURVIVOR: I have never said that last part, ever, in public because it is impossible sometimes to share these sort of things.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: More from Oscar-winner Mira Sorvino, next.</p><p>[05:49:00] BRIGGS: Five forty-eight Eastern time.</p><p>And authorities in the Dominican Republic say the shooting of Red Sox legend David Ortiz was a hit job.</p><p>Police say the alleged gunman, 25-year-old Rolfi Ferreira Cruz, has confessed to shooting Ortiz at a nightclub last weekend in Santo Domingo. They say Cruz and six other men were involved in the shooting; one is still at large.</p><p>Authorities are not commenting on a possible motive but they say the suspects were offered the equivalent of about $7,800 to carry out the hit on Ortiz.</p><p>Oscar-winning actress Mira Sorvino revealed Wednesday that she is a survivor of rape. Sorvino has been one of the most vocal voices of the #MeToo movement.</p><p>She was speaking at a press conference, trying to encourage New York lawmakers to eliminate the state's statute of limitations on rape in the second and third degrees and pass additional sexual harassment protections.</p><p>She was emotional while telling her story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SORVINO: I'm also a sexual assault victim and I'm also a survivor of date rape. So -- and I've never said that in public and I do not want to go into detail. But I have never said that last part, ever, in public because it is impossible sometimes to share these sort of things, and I'm doing it here to try and help.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) [05:50:17] BRIGGS: Sorvino adding she's speaking out because she knows there are other survivors who need time to sort through the trauma and shame of what they've been through.</p><p>She did not give details about who assaulted her or when it happened.</p><p>ROMANS: Really brave yesterday.</p><p>All right, let's get a check on \"CNN Business\" this morning.</p><p>Taking a look at global markets, you can see Asia markets closed mixed amid those violent clashes in Hong Kong between protesters and police over that controversial extradition bill.</p><p>In the U.S., you've got futures leaning up here right now, but not even half a percent here, so I'd call this a little bit indecisive. U.S. markets closed slightly lower yesterday as trade fears stayed front of mind for investors. The Dow closed 43 points lower. Again, that's not even two-tenths of a percent.</p><p>And next week, investors will turn their attention to the Fed board meeting. Markets have been driven higher on hopes that the Fed will cut interest rates. But experts are now saying there's a chance that Jerome Powell will disappoint and the market has gotten ahead of itself in hoping for a rate cut.</p><p>States are joining the fight against big tech. At least a dozen states preparing investigations into the tech industry and three state attorneys general now say fines are not enough to rein in big companies like Google and Facebook.</p><p>Nebraska attorney general Doug Peterson referenced Facebook's motto, \"Move fast and break things,\" saying they have to be fast and thoughtful and \"once we gather information, we have to consider whether or not to break things.\"</p><p>A day earlier, the House Judiciary Committee started its own investigation into the tech industry.</p><p>That hit Netflix series \"STRANGER THINGS\" will soon have a new video game. \"STRANGER THINGS 3: THE GAME\" will be free to play. It will be released in 2020 on IOS and Android platforms.</p><p>The game will be in the style of a 1980s Saturday morning cartoon and will integrate Google maps so fans can play during their daily lives.</p><p>There's also another \"STRANGER THINGS\" video game in the works. That game will debut on July fourth, the same day as the season three debuts on Netflix.</p><p>BRIGGS: OK, the Spice Girls apparently giving fans what they really, really want.</p><p>ROMANS: Really, really want.</p><p>BRIGGS: Details, next.</p><p>[05:56:51] BRIGGS: A truly glorious moment in St. Louis late last night for fans of the St. Louis Blues and fans of the legendary jam band Phish. The Blues have adopted Laura Branigan's 1982 hit \"Gloria\" as the unofficial anthem of their playoff run. Moments after the Blues won the cup last night, Phish broke out in their own heartfelt rendition of \"Gloria.\"</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Fans of the 90s pop sensation the Spice Girls are about to get what they really, really want.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SPICE GIRLS: Singing \"Wannabe.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, that will be in your head all day.</p><p>An animated Spice Girls movie -- all five members of the iconic girl group are on board for the new film, which is still in early development.</p><p>\"Variety\" reports the film will feature the girls as superheroes to send the message of girl power.

It is a workspace designed to enhance the creativity of its 20-something, tech-savvy employees. Rather than cut a ribbon, Bezos looked up at the roof of the giant glass dome and ordered the artificial intelligence assistant Alexa to do the honours. \"OK, Jeff,\" Alexa replied before the lights came on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a moment of corporate theatre that has become synonymous with America's big tech -giants: Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. These titans thrive on their image of being visionary pioneers presiding over uber-cool workplaces full of laptop-wielding millennials.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But such stunts are fast losing their appeal as the world gets a growing glimpse into the dark side of the tech revolution.</p><p>From Washington to Europe to Australia, so-called Big Tech has never been bigger, richer or more powerful. It has also never been more on the nose.</p><p>The companies that changed the way we live, interact, work and play are now having to answer for the social and civil consequences of the world they created.</p><p>Some say it is too late, the genie has been uncorked and that the good still far outweighs the bad. But with every day the bad -appears to be getting worse.</p><p>These giants are accused of ruthlessly invading our privacy, killing off bricks-and-mortar -retailers, monopolistic practices, stealing news and advertising from traditional media, allowing nefarious players - from Russian -intelligence to neo-Nazis - to -exploit their sites, and refusing to help intelligence agencies -access encrypted sites to hunt down -terrorists. The attacks are coming from both sides of politics, from -George Soros toUS President -Donald Trump.</p><p>Meanwhile, corporate reg-ulators, in particular in the US, have been caught flat-footed. They are only now grappling with how they can hold accountable Amazon, Apple, -Alphabet's Google and Facebook, which along with Microsoft are America's five most valuable -companies, worth an astonishing $US3 trillion.</p><p>All eyes are on Australia as the disruption of news media by the tech giants, and how it hurts consumers and publishers, comes under the microscope for the first time. The Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission is to release an issues paper for what is expected to be a year-long inquiry.</p><p>These tech companies rival in size and influence the oil and railway barons of America's Gilded Age. In their day, American Telephone and Telegraph and Standard Oil controlled more than 80 per cent of their markets. These days Google controls 89 per cent of internet searches, Facebook products are used by 95 per cent of young adults, Amazon handles 75 per cent of electronic book sales and Google and Facebook have an advertising duopoly accounting for almost two-thirds of online advertising spending. Together, Google and Apple provide an astonishing 99 per cent of mobile phone operating systems.</p><p>These tech titans wield a power that is far more -invasive and unpredictable than that of the robber barons because it derives from their intimate knowledge of our lives via algorithms and data collection. \"Facebook and Google have grown into ever more powerful monopolies,\" billionaire philanthropist -Soros told a dinner at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week. \"They have become -obstacles to innovation and have caused a variety of problems of which we are only now beginning to become aware.\" He said today's tech giants had \"neither the will nor the -inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions (and that) their days are numbered.\" Big Tech knows it is under pressure as regulators move to scrutinise the industry. In Trump's Washington, Google spent more money last year than any other US company - more than $US18 million - to influence the White House, politicians and agencies on issues from monopolies to tax reform and online advertising. Amazon lifted its lobbying spend in Washington by 16 per cent to $US13m, Apple upsized its budget by 51 per cent to $US7m and Facebook's lobbying bill rose 32 per cent to $US11m. Microsoft spent $US8.5m. Taken together, the tech giants have displaced the telecommunications, energy and defence -industries as the top lobbyists in Washington.</p><p>Alvaro Bedoya, head of the Centre on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University, says this sudden and intense lobbying push by the tech giants makes it harder to enact laws and regulations to protect consumers. \"Because this is the first time in American history that the giants of industry have as their raw -material personal data, (tech companies) are going to do as much as possible to protect access to that raw material,\" he told TheWashington Post.</p><p>In 2002 a bitter antitrust battle with Microsoft -resulted in a court settlement curbing some of the company's monopolistic practices. But 16 years on, regulators are struggling to apply traditional antitrust and other constraints to these multi-headed, fast-moving tech behemoths.</p><p>Consider the extraordinary case of Amazon, a company Bezos began in his garage in Seattle in 1994 by selling books over the -internet. It is now worth $US600 billion ($750bn). Amazon has become the retail juggernaut of our age while spreading its tentacles into credit lending, auction houses, book publishing, film producing, grocery chains, fashion designing and delivery and logistics, among other things.</p><p>\"Imagine getting your pay-TV service, groceries, banking, -insurance, etc, all through one company. That's the threat that Amazon poses,\" says Michael Gleeson, of US business analysis firm The Diffusion Group.</p><p>Critics say it is not the size of Amazon that scares them as much as the online ecosystem the company is creating, which they warn will inevitably stifle competition.</p><p>In the US, Amazon sells more than 400 million products. Because Amazon relies on sales volumes for its wealth, these products are deliberately priced at bare profit margins, a move that has put many bricks-and-mortar -retailers out of business.</p><p>Membership of Amazon Prime, which gives access to streaming TV and movies as well as free -delivery of a dizzying range of products, has doubled to 80 million in the US in the past two years. Membership makes it more likely that future purchases are also made with Amazon.</p><p>\"Although Amazon has clocked staggering growth, it generates meagre profits, choosing to price below cost and expand -widely instead,\" writes Lina Khan in an article in the Yale Law Journal that attracted much attention. \"Through this strategy, the company has positioned itself at the centre of e-commerce and now serves as essential infra-structure for a host of other businesses that depend upon it. Elements of the firm's structure and conduct pose anti-competitive concerns - yet it has escaped antitrust scrutiny.\" Khan argues that US antitrust laws cannot measure the impact of a modern juggernaut such as Amazon because they focus on price and output rather than the Amazon architecture, which is -designed eventually to strangle competitors: \"Specific-ally, current doctrine under-appreciates the risk of predatory pricing and how integration across distinct business lines may prove anti-competitive.\" Amazon, which has long sold Kindle books on its Australian website, had its full retail launch in Australia in December, allowing for physical goods, from fashion to hardware, to be shipped from its Melbourne warehouse for the first time.</p><p>For Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook, 2017 was the worst year since he started the site in 2004, and he has vowed that his \"personal challenge for 2018\" is to fix what has gone wrong. The social network has been accused of failing to prevent the spread of disinformation and violent imagery, of political bias against conservative causes, of distorting news and -advertising, and of allowing Russian intelligence to exploit its sites to interfere with the 2016 US presiden-tial election. \"For those I hurt this year, I ask forgiveness and I will try to be -better,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a post last year.</p><p>\"For the ways my work was used to divide people rather than bring us together, I ask for forgiveness and I will work to do better.\" Last month Facebook executives made the extraordinary -admission that the site, which is used by two billion people a month and is one of the world's biggest distributors of news, could \"spread misinformation and corrode democracy\". \"Facebook was originally -designed to connect friends and family - and it has excelled in that,\" Samidh Chakrabarti, Facebook's product manager for civic engagement, wrote in a blog. \"But as unprecedented numbers of people channel their political energy through this medium, it's being used in unforeseen ways, with -societal reper-cussions that were never anti-cipated. In 2016, we \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 were far too slow to recognise how bad actors were abusing our platform.\" An investigation by Facebook found that 126 million Americans were exposed to Russia disinformation on the site during the 2016 election campaign. According to Roger McNamee, a former mentor of Zuckerberg, Facebook has yet to admit the problem lies in the very nature of the technology that it relies on for its site.</p><p>\"The problem with Facebook's whole position is that the algorithm exists to maximise attention, and the best way to do that is to make people angry and afraid,\" he told TheWashington Post.</p><p>Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of 21st Century Fox and News Corp, publisher of The Australian, last month expressed his frustration with companies like Facebook and Google. \"Facebook and Google have popularised scurrilous news sources through algorithms that are profitable for these platforms but inherently unreliable. Recognition of a problem is one step on the pathway to cure, but the -remedial measures that both companies have so far proposed are inadequate, commercially, -socially and journalistically,\" Murdoch said.</p><p>He said there was a \"lack of transparency\" in the process and this should \"concern publishers and those wary of political bias at these powerful platforms\", and suggested Facebook should support credible news organisations by paying them for content.</p><p>News Corp and other traditional news organisations are increasingly concerned about the duopoly Facebook and Google have on online advertising. -Together they collect nearly half of all global online advertising revenue; in the US - where two-thirds of adults access news on social media - they accounted for 85 per cent of total internet -advertising revenue growth in 2015 and 2016.</p><p>In December the Nine Network, Fairfax Media and News Corp Australia announced a partnership to fight Facebook-Google advertising domination.</p><p>\"As the media sector evolves, there are growing concerns that digital platforms are affecting traditional media's ability to fund the development of content,\" ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in -December when announcing the commission had been formally asked by the Turnbull government to examine the impact of digital platforms.</p><p>While US regulators are also looking more closely at the tech giants, they have lacked the push shown by regulators in -Europe. Last year the EU levied a record $US2.7bn fine against Google for favouring its own services in the results it presents to users.</p><p>Facebook has also been fined by European privacy watchdogs for breaking data protection rules, and in 2016 Apple was forced to pay Ireland more than $US15bn in uncollected tax.</p><p>Soros says of Facebook and Google: \"They claim they are merely distributing information. But the fact that they are near-monopoly distributors makes them public utilities and should subject them to more stringent regulations aimed at preserving competition, innovation and fair and open universal access.\" Privacy concerns have increasingly plagued Google and other tech giants as people become more aware of the vast amounts of information they suck up. These range from the political views of users to their purchase and search histories and their locations.</p><p>New York-based digital magazine Quartz startled some in -November by reporting that smartphones carrying Android software can gather data about your location even when they don't carry a SIM card and -location services are turned off.</p><p>\"The result is that Google \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 could access data about individ-uals' locations and their movements that go far beyond a reasonable consumer expectation of privacy,\" the magazine wrote.</p><p>In the US, politicians appear to have been more active on these -issues than the regulators. Democrats, with the backing of Republican veteran John McCain, have introduced legislation that would require greater disclosure of web platforms that run political advertising - a move designed to prevent a repeat of Russia's hijacking of Facebook. In a separate move, a Senate panel called executives from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube before a panel last month to -answer questions on what they were doing to prevent the posting of hate speech and extremism.</p><p>The debate over Amazon's size has taken on a physical as well as digital dimension. The company has grown so fast that it now employs 40,000 people in central Seattle, up from 5000 in 2010, making it easily America's largest company town. The company occupies 20 per cent of office space in the city across 45 buildings. Cranes dot the skyline, erecting even more buildings for Amazon.</p><p>When Inquirer visited, the city was caught in a fierce debate over whether Amazon was -already too big for it. While its growth has brought in thousands of new and well-paid jobs, it has also led to the fastest rising house prices in the country. This has led to a spike in homelessness, traffic gridlock and even an identity crisis.</p><p>\"If you ask me, as a Seattle -native, I'd say we were better off in the 90s before Amazon got big,\" local author Knute Berger tells -Inquirer. \"Clearly, the tech economy has dramatically impacted rents, real estate values, homelessness, displacement and affordability in general. Amazon has had a big hand in that by the rapidity of its growth.\" Others such as Ed Lazowska, professor of computer science at the University of Washington, disagree. \"Look at that,\" he says, pointing to a street full of Amazon-owned buildings. \"There was nothing here but empty warehouses and carparks before Amazon moved in. Some cities would kill to have this sort of investment.\" And indeed they are. Two hundred and thirty-eight towns and regions across the US put forward bids to be chosen as Amazon's second US headquarters.</p><p>HQ2, as Amazon calls it, will -receive an investment of about $US5bn and create 50,000 jobs.</p><p>As Bezos was -instructing Alexa to open his new building this week, only a block away, hundreds of homeless men, women and children were ensconced at a former Day's Inn hotel. Critics say many of them have been displaced by the rise in rents caused by Amazon's growth. But Amazon has also come to their rescue, allowing them to live rent-free in a building it owns while donating food from the cashier-free Amazon Go store down the road. It seems that even in adversity, Amazon is a one-stop shop.</p><p>Locals say Seattle has become a living symbol of the good and bad of the tech revolution.</p><p>But as Soros said in Davos, it is time to confront the dark side. \"These companies have often played an innovative and liberating role,\" he said. \"(Yet) social media companies exploit the -social environment. This is particularly nefarious because social media companies influence how people think and behave without them even being aware of it. This has far-reaching adverse consequences (for) the functioning of democracy, particularly on the -integrity of elections. The exceptional profitability of these companies is largely a function of their avoiding responsibility for - and avoiding paying for - the content on their platforms.\" Soros believes something harmful and maybe irreversible is happening to human attention in the digital age. \"Social media companies are inducing people to give up their autonomy. The power to shape people's attention is -increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few companies. It (now) takes a real effort to assert and defend what John Stuart Mill called 'the freedom of mind'.\"Cameron Stewart is also US contributor for Sky News Australia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20180203Australian18000358989603</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RJG-69S1-F0JP-W50D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2769\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 3, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

It is a workspace designed to enhance the creativity of its 20-something, tech-savvy employees. Rather than cut a ribbon, Bezos looked up at the roof of the giant glass dome and ordered the artificial intelligence assistant Alexa to do the honours. \"OK, Jeff,\" Alexa replied before the lights came on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a moment of corporate theatre that has become synonymous with America's big tech -giants: Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. These titans thrive on their image of being visionary pioneers presiding over uber-cool workplaces full of laptop-wielding millennials.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But such stunts are fast losing their appeal as the world gets a growing glimpse into the dark side of the tech revolution.</p><p>From Washington to Europe to Australia, so-called Big Tech has never been bigger, richer or more powerful. It has also never been more on the nose.</p><p>The companies that changed the way we live, interact, work and play are now having to answer for the social and civil consequences of the world they created.</p><p>Some say it is too late, the genie has been uncorked and that the good still far outweighs the bad. But with every day the bad -appears to be getting worse.</p><p>These giants are accused of ruthlessly invading our privacy, killing off bricks-and-mortar -retailers, monopolistic practices, stealing news and advertising from traditional media, allowing nefarious players - from Russian -intelligence to neo-Nazis - to -exploit their sites, and refusing to help intelligence agencies -access encrypted sites to hunt down -terrorists. The attacks are coming from both sides of politics, from -George Soros toUS President -Donald Trump.</p><p>Meanwhile, corporate reg-ulators, in particular in the US, have been caught flat-footed. They are only now grappling with how they can hold accountable Amazon, Apple, -Alphabet's Google and Facebook, which along with Microsoft are America's five most valuable -companies, worth an astonishing $US3 trillion.</p><p>All eyes are on Australia as the disruption of news media by the tech giants, and how it hurts consumers and publishers, comes under the microscope for the first time. The Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission is to release an issues paper for what is expected to be a year-long inquiry.</p><p>These tech companies rival in size and influence the oil and railway barons of America's Gilded Age. In their day, American Telephone and Telegraph and Standard Oil controlled more than 80 per cent of their markets. These days Google controls 89 per cent of internet searches, Facebook products are used by 95 per cent of young adults, Amazon handles 75 per cent of electronic book sales and Google and Facebook have an advertising duopoly accounting for almost two-thirds of online advertising spending. Together, Google and Apple provide an astonishing 99 per cent of mobile phone operating systems.</p><p>These tech titans wield a power that is far more -invasive and unpredictable than that of the robber barons because it derives from their intimate knowledge of our lives via algorithms and data collection. \"Facebook and Google have grown into ever more powerful monopolies,\" billionaire philanthropist -Soros told a dinner at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week. \"They have become -obstacles to innovation and have caused a variety of problems of which we are only now beginning to become aware.\" He said today's tech giants had \"neither the will nor the -inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions (and that) their days are numbered.\" Big Tech knows it is under pressure as regulators move to scrutinise the industry. In Trump's Washington, Google spent more money last year than any other US company - more than $US18 million - to influence the White House, politicians and agencies on issues from monopolies to tax reform and online advertising. Amazon lifted its lobbying spend in Washington by 16 per cent to $US13m, Apple upsized its budget by 51 per cent to $US7m and Facebook's lobbying bill rose 32 per cent to $US11m. Microsoft spent $US8.5m. Taken together, the tech giants have displaced the telecommunications, energy and defence -industries as the top lobbyists in Washington.</p><p>Alvaro Bedoya, head of the Centre on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University, says this sudden and intense lobbying push by the tech giants makes it harder to enact laws and regulations to protect consumers. \"Because this is the first time in American history that the giants of industry have as their raw -material personal data, (tech companies) are going to do as much as possible to protect access to that raw material,\" he told TheWashington Post.</p><p>In 2002 a bitter antitrust battle with Microsoft -resulted in a court settlement curbing some of the company's monopolistic practices.

Elements of the firm's structure and conduct pose anti-competitive concerns - yet it has escaped antitrust scrutiny.\" Khan argues that US antitrust laws cannot measure the impact of a modern juggernaut such as Amazon because they focus on price and output rather than the Amazon architecture, which is -designed eventually to strangle competitors: \"Specific-ally, current doctrine under-appreciates the risk of predatory pricing and how integration across distinct business lines may prove anti-competitive.\" Amazon, which has long sold Kindle books on its Australian website, had its full retail launch in Australia in December, allowing for physical goods, from fashion to hardware, to be shipped from its Melbourne warehouse for the first time.</p><p>For Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook, 2017 was the worst year since he started the site in 2004, and he has vowed that his \"personal challenge for 2018\" is to fix what has gone wrong. The social network has been accused of failing to prevent the spread of disinformation and violent imagery, of political bias against conservative causes, of distorting news and -advertising, and of allowing Russian intelligence to exploit its sites to interfere with the 2016 US presiden-tial election. \"For those I hurt this year, I ask forgiveness and I will try to be -better,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a post last year.</p><p>\"For the ways my work was used to divide people rather than bring us together, I ask for forgiveness and I will work to do better.\" Last month Facebook executives made the extraordinary -admission that the site, which is used by two billion people a month and is one of the world's biggest distributors of news, could \"spread misinformation and corrode democracy\". \"Facebook was originally -designed to connect friends and family - and it has excelled in that,\" Samidh Chakrabarti, Facebook's product manager for civic engagement, wrote in a blog. \"But as unprecedented numbers of people channel their political energy through this medium, it's being used in unforeseen ways, with -societal reper-cussions that were never anti-cipated. In 2016, we \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 were far too slow to recognise how bad actors were abusing our platform.\" An investigation by Facebook found that 126 million Americans were exposed to Russia disinformation on the site during the 2016 election campaign. According to Roger McNamee, a former mentor of Zuckerberg, Facebook has yet to admit the problem lies in the very nature of the technology that it relies on for its site.</p><p>\"The problem with Facebook's whole position is that the algorithm exists to maximise attention, and the best way to do that is to make people angry and afraid,\" he told TheWashington Post.</p><p>Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of 21st Century Fox and News Corp, publisher of The Australian, last month expressed his frustration with companies like Facebook and Google. \"Facebook and Google have popularised scurrilous news sources through algorithms that are profitable for these platforms but inherently unreliable. Recognition of a problem is one step on the pathway to cure, but the -remedial measures that both companies have so far proposed are inadequate, commercially, -socially and journalistically,\" Murdoch said.</p><p>He said there was a \"lack of transparency\" in the process and this should \"concern publishers and those wary of political bias at these powerful platforms\", and suggested Facebook should support credible news organisations by paying them for content.</p><p>News Corp and other traditional news organisations are increasingly concerned about the duopoly Facebook and Google have on online advertising. -Together they collect nearly half of all global online advertising revenue; in the US - where two-thirds of adults access news on social media - they accounted for 85 per cent of total internet -advertising revenue growth in 2015 and 2016.</p><p>In December the Nine Network, Fairfax Media and News Corp Australia announced a partnership to fight Facebook-Google advertising domination.</p><p>\"As the media sector evolves, there are growing concerns that digital platforms are affecting traditional media's ability to fund the development of content,\" ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in -December when announcing the commission had been formally asked by the Turnbull government to examine the impact of digital platforms.</p><p>While US regulators are also looking more closely at the tech giants, they have lacked the push shown by regulators in -Europe. Last year the EU levied a record $US2.7bn fine against Google for favouring its own services in the results it presents to users.</p><p>Facebook has also been fined by European privacy watchdogs for breaking data protection rules, and in 2016 Apple was forced to pay Ireland more than $US15bn in uncollected tax.</p><p>Soros says of Facebook and Google: \"They claim they are merely distributing information. But the fact that they are near-monopoly distributors makes them public utilities and should subject them to more stringent regulations aimed at preserving competition, innovation and fair and open universal access.\" Privacy concerns have increasingly plagued Google and other tech giants as people become more aware of the vast amounts of information they suck up. These range from the political views of users to their purchase and search histories and their locations.</p><p>New York-based digital magazine Quartz startled some in -November by reporting that smartphones carrying Android software can gather data about your location even when they don't carry a SIM card and -location services are turned off.</p><p>\"The result is that Google \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 could access data about individ-uals' locations and their movements that go far beyond a reasonable consumer expectation of privacy,\" the magazine wrote.</p><p>In the US, politicians appear to have been more active on these -issues than the regulators. Democrats, with the backing of Republican veteran John McCain, have introduced legislation that would require greater disclosure of web platforms that run political advertising - a move designed to prevent a repeat of Russia's hijacking of Facebook. In a separate move, a Senate panel called executives from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube before a panel last month to -answer questions on what they were doing to prevent the posting of hate speech and extremism.</p><p>The debate over Amazon's size has taken on a physical as well as digital dimension. The company has grown so fast that it now employs 40,000 people in central Seattle, up from 5000 in 2010, making it easily America's largest company town. The company occupies 20 per cent of office space in the city across 45 buildings. Cranes dot the skyline, erecting even more buildings for Amazon.</p><p>When Inquirer visited, the city was caught in a fierce debate over whether Amazon was -already too big for it. While its growth has brought in thousands of new and well-paid jobs, it has also led to the fastest rising house prices in the country. This has led to a spike in homelessness, traffic gridlock and even an identity crisis.</p><p>\"If you ask me, as a Seattle -native, I'd say we were better off in the 90s before Amazon got big,\" local author Knute Berger tells -Inquirer. \"Clearly, the tech economy has dramatically impacted rents, real estate values, homelessness, displacement and affordability in general. Amazon has had a big hand in that by the rapidity of its growth.\" Others such as Ed Lazowska, professor of computer science at the University of Washington, disagree. \"Look at that,\" he says, pointing to a street full of Amazon-owned buildings. \"There was nothing here but empty warehouses and carparks before Amazon moved in. Some cities would kill to have this sort of investment.\" And indeed they are. Two hundred and thirty-eight towns and regions across the US put forward bids to be chosen as Amazon's second US headquarters.</p><p>HQ2, as Amazon calls it, will -receive an investment of about $US5bn and create 50,000 jobs.</p><p>As Bezos was -instructing Alexa to open his new building this week, only a block away, hundreds of homeless men, women and children were ensconced at a former Day's Inn hotel. Critics say many of them have been displaced by the rise in rents caused by Amazon's growth. But Amazon has also come to their rescue, allowing them to live rent-free in a building it owns while donating food from the cashier-free Amazon Go store down the road. It seems that even in adversity, Amazon is a one-stop shop.</p><p>Locals say Seattle has become a living symbol of the good and bad of the tech revolution.</p><p>But as Soros said in Davos, it is time to confront the dark side. \"These companies have often played an innovative and liberating role,\" he said. \"(Yet) social media companies exploit the -social environment. This is particularly nefarious because social media companies influence how people think and behave without them even being aware of it. This has far-reaching adverse consequences (for) the functioning of democracy, particularly on the -integrity of elections. The exceptional profitability of these companies is largely a function of their avoiding responsibility for - and avoiding paying for - the content on their platforms.\" Soros believes something harmful and maybe irreversible is happening to human attention in the digital age. \"Social media companies are inducing people to give up their autonomy. The power to shape people's attention is -increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few companies. It (now) takes a real effort to assert and defend what John Stuart Mill called 'the freedom of mind'.\"Cameron Stewart is also US contributor for Sky News Australia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20180203Australian315000358999951</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RJX-4R51-F0JP-W1VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2769\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 3, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Samar Yahya</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"AS the largest Venture Capital (VC) in the region, Middle East Venture Partners (MEVP) has more than $200 million in assets under management across five funds, with over $100M attracted in co-investments. We have a team of 23 highly experienced VC professionals and 40 portfolio companies, and a solid track record with value added investors such as telecom operators, media groups, and financial institutions,\" said Walid Hanna, founder and chief executive officer, Middle East Venture Partners (MEVP).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MEVP recently announced a partnership with Mohamed Alabbar, who acquired a non-controlling stake in MEVP. \"We are excited about this partnership with Alabbar being a recognized leader with an incredible track record in business and entrepreneurship. Since our partnership, our pipeline has already increased and we are looking into more strategic opportunities across the region.</p><p>\"We have a strong portfolio of companies across most tech verticals, including several leaders in key sectors, such as new media, fintech, healthtech and e-commerce marketplaces - with several synergy opportunities across companies. Among some of the leading names in our portfolio are Anghami, the leading music streaming platform in MENA, Altibbi, a leader in digital healthcare in the region, YGAG, a leading digital gift card marketplace in MENA, The Luxury Closet, a leader in second-hand luxury in MENA, and Wego, a leading travel portal,\" Hanna said.</p><p>As for investments in Saudi Arabia, Hanna said \"Saudi Arabia is one of the largest markets in the region in terms of wealth and population making it one of the biggest markets for tech companies looking to expand regionally. The growth-stage tech companies we invest in typically have a presence in Saudi Arabia or have plans to expand there. In addition, Saudi youth are some of the most digitally connected in the region and they are demanding locally relevant tech-based solutions that cater to them. Tech startups are creating and delivering these new services; however, as they reach the next stage of growth, which requires more capital, they are finding it difficult to attract funding. In many cases the funding has lagged behind the pace of change and adoption of technology and this is where MEVP comes in.</p><p>\"We believe that there is significant opportunity for growth, especially for later-stage and growth tech ventures. We recently launched our fifth fund, MEVF III, with a target size of $250 million and we aim to invest in innovative early-stage and growth-stage tech companies across the region.\"</p><p>\"As the market is showing more liquidity and more exits, our new fund MEVF III will help to provide growth capital for these emerging local champions. We can help them with larger-ticket growth capital as well as operational and strategic expertise. We are always on the lookout for rising Saudi stars, and we are actively looking for a full-time Saudi venture partner to support us locally in Saudi Arabia to encourage and bolster the tech startup ecosystem. In addition, we are considering opening an office in Riyadh to have a more permanent presence and further support Saudi growth-stage businesses,\" said Hanna</p><p>On challenges that MEVP might face in Saudi market, Hanna commented: \"The challenges in Saudi Arabia are similar to those encountered in other markets in MENA. The regional technology sector lacks Series B and late stage growth capital. International investors are reaping the rewards of the opportunity in later stage funding in the MENA region. Such \"capital void\" highlights a compelling opportunity for MEVP, and other VCs, to play a significant role in this nascent space.</p><p>\"In addition, as with the rest of the region, there needs to be further encouragement of technology-based education and training for youth to develop their talents and prepare them for jobs that require these skills. If we are looking to have the region compete on a global level, local talent needs to be nurtured from today. Furthermore, certain regulations can be eased to allow startups and small businesses to grow and thrive in a challenging and competitive local and global business environment we will then see a more thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem that drives innovation and caters to the requirements and aspirations of future generations.\"</p><p>According to Hanna investing in tech start-ups has two sides. On the demand side, there are over 300m tech-savvy consumers hungry for digital goods and services. There is high Internet penetration and high smartphone penetration. Digital consumers want to learn and shop on their mobile phone, yet e-commerce only accounts for 2% of retail in MENA.</p><p>On the supply side, there was more than $800m invested last year with the strong possibility to break $1bn this year. There is a significant spike in interest from global tech companies and local corporates into this region. In the past year Amazon acquired Souq (pivoting from their traditional approach to build locally); Emaar Malls acquired a majority stake in Namshi to expand their online retail presence; Delivery Hero acquired Kuwaiti food delivery rival Carriage.</p><p>\"We believe this momentum will attract more buyers to the region and validate the tech investment potential in the Middle East. More importantly, it underscores the importance to have local partners who understand the complexities of this large bloc with different regulations and different tastes across the region. It is clear that demands from the consumer and businesses are growing faster than the capital available for these tech companies. There are emerging local champions reaching next level of growth with increasing capital needs and that is where our new fund will be positioned.\"</p><p>About the new fund, he said, MEVF III will focus on key six tech sectors with attractive growth potential: new media, ecommerce/marketplaces, fintech, healthtech, edutech, and travel.</p><p>MEVP invests in companies that provide real solutions to this region given its challenges in a complicated market with local needs. The startups must have scalable business models and proven product-market fit, solid and proven economics with organic traction. With regards to the entrepreneurs, MEVP supports founders with a strong track record of success and sector knowledge expertise have the ability to build MENA market leaders.\"</p><p>On the future of VC investments in the region, Hanna said that VC investments in MENA (as % of GDP) amounted in 2016 to 0.03%, significantly less than in the US (at 0.4%) and even much less than in India (at 0.2%). This is just one descriptive factor at the tremendous opportunity for growth. The MENA region presents an attractive opportunity for venture capital investment due to favorable macro-economic conditions, rise of local champions, lack of equity funding, and realization of exit opportunities. The region has a total population of about 345 million, and with one common language and a shared culture, the region represents a large market for consumer and B2B tech companies.</p><p>\"We believe that now is the beginning of a big tech play in MENA. We are seeing rapid changes and adoption of technology by consumers, businesses, and governments. The shift from offline to online is happening now and the region is starting to experience the digital disruption like rest of the world. Some governments are trying to diversify economically with new initiatives into the technology and other sectors. The current macro environment is very attractive.</p><p>\"MEVP wants to transform local economies - be the agent of positive change and disruption through building home grown tech champions that defend our local commercial interests. And to achieve this, we need to provide financial, strategic and operational support to local tech-based companies,\" Hanna said</p><p>MEVP, established in 2010, is now the oldest and one of the largest and most established independent venture capital firms in the region involved in building the thriving tech entrepreneurial ecosystem. MEVP invests in innovative, early-stage and growth-stage businesses run by talented entrepreneurs located primarily throughout the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey (MENAT) region.</p><p>MEVP team is highly experienced and is a solid track record with value added investors. VC is important to drive the tech entrepreneurship in the region, especially to unlock the potential of its tech-savvy youth, with more than one-third the population below the age of 25.

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) has ruled that as long as the agency receives taxes, the use of bitcoin is a private business matter. And the Ohio Department of Public Safety has also taken no position on merchants accepting bitcoin for liquor sales.</p><p>After an inquiry from a Cleveland Plain Dealer reporter into the topic, the Public Safety Department said, \"In keeping with guidance from the IRS that bitcoins are a form of 'property' and not 'currency' for tax purposes, the Ohio Investigative Unit may investigate the use of bitcoins as monetary payment for alcohol.\"</p><p>So merchants could accept Bitcoin for alcohol purchases, but the Investigative Unit could decide to issue a citation to the bar owner because of its decision. The bar owner could then challenge the citation in court. \"Ultimately the Ohio Liquor Control Commission, and possibly an Ohio court, will determine whether the use was permissible,\" said Eric Wolf, who is in charge of the Investigative Unit, in the response.</p><p>Much of the progress Bitcoin has made with Ohio merchants and regulators has been due to the efforts of Nikhil Chand, CEO of CoinNEO, a Bitcoin consulting startup that is active in Cleveland.</p><p>Chand has continued to engage with Ohio state government agencies on the topic.</p><p>\"We read [the ODPS'] letter to be a challenge to small-business owners to break the law in order to move this forward,\" said Chand. \"We want a proactive investigation though\"\\xA6instead of having these merchants risk their businesses and livelihood.\"</p><p>He has told merchants on Lee Road to not accept bitcoin for alcohol and poke at Ohio regulators until they take a formal position.</p><p>The Ohio Attorney General's office referred inquiries from PaymentsSource to the Ohio Liquor Control Commission, a part of the Department of Commerce, which referred inquiries to the Department of Public Safety, which did not return several calls and emails. During each of those calls, agency representatives seemed unfamiliar with Bitcoin.</p><p>Chand has had similar experiences but he's hopeful that the state of Ohio will look to more proactive states, such as California and Texas, as a model. Ohio could rule that Bitcoin is money, similar to California's stance. The state could also add a clause to liquor laws to address digital currency, or completely rework its laws.</p><p>Ohio's decision is impeding on merchants' \"ability to do business and compete. It gets in the way of creative entrepreneurship,\" Chand said.</p><p>Chand insists the rulings are anti-small business. \"We would have easily doubled revenues on Lee Road in Bitcoin sales alone had we allowed alcohol sales,\" he said.</p><p>And not only in Cleveland, but also in Columbus and Cincinnati, bars and breweries are showing interest in accepting Bitcoin and moving the conversation with regulators forward. Chand is currently trying to get a petition together, and building a working group of small-business owners and legal counsel to engage the Ohio stateCongress.</p><p>The six merchants along Lee Road accept Bitcoin through BitPay, a Bitcoin merchant services provider that offers a free package for smaller merchants who don't need advanced features such as Quickbooks accounting software integration.</p><p>\"Credit cards kill me; I see what I get charged [for accepting credit cards] out of net proceeds every month\"\\xA6and you could make a house payment on it,\" said Adam Fleischer, owner of The Wine Spot. \"If I'm going to survive and reinvest my money back into the business and hire people and help the local economy\"\\xA6I need to shift some of my focus off credit cards.\"</p><p>Fleischer pays between 2.75% and 4% on credit card transactions.</p><p>And the other businesses in the area-about 95% of which are independently-owned-are likely feeling the same need for alternative payment methods, especially with more commerce moving online and big box retailers squeezing margins.</p><p>In part because of the attention focused on the benefits of cryptocurrency, such as near real-time transactions without high fees, the payments industry has been eyeing other ways to cut merchant costs.</p><p>Both legacy players and startups, including WingCash, are offering free, immediate and guaranteed cash-like transactions digitally when both the payer and payee are part of the company's network. And while the big tech companies focus on mobile wallets, traditional payment methods are getting a second wind with startups building out digital systems for transacting with checks or over automated clearinghouse rails.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Most of the merchants on Bitcoin Boulevard accept one or two Bitcoin transactions per week.</p><p>But the press surrounding the introduction of Bitcoin Boulevard has been tremendous. The Wine Spot has been featured on National Public Radio (NPR), The Washington Post, Entrepreneur Magazine, a Korean television station and Fusion Television.</p><p>\"That sort of exposure as a result of accepting a new technology was, to me, a no-brainer,\" Fleischer said, \"We'd never be able to pay for the advertising to reach all those people that national coverage does.\"</p><p>The wine seller has seen an increase in tourists coming to Cleveland because they've heard about Bitcoin Boulevard. Even if these tourists are not using the digital currency, more of them are coming in to shop with traditional payment methods, Fleischer said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CARDPM-0003019436</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CARDPM2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DCP-R451-JCRW-5318-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1058\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) has ruled that as long as the agency receives taxes, the use of bitcoin is a private business matter. And the Ohio Department of Public Safety has also taken no position on merchants accepting bitcoin for liquor sales.</p><p>After an inquiry from a Cleveland Plain Dealer reporter into the topic, the Public Safety Department said, \"In keeping with guidance from the IRS that bitcoins are a form of 'property' and not 'currency' for tax purposes, the Ohio Investigative Unit may investigate the use of bitcoins as monetary payment for alcohol.\"</p><p>So merchants could accept Bitcoin for alcohol purchases, but the Investigative Unit could decide to issue a citation to the bar owner because of its decision. The bar owner could then challenge the citation in court. \"Ultimately the Ohio Liquor Control Commission, and possibly an Ohio court, will determine whether the use was permissible,\" said Eric Wolf, who is in charge of the Investigative Unit, in the response.</p><p>Much of the progress Bitcoin has made with Ohio merchants and regulators has been due to the efforts of Nikhil Chand, CEO of CoinNEO, a Bitcoin consulting startup that is active in Cleveland.</p><p>Chand has continued to engage with Ohio state government agencies on the topic.</p><p>\"We read [the ODPS'] letter to be a challenge to small-business owners to break the law in order to move this forward,\" said Chand. \"We want a proactive investigation though\"\\xA6instead of having these merchants risk their businesses and livelihood.\"</p><p>He has told merchants on Lee Road to not accept bitcoin for alcohol and poke at Ohio regulators until they take a formal position.</p><p>The Ohio Attorney General's office referred inquiries from PaymentsSource to the Ohio Liquor Control Commission, a part of the Department of Commerce, which referred inquiries to the Department of Public Safety, which did not return several calls and emails. During each of those calls, agency representatives seemed unfamiliar with Bitcoin.</p><p>Chand has had similar experiences but he's hopeful that the state of Ohio will look to more proactive states, such as California and Texas, as a model. Ohio could rule that Bitcoin is money, similar to California's stance. The state could also add a clause to liquor laws to address digital currency, or completely rework its laws.</p><p>Ohio's decision is impeding on merchants' \"ability to do business and compete. It gets in the way of creative entrepreneurship,\" Chand said.</p><p>Chand insists the rulings are anti-small business. \"We would have easily doubled revenues on Lee Road in Bitcoin sales alone had we allowed alcohol sales,\" he said.</p><p>And not only in Cleveland, but also in Columbus and Cincinnati, bars and breweries are showing interest in accepting Bitcoin and moving the conversation with regulators forward. Chand is currently trying to get a petition together, and building a working group of small-business owners and legal counsel to engage the Ohio stateCongress.</p><p>The six merchants along Lee Road accept Bitcoin through BitPay, a Bitcoin merchant services provider that offers a free package for smaller merchants who don't need advanced features such as Quickbooks accounting software integration.</p><p>\"Credit cards kill me; I see what I get charged [for accepting credit cards] out of net proceeds every month\"\\xA6and you could make a house payment on it,\" said Adam Fleischer, owner of The Wine Spot. \"If I'm going to survive and reinvest my money back into the business and hire people and help the local economy\"\\xA6I need to shift some of my focus off credit cards.\"</p><p>Fleischer pays between 2.75% and 4% on credit card transactions.</p><p>And the other businesses in the area-about 95% of which are independently-owned-are likely feeling the same need for alternative payment methods, especially with more commerce moving online and big box retailers squeezing margins.</p><p>In part because of the attention focused on the benefits of cryptocurrency, such as near real-time transactions without high fees, the payments industry has been eyeing other ways to cut merchant costs.</p><p>Both legacy players and startups, including WingCash, are offering free, immediate and guaranteed cash-like transactions digitally when both the payer and payee are part of the company's network. And while the big tech companies focus on mobile wallets, traditional payment methods are getting a second wind with startups building out digital systems for transacting with checks or over automated clearinghouse rails.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Most of the merchants on Bitcoin Boulevard accept one or two Bitcoin transactions per week.</p><p>But the press surrounding the introduction of Bitcoin Boulevard has been tremendous. The Wine Spot has been featured on National Public Radio (NPR), The Washington Post, Entrepreneur Magazine, a Korean television station and Fusion Television.</p><p>\"That sort of exposure as a result of accepting a new technology was, to me, a no-brainer,\" Fleischer said, \"We'd never be able to pay for the advertising to reach all those people that national coverage does.\"</p><p>The wine seller has seen an increase in tourists coming to Cleveland because they've heard about Bitcoin Boulevard. Even if these tourists are not using the digital currency, more of them are coming in to shop with traditional payment methods, Fleischer said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CARDPM-0003019436</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CARDPM2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DCN-6441-JCRW-52CF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1058\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) has ruled that as long as the agency receives taxes, the use of bitcoin is a private business matter. And the Ohio Department of Public Safety has also taken no position on merchants accepting bitcoin for liquor sales.</p><p>After an inquiry from a Cleveland Plain Dealer reporter into the topic, the Public Safety Department said, \"In keeping with guidance from the IRS that bitcoins are a form of 'property' and not 'currency' for tax purposes, the Ohio Investigative Unit may investigate the use of bitcoins as monetary payment for alcohol.\"</p><p>So merchants could accept Bitcoin for alcohol purchases, but the Investigative Unit could decide to issue a citation to the bar owner because of its decision. The bar owner could then challenge the citation in court. \"Ultimately the Ohio Liquor Control Commission, and possibly an Ohio court, will determine whether the use was permissible,\" said Eric Wolf, who is in charge of the Investigative Unit, in the response.</p><p>Much of the progress Bitcoin has made with Ohio merchants and regulators has been due to the efforts of Nikhil Chand, CEO of CoinNEO, a Bitcoin consulting startup that is active in Cleveland.</p><p>Chand has continued to engage with Ohio state government agencies on the topic.</p><p>\"We read [the ODPS'] letter to be a challenge to small-business owners to break the law in order to move this forward,\" said Chand. \"We want a proactive investigation though\"\\xA6instead of having these merchants risk their businesses and livelihood.\"</p><p>He has told merchants on Lee Road to not accept bitcoin for alcohol and poke at Ohio regulators until they take a formal position.</p><p>The Ohio Attorney General's office referred inquiries from PaymentsSource to the Ohio Liquor Control Commission, a part of the Department of Commerce, which referred inquiries to the Department of Public Safety, which did not return several calls and emails. During each of those calls, agency representatives seemed unfamiliar with Bitcoin.</p><p>Chand has had similar experiences but he's hopeful that the state of Ohio will look to more proactive states, such as California and Texas, as a model. Ohio could rule that Bitcoin is money, similar to California's stance. The state could also add a clause to liquor laws to address digital currency, or completely rework its laws.</p><p>Ohio's decision is impeding on merchants' \"ability to do business and compete. It gets in the way of creative entrepreneurship,\" Chand said.</p><p>Chand insists the rulings are anti-small business. \"We would have easily doubled revenues on Lee Road in Bitcoin sales alone had we allowed alcohol sales,\" he said.</p><p>And not only in Cleveland, but also in Columbus and Cincinnati, bars and breweries are showing interest in accepting Bitcoin and moving the conversation with regulators forward. Chand is currently trying to get a petition together, and building a working group of small-business owners and legal counsel to engage the Ohio stateCongress.</p><p>The six merchants along Lee Road accept Bitcoin through BitPay, a Bitcoin merchant services provider that offers a free package for smaller merchants who don't need advanced features such as Quickbooks accounting software integration.</p><p>\"Credit cards kill me; I see what I get charged [for accepting credit cards] out of net proceeds every month\"\\xA6and you could make a house payment on it,\" said Adam Fleischer, owner of The Wine Spot. \"If I'm going to survive and reinvest my money back into the business and hire people and help the local economy\"\\xA6I need to shift some of my focus off credit cards.\"</p><p>Fleischer pays between 2.75% and 4% on credit card transactions.</p><p>And the other businesses in the area-about 95% of which are independently-owned-are likely feeling the same need for alternative payment methods, especially with more commerce moving online and big box retailers squeezing margins.</p><p>In part because of the attention focused on the benefits of cryptocurrency, such as near real-time transactions without high fees, the payments industry has been eyeing other ways to cut merchant costs.</p><p>Both legacy players and startups, including WingCash, are offering free, immediate and guaranteed cash-like transactions digitally when both the payer and payee are part of the company's network. And while the big tech companies focus on mobile wallets, traditional payment methods are getting a second wind with startups building out digital systems for transacting with checks or over automated clearinghouse rails.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Most of the merchants on Bitcoin Boulevard accept one or two Bitcoin transactions per week.</p><p>But the press surrounding the introduction of Bitcoin Boulevard has been tremendous. The Wine Spot has been featured on National Public Radio (NPR), The Washington Post, Entrepreneur Magazine, a Korean television station and Fusion Television.</p><p>\"That sort of exposure as a result of accepting a new technology was, to me, a no-brainer,\" Fleischer said, \"We'd never be able to pay for the advertising to reach all those people that national coverage does.\"</p><p>The wine seller has seen an increase in tourists coming to Cleveland because they've heard about Bitcoin Boulevard. Even if these tourists are not using the digital currency, more of them are coming in to shop with traditional payment methods, Fleischer said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CARDPM-0003019436</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CARDPM2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DCP-SKP1-F06X-W03K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1058\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Next thing you know, Wall Street is suddenly watching the wires for word of the next big tech acquisition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But don't expect to see much in the way of smoke signals from the telecom tent. It's been a good two years since deal talk led to action in these parts, and industry observers see roadblocks even if big telcos do want to pair up.</p><p>Though it hardly qualifies as merger mania, this week's action in the tech sector has yanked the M&amp;A machine out of mothballs. Friday's $5.1 billion hostile bid by Oracle (ORCL:Nasdaq) to acquire PeopleSoft (PSFT:Nasdaq) came in the wake of Wednesday's news that PeopleSoft had bid on business software rival J.D. Edwards (JDEC:Nasdaq).</p><p>That same day, Handspring (HAND:Nasdaq) agreed to merge with handheld computer rival Palm (PALM:Nasdaq).</p><p>But despite an abundance of preliminary chats between phone giants like BellSouth (BLS:NYSE) and AT&amp;T (T:NYSE), as well as conversations among wireless dealmakers involving Cingular, T-Mobile and AT&amp;T Wireless (AWE:NYSE), the telecom industry's merger-and-acquisition docket has been empty. This despite a long list of reasons that merger proponents can list off.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Taking the Case</p><p>With six wireless service companies vying for business in most major cities, a critical cap lifted on the amount of wireless radio wave spectrum any single player can own, and the abrupt slowdown in new subscriber growth, the case for consolidation appears strong. The last two months' sharp rise in stock prices has only emboldened the speculators.</p><p>Similarly, now that local phone companies like Verizon (VZ:NYSE) and SBC (SBC:NYSE) are duplicating service packages offered by long distance rivals AT&amp;T and MCI, there's reason to think the seven big phone players could find their way to a field of three.</p><p>\"Everyone wants someone else to merge,\" says Jefferies &amp; Co. analyst Richard Klugman. Sales are down, competition is brutal, a merger \"would reduce one less price leader. They just aren't sure the benefits are there,\" says Klugman, referring to the merger stalemate.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Bad Feelings</p><p> This may seem slightly odd for a sector that brought some of the largest deals to the market in the late '90s. But obviously, things have changed a bit since then.</p><p>Origins of the industry's merger shyness can be traced in part to the 2000 kibosh the Justice Department put on the proposed merger of Sprint (FON:NYSE) with a company that was then known as WorldCom and now goes by MCI. The U.S. government said combining Sprint and WorldCom would put too much of the market in too few hands. Since then, fear of antitrust scrutiny -- in addition to the industry's problems with debt and basic-business erosion -- has helped keep the blockbuster deals in check.</p><p>Probably the biggest and most widely known deal discussions concern the possible hookup between local phone giant BellSouth and top long-distance player AT&amp;T. While some observers had debated the merits of combining BellSouth's stalled local phone business with AT&amp;T's deteriorating long-distance effort, others say the deal's threat to recombine Ma Bell with a Baby Bell is almost a nonstarter. To foster competition, AT&amp;T was broken up into a long-distance business and seven Baby Bells in 1984. Efforts to rejoin the family have never proceeded beyond the discussion stage.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be surprised if there were conversations, but a deal with AT&amp;T and BellSouth would be exceptionally difficult from a regulatory perspective,\" says Klugman.</p><p>\"These are untested waters,\" says a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer. \"We really don't know how things will play out among the regulators, the Department of Justice, and any other group that looks at these deals.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-#10092126#</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2003</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:48SN-JRP0-01HP-117F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"618\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>TheStreet.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19301\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2003 TheStreet.com, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>June 6, 2003 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>AT&amp;T MOBILITY LLC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>\u00a0AT&amp;T INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>\u00a0VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>\u00a0ORACLE CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>\u00a0JEFFERIES &amp;

Chicago-based LSC Communications and Wisconsin's Quad/Graphics called off the $1.4 billion deal July 23 after the U.S. Department of Justice sued last month to block the combination on antitrust grounds. Government lawyers argued the deal would combine the only two commercial printers with the nationwide scale to print and distribute magazines, books and catalogs, setting the stage for price hikes and service cuts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Had this merger gone forward, it would have harmed competition that benefits publishers, retailers, and, ultimately, consumers through lower prices and greater availability of printed products from popular books to grade school textbooks,\" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division said in a statement celebrating the companies' capitulation.</p><p>Coincidentally, July 23 also brought news that Attorney General William Barr had authorized a broad review of the expanding market power of Big Tech companies.</p><p>\"Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,\" Delrahim said in another statement. \"The department's antitrust review will explore these important issues.\"</p><p>If he's looking for witnesses to testify about the growing might of digital behemoths, he might call a commercial printing executive. Demand for traditional printing services is under pressure as print publications lose advertisers and readers to online rivals. Industry heavyweights like LSC, which was spun out of 155-year-old R.R. Donnelley in 2016, have propped up revenues by acquiring smaller printers and adding new services.</p><p>But it's getting harder every day. In the statement announcing the Quad deal was off, LSC CEO Thomas Quinlan also warned that LSC would report a loss of $22 million to $26 million for the recently completed second quarter, after booking $8 million in profit a year earlier. Revenue is expected to drop about 8 percent to between $865 million and $875 million.</p><p>Quinlan blamed \"the accelerated impact of digital disruption of demand for printed materials.\"</p><p>Disruption notwithstanding, antitrust regulators weren't about to sign off on a deal they considered a threat to price competition between the country's two largest commercial printers.</p><p>Noting that Quad and LSC \"compete head-to-head on price and quality,\" the Justice Department argued the merger would \"deny their customers the benefits of competition and likely increase the price and reduce the availability of products from popular magazines to grade-school textbooks.\" Quad and LSC disputed the government's claims but opted not to take the case to trial.</p><p>\"The parties have determined that the added delay, uncertainty and cost of legal challenges would have likely eroded a considerable amount of the expected benefits of the merger,\" Quad said in a press release.</p><p>Without a full trial, it's hard to assess the merits of each side's arguments. What's clear is that Delrahim's antitrust patrol won't be cutting any breaks to beleaguered companies that turn to mergers for shelter from the digital storm. Their tough stance suggests an unwillingness to consider the impact of digitization on traditional markets when assessing the potential effect of a merger on competition and pricing.</p><p>Mature or shrinking industries often undergo consolidation, as firms look to grow through acquisitions that can boost revenue and create opportunities to expand profit margins through cost cuts, economies of scale and other efficiencies. Consolidation options dwindle, however, when antitrust officials blow the whistle on deals like the LSC/Quad combo.</p><p>That has implications for other industries where incumbents are losing ground to digital interlopers. Newspapers, for example, have seen revenues plummet as online media decimates print circulation and advertising. Consolidation is a natural response, but would-be dealmakers including Chicago-based Tribune Publishing have encountered antitrust obstacles. The feds blocked Tribune's deal to acquire papers in Southern California and questioned a proposed acquisition of the Chicago Sun-Times. Potential antitrust issues also seem to have cooled interest in a combination with McClatchy.</p><p>If reported talks between Gannett and GateHouse produce a deal, we'll find out if the Justice Department's view of newspaper combinations has softened. Still, any company hoping to merge its way out of digital disruption had better have a Plan B.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIBUS-4923784</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIBUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPP-R9T1-JC0G-40NV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8099</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Crain Communication All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crain's Chicago Business</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"23760\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 42</volume><edition>Print Version</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 29, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In the post-coronavirus economy, the question of social fairness must be addressed</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At this moment in time, the old model doesn't work any more. When President Donald Trump pledged to put \"America first\", he could not have imagined that the United States would one day top the world in coronavirus cases (over 1.2 million) and deaths (over 75,000). Few could have imagined the world's most powerful economy would, in a matter of months, move from near full employment to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3082392/coronavirus-latest-saddest-day-global-economy-us\">more than 30 million</url> seeking unemployment aid. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And those of us who bought into the \"one for all, all for one\" mythology of Hollywood movies like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Saving Private Ryan</emphasis> cannot believe that the US is willing to sacrifice <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3082722/100000-dead-americans-trump-revises-us-coronavirus\">100,000 lives</url> to reopen the economy earlier. Do livelihoods matter more than lives now? </p><p>American capitalism works on the basis that all are free to pursue their goals, so the best, brightest and most competitive can rise to the top. Competitive freedom is at the heart of a meritocratic society. </p><p>British sociologist Michael Young invented the word meritocracy in his 1958 satire, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Rise of the Meritocracy</emphasis>. He wrote: \"Today we frankly recognise that democracy can be no more than aspiration, and have rule not so much by the people as by the cleverest people; not an aristocracy of birth, not a plutocracy of wealth, but a true meritocracy of talent.\" </p><p>He foresaw that the rise of the meritocratic class would divide society into the elite and the non-elite, who would come to realise that members of the elite were governing not in society's interests but in their own interests. </p><p>This abuse of power by the elite is exemplified by the shareholder-value model of corporate governance. The model suggests that a company should pay top dollar for management to maximise shareholder value. Top management talent are given share options so as to align their interests with those of shareholders. </p><p>The assumption is that profitable and efficient companies create value for shareholders and society. However, in practice, many managers use the corporate cash for share buy-backs to prop up the value of their share options, sell valuable assets to maintain quarterly earnings and sack staff whenever profits are threatened. </p><p>The best can't be working for the rest when they are looking out for their own interests first. </p><p>In his latest book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Storm Before the Calm</emphasis>, geopolitical strategist George Friedman reckons that, since the 1980s, new technology has divided America into the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/2119052/three-richest-people-us-own-much-wealth-bottom-half\">best</url> and the rest: the technocratic class who went to the best universities and benefited the most from tech bubbles, and the industrial class who are struggling in the old economy. </p><p>As political scientists Jeff D. Colgan and Robert O. Keohane argued in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Foreign Affairs</emphasis> magazine in 2017: \"Elites have taken advantage of the global liberal order - sometimes inadvertently, sometimes intentionally - to capture most of the income and wealth gains in recent decades, and they have not shared much with the middle and lower classes.\" </p><p>Today, the pandemic has brought into sharper relief the divide between the best and the rest. Lockdowns have split the economy into viable sectors where people can <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/article/3080354/work-home-revolution-has-begun-thanks-coronavirus-remote\">work remotely</url> and fragile offline sectors where most people work. </p><p>In the post-coronavirus economy, big tech companies will thrive, while businesses that depend on high crowd density - such as mega malls, cruise ships, airlines and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3081349/coronavirus-hong-kong-tourism-recovery-far-certain\">tourism</url> - will suffer. </p><p>This raises a fundamental question of social fairness. Can we still afford to pay financial engineers very high salaries, when the ability of banks to make money is less dependent on public deposits than central banks' monetary creation? Why should public health workers, who are putting their lives on the line in the pandemic, be paid significantly less than software technicians? </p><p>The market cannot price in the social value of different jobs. But if we support minimum wages, to be fair, surely we can consider caps on salaries for less-socially-useful jobs. </p><p>Governments may have to increase expenditure in a few areas going forward. First, there is the cost of keeping firms and jobs alive during lockdowns. Second, investment may be necessary to help viable firms make a transition to the post-coronavirus economy. </p><p>Last but not least, workers have to be retrained to do jobs in the post-Covid-19 economy; here, governments will have to rely on big tech. However, new technology might not create so many new jobs. </p><p>All this suggests that, in the post-coronavirus economy, we can expect large government spending programmes and deficits well in excess of those run during the 2008 financial crisis. Unless there is a miracle in the form of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3081655/bill-gates-hopes-his-coronavirus-vaccine\">vaccine</url>, the outcome of the reopening of businesses will depend on the quality of health and social distancing regulations. </p><p>In adapting to survive, we need to build in redundancy and be resilient to future shocks. It must be recognised what is resilient is not the most efficient. There are no best solutions going forward. </p><p>In a post-pandemic world, the best cannot be the enemy of the good. The best should take care of the rest. This means cooperation, empathy and putting people first. Our hearts go out to the tens of thousands who might die as Trump continues to put \"America first\". If that is the best model, the best is not for me. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Sheng writes on global issues from an Asian perspective.

It might make it whilst we are on air, or certainly -- there you are. It has even made it whilst we were just talking, 29,000 on the Dow Jones.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's the way the market is looking. It is a bullish day. The reasons behind in the next hour.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is bullish despite some grim news. United airlines says that it will furlough 20 percent of its frontline staff.</p><p>Greece is on the wrong end of European travel restrictions. The country's Tourism Minister is with me shortly.</p><p>And Daimler's Chief Executive says Daimler has dodged the curveballs. You will hear him on this program.</p><p>We are live from New York. It is the mid-week, Wednesday edition, it is September 2nd. I am Richard Quest. And indeed, I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. The woes of the airline industry are well and truly coming home to roost, in warnings that have gone unheeded by the U.S. Congress. Well now, United said we warned you, so now, we are going to furlough permanently 16,000 employees.</p><p>Air travel is still restricted. Capacity is greatly reduced. Passenger numbers are way down.</p><p>U.S. Federal aid expires -- or the limitations expire on October 1st and that is when the airlines, United says it will do an involuntarily furlough of 16,000 employees, 20 percent of the front line workers.</p><p>There is no considerable rebound seen in the aviation industry until a vaccine is widely available.</p><p>Pete Muntean is our aviation correspondent. He is with me now. No one could say United didn't warn months ago. They said, it could be 32,000. So, I guess coming in at 16,000, they would say they have done whatever they can, but these are the number that has to leave.</p><p>PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: That 16,000 number, Richard, is still very stark the airline says. It actually calls it heartbreaking considering the fact that there is no airline recovery coming it says, no vaccine to bring passengers back, no sign of new Federal aid to keep these jobs.</p><p>You know, what is so interesting as you mentioned is that this number is actually a lot smaller than what United forecast back in July. United is actually thanking being 7,000 employees for taking early outs or early retirements.</p><p>An unknown number of employees are taking voluntary paid leave or other incentive packages although in this new memo to employees, United does underscore that the number of people who are going to be furloughed October 1st could be zero if Congress steps up to the plate once more and extends the CARES Act beyond October 1st saving these jobs into 2021, but that October 1st cliff is only a few weeks away -- Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Other airlines, if we look at the numbers, other airlines have come up with similar large losses of staff. We have got United's number. But also Delta has said it will lose staff. American has said it will lose staff.</p><p>These are the numbers that we are looking at. American has warned of 19,000. Delta says 2,000 furloughed pilots; 16,000 for United.</p><p>On the international front, we know there are thousands will go at Lufthansa. British Airways says it will cut up to 12,000.</p><p>Pete, I mean, even with help, even with government programs, until the flying public feels more secure, then, really, we are looking at a considerably smaller airline sector.</p><p>MUNTEAN: United makes no bones about it, Richard. They say there has to be a widely developed and available vaccine so passengers feel comfortable to come back.</p><p>There is no mistaking, though, that Federal aid will really only stop the bleeding. Airlines everywhere, as you said, are hurting. You know, so far, this talk is only about furloughs. But now the question is, as we go into the fall and the winter, will we be talking about airlines folding completely?</p><p>You know, United's Chairman, Oscar Munoz said in an exclusive interview with CNN that he does anticipate airlines going out of business. We will see, though, if that happens as this pandemic drags on.</p><p>So far, no major airlines have gone out of business, only smaller regional airlines -- Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Pete Muntean in Washington. Pete, thank you. Now, it may seem such an obvious point to make, but you'll see why in a second.</p><p>Planes obviously take passengers from A to B. If they are not flying, those passengers aren't getting there and the destinations are suffering.</p><p>[15:05:21]</p><p>QUEST: The summer slump in European travel has been dramatic, and as we go into the fall and the autumn, so we can now we can see that in crystal clear clarity.</p><p>Travel corridors set up in emergencies are now being slammed shut after a brutal season. E.U. cases are rising. Let me tell you, the U.K. could remove Portugal from its safe list. There are new restrictions on Greece from Scotland and Wales. TUI is cancelling trips to resorts on the Island of Zante.</p><p>Overall, look at how the summer season has played out in terms of those countries and how much their numbers were down. Croatia is the worse. Croatia saw numbers down 87 percent. For Portugal and Spain, down 64 percent. Greece down 67 percent. Arguably, it was an achievement that they held the line at 67 percent.</p><p>Harry Theoharis is the Tourism Minister in Greece. He joins me now from Athens. Minister, you didn't -- I mean, you did the best you could, but now the numbers of infections are rising, even if they are not from imported tourists. So what's gone wrong in Greece?</p><p>HARRY THEOHARIS, GREEK, TOURISM MINISTER: Well, it is not a case of things going wrong. When we opened our economy, obviously, we expected and we expect the number of cases to go up.</p><p>We've seen, if you like, a second wave in all the countries. What we did, we explained the plan a few months ago together with you. I am happy to say we remained with that plan exactly as we said then and we are taking targeted measures when and where it is necessary, and it has been necessary.</p><p>I mean, people in the summer relax a bit more and it is understandable that as I said before that the cases would rise.</p><p>Our measures seem to take effect. We have taken some places off the restricted list. So this is good overall. But a very dynamic process. A very difficult process and we are monitoring it daily.</p><p>QUEST: The recent TUI flight back to the U.K., where numerous passengers were on board had the virus, whether they got it in Greece or not, or the circumstances of it, I mean, what it shows, and what it proves is just how difficult it has been for you to keep your tourism industry open at such a difficult period.</p><p>THEOHARIS: Yes, of course. Back in April, obviously, I would have said that it's not possible to open up. But it is very hard work and with a lot of cooperation from every part of the industry and of course the public sector, we managed to open and we managed to keep the engines running and the engines going.</p><p>I am very proud of that. And we are going to continue doing whatever it takes to keep our people and our tourists, our guests safe.</p><p>Now, we are seeing that we are ready to take any difficult decisions to sort of stop parties, stop wedding or, you know, gatherings in bars after 12:00. So we are doing whatever it takes to keep our people safe.</p><p>And when things get better -- and they have been better in the areas where we ...</p><p>QUEST: Minister?</p><p>THEOHARIS: ... imposed them, we will lift them.</p><p>QUEST: Minister, what I do want to get into, as we go into the winter, where you know, the summer season is drawing to a close. Greece traditionally has longer season because of your position in the Mediterranean and the Greek Sea where you are -- but as you go into winter, this is going to become a crisis, an economic crisis of another different kind for you, isn't it?</p><p>THEOHARIS: Well, of course. We monitored the economic situation as well. That's why we are doing our best to keep the economy with safety in our mind. But at the same time, we want to ensure that whatever economic hardship and whatever economic problems are still there in the winter, we will have enough \"ammunition,\" quote-unquote in order to support and to bring the needed to try and support to both employees and the enterprises.</p><p>Rest assured that no enterprise and no single employee that needs our support will not find it. We will support each and every one of them.</p><p>[15:10:07]</p><p>QUEST: Your numbers are down roughly 70 percent, 67 percent.</p><p>THEOHARIS: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: How much permanent -- how much permanent muscle from the industry do you think has been cut away? Those restaurants, tavernas that won't be able to come back, those resorts that simply weren't able to get the financing to keep going. What do you think the permanent damage has been to your tourism industry?</p><p>THEOHARIS: WELL, this is again a dynamic situation. Nobody knows the end date yet. We don't know on the health front when we will see some kind of return to normality.</p><p>So this -- the answer to your question might be very different in two, three, four or five months' time.</p><p>But for the time being, I would say that the problems are up to a point manageable. I do not see things that will destroy, if you like, the value - - the assets of what we have built during the past few years.</p><p>All this, however, is very contingent on how the pandemic will unfold. Nobody knows.</p><p>QUEST: Finally, Minister, how difficult has it been running an industry where at the whim of one government or another -- whether for good reason or not -- you have suddenly found the entire scenario change.</p><p>Scotland suddenly put you on the banned list, another country takes you off the list, and somebody else puts another country. When you talk to other European ministers, how difficult has it been to manage this?</p><p>THEOHARIS: Yes, it's been very, very difficult. We now are back in the stage where we need more coordinated action on a European level. From our point of view, the Scottish decision has been harsh and we would like to see under the basis of the decision is, because the yardstick that the U.K. has put on its own of 20 cases per 100,000 of population, we are nowhere near that.</p><p>So, if you like, we need more cooperation and coordination in order to ensure that there is more stability it has been a very, very rough and very, very difficult year.</p><p>QUEST: Minister, we are grateful that you have spoken to us on several indication and we will continue to keep in touch with you obviously with the situation in Greece. Very glad to have you with us tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Now a milestone for China of course which is where the whole virus began in the first place. Now, flights in and out of Beijing to certain select destinations are about to resume, international flights, specifically. CNN's David Culver is our correspondent in Beijing.</p><p>DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Richard, this is a big step in things getting back to where we were before the outbreak. China announcing that from Beijing, the capital, they will be resuming international flights to specific countries that they have listed. Those countries that they have deemed to be mostly under control when it comes to the outbreak.</p><p>We are talking about Cambodia, Greece, Denmark, Thailand, Pakistan, Australia, Canada, and Sweden. Now, what does it mean?</p><p>Well, it means eligible passengers are from those countries, individuals with specific visas can come into Beijing and will be able to leave China. So that's a start in opening borders. However, we have got to stress, the borders here are still very much sealed off to most every tourist, most every foreigner really.</p><p>Chinese nationals will also be allowed to enter and leave. Here's where it will change a bit, though. It is not just coming into Beijing and going about your daily life. It is coming in to Beijing, getting a nucleic acid test and then going through two weeks of government quarantine.</p><p>In fact, here in Beijing, they have already designation one of those facilities to be several miles outside of where we are in the city center. It is going to be the fifth ring area of this city. It is pretty far out. But it is their way of getting things a step closer to where we were -- Richard.</p><p>QUEST: David Culver reporting there from Beijing. Now, the W.T.O. is facing down a global crisis, protectionism from the U.S. over a variety of issues on its disputes panel.</p><p>And the Director General is gone. Well, the outgoing Director General Roberto Acevedo stepped down and he will be with us after the break.</p><p>[15:17:33]</p><p>QUEST: As you know, the search is on for the new head of the W.T.O., the World Trade Organization and we will be speaking to all the candidates here on this program.</p><p>Reuters describes the W.T.O. as damaged. The Wire calls it in systemic crisis because of Trump administration policies.</p><p>There is certainly a general feeling that the W.T.O., the World Trade Organization is not in good shape.</p><p>The outgoing leader, Roberto Acevedo joins me now to talk about his time there and the challenges now. He has left the W.T.O. to join Pepsi. We will talk about that in a second.</p><p>Roberto, good to see you. Thank you for talking to us. And we always thank you for joining us always on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. It has been good to have you as this has gone through.</p><p>But the organization you led for seven years is perceived to be in crisis. Although you may not have created that crisis, the question is, your legacy in the stewardship of it. How do you see it?</p><p>ROBERTO ACEVEDO, OUTGOING DIRECTOR GENERAL OF WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION: Well, Richard, I have been doing this for 23 years and I don't recall a moment when the W.T.O. was not in crisis. I have to tell you, even when I took office. The organization was 18 years old. It had never delivered one single agreement. And we had a Doha round that was going nowhere.</p><p>The organization had no sense of direction at that point in time, and nobody's fault, I have to say. It was nobody's fault. It was just the politics and how difficult it is to manage things in our organization that decides by consensus that unanimous decision of 164 countries.</p><p>Nonetheless, we managed to do quite a bit. Early on in my mandate we concluded several agreements, the trade facilitation agreement. The first agreement that the W.T.O. had ever delivered, then the information technology agreement, the elimination of export subsidies.</p><p>There were a number of things that we did, and afterwards, facing the perfect storm, and that's the point that I think you are driving at.</p><p>And what we could do, for instance in this perfect storm was to create new ways of negotiation.</p><p>[15:20:03]</p><p>QUEST: Right. If I jump in here, sir, because the issue also, of course you also faced was President Trump and his outward hostility to the W.T.O. believing it to be unfair to the U.S., too favorable to china, and so forth.</p><p>Now, I expect you are not going to agree with that. But the question is, how difficult did it make your job that the U.S. President was so hostile to the W.T.O.</p><p>ACEVEDO: The degree of changes that was required by the U.S. administration was out of reach, certainly, in the early moments. I have no doubts in my mind that the W.T.O. needs to reform.</p><p>The world has changed, and the major players have changed their powers. The shift in power at the economic level has changed considerably.</p><p>But you cannot deliver those changes overnight. This is a process that is going to take several years to re-form the organization, to change things. The rules need updating.</p><p>I have been saying this for the whole time, but until countries are truly engaged in deciding to change, I think it is not going to happen. And I fear that the W.T.O. and the reform of the W.T.O. for a while was not the priority of some administrations that were critical to making it happen.</p><p>QUEST: Are you bitter? Are you bitter in a way at the way in which you were --I mean, if you listen, let's just listen to what you said to me very early on in one of the unfairnesses of television is that we can play your own words back to you.</p><p>Let's do that, so we hear some of the things you said in those early interviews about your hopes for your time at the W.T.O.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ACEVEDO: Protectionism has become a lot more complex. It has become more sophisticated. In the past, protectionism was about raising tariffs or was about providing export subsidies or domestic subsidies.</p><p>Today, it is not like that anymore because the W.T.O. disciplines avoid that. You simply cannot do that. So what protectionism has done, it has evolved.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Now, that protectionism that's evolved became the defining force. Is it possible now with the wisdom of hindsight of office, to put protectionism back in the bottle?</p><p>ACEVEDO: Not without a significant change in the politics. Clearly, today, especially if you look at the U.S./China axis and it is a very antagonistic relationship that you see in so many different ways.</p><p>Unless you see a changing of that, I see protectionism as a tool to address many of the tensions that you see in the world today. So to the extent that this shift in competitiveness that some countries become more competitive than others, when the labor market is under pressure because of new technologies, because of, you know, structural unemployment in many areas, I think the easy -- the easy response to that is to find a foreign force, a foreign enemy, something that is happening outside our borders.</p><p>And protectionism addresses precisely that. You say, look, it is not our fault. We are competitive. We are doing fine. The problem is, what is happening in the world is that people are taking advantage of the situation.</p><p>And the only response that can I give to that is to raise barriers and to protect my market, protect my companies. That's the easy answer, but that's not the right answer. That's not going to solve the problem.</p><p>QUEST: All right, so the next person who takes the job, there are eight candidates. We are talking to them throughout this program over the next few weeks. Do you -- I think this is going to be a long question for a short answer. Do you have a preference? Do you have a view on, of the eight candidates, who should get it?</p><p>ACEVEDO: No. I have no preference whatsoever. The only thing I would say is, choose the right person that is committed to reform. Because no reform, no future for the W.T.O. I can guarantee that.</p><p>So whoever is my successor, that person has to be committed to changing things significantly.</p><p>QUEST: Final question, sir, you have moved out. I mean you've gone from the W.T.O. and you have gone to Pepsi where there is a whole new raft of new challenges. But I was looking at your bio if you like, your CV, this will be -- unless I am dramatically mistaken, which is possible, of course, that this is your first major role in the private sector.</p><p>Now, admittedly, it is in a sort of policy area, but it is in a for-profit company where previously you have either been a diplomat or at the W.T.O., an international negotiator. Are you ready for that change? Will it be a big change for you?</p><p>[15:25:39]</p><p>ACEVEDO: I think it's a perfect fit, actually. First and foremost, I was pretty much committed to change to the private sector. I had more than 30 years of public sector, and I decided that, you know, before I actually retire, and I still have some road ahead of me, I wanted to change things and to do something different.</p><p>PepsiCo offered me an opportunity, the challenge of the position. It is a very high-level position, so I can contribute in a very positive manner. I can be part of the vision. And I know the CEO, Ramon Laguarta, he is a person with -- that excels both professionally and in ethics.</p><p>The company is dedicated to thing which is more than just a business, more than just the growth of the company. It's also about helping the environment. It's about helping the communities, especially in the times of COVID.</p><p>But after that, structurally, the company is responding to these bigger challenges and wants to be a leader in environment, social, and government issues, and governance issues, and I'm really thrilled to be part of that project.</p><p>QUEST: All right. Sir, it has always been a treat and a pleasure talking to you. I hope that you remain a good friend of this program, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS and in your new role, we will still talk to you about those increasingly important issues, but this time you will obviously be coming at it from a different way.</p><p>We might even seek your opinion on whoever does get the W.T.O. job. Good to see you, Roberto, and thank you. I appreciate it.</p><p>ACEVEDO: Always a pleasure, Richard. Always stimulating.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you. All right, let's look at the markets, which have got some stimulation of their own under way at the moment.</p><p>A quick look at how the Dow has powered on through. We have had a bullish session. There you are, look at that, over 29,000, first time since February, 1.5 percent. It is about whether or not there will be a deal for more stimulus. This, and that, and the other.</p><p>The market likes what it's seeing at the moment. We still have one of the candidates to talk to today -- the Mexican candidate -- on the W.T.O. candidacy. He will be joining me later in the program to put their case as we go through all the candidates over the next few days who are seeking Roberto Acevedo's job.</p><p>We will have more after the break. This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for you in just a moment or two. The Dow is about 29,000. We need to understand why, and what's been going on. We know the markets on a tab, but why the Dow particularly today. And the celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck is with us tonight. Restaurants are far from tasty. The restaurant business is far from tasty, and just how much damage can be expected if the return of inside dining doesn't come to places like New York or capacity increased. We'll talk about that with him in just a moment. This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS and CNN. And on this network, of course, the news always comes first.</p><p>The German Chancellor Angela Merkel says there's no doubt that the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned, and she's demanding answers from the Kremlin. Merkel says tests proved that a Navalny was attacked with a Novichok nerve agent and accuses Russia of trying to silence him. The trial began to 14 people charged in connection with the 2015 terrorist attack in Paris. They began when gunmen killed 12 people at the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical magazine. In all, 17 people were killed over three days before police killed the gunman.</p><p>The former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has tested positive for COVID-19. His office tells us that the 83-year-old media tycoon does not have symptoms and is working remotely from his home near Milan. Prince Harry and Megan Markel have signed a multi-year deal with Netflix. The streaming service says they will produce films, documentaries and children's programming. In January, they stunned the U.K. when they announced they were stepping back from royal duties. The couple and their child now live and reside in California.</p><p>Alexei Navalny was poisoned with Novichok says the Germans, and the E.U. has described the poisoning as being despicable and cowardly. Now, Navalny is in intensive care in a German Hospital in Berlin. Russia is denying that any crime took place. Merkel is calling it an attempted murder and says there will be consequences.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANGELA MERKEL, CHANCELLOR OF GERMANY (through translator): We are informing our E.U. and NATO partners about the results of the findings. We will deliberate together, and depending on the Russian reaction, we will decide on an adequate common reaction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Fred Pleitgen is with me outside the hospital in Berlin. Fred, we'll do the politics in just one second, but a brief update, please, on Navalny's condition. Is he out of danger?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, he's certainly not out of danger, but his life, at least, appears to be out of danger. Richard, we got an update actually from the hospital just a couple of hours ago. And they said, of course, he's still very much in serious condition. He is still also being mechanically ventilated as the hospital put it.</p><p>Now, they do say that he is in somewhat stable condition, and his life is not under threat anymore. But they also said that this is going to be what they call a long illness, of course, because of the fact that he was administered Novichok, and that there could also be long-term damage to Alexei Navalny, as well. Of course, that's going to be one of the big question is that, even though it seems as though Alexei Navalny is going to survive all of this, it is very much unclear whether or not this is going to be something that is going to leave him with lasting damage for an extended period of time, Richard.</p><p>[15:35:08]</p><p>QUEST: OK. Again, on the river side, please, the -- this has turned -- this is going like Salisbury in the U.K. This turns into she-said-he-said. Merkel says he was poisoned by the Russian government. Putin says it wasn't us. We end up no better.</p><p>PLEITGEN: Well, that's -- that is entirely possible. But you do see that the Germans from day one, since Alexei Navalny got here, they certainly wanted to take their time with all of this, and they certainly want to be sure that they do have all the facts. I mean, Alexei Navalny was brought here to the Charite Hospital from on a medivac flight on August 22nd. And the Germans really took until now, until September 2nd to come out with the actual results. And they didn't just involve a few labs on all this. They went to the best lab here in Germany, which is the toxicology department of the German military, and they came back today and they said, unequivocally, without any sort of doubt that it was Novichok that was administered to Alexei Navalny.</p><p>Now, Angela Merkel did not specifically say that she believes that the Russians did this. She just says that the Russians have some serious questions that only they can answer and that they need to answer. And, you know, Richard, this is one of the few times that I've really seen Angela Merkel really evidently angry as she came up to the podium today. And that's also, of course, one of the reasons why the Germans are saying they're going to consult with their E.U. partners, they're going to consult with NATO, and then just decide what the best way forward is. But they do also say that they want to give the Russians a chance to clear all of this up.</p><p>Of course, we've already heard from the Russians today, they once again said that all this is anti-Russian propaganda. And they also said that when Alexei Navalny was in that hospital in Omsk that there was no sign of any chemicals inside his system. Certainly, doesn't seem as though at this point in time, the international community and certainly Germany is buying that. But you do still hear the Germans saying what they're demanding now is transparent investigation into all this as unlikely as they believe that that might be, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: All right, Fred. Thank you, Fred Pleitgen, in Berlin. So, the Dow right at the top of this program, we saw it go through 29,000 for the first time since February. And now, if we look at the underlying numbers within it, the Dow 30, you can see it's the cyclicals, interestingly, that have done the push today. Things like 3M, Honeywell, et cetera, are amongst the top gainers. Coca Cola cyclical, IBM, Intel, it's tech. Dow good solid stock, literally if you like. Paul La Monica, why today, Paul, what happened?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, it is interesting to see this rotation out of some of the sexier big tech names that have been leading the market for some time. Apple is one of the few stocks in the Dow that is lower today, one of the FAANG group, of course, but Salesforce, one of the new entrants in the Dow, one of the companies that helped replace ExxonMobil, it is down today, as well, but it's not simply a case of tech falling while the rest of the market is rising. You mentioned some of those cyclicals, but IBM and Intel are both tech stocks, as well. They're just more cyclical older tech companies.</p><p>You're seeing semiconductors rally today, Nvdia, which has been one of the hottest stocks in the market actually bigger than Intel, worth more than Intel now, not the Dow, but a leader in the S&amp;P 500. That stock is rallying, too. So, you're seeing chip stocks rally, and I think that is a sign that people are hoping that the broader economy is going to make a comeback as chip stocks are definitely a macro leader, you know, a market leader when you see the economy.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, pulling the strands together, we see -- we see the spider's web of the economy. Paul La Monica, thank you. And after this short break, we will be hearing from one of the candidates who wants to join and become the leader of the WTF. In a moment.</p><p>[15:40:00]</p><p>QUEST: Earlier on, we heard from the outgoing Director General of the -- actually, he's gone -- of the WTO, the World Trade Organization. He said reform must be at the heart of his successors' agenda, who is currently facing what Azevedo described as a Perfect Storm. There are eight candidates to replace him. We're talking to them all during the process. Jesus Seade is the Mexican nominee to head the WTO. He joins me from Hong Kong, where it is the middle of the night. Sir, we're very grateful that you've stayed up this late to talk to us. And you're the Mexico's candidate, your predecessor, if you get it, the predecessor says, reform of the WTO must be at the heart. So, how will you offer up reform?</p><p>JESUS SEADE, MEXICO'S NOMINEE FOR WTO DIRECTOR-GENERAL (via Skype): Well, there are lots of things that have to happen. The first one is that negotiations have to be engaged in a serious way. It's the heart of the WTO system and for 26 years, we've had almost no negotiation. Secondly, the appellate body is not on the floor. It's not working. We have to make it work. But then third, we have to -- have to make the place a lot more efficient, inclusive, and dynamic. That's probably a good agenda for reform.</p><p>QUEST: All right, but the critics say that you're too closely allied to the United States. After all, you've got the USMCA through. So, can you evidence sufficient independence, if you like, from a North America agenda that might still be dominated by Donald Trump after November?</p><p>SEADE: No, I really don't see what this can be based on. I negotiated with United States, the USMCA and got very good results that the United States was not exactly keen at the beginning to do -- to agree on. We negotiated well. I have shown an ability to negotiate with the United States which is crucial for WTO. But otherwise, all my life, I've spent more time in Europe than anywhere else in the world, including my country. And I have lived for 10 years in Hong Kong. I have worked on all the world. I'm a citizen of the world, close to everybody, not too close to anybody.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, I love that phrase, \"Close to everybody, not too close to anybody.\" Your trade credentials are impeccable having negotiated the USMCA and been heavily involved in trade during your professional life. But I wonder if there's a -- do you have the reformist mindset, bearing in mind, Azevedo came in when the Doha Round was still around, and he killed it off, facility -- the best achievements with facilitation and minor agreements. Is it ever possible to get a major multilateral trade deal?</p><p>SEADE: Oh, it is absolutely not only possible, it is possible, it is essential. Without it, the laureate you will continue to wither away into irrelevance. We need a big agreement on a number of areas. In agriculture, on the green economy and development, sustainable development, on transparency across the board, transparency in trade practices, in investment decisions, in prices, which is the only way for the United States and China and everybody else to begin to get closer to each other.</p><p>[15:45:17]</p><p>We need a big result and precisely because things have gotten worse. I believe that everybody is listening to the call of need to move forward. And so, this is all about moving forward. And that's what I can offer.</p><p>QUEST: Good to have you with us, sir. I'm very grateful. It's quarter to 4:00 in the morning for you in Hong Kong. I'm glad and grateful that you stayed up tonight to talk to us. Thank you.</p><p>SEADE: Like there are spies in the --</p><p>QUEST: The chief executive of Daimler -- thank you, sir. The chief executive of Daimler has just launched a new S when -- Class Mercedes-Benz car, just so at the height of your like of a pandemic. You might arguably say that this is not the time to be launching a new car when times are so difficult, but the CEO of Daimler says the company has done remarkably well. All things considered.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OLA KALLENIUS, CEO, DAIMLER AG: When the pandemic hit the markets, we had an unprecedent reduction in sales, especially the quarter two. But we had had a little bit of a warning because we saw this come to China first, and already in February, we saw the sales drop. But already, June, July, we started pick back up again. So, the whole topic of buying a luxury car, making sure that you have the individual freedom, the self-determined mobility that our founding fathers invented. We are slightly optimistic that we're going to gradually return back to some kind of normality.</p><p>QUEST: The optimism is good and the new car that you are offering up, I'll be reading up on its various A.I. features. I find the one -- I mean, you know, maybe just because I'm the wrong side of 50, but I'd find the -- this one that lifts the vehicle and the side impact -- in the event of a side impact within 10th of a second, it will raise the vehicle. Is this the new future, these sort of enhanced safety security devices?</p><p>KALLENIUS: The S-Class is the flagship of the Mercedes portfolio. So, of course, our engineers, they really want to improve the vehicle in all dimensions and safety has always been something that Mercedes Benz brand has stood for. And the feature that you just mentioned is just one of these many little angels that takes care of you. If you God forbid, end up in an accident, you want the vehicle to give you maximum protection. This will be the vehicle -- the first vehicle in the world with an airbag actually for somebody sitting in the backseat. So, so many features are going into the S-Class that are designed to protect you or protect the people around you.</p><p>QUEST: Once tempted to always ask you, did you consider delaying the launch of this car? Nobody wants to have a major launch in the middle of a pandemic. But I guess you get to the point where you got to do it sometime. So, where are those discussions?</p><p>KALLENIUS: When we sat here in March, and we looked at the project and said, we have the last six months, the final stretch of this project, really, to get across the finish line. And at the same time, parts of the company is in lockdown. Some people are in home office. How do you do it? And here I really have to applaud the team, the engineering team, the project team around the S-Class. They had the ingenuity, the flexibility, all the passion to keep this project on time. So, we're launching according to our original schedule, and the reaction that we have had from customers and fans around the world, people really are waiting for this car. So, I'm very proud that we're on time.</p><p>QUEST: So, you're ready for that. You're ready for Brexit, you're dealing the pandemic. You know, one looks at a variety of issues, and here you are launching a luxury car, which of course, is crucial to your future success. In all of these global issues, which one is worrying you the most at the moment?</p><p>KALLENIUS: Well, you have just mentioned, if we use baseball terms, a few curveballs that were thrown at us this year, but in our core, we're a innovation and technology and engineering company, we're looking at pushing boundaries. We're in the transformation of the -- of the whole automotive industry going towards CO2 neutrality, and digitization, using artificial intelligence. So, we believe pushing ahead, especially when the times are maybe a little bit stormy, bring those new attractive products, and the customer will come.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: CEO of Daimler. After the break, Wolfgang Puck will be with me, the famous celebrity restauranter and cook on the crisis facing the industry of -- of high-end restaurants. There's Wolfgang. We'll be with you after the break, Wolfgang.</p><p>[15:50:07]</p><p>QUEST: Michelin star restaurants are slowly coming back to life. According to the guidebooks, 83 percent of them have opened worldwide, but of course, it is spotty. Restaurants need to -- the high-end restaurants need to maintain their valuable reputations. That is difficult to do with new restrictions on indoor dining. Wolfgang Puck has had to close two of his restaurants. Still more than 30 restaurants, bars and lounges remaining in the -- in the group. Wolfgang Puck joins me now from Los Angeles via Skype. The challenge, obviously, Wolfgang, is to open safely, but also to do so where you have capacity restraints that often only allow you to have 20, 30, or 40 percent of diners. Does this simply make the economics impossible?</p><p>WOLFGANG PUCK, MICHELIN STAR CHEF (via Skype): Well, you know, Richard, there are certain things when there is a big problem, we've found the solution. For example, a cut at 45 pounds in London, we open the outside for the first time. I never thought we should have outside a terrace. And you know what, it has become so popular. People love to eat outside, you know? I think it's really wherever there is a space. Now, I must say the weather in London is not always Great. So, sometimes we tried to set it up half an hour later, the rain comes and everything has to move inside.</p><p>But I think, to me, here in Los Angeles, some of our restaurants are closed still. Maui is still closed, so New York, we just opened at New York, just opened outside only. New York has the same bad weather, you know, often that all of a sudden, you've got a thunderstorm, and then it's -- so, it's still very, very difficult. We still have a lot of restaurants who are closed, like in Washington, DC, we are closed totally. And in Dallas, we are closed. So, I think --</p><p>QUEST: Wolfgang --</p><p>PUCK: -- we try our best. Yes.</p><p>QUEST: The ability -- the ability to open and offer fine dining will get more difficult in the winter, won't it? And so, what is it that high-end restaurants like you want from governments, from policymakers, from cities, what would make your job and life easier?</p><p>[15:55:10]</p><p>PUCK: Well, I really believe when four counts, we're going to need some restriction probably and some way to serve inside. If it's 50 percent or 30 percent, whatever it is, but we're going to need part of it because the weather is getting colder and the weather is getting more and more rainy. So, I think if the policymakers can come up with a unified way to say, OK, let's just give them 25 or 50 percent of the maximum maybe occupancy, that way we can continue the business. If not, I have to close down again.</p><p>QUEST: That's going to be the big fear, which of course, we don't wish because that's obviously -- so, if you had to sum up the -- your hope because we always like to end positive here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in the business world. Your hope for how -- briefly, for how you think this can go forward, as we look forward to Christmas?</p><p>PUCK: Well, I hope it's going to change. I hope we're going to have the pandemic under control a little more than we have it now, especially here in L.A. County, where we have five restaurants. So, I think it's really an important part that we get the pandemic under control somehow. And then, hopefully, my hope is really to get 50 percent occupancy, enough social distancing, maybe if we put some plexiglass in between the tables, so that way people feel comfortable because my biggest fear is my employees that they get sick, but also our guests. I want our guests to feel comfortable. If not, they won't come to the restaurant.</p><p>QUEST: You and I will meet in Los Angeles or somewhere suitably, socially distance, where we can then talk about these and other issues. Wolfgang Puck, I appreciate you joining me tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Thank you, sir.</p><p>PUCK: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: And we will take -- we will take a \"PROFITABLE MOMENT\" after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Travel and tourism is the world's largest single industry. That is why we give so much time and love and attention on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And tonight, you heard three views on it, from the airlines, which of course, are cutting back dramatically, tens of thousands of employees. To the resorts that are now facing a difficult winter ahead, for example, that you heard from the Greek tourism minister. And finally, from Wolfgang Puck with his restaurants, what they need in terms of regulation, and easing of restrictions, and help from governments and authorities.</p><p>I raised all three of them, because what's now clear is that the authorities, regulators and governments need to do more to help these three crucial areas of hospitality, transport, travel and tourism. That is going to be the key to ensuring that there aren't hundreds of thousands of people, more people put out of work as we go into a difficult autumn and winter. And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I'm Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable. The closing bell is ringing. The Dow is over 29,000. The day is done.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

You can listen or you can disregard,\" said regular WLUK viewer Gary Pieschek, a retired Brown County sheriff's deputy who was rolling the dice with buddies at the Bay Family Restaurant to see who'd spring for morning coffee.</p><p>\"I think they present both sides, both ways,\" he said. \"I'm more concerned about how quickly their reporters are here today and gone tomorrow. Some of them don't even know how to pronounce the names of our cities.\"</p><p>But other citizens, and left-leaning watchdog groups such as Media Matters For America and Allied Progress, are deeply concerned about Sinclair, which operates the nation's largest TV chain. With more than 170 stations, it reaches about 38 percent of American households - just under the ownership limit set by Congress. A proposed purchase of rival Tribune Media would nearly double its reach. Federal regulators are considering whether to relax their rule.</p><p>The Sinclair-Tribune deal comes at a time when local TV remains the No. 1 news source of Americans - and media companies are under fire from both the left and right.</p><p>Sinclair owns only one Minnesota station, WUCW, Ch. 23. It doesn't air local news and is exempt from running the commentaries. But the company has a presence in nearly 20 Midwest markets, including three in Wisconsin and four in Iowa. Tribune Media would give it a foothold in Chicago and six of the other top 10 U.S. markets.</p><p>Criticism of the Baltimore-based company swelled this month when it ordered anchors across the country to read a promotional spot seemingly aimed at adding fuel to the president's fiery attacks on mainstream media.</p><p>With a line about \"the troubling trend of irresponsible, one-sided news stories plaguing our country,\" the spot drew praise from Trump and criticism from media outlets ranging from Deadspin.com to HBO's \"Last Week Tonight With John Oliver.\"</p><p>\"I found them sickening,\" said former Twin Cities anchor Don Shelby.</p><p>But Shelby's former boss at WCCO-TV, Scott Libin, doesn't think Sinclair's action crossed any ethical lines.</p><p>\"It's not without precedent for news anchors to read something written by non-journalists. It happens every day in promotions,\" said Libin, who also served as news director at KSTP and now teaches at the University of Minnesota. \"Sinclair didn't make this stuff up. There is evidence out there that people are worried about fake news.\"</p><p>'Let the local people decide'</p><p>A study this year by two Emory University researchers found that Sinclair-owned stations tilted slightly to the right compared to their competition. They also devoted 25 percent more time to national politics than the average local newscast, and about one-third less time on local politics.</p><p>\"Sinclair can't help but color everything in their markets,\" Shelby said. \"Reporters may be trying to please the boss and go out and find stories that represent a shared view.\"</p><p>Al Tompkins, a former TV journalist who teaches broadcast news at the Poynter Institute, a journalism nonprofit, has raised ethical questions about Sinclair asking its local managers for donations to the company's political action committee. That PAC has contributed to several key members of Congress.</p><p>Susan Finco, a former anchor in the Green Bay market, said while Sinclair's influence has been the subject of discussion in the community, she feels most residents can distinguish the corporate commentary from local coverage of stories that matter most to viewers.</p><p>\"I don't think it's changed the reporting or how people perceive the reporting, said Finco, who now runs the public relations firm Leonard &amp; Finco. \"Local reporters view themselves as very independent voices. That would be true at all the stations.\"</p><p>Local TV remains an important source of news for American adults, according to a 2017 study by Pew Research Center. Although viewership eroded last year as younger people shift to online news sources, 37 percent still turn to local newscasts regularly, compared to 28 percent for cable news and 26 percent for the broadcast networks. Those numbers help justify Sinclair's order to work more national issues into local broadcasts.</p><p>In effect, the TV chain is positioning itself as an alternative to cable and network news - a strategy that CEO Christopher Ripley reiterated in a memo circulated to his employees this month.</p><p>\"Sinclair will continue to pursue new and innovative strategies, including our hybrid approach of bringing together the best of the local broadcast model with the best of the network model, which will undoubtedly expose us to more criticism because 'no other local TV broadcasters does it that way,' \" he wrote. \"However, those that do not answer the call to innovate will be sucked into the black hole that is big tech, which is consuming every segment of the media universe.\"</p><p>But when Green Bay resident Kim Oskar wakes up, she doesn't want to hear Epshteyn's take on Syria. She just wants local news from the anchors on WLUK's \"Good Day WI.\"</p><p>\"I can't handle the national news that early in the morning,\" said the retired nurse from Appleton, who was standing in line at a suburban Mills Fleet Farm to meet the station's meteorologists. \"The newscasters make me laugh.

But over all the city has problems the rest of the country would love to have. Start-up technology companies are clamoring for the prestige of a Palo Alto address. The vibrancy of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stanford.edu/\">Stanford University</url> keeps the city young and humming.</p><p>In an election year, with nearly constant squawking from presidential candidates about well-paying jobs, the mayor of Palo Alto has an unusual message for some of the cash-flush tech companies based here: Go away.

In the charming downtown, where battalions of tech workers from companies like Amazon stroll the streets, their eyes often glued to their smartphones, the mayor is looking to enforce, in some form, an all-but-forgotten zoning regulation that bans companies whose primary business is research and development, including software coding. (To repeat: The mayor is considering enforcing a ban on coding at ground zero of Silicon Valley.)</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d said Kate Vershov Downing, a lawyer who lit up the internet this month when she <url normalizedValue=\"https://shift.newco.co/letter-of-resignation-from-the-palo-alto-planning-and-transportation-commission-f7b6facd94f5#.podfjfxoj\">announced</url> that she was quitting the city\u2019s planning commission because she was moving someplace cheaper. \u201cThis is Silicon Valley. We\u2019ve been writing code here for decades.\u201d</p><p>I interviewed Ms. Downing on Facebook Live, but the connection kept cutting out. Her husband, Steve, works for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.palantir.com/\">Palantir Technologies</url>, a software company, and joined the interview.</p><p>The symbolism of the couple\u2019s departure from Palo Alto is poignant: Even a lawyer married to an engineer can\u2019t afford Palo Alto. (The <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.zillow.com/palo-alto-ca/home-values/\">median price</url> of a home is around $2.5 million, making it one of the most expensive places in the country.)</p><p>But as symbols go, it\u2019s hard to beat the paradox of bad cellphone reception in the cradle of cutting-edge technology.</p><p>Brian Reid, a computer scientist and Palo Alto resident, blames \u201can unbelievable, fanatical fear of cell towers\u201d among Palo Alto residents for the somewhat spotty coverage, and he said heavy data usage compounded the problem.</p><p>Mr. Reid, who lives four doors from the house of Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple who died in 2011, remembers the irony in 2007, a time of even worse cellphone coverage, when the iPhone was being introduced. Mr. Jobs had to leave his house to make calls, Mr. Reid said.</p><p>\u201cHe was trying to sell these phones, but he couldn\u2019t use one in his front yard,\u201d Mr. Reid said.</p><p>Thomas Fuller is the San Francisco bureau chief for The New York Times.

My daughter still hasn't forgiven me for the fact that her little brother got his when he was 15\u00bd because it was Christmas and there was a sale. A teenager scorned has the longest memory of all.</p><p>My two youngest children, 12 and 13, have had smartphones for several years.</p><p>It's a curse and a blessing.</p><p>Long trips in the car to see family are no longer punctuated by sibling arguments, because both children are buried in their phone screens for hours at a time. This is, mostly, a good thing for my sanity.</p><p>But try to get them to put their phones down to have a conversation, or focus on homework, and, well, it takes an act of God.</p><p>Enter Josh Hawley. The junior senator from Missouri, who describes himself as a conservative Republican using all the most conservative adjectives that define him as the sort of conservative who embodies only the most conservative of conservative values, wants to fix my children's addiction to all things smartphone.</p><p>Hawley, who is a year older than my oldest child, is channeling his inner Tipper Gore, the high priestess of leftist Nanny State ideology who in the 1980s successfully lobbied for labels on music to warn children and parents of violent or sexually explicit language.</p><p>This week, Hawley filed a bill that would regulate the technology that out-of-control capitalist companies like YouTube and Snapchat use to fuel social media addiction.</p><p>To this, I say, Godspeed.</p><p>Any parent who has tried and failed to limit their child's use of smartphones would welcome a little help from the long arm of the federal government. Of course, Hawley might find the sledding a little tough.</p><p>His bill, for instance, tries to change the technology by mandating that the default setting on social media software limit children to 30 minutes of use a day. Um, tried that. See, what kids do is find the setting that allows them to change it back, and it doesn't take them very long. Then they'll change their time zone or something or, worse yet, switch to a social media platform you haven't even heard about yet.</p><p>It's always something.</p><p>The thing about Hawley is that it's tough to figure out what he's really up to.</p><p>This is the guy who spent days railing against social media, then blasted Nike over its Colin Kaepernick-inspired cancellation of the Betsy Ross flag shoe, and then turned to Twitter to post a Fourth of July photo of his kids wearing Nikes.</p><p>Go figure.</p><p>In the Age of Trump, where truth is no longer an accepted political currency, Hawley and his army of social media sycophants make their own truth, and then, when the wind blows the other way, they redefine themselves again.</p><p>In using the federal government to tell Big Tech how to do its job, Hawley lets some of the conservative shine rub off.</p><p>Here's how Jeremy Cady, the Missouri state director for the Koch network funded Americans for Prosperity, characterized Hawley's bill, in a Facebook post:</p><p>\"The issue here is that Senator Hawley has an opinion about social media,\" wrote Cady, whose organization is made up primarily of MAGA-hat wearing Trumpites. \"The Senator desires to mandate all Americans adhere to his opinion or force them to \u2018opt out' of his mandate. This is nothing but big government interference.\"</p><p>Cady's not wrong.</p><p>Nevertheless, I wish Hawley good luck in his quest.</p><p>Sure, he campaigned on a platform of fighting federal government overreach, and he's opposed \"job-killing\" federal regulations intended to protect our air and water and health. But if he can use the power of the federal government to get my kid to put down his smartphone for 5 minutes, I say welcome to the socialist revolution.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p> Sen.

Tous les responsables politiques - paradoxalement en qu\u00eate de buzz - vont tomber \u00e0 bras raccourcis sur Mark Zuckerberg d\u00e8s qu'il se pr\u00e9sentera devant eux [le patron de Facebook devait t\u00e9moigner devant le Congr\u00e8s am\u00e9ricain les 10 et 11 avril]. Ils vont acculer le cofondateur de Facebook dans un coin de la salle et l'accuser de tous les p\u00e9ch\u00e9s du monde. Ce sera un spectacle magnifique. Mais un spectacle est un substitut bien vide \u00e0 la politique. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Au fur et \u00e0 mesure que les scandales autour de Facebook ont \u00e9clat\u00e9, le\u00a0retour de b\u00e2ton contre \"Big Tech\" [les grandes entreprises technologiques am\u00e9ricaines] s'est\u00a0fait de plus en plus violent. Mais la col\u00e8re l'a emport\u00e9 sur la r\u00e9flexion. La proposition de loi la plus aboutie et la plus largement soutenue qui circule au Congr\u00e8s r\u00e9glementerait les publicit\u00e9s politiques sur Internet, mais limiterait tr\u00e8s peu le pouvoir et les profits des entreprises du web. Et cette loi ne s'attaque pas \u00e0 la racine du mal : l'absence de protection des donn\u00e9es personnelles par l'\u00c9tat. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">dans une crise de triomphalisme juv\u00e9nile, il a trait\u00e9 les gens qui lui confiaient leurs donn\u00e9es de \"gros abrutis\". </p><p>Ce qui caract\u00e9rise la vie num\u00e9rique, c'est\u00a0qu'Internet a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 dans la fr\u00e9n\u00e9sie libertarienne des ann\u00e9es 1990. Lorsque nous avons tir\u00e9 le r\u00e9seau des mains des agences gouvernementales qui l'avaient engendr\u00e9 et que nous l'avons privatis\u00e9, nous avons mis sur pause l'instinct civique dont nous avions h\u00e9rit\u00e9. Au lieu de traiter le web comme\u00a0le syst\u00e8me financier, l'aviation ou l'agriculture, nous\u00a0avons pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 nous passer des r\u00e8gles solides qui auraient pu garantir notre s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et le respect de nos valeurs constitutionnelles. </p><p>Cette d\u00e9faillance est \u00e9vidente depuis belle lurette pour les militants qui ferraillent en marge du d\u00e9bat, et la plupart des utilisateurs de Facebook ont peut-\u00eatre toujours eu conscience de ses dangers. Mais savoir de fa\u00e7on abstraite que nos donn\u00e9es personnelles sont exploit\u00e9es est une chose, et voir concr\u00e8tement comment elles peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es contre nous en est une autre. Les r\u00e9v\u00e9lations fracassantes sur la complicit\u00e9 de Facebook dans la d\u00e9b\u00e2cle qu'a \u00e9t\u00e9 la derni\u00e8re campagne pr\u00e9sidentielle am\u00e9ricaine nous ont r\u00e9veill\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on brutale. Et le fait que Facebook ne semble pas vouloir reconna\u00eetre pleinement son r\u00f4le inspire des soup\u00e7ons suppl\u00e9mentaires sur ses motivations et ses m\u00e9thodes. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu'il prendra connaissance des faits et de leur monstruosit\u00e9, le public comprendra peut-\u00eatre bient\u00f4t que c'est la d\u00e9faillance de nos lois qui a permis l'immense succ\u00e8s de Facebook. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transparence radicale. </emphasis>On le voit clairement en prenant un peu de recul : le\u00a0mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique de Facebook repose sur l'\u00e9visc\u00e9ration de la vie priv\u00e9e. Pour le dire autrement, la strat\u00e9gie de l'entreprise consiste \u00e0 pousser ses utilisateurs \u00e0 partager des informations personnelles (ce qu'elle a appel\u00e9 la \"transparence radicale\"), puis \u00e0 les \u00e9pier pour pouvoir les abreuver de \"posts\" qui les garderont \"actifs\" sur le site et, en m\u00eame temps, de publicit\u00e9s cibl\u00e9es. Si Mark Zuckerberg opine du chef lorsqu'on parle de vie priv\u00e9e, il a par le pass\u00e9 \u00e9t\u00e9 franc sur son vrai sentiment. Il a par exemple dit en 2010 que l'intimit\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait plus une <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"norme sociale\" </emphasis>(il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, dans une crise de triomphalisme juv\u00e9nile, il a m\u00eame trait\u00e9 les gens qui lui confiaient leurs donn\u00e9es de <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"gros abrutis\"</emphasis>). Les cadres de l'entreprise sont conscients des dangers de leur syst\u00e8me. Au cours d'un d\u00e9bat auquel j'ai r\u00e9cemment particip\u00e9, un repr\u00e9sentant de Facebook a avou\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas utilis\u00e9 le site depuis des ann\u00e9es parce qu'il voulait se prot\u00e9ger contre les envahisseurs. </p><p>Si l'on garde \u00e0 l'esprit cette indiff\u00e9rence id\u00e9ologique \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e, l'inconsid\u00e9ration r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e par l'affaire Cambridge Analytica n'\u00e9tonne plus. Facebook n'a eu aucun scrupule \u00e0 donner acc\u00e8s \u00e0 vos donn\u00e9es aux charlatans de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 britannique, sans se demander qui ils \u00e9taient ni ce qu'ils pouvaient bien avoir en t\u00eate pour vouloir mettre la main sur autant d'informations personnelles. Ce n'\u00e9tait pas la premi\u00e8re fois que cela arrivait. Facebook a \u00e9galement ouvert la porte des donn\u00e9es de ses utilisateurs \u00e0 des d\u00e9veloppeurs d'applications tiers dans le cadre d'un march\u00e9 faustien. L'entreprise avait besoin de ces d\u00e9veloppeurs parce que leurs applications incitaient les utilisateurs \u00e0 passer toujours plus de temps sur le r\u00e9seau. Comme l'a \u00e9crit mon confr\u00e8re Alexis Madrigal [journaliste \u00e0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Atlantic</emphasis>], Facebook a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s laxiste sur la collecte de donn\u00e9es, en d\u00e9pit des critiques qui exprimaient avec force leur inqui\u00e9tude. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L'auteur </emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></p><p>Franklin Foer Journaliste \u00e0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Atlantic</emphasis>, Franklin Foer a publi\u00e9 en septembre 2017\u00a0aux \u00c9tats-Unis <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">World Without Mind</emphasis>. </p><p>Ce livre critique le pouvoir des grandes entreprises technologiques que sont Google, Amazon, Facebook et Apple. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"Ce n'est pas parce que ces compagnies ont fait des choses fantastiques pour nous et que nous pouvons les consid\u00e9rer comme des innovations formidables que nous devons cacher leur c\u00f4t\u00e9 obscur\", </emphasis>explique-t-il dans une interview au magazine <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wired. </emphasis></p><p>Si l'on imaginait\u00a0 un <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"classement des entreprises les plus diaboliques\", </emphasis>Facebook arriverait selon lui \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re place, suivi d'Amazon, de Google et d'Apple. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Le scandale Cambridge Analytica </emphasis></p><p>   Sous le feu des critiques depuis le d\u00e9clenchement de l'affaire Cambridge Analytica, le 17 mars, le PDG et fondateur de Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, a formellement \u00e9cart\u00e9 l'id\u00e9e d'une d\u00e9mission. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"J'ai cr\u00e9\u00e9 cet endroit. </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Je le dirige.

Mais nous voyons enfin aujourd'hui le prix \u00e0 payer. Notre intimit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9e \u00e0 des individus malintentionn\u00e9s, \u00e0 des gens qui cherchent \u00e0 manipuler nos opinions politiques, nos pens\u00e9es et nos habitudes de consommation. Les patrons de Cambridge Analytica ont tr\u00e8s facilement eu acc\u00e8s \u00e0 tout cela. Facebook a transform\u00e9 nos donn\u00e9es - l'\u00e9quivalent d'une radiographie de notre moi - en une marchandise \u00e9chang\u00e9e \u00e0 notre insu. </p><p>Tout au long de leur histoire, les Am\u00e9ricains ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00c9tat de les prot\u00e9ger de <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> \u00a032  31\u00a0  </emphasis>ce type d'exploitation. La loi emp\u00eache les \u00e9tablissements financiers de profiter de notre ignorance ou de nos faiblesses et interdit le commerce de nos donn\u00e9es bancaires. Lorsque les industriels de l'agroalimentaire ont truff\u00e9 leurs produits de substances infectes, l'\u00c9tat les a oblig\u00e9s \u00e0 donner la liste compl\u00e8te des ingr\u00e9-dients. Lorsque nous avons cr\u00e9\u00e9 les syst\u00e8mes de transport, l'\u00c9tat a impos\u00e9 des limitations de vitesse et la ceinture de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Il y a peut-\u00eatre des failles dans tout cela, mais \u00e9galement un consensus sur le fait qu'avoir ces r\u00e8gles vaut bien mieux que de n'en avoir aucune. Nous devons appliquer notre mod\u00e8le historique \u00e0 notre nouveau monde. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lorsque La vie priv\u00e9e dispara\u00eet, on ne peut pas La restaurer. </emphasis></p><p>Heureusement, nous n'avons pas besoin de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer \u00e0 l'aveuglette. Le 25 mai, un corpus de loi appel\u00e9 \"R\u00e8glement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur la protection des donn\u00e9es\" va entrer en vigueur dans l'Union europ\u00e9enne. Les pays membres de l'UE avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 chacun cr\u00e9\u00e9 leurs agences de r\u00e9gulation et fix\u00e9 des limites aux exc\u00e8s des entreprises technologiques. Le nouveau r\u00e8glement cr\u00e9e un cadre l\u00e9gal unique pour l'ensemble de l'UE, dans un effort massif et exemplaire pour obliger les entreprises du web \u00e0 dire clairement ce qu'elles comptent faire des donn\u00e9es personnelles qu'elles collectent. Il donne \u00e9galement davantage de pouvoir aux citoyens concernant l'exploitation de leurs donn\u00e9es, ainsi que le droit de les effacer. </p><p>L'heure est venue pour les \u00c9tats-Unis de mettre en place leur propre cadre l\u00e9gislatif, en accord avec leurs valeurs et leurs traditions. De cr\u00e9er une \"Data Protection Authority\".

Penguin Books, 2017, non traduit en fran\u00e7ais], rappelle volontairement celui de notre agence charg\u00e9e de la protection de l'environnement [Environmental Protection Agency]. </p><p>Il y a un parall\u00e8le entre l'environnement et la vie priv\u00e9e. Les deux sont des biens qu'un march\u00e9 non r\u00e9glement\u00e9 peut d\u00e9truire. Nous laissons certes les entreprises d\u00e9grader l'air, l'eau et les for\u00eats. Mais nous imposons aussi des restrictions d'une importance cruciale \u00e0 l'exploitation de l'environnement \u00e0 des fins commerciales, et nous avons besoin d'en faire autant en ce qui concerne la vie priv\u00e9e.

While topics such as privacy and data protection, censorship, and other foreign companies\u2014especially China\u2014were addressed, the audience aimed to address the economic power these companies have achieved in U.S. digital markets.<br/>\"This hearing has made clear to me a fact: these companies, as they exist today, have monopoly power. Some must be divided, all must be properly regulated and accountable,\" Democratic Congressman <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Cicilline,</emphasis>chairman of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Administrative, Commercial and Antitrust Law,</emphasis>said at the end of the hearing.<br/>Last June, the antitrust subcommittee led by Cicilline launched an investigation that not only seeks to investigate \"the rise and use of power\" in digital markets but aims to adapt antitrust laws in the United States and their \"levels of application,\" as the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> US Congress Judicial Committee's</emphasis>announcement of the initiation of the investigation.<br/>For <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paolo Benedetti,</emphasis>partner of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Agon Economy and Law,</emphasis>a firm specialized in competition and regulation, the audience of the great technology is part of a particular context. According to the specialist, in the most recent five years, competition issues in digital markets have been the protagonists in competition and antitrust discussions. \"For a year and a half, the subject has become almost exclusive,\" he said.<br/>Benedetti recalled that these digital giants have open research on both sides of the Atlantic. In March 2019, the European Commission imposed a fine of 1.49 million euros on Google for abusive practices in the online advertising market. Facebook, Amazon and Apple are also being investigated in the central body of the European Union and this is in addition to the recent investigation by the US subcommittee.<br/>\"In that sense, I have no doubt that officials from all competition agencies around the world must have been following the vicissitudes of the event. I'm sure the officials of the Mexican agency were no exception.\"<br/>Tipping<br/>The harsh discussions around the possible monopoly practices of great technology revolves largely around a phenomenon: tipping. Also known as the phenomenon of \"the winner gets everything\" or \"Winner takesAll\" in English, tipping occurs when competition in a market is completely in favour of a competitor without the possibility that this dynamic can be easily reversed.<br/>According to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Angel L\u00f3pez Hohner,</emphasis>Agon's partner economist, tipping is typical of markets with very specific characteristics: those economies of very high scale, in which the more it occurs, the more the unit cost of production, or in very powerful network economies, in which the value of services to consumers increases the more people consume those services.<br/>\"When these phenomena arise, a small initial advantage in size is magnified and accelerated in spiral: my slight cost advantage (or my marginally higher appeal) allows me to attract more users, who give me more advantage, and so on until no one else can compete with my costs or with my attractiveness to users. This happens in markets such as telecommunications, financial services, transportation and, more recently, digital platforms,\" he said.<br/>For L\u00f3pez Hohner, if you take into account that, in the case of e-commerce, since 2018, Amazon accounted for 50% of e-commerce sales in the United States; 47% in Germany and 45% in France, most likely these markets have already reached a point where a winner has taken it all or<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> tipping point.</emphasis><br/>\"At these levels, it is very difficult for another e-commerce platform\u2014existing or new\u2014to attract enough sellers and buyers, both indispensable to compete with them effectively.\"<br/>Mexico is between three and five years old, or less<br/>A market in which a winner has taken everything or has reached a tipping point, as seems to be the case with digital markets in Europe and the United States, is known as a natural monopoly and according to L\u00f3pez Hohner, its regulation presents a dilemma. While it is necessary to preserve the efficiency that comes from its scale (size) or its network of users, it is also necessary to prevent anti-competitive behaviors that harm consumers within these markets.<br/>\"The question is how to achieve it, and that's the current international debate on digital platforms,\" he said.<br/>Like its counterparts in the European Union, England or the United States, to name a few, the Mexican regulator has set out in the search for that way to prevent companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple from distorting digital markets in Mexico without restricting the technological innovation and business models that have generated these markets.<br/>Recently, the Cofece created the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Directorate-General for Digital Markets,</emphasis>which seeks to \"analyze the development of digital markets and the implications they have in terms of economic competition and free competition\". But the regulator has taken a rather conservative stance on this. According to its newly published<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Digital Cofece Strategy\"</emphasis>the Mexican economy has a special feature that elements of digital technologies that regularly arouse concern and more developed economies probably do not have the same effect, or at least not yet, in the Mexican context.<br/>However, for Paolo Benedetti, the competition problems in these digital markets \"are more associated with their structural characteristics (very high economies of scale and very powerful network effects) than to local factors. According to the specialist, the Mexican regulator is likely to believe that the Mexican economy has a special feature because in Mexico the phenomenon of \"the winner takes everything\" has not yet been given.<br/>\"If that were the case, I would tell youthat it is crucial to ensure that competition in these markets is given on merits and agents do not engage in practices that, artificially, seek to nullify it. International experience shows that if proactive action is not taken, it is only a matter of time before competition in the market disappears. As an example, Apple's App Store works exactly the same in Mexico as it does in the United States or Europe. If There Apple is displacing developers it competes with, I don't see why the same thing wouldn't be happening here. Similarly, amazon's rules and practices in the Mexican marketplace are the same as in its marketplaces in the United States and Europe. If those rules and practices are there leaning the court in their favor when competing with their sellers, I don't see why it would be any different here,\" he said.<br/>For Angel L\u00f3pez, in the case of e-commerce, where the strongest participants in Mexico are Amazon and Mercado Libre, the pandemic has reduced the time remaining for this market to reach its tipping point. \"If it took 10-15 years in the most developed countries to get to where they are today, a few months ago I would have thought that in Mexico we would be talking 3 to 5 years; today, with the effect of the pandemic, I think this has even accelerated,\" he said.<br/>Barriers to competition<br/>According to the specialists, the Mexican regulator has a tool to prevent markets such as e-commerce or fintech in Mexico from living the phenomenon of tipping.<br/>Since 2014, the Federal Law on <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Economic Competition</emphasis> provides in Article 94 of the investigative figure to determine barriers to competition, according to which \"the commission shall initiate, ex officio or at the request of the Federal Executive, by itself or through the Secretariat, the investigation procedure where there are evidence to suggest that there are no conditions of effective competition in a market and in order to determine the existence of barriers to competition and free competition or essential inputs that may generate anti-competitive effects.<br/>The advantage of this legal figure, according to L\u00f3pez Hohner, is that, unlike traditional instruments, where what is attacked is illegal conduct, in the case of investigations to determine barriers to competition they seek to solve problems in the functioning of markets that do not necessarily result in illegal conduct.<br/>\"If you review the initiatives of the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> European Commission </emphasis>and the authorities of Germany and the United Kingdom to intervene effectively in digital markets, you will realize that you are asking precisely for the kind of legal instruments that have existed in Mexico since 2014. That's why I think the opportunity in Mexico is huge: we're at an early stage of the problem, and we have the tools to get in to it. Very few countries in the world (if any) can say the same,\" he said.<br/>[email protected]<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-13736624</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JM-2RJ1-JBJN-M49W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1551\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 9, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As U.S. coronavirus cases rise, predictions of resulting death tolls are proven right. Russian officials say their vaccine in pre-order demand from many countries including Brazil, India and Saudi Arabia. Doctors and theorists take to the media to support Trump's handling of the virus and his endorsement of hydroxychloroquine. When Brazil's president recovered from the coronavirus, he claimed the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine had cured him even though almost every major study has shown it's not effective for COVID-19. The president's supporters are now buying in to his hype. As Italy adjusts to a new world filled with masks, it comes as no surprise the Italians being one of the world's global fashion hubs are turning these masks into stylish fashion accessories. For five hours on Capitol Hill, four of the world's most powerful CEOs did what they rarely do, sat quietly, as they were berated, questioned and accused of wrongdoing and abused their dominance of the tech economy. His actions might have changed everything, a man with an umbrella and a hammer believed to have set off the violence and looting in Minneapolis back in May.

Midwives for a growing number of conspiracy theories spreading faster than the pandemic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the world's most powerful CEOs grilled by lawmakers on Capitol Hill over their dominance of the tech economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CNN NEWSROOM starts right now.</p><p>When the coronavirus infection started to surge in the U.S. over the past month, experts predicted a spike in the death toll would follow. And now, it's happening.</p><p>The U.S. has surpassed 150,000 fatalities.</p><p>The nation's leading infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, says midwestern states need to get ahead of the curve right now before their case numbers are out of control.</p><p>A new report from Johns Hopkins University urging the U.S. to reset its virus response.

ERICA HILL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Masks, social distancing, good hygiene. The tools are there but the virus just keeps spreading.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Dr. ROB DAVIDSON, EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIAN: It's like whack-a-mole. With hotspots all over this country, it's just going to keep popping up if we don't do something nationally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILL: That lack of a national plan could result in hundreds of thousands of additional deaths, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges, which released a road map Wednesday for a coordinated response.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ROSS MCKINNEY, JR., CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER, ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN MEDICAL COLLEGES: Having common standards sort of sets expectation, provides some consistency. So that we don't get these continuous waves of infection that have followed our premature reopening so far.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILL: While the president is urging governors to reopen, his own administration is warning the 21 states in red on this map, they may need stronger restrictions. The yellow states also being watched closely.</p><p>Dr. Deborah Birx noting young adults are fueling the spread in those areas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR (VOICE OVER): \"Remember the majority of those are asymptomatic. So if you expect to see hospitalizations, by the time you see hospitalizations, your community spread is so widespread that you've into flipped into a red state incredibly quickly.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILL: Indiana one of those yellow states closing beaches in Gary today for at least two weeks, as cases continue to rise.</p><p>Indoor gatherings also causing concern across the country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. PHIL MURPHY, (D-N.J.): We simply can't continue to have crowded house parties. They are not safe. Period.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) HILL: Deaths are rising in 29 states. California and North Carolina posting new daily highs on Wednesday. Florida reporting record numbers for the second day in a row.</p><p>The governor focusing on the new school year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FLA): And I would absolutely have my kids in school because I do think that it's safe to do so. I believe that this is something that's very low risk for kids.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILL: The governor also noting his kids aren't yet old enough for school.</p><p>Meantime, a new study finds statewide school closures last spring helped to reduce the number of infections and deaths.</p><p>As Dr. Anthony Fauci offers this blunt warning to teachers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: So in many respects, unfortunately, though this might sound a little scary and harsh -- I don't mean it to be that way -- is that you're going to be actually part of the experiment of the learning curve of what we need to know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILL: We did learn on Wednesday Miami Dade County which is still in phase one will begin the year later than planned starting school on August 31st. And they'll begin with remote learning.</p><p>Denver public schools will also start with virtual learning. And that is expected to go through at least October.</p><p>In New York, I'm Erica Hill. CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: New records in daily case counts are being set around the world. Japan saw more than 1,200 new cases on Wednesday, the highest daily total since the start of the pandemic.</p><p>It's also the first time Japan recorded more than 1,000 new infections in one day.</p><p>For a second day, China has reported more than 100 new cases. Most were locally transmitted in the western province of Xinjiang.</p><p>Also, 21 new asymptomatic infections were recorded.</p><p>CNN's Will Ripley live this hour in Hong Kong. [01:05:00]</p><p>So just -- there is a difference here too. When we're talking about the locally transmitted cases and the asymptomatic cases as well -- because it's those asymptomatic cases, I think, which have the authorities really concerned.</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. Because a lot of people who don't have symptoms might not necessarily have a reason to go in and get tested.</p><p>That's certainly a phenomenon that we're seeing here in Hong Kong as well.</p><p>And this is a city that, for at least eight days, has been reporting triple-digit increases in the number of COVID-19 cases.</p><p>China, as you mentioned, just the last two days, they have 1.4 billion people there, we have seven million people here.</p><p>Either location, the numbers are enviable, certainly by U.S. and many other countries' standards. But they are huge cause for concern here.</p><p>American, Steven Hightower [ph], has been living in Hong Kong for seven years. The Alabama native was teaching gymnastics until the city's third wave of COVID-19 shut down all the gyms. Again.</p><p>Hightower came down with a mild fever and sore throat last week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HIGHTOWER: So I decided to get the test done. And then, lo and behold I was -- I tested positive.</p><p>RIPLEY: Do you have any idea how you got it?</p><p>HIGHTOWER: Zero idea. I backtracked to everyone I had been in contact with; no one had any sympathies, no one feels ill.</p><p>RIPLEY: He's been isolating ever since. Waiting for days to go into government quarantine.</p><p>HIGHTOWER: The hardest part of this experience has been the not knowing. We don't know what's coming next.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIPLEY: This could be what's next for patients like him. People with mild symptoms.</p><p>This Expo Center near the airport is the future site of a COVID-19 field hospital, like one in Wuhan. In fact, China has even agreed to help build it.</p><p>The goal? To ease the strain on Hong Kong hospitals. Even though the city has far fewer cases than most, the numbers are rising fast. Ivan Law [ph] is a nurse in one of Hong Kong's most crowded COVID-19 wards.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IVAN LAW: You get another patient to leave, another patient will come in.</p><p>RIPLEY: And it's just over and over again, new patients coming in.</p><p>LAW: Yes. Over and over again. You have to keep working. You don't have -- you cannot see when it ends.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIPLEY: A survey from the Hong Kong Nursing Association says nearly 90 percent of medical staff don't think the hospital authority is prepared for the third wave.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIPLEY: Do you think that Hong Kong could have or should have done more during the period of time when there was no community spread?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That obviously is a \"yes.\" Health experts and also health professionals also press the government to do more testing and screening.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIPLEY: Hong Kong's chief secretary defends the city's approach.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEW CHEUNG, CHIEF SECRETARY, HONG KONG: I think we've been adopting the right approach all along. Approach is lift and suppress. On the basis of scientific evidence, on the basis of expert advice.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIPLEY: Just this month, Hong Kong began contracting with private companies to conduct mass testing of restaurant workers, taxi drivers and elderly caregivers. All groups with recent clusters of infections.</p><p>Hong Kong biotech, Prenetics, aims to eventually test up to 20,000 people a day.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIPLEY: If Hong Kong sees an explosion in numbers like other places, is this city prepared to deal with that?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No country is prepared, right? To be quite honest, right? No country is prepared because, again, the virus is so new. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HIGHTOWER: Anyone can catch it. And even if you're doing everything that you feel you possibly can, it's probably not enough.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIPLEY: A lesson Hong Kong learned the hard way.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Now the big question being asked here in Hong Kong is should the legislative council elections go on as planned in September? There is a lot of talk right now.</p><p>And it's being widely reported in local media that many lawmakers on the pro-Beijing side are pushing for the election to be postponed by a year.</p><p>They're citing health reasons because of the pandemic. Their political opponents say it has everything to do with the fact that all indications are they will get trounced in the election because the pro-Beijing side has been so unpopular amongst the electorate.</p><p>So we'll wait in the coming days to see what happens with that.</p><p>But it does -- again, it's so interesting, John. That you see such huge numbers in other places like the U.S. and here where you still have -- you had numbers over 100 but they're not really exploding, and yet the city has essentially been shut down in terms of dining and restaurants, going to the beach, gathering in groups larger than two. Everybody has to wear a mask outside.</p><p>It is extraordinary how seriously it's being taken here even though the numbers remain low.</p><p>They say the health care system being overburdened is the big reason for that.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes. You've got to keep that pressure on if those numbers are going to stay low. I guess that's the point. And that's the hard part.</p><p>But, Will, thank you. Will Ripley live for us in Hong Kong.</p><p>Brazil has ended a four-month long travel ban reopening the country to foreign visitors arriving by plane despite another record spike in new coronavirus cases.</p><p>Almost 70,000 on Wednesday. It also recorded 1,500 deaths.</p><p>With more than two-and-a-half million cases, Brazil has the highest number of confirmed cases in Latin America and the Caribbean.</p><p>Mexico has the second highest number and the crisis there is showing little signs of improving.</p><p>The death toll rose past 45,000 on Wednesday after hundreds more died on that day.</p><p>CNN's Matt Rivers has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, here in Mexico there continues to be really nothing but bad news when it comes to this pandemic.</p><p>It was Wednesday night that health officials reported nearly 500 newly-confirmed deaths. That pushes the country's overall death total to more than 45,000 for the first time.</p><p>And with that, it is very likely that in the next few days we're going to see Mexico's death toll overtake the United Kingdom's. And when that happens, Mexico's death toll will be third highest in the world, trailing only the United States and Brazil.</p><p>And the reason why that death toll keeps going up is because the number of newly-reported deaths each day is not going down.</p><p>And if you look at the numbers, throughout the entire month of July it's hovered right around 600 deaths per day. And with each week that goes by, we're just not seeing that number get any lower.</p><p>But it's not just human life that is being affected by this outbreak.</p><p>We've also done a lot of reporting on domestic violence and the effect of the economic shutdown here, that it's had on the country's women.</p><p>And today, we got some data to back our reporting. Which has shown that many women who were in abusive situations, things were getting worse for them as a result of the country's lockdown because they were trapped with their abusers.</p><p>It was today that Mexico's government reported that 9-1-1 calls related to violence against women increased by nearly 46 percent during the first half of this year. As compared to the same time period from January to June back in 2019.</p><p>And that gives you some evidence there that this outbreak has had a brutal effect on victims of domestic violence, as evidenced by those numbers.</p><p>So this outbreak just having such an effect on all aspects of society here Mexico.</p><p>Matt Rivers, CNN. In Tijuana, Mexico.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Spain has recorded its highest number of daily infections since early May. More than 1,100 on Wednesday.

Thank you for taking the time.</p><p>JOE PIERRE, CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF HEALTH SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES: Thanks for having me.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. There seems to be this common thread of denialism. Which starts with denying that this virus is more deadly and more dangerous than the seasonal flu.</p><p>That then moves on to refusing to believe experts who say there's no miracle cure. And there's a few other steps in there as well but it brings us to the big one of all; and that's just sort of denying that a mask is effective and refusing to wear one.</p><p>Donald Trump shoulders a lot of the blame for this. But that doesn't explain why so many people, especially in this country, are willing to believe this reality TV star turned president who has a decades-long history of documented lying and fraud?</p><p>PIERRE: Yes, absolutely. So you're really touching on the topic of misinformation. And I would say that misinformation is rampant these days, especially in the era of the Internet.</p><p>It's very easy to find so-called \"alternative facts\" to virtually any topic these days.</p><p>And so it's a real problem in terms of belief and misinformation.</p><p>VAUSE: But you have to have a certain mindset to go searching for the alternative -- alternative facts which are just basically, they're not true, it's garbage. Which confirms your point of view. It's not science, it's not fact.</p><p>PIERRE: Well, that's right. And my area of academic work really centers around belief in conspiracy theories.</p><p>And for belief in conspiracy theories, I like to think of it as really consisting of two parts.</p><p>And the first part is mistrust in authoritative sources of information. And so when we mistrust authoritative sources, we tend to then be vulnerable to misinformation.</p><p>And, in fact, we seek out -- when we seek out alternative explanations we then succumb to false information.</p><p>VAUSE: Now we have \"Congressman COVID,\" Louie Gohmert from Texas on the front lines of refusing to wear a mask. He was diagnosed with COVID-19.</p><p>And of course, he blames the masks for the infection.</p><p>Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. LOUIE GOHMERT, (R-TEXAS): I can't help but wonder if by keeping a mask on and keeping it in place that -- if I might have put some germs, some of the virus onto the mask and breathed it in.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Can you explain this thought process? It's beyond cognitive dissonance, really.</p><p>PIERRE: Well, I'm glad you mentioned cognitive dissonance. Because I think it is a flavor of cognitive dissonance, if you will.</p><p>I always liked this quote by C.S. Lewis that says that experience is the most brutal of teachers but by God, you learn.</p><p>But (inaudible) find an example where experience didn't really result in teaching a lesson.</p><p>And so I think cognitive dissonance does help to explain that.</p><p>If we're so rigid in terms of what we believe in then really no matter what evidence is presented, we can often turn away from that.</p><p>So another psychological explanation of that is really confirmation bias. That we tend to gravitate to evidence that we think supports what we believe. And then evidence that doesn't support it, well, we reject that out of hand.</p><p>VAUSE: They say there's no cure for stupid, it can't be quarantined either and it can be found everywhere.</p><p>Entertainer Madonna. She's about as far away from Louie Gohmert as you'd possibly get in every way, but on Instagram which was -- a post on Instagram, rather, which was taken down -- she claimed a vaccine had already been developed but not released because --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>-- \"they would rather let fear control the people and let the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: I wouldn't have said [ph]. Michael Porter Jnr, with the NBA believing --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>\"Personally I think I think the coronavirus is being used obviously for a bigger agenda.\"</p><p>He went on to say it's being used for population control</p><p>-- \"in just terms of being able to control the masses of people.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: And again, this is lunatic stuff. But there are people who genuinely are committed to this belief. This is the conspiracy theory stuff. PIERRE: Right. And I always like to say that the idea that human beings think rationally and are only logical in the way they think is just a myth. That's just not true.</p><p>These days we do see a lot of politicization of different kinds of beliefs.</p><p>So we kind of think of conspiracy theories these days as more associated with conservatives. And to an extent, that's probably true at the moment. But historically, that's not necessarily true.</p><p>What I'm saying is that, really, we all share a vulnerability to misinformation and even belief in conspiracies.</p><p>[01:25:00]</p><p>But right now, a lot of what's going on really has to do, I think, with mistrust.</p><p>And there's a lot of legitimate reasons why people might be mistrustful right now during COVID.</p><p>For one thing, things just take time.</p><p>This is a new pandemic, scientists are trying to figure things out on the fly.</p><p>Sometimes information comes out. A month later, maybe it's revised. And so it's hard for people to grab onto something that's reliable in uncertain times like this.</p><p>VAUSE: Just very, very quickly. We're almost out of time -- in fact, we are out of time.</p><p>But I'm just curious. People who have had these sort of misconceptions, these beliefs in conspiracy theories, whatever, do they ever get to that point where they go, oh, I was wrong?</p><p>PIERRE: Sometimes they do. As I said, sometimes coming up against experience you do see people change their mind.</p><p>In fact, there are a couple of cases over the past couple of months of people who eventually died who had called coronavirus a hoax. And virtually on their deathbeds, they admitted that they were wrong.</p><p>That said, as you mentioned, there are people who are very entrenched and just never give up that belief.</p><p>VAUSE: Wow. OK. Thank you so much, Professor Joe Pierre. We want to also mention that you write about these issues on your blog @psychologytoday.\" It's well worth a look.</p><p>So thank you very much for being with us.

That it was (inaudible).</p><p>SWAN: Who said it was fake news?</p><p>TRUMP: I think a lot of people. If you look at some of the wonderful folks from the Bush Administration, some of them -- not any friends of mine -- were saying that it's a fake issue.</p><p>But a lot of people said it's a fake issue.</p><p>SWAN: There was dispute within (inaudible).</p><p>TRUMP: We had a call, we had a call talking about nuclear proliferation.</p><p>SWAN: Right.</p><p>TRUMP: Which is a very big subject where they would like to do something.

No.</p><p>SWAN: (Inaudible).</p><p>TRUMP: I would. I'd have no problem with it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: And it's not like he hasn't had a chance to talk about it. Apparently there's been at least seven phone calls between Trump and Putin in recent months.</p><p>And during the conversation with \"Axios,\" Trump also tried to draw a moral equivalency between those bounties being offered by the Russians to kill American troops, an American campaign to aid anti-Soviet forces in Afghanistan providing the Muja din with weapons during the 1980s.</p><p>Also under heavy scrutiny is Donald Trump's decision to withdraw nearly 12,000 U.S. forces from Germany.</p><p>Republican Senator Mitt Romney tweets that the move is a gift to Putin after reports of bounties in killing American troops.</p><p>He goes on to say the move's --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>-- \"consequences will be lasting and harmful to American interests.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Mr. Trump insists he's removing the troops because Germany is not paying all of its NATO dues.

It may even be harmful.</p><p>But its use here has become an act of worship almost. This evangelical church follows science and social distancing and its seating plan as they offer a prayer for the president's health.</p><p>\"I want us to pray for the country and him. Can we do that now,\" he says. But science steps aside for belief when it comes to the drug.</p><p>\"We're a congregation of 3,000 people,\" the pastor says and we have no deaths. None.

But before Italy started to open up after its strict draconian lockdown, the Italian president Sergio Mattarella led the way by wearing a mask even when it wasn't required.</p><p>Now face coverings are part of daily life and no one leaves home without one.

Lawmakers spent roughly five hours grilling some of the most powerful CEOs in the world. Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai each of them argued that their companies have created millions of jobs, and helped small businesses grow.</p><p>But some members of Congress came away unconvinced. Congressman David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, chairs the panel that interrogated the CEOs.</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D), RHODE ISLAND: This hearing has made one fact clear to me. These companies that exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up.

That's not a suspicion, that's not a hunch, that's a fact.</p><p>July 20th, 2020, Google moves the home pages of Breitbart and \"The Daily Caller\". Just last night we learned Google has censored Breitbart so much, traffic has declined 99 percent. June 16th, 2020 Google threatens to demonetize and ban \"The Federalist\". April 19th, 2020 Google and YouTube announce a policy, censoring the content that conflicts with recommendations of the World Health Organization.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: You know, the Democrats, to be fair, they complained it was too to a lesser degree. And we'll talk politics and bias on social media in a moment. But big picture here, at the end of a year-long antitrust investigation, do you think Congress is likely to agree on any kind of overhaul, or new regulations for big tech?</p><p>THOMPSON: I actually do, because when you watch the whole five hours, there are two representatives, Gordan and Gaetz who are, you know, just off their space cadets talking about conservative bias, exactly the clips you showed. Stuff that's important to them, but not really germane to anti-Trump.</p><p>[01:45:00]</p><p>THOMPSON: But most everybody else, including some of the Republicans are focused on similar questions about antitrust, and whether the large tech companies are misusing their power to crush smaller competitors in a way that hurts the economy, so I, unlike all of people who left those hearings, a little bit optimistic that we'll get smart action.</p><p>VAUSE: Optimism is a good thing these days.</p><p>It's pretty quiet in Washington at the moment, not a lot going on. So the President had plenty of time to weigh in via a tweet which had not been flagged for false information.</p><p>He tweeted, \"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to big tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with executive orders. In Washington, it has been all talk and no action for years. And the people of our country are sick and tired of it.</p><p>Last year, \"The Economy Journalism Review\" reported the myth of social media anti conservative bias refuse to die. Clearly they were right. Why is that?</p><p>THOMPSON: Well, I think that everybody in every political party, things that if they put pressure on the tech companies, they will get more out of them. It's like working the refs. If you complain about the refs before your sports team plays, you think you'll get better calls, right.</p><p>The Republicans know they thrive on social media. Donald Trump could not govern without Twitter, would not have been elected without Facebook. But he thinks that he will get the algorithms to work more in his favor if he puts this kind of pressure on them.</p><p>The unfortunate thing is that there are really important issues about the American economy, I mean much better for the whole congressional hearing and the President's twitter feed, be devoted to that.</p><p>VAUSE: Right. Good point. What I've noticed there wasn't really sort of an a-ha moment in the five hour. No one really got pinned for anything in a major way. Even when the example of a new monopoly was fairly stark, like Apples app store. And here's how CEO Tim Cook sort of dispensed with that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: We don't have a dominant share in any market or in any product category where we do business. If Apple is a gatekeeper, what we've done is open the gate wider. We want to get every app we can on the store not keep them off.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Is it fair to say that they kind of came up with this argument that, yes they are big, yes they are dominant but hey, that's a really good thing because being big and dominant means that, you know, consumers have advantages in terms of, you know, they can develop shiny new products?</p><p>THOMPSON: Yes. I mean it was interesting, if you listen to Cook's answer there, it is emblematic of two arguments that the CEOs made throughout the day.</p><p>The first is, we are not as big as you think we are. We are actually a little bit meek. And for Amazon, we are threatened by Kroger's. Or Apple, we don't have a dominant share in any category. So really playing down their strength.</p><p>And then as Cook just said, and as you rightly pointed out, suggesting that to the extent they are huge, it helps everybody else. Those were the arguments that they made, and they were a little bit disingenuous.</p><p>If you look at the way the tech CEO talk in any other context, they are much more aggressive about promoting their size and power. It's in congressional antitrust hearings where they downplay it all.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes. Well, Jeff Bezos though from Amazon has been like babysitting in the corner. He was seen eating lunch, he had a cup of coffee, he was kind of left there by himself for a few hours.</p><p>One reporter from the \"New York Times\" noted, \"Jeff Bezos, sitting there doing nothing, just made maybe $300 million or so.\" Why the kid gloves for him? What, first-time is get off easy?</p><p>THOMPSON: Well, I think what happened to Bezos is he got off easy for the first hour. We went into the first break, and he hasn't said a thing. And then he got pummeled, right?</p><p>One of -- if you're to pick sort of five signature moments that could actually carry on, and that we may remember, it's when Bezos is called out, and confronted with documents showing that he used a tool called predatory pricing to drive diapers.com, basically, out of the market. What he said, and what we saw on the documents is, we, Amazon, have a short term competitive threat from Diapers, so therefore, when you drop our prices so low that we are going to lose lots of money, but that's ok because it will drive our competitor to ruin and then we can either drive them out of business or acquire them, right?</p><p>And that's not entirely legal. It is perhaps directly illegal. So getting hit there was pretty tough. And then, a couple other points, and here I was very interested to see Congress pushing Bezos. And Bezos not being able to answer.</p><p>Specifically, he was asked, do, you know, people have to use real names and addresses when they set up seller accounts. He didn't know the answer. How does Jeff Bezos not know the answer? I thought Jeff Bezos was a superhuman who knew everything about Amazon. So, he was totally treated with kid gloves for a while, and then it got a little tougher.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. I guess the end result will be what they come up with, and that's always a way.</p><p>But Nick, great to have you with us. Really appreciate your insights.</p><p>[01:50:00]</p><p>THOMPSON: It was so much fun to talk to you. Thanks for having me on tonight.</p><p>VAUSE: It's a pleasure, thank you.</p><p>His actions might have changed everything, a man with an umbrella and a hammer believed to have set off the violence and looting in Minneapolis back in May. Now finally, police say they know who he is.</p><p>VAUSE: U.S. government agents will be leaving the downtown area of Portland, Oregon after an agreement was reached between the Trump administration and the Democratic governor. For two months protesters had been demanding racial justice and an end to police brutality.</p><p>And where there had been violent clashes in the early stages, enthusiasm and momentum was fading among demonstrators. That is, until the federal agents arrived about two weeks ago.</p><p>President Trump praised the efforts of these unidentified federal police force which had been sent to protect federal property.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: All you have to do is look at Portland, look at the agitators, look at the anarchists in Portland. And our people have done a great job in protecting our courthouse. And I told my people a little while ago, if they don't solve that problem locally, very soon, we are going to send in the National Guard to get it solved very quickly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: The Department of Homeland Security though says as a presence of federal agents will remain in Portland until federal property is secure.</p><p>Well, the Portland protests have been going since George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis. Police there now say they know who helped incite the riots which left parts of the city in ruins.</p><p>Here's CNN's Sara Sidner.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: For weeks, no one could figure out who the man dressed in black was until now. A police investigator believes the man helped initiate the riot and destruction in Minneapolis during the George Floyd protest.</p><p>It turns out he is associated with a prison gang, police say, which the Anti-Defamation League identifies as white supremacist.</p><p>The man was caught on a live stream, smashing in the windows of the Auto Zone. Brad Svenson shot the video.</p><p>BRAD SVENSON, LIVESTREAMED DURING MINNEAPOLIS PROTESTS: All I saw really was a hammer hitting glass.</p><p>SIDNER: Police also blame the man for spray painting graffiti on the building. The man in black, holding an umbrella, is confronted by a protester in a pink shirt and later another protester.</p><p>(EXPLETIVE DELETED)</p><p>SVENSON: Immediately, they wanted him to stop, but afterwards, they wanted to know who he was, and why he was doing what he was doing.</p><p>SIDNER: His video and others went viral. Then protesters at Online Flute (ph) began a furious search to identify the man they dubbed \"umbrella man\".</p><p>First, social media seized on that, misidentifying him as a state police officer. The police department responded, \"It's sad that people would post and share this untrue information, adding more confusion to an already painful time in our community.\"</p><p>This week, a Minneapolis police arson investigator says she finally identified the man whose name we are not publishing because he has not been charged. In a warrant filed, the officer says a tipster emailed police, identifying the man and saying he wanted to sow discord and racial unrest.</p><p>And using the video, the officer discovered he is a full fledged member of The Hell's Angels, and is a known associate of the Aryan Cowboys.</p><p>Who are the Aryan Cowboys?</p><p>[01:54:59]</p><p>JONATHAN GREENBLATT, CEO, ANTI-DEFASMATION LEAGUE: The Aryan Cowboy Brotherhood was formed in a Minnesota prison, as a small white supremacist prison gang. The founder of the ACB now is part of The Hells Angels, as we understand.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And this is, as you believe, scary.</p><p>SIDNER: As mostly peaceful daytime protests turned into violent nighttime unrest, the mayor and governor blamed white supremacists in part for playing a role.</p><p>Now, weeks later, this investigator's search warrant notes, \"The work of a man fitting that description appears to have helped fuel the destruction, looting and fires\". She writes, \"In a short time after the front windows are broken out in the Auto Zone, looting started. Within a short time after the looting started, the Auto Zone was set on fire. This was the first fire that set off a string of fires and looting throughout the precinct and rest of the city.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A third precinct appears to be on fire at this time.</p><p>SIDNER: In the end, the neighborhood suffered massive destruction at the hands of many. Community organizers who tried to calm the chaos say the revelations, though, in a search warrant come as no surprise.</p><p>SHANENE HERBERT, CORCORAN NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY ORGANIZER: I think it's confirmation of what everybody knew already, of the threat of white supremacy coming into our town to wreak havoc and kind of monopolize on the situation that was happening here at the time. So, it was just confirmation.</p><p>ALICIA SMITH, CORCORAN NEIGHBORHOOD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: Certainly, I think that it was an opportunity to take advantage of the rage, the hurt, right? The deep pain. We are talking about deep hurt and deep pain that we are all experiencing. SIDNER: Sara Sidner, CNN -- Minneapolis.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Former U.S. president Barack Obama will deliver the eulogy for Congressman John Lewis. The civil rights leader has been lying in state at the Capitol in Atlanta. In the coming hours, his funeral will be held at Ebenezer Baptist Church. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush will attend.</p><p>A spokesperson for former president Jimmy Carter says, \"Right now Mr. Carter is not traveling, but sends his condolences.\"</p><p>Six days of ceremonies have traced the path Lewis took from civil rights leading those marches in Alabama where he was brutally beaten, to the halls of Congress where he served for more than 30 years.</p><p>Well, I'm John Vause.</p><p>Please stay with us. I will be back with another hour -- yes, more to go -- of CNN NEWSROOM in just a moment.</p><p>[01:57:16]</p><p>Hello, welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world, I'm John

I'm Bret Baier at the  White House.  We are following two breaking stories of two potential  natural disasters.  On the left of your screen you're looking at scenes  from Mexico.  A Magnitude 7.1 earthquake has rocked that nation on the 32nd  anniversary of the massive 1985 quake that killed thousands.  Right now the  governor of one central Mexican state has at least 42 people are dead, but  that number is expected to rise.  The U.S. geological survey says the quake  was centered about 76 miles southeast of Mexico City.  We'll have a live  report from our west coast newsroom shortly.  On the right hand of your  screen, Hurricane Maria is bearing down on the Caribbean right now.  It is  a category 5 hurricane with winds of 165 miles per hour.  It is going over  much of the same territory that was ravaged by Hurricane Irma just days  ago.  Puerto Rico is bracing for a major hit tomorrow.  We'll have the  latest from our Fox weather center, and we'll go to Puerto Rico where our  own Steve Harrigan has just arrived on the scene.  There is a third top  story today, and it is out of New York, President Trump making his first  speech to the United Nations General Assembly, and he made quite a first  impression.</p><p/><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  We meet at a time  of both immense promise and great peril.  The depraved regime in North  Korea.  Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.   We must work together and confront together those who threaten us with  chaos, turmoil and terror.  The Iran deal was one of the worst and most  one-sided transactions.  We cannot abide by an agreement if it provides  cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  He was not shy in trying to rally the world against the nuclear  ambitions of Iran and North Korea.  Chief White House correspondent John  Roberts is outside the U.N. tonight.  Good evening, John.  Quite a speech.  </p><p> JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Bret, good evening  to you.  It was quite a speech, but it was exactly what the president  intended.  He came to Washington to be a disruptor, to shake things up, and  that's what he did here at the United Nations in his speech this morning.   The president was really reaching out to the United Nations to do something  about North Korea.  I mean, clearly, if North Korea does get a  thermonuclear warhead that it can mount on an intercontinental ballistic  missile and were to fire one towards the United States, well, that would  unleash the total destruction that President Trump threatened this morning.   But don't forget, he said if the United States is forced to defend itself,  it will totally destroy North Korea.   But that is not the president's preferred course of action.  He has said  that.  His aides have said that.  So what the president would really like  to see is for the United Nations Security Council to come together to  impose more tough sanctions on North Korea.  For China and Russia to use  their collective influence against North Korea.  He slapped, as Nikki Haley  said he would, the right people, and he hugged the right people, according  to the U.S. delegation.  And the president did reach out and gave a nice  big hug to China and Russia, thanking them for their actions last week at  the U.N. Security Council in passing these tough new sanctions.  So, while  people like Dianne Feinstein are criticizing the president, Bret, for using  his United Nations speech as a platform to threaten war, the president sees  it completely the opposite, saying those would be the ultimate consequences  if something doesn't happen with North Korea.  Now it's time for the U.N.  to act.  Bret?  </p><p> BAIER:  Interesting to hear the ambassador from Venezuela say that he  thought he was listening to Ronald Reagan in 1982 as a jab.  </p><p> ROBERTS:  You know, yeah -- Jorge Arreaza, he's the foreign minister of  Venezuela, who's reacting to the president, calling out the Nicholas Medora  regime, saying it wasn't a failed imposition of socialism.  It was a  faithful imposition of socialism.  Calling it a corrupt dictatorship which  has stolen democracy from the people of Venezuela.  Well, Arreaza came back  out, accused President Trump of reigniting the cold war saying he didn't  know if he was listening to Ronald Reagan in 1982 when he was talking tough  about the Soviet Union or Donald Trump in 2017.  Note to the Venezuelan  prime minister, if you're going to try to insult a Republican, don't  compare him or her to Ronald Reagan.  Bret?  </p><p> BAIER:  John, we'll see you at 6:00 PM.  Thank you.  We'll also have a live  interview with secretary of state Rex Tillerson in the next hour.  But  first, let's get some analysis of the president's speech.  Dana Perino is  co-host of The Five, she is in New York, and Chris Stirewalt is Fox News  politics editor, he's in our Washington bureau.  Dana, first to you, your  thought on the speech.</p><p> DANA PERINO, THE FIVE CO-HOST:  Well, presidential speeches in their maiden  voyage to the United Nation General Assembly are often defining moments of  a presidency.  It only happens once a year.  And I love that today  President Trump had the stage to himself.  And that meant that -- not only  was he there to give a speech, but there were some people that weren't  there.  I think it's good that President Putin and President Xi, Russia and  China weren't there, so that he could have the stage and the world could  listen to him.  And if you see people on the right, even people who might  consider themselves sort of moderate or the neo-cons, they love the speech.  </p><p> The left seems alarmed but at least they have something, which is a defined  foreign policy.  They've been sort of wondering where is he going to fall  on this or that.  This was a speech that was really grand in scope.  It  didn't touch everything.  It didn't hit everybody's words, like freedom and  liberty.  Maybe that wasn't in there as much.  But he did talk about  diplomacy and how the United Nations could be better.  And I think that it  was just well received, not just on the right but even in the middle.  The  left are going to be upset no matter what.  But I would say that he really  rose to the occasion today and gave a great speech.  </p><p> BAIER:  Now Chris, there were strains in here that you could hear from  other Republican presidents, definitely.  But there were Trumpian moments,  the rocket man moment and other phrases.  What's interesting is if you look  at the scope of speeches though -- there, you see the joint address to  congress, and then you see Saudi Arabia, then you see Warsaw, and that  speech in Poland, the Afghan policy rollout, and then you have today.  I  mean, you're beginning to see the contours of Trump doctrine that is  America first, but other countries can be independently able to handle  their own issues too.  </p><p> CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR:  Yeah.  And more humane and  thoughtful version of the Trumpism.  I thought of two speeches when I heard  the president today.  One was -- remember when he went to Mexico, went down  there and it was not a good look.  He was -- seemed very uncomfortable on  the world stage.  When he went down and he had his meeting with the Mexican  president, and it looked like he came out on the short end of that.  You  can thrash that to today, where he was in command, and he was speaking  authoritatively on subjects that were complex.  He put forward -- I know it  didn't sound nuanced, but there were nuanced points that he made  throughout.  And he put forward a basically straightforward American  foreign policy that, as you said, could have come from the mouths of almost  any Republican president.  </p><p> BAIER:  Yeah.  Dana, the one thing that a lot of critics are focusing on is  that North Korea threat.  And they're leaving out the, if, part of that  sentence.  If North Korea and Kim Jong-un do this, then this is going to  happen.  I wonder what the message -- how it's going to be digested by  countries like China.  </p><p> PERINO:  Well, one of the things you've also heard the administration say  that they're out of road.  You had McMaster, Haley, and Tillerson, all  saying that over the weekend.  So that's actually means that they are  trying to send quite a clear message.  Remember, that when a president  speaks he's not only speaking to the people that are directly in front of  him or even those that are on television.  This was a message meant  directly for Kim Jong-un, and I'm sure the president words are going to be  parsed.  And they were going to try to think, what does he mean by that?   </p><p> And I actually think in this occasion, when it comes to presidential  speeches, you do not have to wonder what President Trump would actually do.   What he's saying is it was a strong warning.  And it was enough also to get  the attention of the world to say I'm actually not kidding.  We are at the  end of the road.  And you're very survival, the people that you care about  that you're here representing, it all comes down to us.  So we will  actively have to.  And you're right.  The important word is, if.  It might  be the first time that a world leader was given a nickname on stage at the  United Nations.  I don't know if it will become routine, but rocket man  will never be the same.  </p><p> BAIER:  I didn't know what the over-under was about the marble being  commented on at the U.N.  But rocket man is surely going to get in.  Chris,  final thought here, what else struck your ear of this speech?  There were  some pointed criticism of the U.N. overall, but also some praise for what  they can get done in the U.N. Security Council.  </p><p> STIREWALT:  So Trump's foreign policy has evolved rather rapidly over the  course of his presidency.  There's been considerable move towards -- as we  talked about before, normal, a more normal, predictable American foreign  policy than what we've been expecting.  But his tough talk about North  Korea before makes his challenge greater because every president has had to  come to terms with, eventually, the fact that there is no good solution for  North Korea, and there continues not to be one.  Now, because of the way  that Trump addressed the problem when he came into office.  Status quo is  not an option, and the North Koreans continue to escalate the situation.   This one is intractable and he's going to need to pull off a Hail Mary on  this.  </p><p> BAIER:  And Dana, there was a tease in here, and sometimes Trump speeches  include that, like coming up next week, the Iran deal and whether there is  going to be some change.  </p><p> PERINO:  There is a deadline of October 15 for the president to respond to  congress.  I think that if you look at Nikki Haley's speech from about two  weeks ago at the American Enterprise Institute, she laid out pretty much  what's going to happen, which is the United States would basically say this  deal is not good.  And congress, if you look at the law, the law congress  passed, it's up to them to decide what to do going forward.  And I think  that the president will say that's what he expects them to do.  So, now  congress' list just got a little bit longer.  </p><p> BAIER:  All right.  Dana, Chris, as always, thank you.  </p><p> STIREWALT:  You bet.</p><p> BAIER:  This is a Fox News alert.  At least 42 people are now dead in a  massive earthquake that struck central Mexico today.  Correspondent Trace  Gallagher is in our west coast newsroom tonight with the latest.  Good  evening, Trace.  </p><p> TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Bret.  Before I  show you more of these disturbing pictures of the earthquake destruction in  and around Mexico City.  I want to, kind of, give you an idea of the area.   The 7.1 quake hit 70 miles south of Mexico City in the state of Puebla.  We  have not gotten a death toll in Puebla, but in the next-door state of  Morelos, the governor there said the death toll is now at 42.  In Mexico  City, which is in the district of Mexico, two people have died.  But if you  look at these pictures of collapsed buildings and buckled bridges, the  death toll will almost certainly rise.  We know there are numerous people  trapped inside some of these fallen buildings, but it's unclear if  authorities are in contact with these people.  </p><p> We are also getting word that dozens, if not hundreds of roads in and out  of Mexico City are fractured and impossible, which means the recovery  effort will be that much slower, especially in the very vulnerable areas  outside of Mexico City where millions of poor people live.  Thirty two  years ago today, an 8.0 quake in Mexico City claimed at least 5,000 lives  and thousands of buildings.  Now the construction codes have become much  stricter over the past three decades, but in the poorer areas there are  hundreds of thousands of structures that have not been retrofitted or  reinforce.  So it's worth noting, Mexico City was built on a dry lake bed,  so earthquake waves tend to echo and multiply the damage.  Dry lake beds  are also prone to liquefaction, which means the ground simply turns to  water.  </p><p> And in the outlying areas of Mexico where millions of poor people live,  there are still many buildings, again, that are not reinforced.  Even  though the epicenter of this quake was 70 miles south of Mexico City,  because it was 32 miles deep the damage will be felt over a very wide area.   And for some context, today's quake in Mexico City was six times stronger  than the 6.9 quake that hit San Francisco in 1989, 12 times stronger than  the quake that hit Northridge, California, in 1994.  And, of course, just  last week, Bret, an 8.1 quake in the southwestern part of Mexico killed 58  people.  The death toll of this Mexico City quake will certainly rise in  the hours ahead, Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  It's a big story.  And we'll head back with breaking details as  they become available.  Trace, thank you.  Who has the presidents back  after his speech today at the U.N.?  We'll find out after the break.  Plus,  health care, Russia, and the budget.  A tick-tock of what's happening on  Capitol Hill.  And we're watching that big storm out there, Hurricane  Maria.   Next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  Here at the White House today, we do this once a week.  Meantime,  just down Pennsylvania Avenue, congress has more than a full plate in the  final 11 days of this fiscal year.  Let's get more on that tonight from Fox  senior Capitol Hill producer Chad Pergram.  He's at the capitol this  evening.  Good evening, Chad.  </p><p> CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER:  Good evening.</p><p> BAIER:  You know, we're talking about a lot of things, but really on the  focus for a lot of folks is health care.  We thought efforts to repeal and  replace Obamacare might be finished, might be done.  But now, they've been  resurrected.  Explain what's going on.  </p><p> PERGRAM:  This is like one of those old horror movies, Bret, where they  think that they've killed off the monster, and yet, it's really alive and  keeps coming around the corner.  You can almost hear the creepy music.   That's the take the Democrats say, because they thought they killed this  off.  There's going to be an effort to try to resurrect this by Republicans  in the next week and a half.  They've only have until September 30th to use  this special process which avoids filibusters, and then it goes poof.  It  goes away.  </p><p> Now, the thing about health care is that it's always been about the math.   The average repeal and replace bill would always get in the upper 40's in  the Republican side.  They need at least 50 with Vice President Pence to  potentially break a tie here.  John McCain and Susan Collins are on the  fence.  Collins says that this bill is more flawed than the last one.  Rand  Paul is a hard no.  And so, what a lot of people are looking at, Lisa  Murkowski, the Republican senator from Alaska.  I have senior sources here  telling me that all roads lead to her.  And they would have to move this  next week.  Vice president Pence was at the capitol today talking to  Republican senators about this, and he says it's all in.  And they have to  get this off the table so they can go to tax reform next, Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  Yeah.  And we should point out the Cassidy-Graham bill, essentially  is a federalist version, pushes a lot of it to the states. So we're  watching those votes.  Next week, a big week, as you mentioned, for tax  reform in congress.  </p><p> PERGRAM:  Right.  And what we expect is Kevin Brady, the chairman of the  ways and means committee from Texas, to put out some general specifics  here.  This has been the criticism from Republicans that they don't have  enough specifics.  People who've been riding this bill say, yes, you do.   But we'll actually see what the proof is in the pudding when they put that  together next week.  Kevin Brady has not yet scheduled a markup section.   That would be the signal to know that they're really getting somewhere in  the committee.  And again, Republicans have always been in general  agreement on tax reform.  The devil will be in the details on this and  that's what's going to be hard.  And that might be why they need Democrats,  and they need to avoid a filibuster, and that's why they need a second  special budget reconciliation package which neuters those filibusters.  </p><p> BAIER:  Yeah, a lot of moving parts up on the hill.  The senate  intelligence committee today heard from President Trump's personal attorney  Michael Cohen as part of this Russian investigation, but it didn't really  all go as well as planned.  </p><p> PERGRAM:  That's right.  And that's because he leaked out some of the  information that he was going to tell the committee.  They didn't like  that.  Richard Burr, the chairman of the committee, Republican senator from  North Carolina, indicated that you don't get to say things in public and  then say other things in private.  And so, just in the past 15 minutes or  so here, they've asked Michael Cohen to appear in a public session on the  25th of October.  </p><p> BAIER:  OK.  Chad Pergram with all the latest up on Capitol Hill.  Chad,  thanks.  As we mentioned at the top of the show, Hurricane Maria tearing  through the Caribbean tonight.  It's going over a lot of the same territory  already devastated, unfortunately, by Hurricane Irma.  Let's get the latest  on the storm's path from meteorologist Adam Klotz.  He's in the Fox weather  center in New York.  Adam, Puerto Rico looks like it's in the target range.  </p><p> ADAM KLOTZ, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST:  Yeah, it is.  Overnight tonight, Bret,  into tomorrow, really throughout the day tomorrow, that's what we're going  to be looking at.  Here it is.  It's a big storm.  Winds currently at 165  miles an hour.  Gusting at times even up to 190, 185, right around there.   So it's a powerful one.  Going to continue to move that direction.  As a  category five storm, you are going to see this -- maybe weakened a little  bit once it begins to run over the U.S. Virgin Islands, over Puerto Rico.   But either way, a very powerful storm.  Following there to a category four.  </p><p> Really think early, early tomorrow morning to the U.S. Virgin Islands,  throughout the day tomorrow.  Folks in Puerto Rico are going to be dealing  with it.  We've saw a little bit of indecision on specifically where it's  going to cross over the island, but either way it looks like the largest  city, San Juan, is going to be heavily impacted with this.  You see it  eventually begin to turn just east of the Bahamas before it heads to the  north.  </p><p> So no concerns for Florida with this particular system, even though it's a  system that is taking, at least, early on, a similar path to Irma.  The big  concerns, initially, are going to be these winds as they cross over yet the  U.S. Virgin Islands, and then into Puerto Rico tomorrow.  All of these  getting hurricane force winds.  That's what that is indicating, right in  that area.  What kind of winds that I'm talking about?  Real quickly here,  these are some of the wind gusts forecasted for you on Wednesday, getting  up to about 120, 130, in some areas.  This is going to be a real powerful  storm, Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  Adam, thanks.  We'll track that.  Back over to the United Nation  now, Israel's prime minister gave President Trump some serious backup today  at the U.N.  Senior correspondent Eric Shawn is there tonight.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Let's give this  as a toast to the potential, the great, great potential of the United  Nations.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPINDENT:  While the international  spotlight was on President Trump's debut on the world body stage, other  leaders echoed similar themes warning of threats to the global order.   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu focus on Iran.  Each year he has  used the annual General Assembly platform to denounce Iran's nuclear  ambitions.  And did so, yet, again, today.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAEL PRIME MINISTER:  President Trump rightly called  the nuclear deal with Iran, he called it an embarrassment.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAWN:  The Israeli leader is calling for the agreement, in his words, to  be fixed or canceled.  Saying revisions that left a restriction on Iran's  nuclear program in ten years will certainly clear the way for a nuclear  bomb.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NETANYAHU:  Fix it or nix it.  Nixing the deal means restoring massive  pressure on Iran, including crippling sanctions until Iran fully dismantles  its nuclear weapons capability.  Fixing the deal requires many things,  among them inspecting military and any other sites that is a suspect.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAWN:  In a little noticed development, Netanyahu had a private sit down  with Egyptian president, Abdel el-Sisi, an important bond with Israel's  Arab neighbor that has also suffered numerous terrorist attacks.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  I would like to speak in favor of the nuclear  agreement with Iran.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAWN:  But in contrast to President Trump and Netanyahu's view, French  president, Emmanuel Macron, praise the Iran deal, saying changing or  scrapping it would be a mistake. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  If we put together a solid, robust, and fare agreement  with Iran that, will ensure that Iran does not obtain nuclear weapons.   Renouncing it would be a grave error.  It would be irresponsible for us to  fail to uphold that agreement because this is good agreement. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAWN:  The Venezuelan foreign minister reacted sharply to President  Trump's speech, saying he came to talk of war, treats the countries like  his employees.  It's a sad day for the world, he said.  Tomorrow, there'll  likely be more reaction.  That's when it's Iranian president Hassan  Rouhani's turn to speak before the green marble podium of the General  Assembly.  Bret?  </p><p> BAIER:  Eric Shawn outside of the United Nation.  Eric, thanks.  Stay with  us.  Millions of people personal information compromised.  Now Equifax is  admitting it's not the first time.  Plus, rough sailing for the U.S. navy,  and now the top admirals are facing tough questions.  Keep it here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  Welcome back to the White House.  The last few months have been  anything but smooth sailing for the U.S. navy.  A series of accidents has  led to the deaths of 17 sailors and the replacement of several senior  officers.  Today, some of those still left were on Capitol Hill.  National  security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest tonight from the  Pentagon.  Good evening, Jennifer.  </p><p> JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening,  Bret.  Angry lawmakers directed tough questions at the navy's top officer,  Admiral John Richardson, while family members of the victim sat behind him.   Richardson admitted today that changes to training may be part of the  problem.  In 2003, the navy closed its surface warfare schoolhouse.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  We thought we could achieve the aim and then train  surface warfare officers, junior officers with a computer-based approach  combined with on-the-job training at sea.  And we found that was woefully  inadequate.  </p><p> UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  How in the world is a billion-dollar destroyer not  know that there's a freighter closing in on it?  I don't understand how  this could possibly happen.  And I've talked to Maine lobstermen, they're  scratching their heads.  They can tell when there's a flock of seagulls of  their bowels.  Don't we have sailors on the bridge with binoculars anymore?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GRIFFIN:  Many of them, watch officers, are exhausted.  The chief of naval  operations admitted many sailors are working 100 hour weeks.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, R-ARIZONA: I think I know what 100 hours a week does to  people over time.  When somebody is working 100 hours a week, over a period  of time, they're going to make mistakes.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GRIFFIN: For McCain, this is a personal one.  One of the two destroyers  that crashed was named for his father and grandfather.  The Navy is down to  two destroyers, badly needed right now in the Pacific, both capable of  shooting down North Korean missiles.  </p><p> The outgoing head of the Navy's surface forces has ordered all Navy ships  to keep their automatic identification systems on while operating in busy  shipping lanes.  It will alert adversities to the location of the U.S  warships, the system can force merchant ships on autopilot to change  course.  He also wants to get rid of five hour watches the Navy.  Six Navy  leaders have been fired since the collisions.  </p><p> Rear admiral Charles Williams and Captain Bennett were terminated  yesterday.  One-third of all Navy Warship training certifications have  expired, according to a government watchdog.  Those ships are still  sailing.  Today the Navy Officers admitted ten of the USS Fitzgerald  certifications had expired at the time of the crash. </p><p> BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST:  A big story for the Navy.  Jennifer Griffin  live at the Pentagon.  Thank you.  New trouble tonight for Equifax, the  credit card monitoring company was dealing with the fallout from a massive  security breach.  Now we are learning it was not the first.  Equifax says  the earlier incident was not related to the most recent breach which  compromised the personal information of more than 140 billion Americans.   Let's get more from Fox business network, good evening.  </p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX NEWS HOST: Some industry watchers were speculating that  hackers did the first tack and marked as a test for the bigger one that  followed. Equifax saying that's not the case.  After the March hack,  Equifax hired an outside security firm which was retained to help with the  May through July data set.  </p><p> Equifax says they found no evidence these two hacks were related but its  worth noting they have declined to comment.  What cast longer of a shadow  is there's evidence that Equifax executives should have realized how  vulnerable their company was.  This March hack casting doubts on claims of  these three high level executives who said they had no knowledge of data  breaches selling $2 million worth of stock this summer. </p><p>  Some experts say if you believe three high ranking executives didn't know  about one breach, it's less believable that they were unaware of two  breachers.  They have opened a criminal probe into Equifax.  Earlier today,  the Attorney General filed a suit against Equifax.  This matches with New  York Attorney General did.  This is a sign of things to come.  It's worth  cyber experts say none of the data from this Equifax pack showed up  anywhere.  In other words, it's not for sale.  </p><p> All of the social security numbers, dates of birth and some cases driver's  license numbers.  It's not on sale on the web.  A lot of experts are saying  the lack of commercial activity is near proof that state sponsored group is  behind this big data breach.  May through July Data breach affected 40% of  Americans.  The theory is a hack this big and sophisticated must be the  work of a governmental organization.  People can only protect themselves by  only freezing their credit reports.  </p><p> BAIER: It's a good thing to do. Thank you.  Next up, President Trump  threatens North Korea and blisters Iran and Venezuela.  We will get  reaction to his U.N speech from our panel.  A little later, I will ask  secretary of state Rex Tillerson out the fallout from the speech in the  latest hot spots around the world. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The United States has great  strength and patience.  But if it's forced to defend itself or it's allies,  we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.  Rocket man is  on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.  No nation on Earth  has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with Nuclear  weapons and missiles.  </p><p> BAIER: President Trump at the United States today, a speech that's getting  a lot of reaction here and around the world.  Democratic Senator saying  this.  Dianne Feinstein \"President Trumps Bombastic threat to destroy North  Korea and his refusal to present any positive pathways forward on many  global challenges we face are severe disappointments.  </p><p> He aims to unify the world through tactics of intimidation but in reality,  he only further isolates the United States.\"  Republicans came out with  positive tweets and reaction as well as a the Israeli Prime Minister with  the big kudos.  Lets bring the panel.  Joining me at the White House,  Catherine Lucey, White House reported for the associated press.  From the  Washington Bureau, Katie Pavlich.  Charles Hart, opinion editor for the  \"Washington Times\".  It was bold, direct.  </p><p> CATHERINE LUCY, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: He really put the world on Notice  today.  The president came in with a clear message.  I've been watching his  speeches throughout the year and the campaign, it was a continuation of a  vintage and of a vision we've seen before.  He revealed his frustration and  the way he thinks, and it's the way he thinks that needs to deliver the  message.  This is the kind of rhetoric he's comfortable with.  This is the  way he wants to communicate.  He wanted to make a stand today.</p><p> BAIER: We have seen these kinds of speeches before.  I mentioned Saudi  Arabia and Warsaw big speeches.  It's a bit of a Trump doctrine that's  forming here.</p><p> CHARLES HURT, WASHINGTON TIMES: Absolutely.  I think a fairly consistent  Trump Doctrine and a departure from the kind of speeches you would hear  from President Obama a year ago when he was giving a similar speech before  the U.N.  He was talking about how America had to learn to subjugate its  interests for other countries and just sort of rein in some of our freedom  in order to make better, grander world.  </p><p> Donald Trump went out there talking about how much more money we're going  to invest in our military we've ever been, and then went names and terms of  calling out enemies.  And then went out to even criticize the U.N for  completely failing in central parts of its mission.  I look back and I  cannot think of another -- even George W. Bush who got sort of criticized  for being somewhat of a cowboy wouldn't have delivered a speech like this.   This is tough stuff.  I think a lot of people are thrilled to hear it.</p><p> BAIER: He mentioned Russia and China wants.  I want to play this sound  bite.  Russia and China, the leaders, were not in the room at the time.    Here is that part.  </p><p> TRUMP: We must reject threats to sovereignty from the Ukraine to South  China Sea.  It's time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization  is its only acceptable future.  I want to thank China and Russia for  joining the vote to impose sanctions along with all the other members of  the Security Council.  </p><p> BAIER: He mentioned China, except for that once, they North Korea part was  aimed at China specifically.  </p><p> KATIE PAVLICH, AMERICAN JOURNALIST: This is going to be the next step here,  we saw a lot coming from President Trump today in terms of rhetoric and  he's a man who expects results.  We've had these votes on sanctions now.   The Chinese and Russians have signed on, and the question going forward is  going to be due this sanctions get enforced and does the U.N make sure  those sanctions get enforced?  </p><p> In terms of the general message and theme of the speech, he did reject  globalism as Charlie was saying, of Americans giving some of their ideology  to fit into this global -- international community.  At the same time, did  not reject international partnerships with different countries in terms of  solving the big problems on North Korea and Iran.  I think that goes to  show he's very serious that it's an America first but not alone.  </p><p> BAIER: What about the tease about the Iran Nuclear deal?  It seemed like he  suggested there'll be some sort of change. </p><p> LUCY: It's possible.  He didn't tell us today what's going to happen.  He  had tough rhetoric today.  He has been very clear.  He was vocal last week  that he's not happy with the deal.  We're going to have to wait a little  bit longer to see exactly what he does. </p><p> BAIER: I will be asking the Secretary of State about that next hour.   Charlie, final thoughts on the broad messaging here.  You've got North  Korea, Iran, Venezuela, Radical Islamic terrorism, taking target to all of  it.</p><p> HURT:  Much like everything we've seen with we've seen with the Trump  Presidency from his election, so much of it is a rejection of the previous  administration and the previous administration strategic patience in North  Korea or the Iran deal of Russia's entanglement, broadening entanglement  come all over its region and interference in our election.  This really is  not only a domestic slap in the face to the previous administration.   Lawyer seeing here is a stark departure from the Obama administration  policies.  </p><p> BAIER: Panel, standby.  Washington Versus Silicon Valley, up next. </p><p> (COMMERICAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER: Gorgeous day here at the White House.  The heads of Facebook are  under new scrutiny tonight over how they may have unwittingly helped  Russia's efforts to influence last year's U.S election.  This is part of a  growing backlash here in Washington towards Silicon Valley.  Correspondent  Kristen Fisher reports.</p><p> KRISTIN FISHER, FOX CORRESPONDENT: The tech giants have long been admired  by congress, companies that embodies American innovations in job creation.   But then the 2016 election happened.  Big Tech could be in big trouble on  Capitol Hill.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED PARTCIPANT: I think frankly they need to come and testify  before congress because there's a lot we need to know about this.  </p><p> FISHER: Right now to no company is a bigger target than Facebook from  unwittingly allowing the spread of fake news during the campaign to  Facebook's most recent admission selling thousands of ads to groups backed  by the Russian government.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED PARTCIPANT: I am distressed it's taken this long to be  informed that the Russians had paid for at least $100,000 of ads designed  or tried to influence our electoral process.  </p><p> FISHER: Congressman Adam distressed that Facebook shared evidence with the  special counsel but not his committee, which is also investigating Russian  interference in the 2016 election.  Added up and you can see why analysts  say this may be the moment congress turns its back on big tech. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are entering an era of accountability because we have  system platforms that reached nearly every citizen in the country.  </p><p> FISHER: Last night Hillary Clinton called the weaponization of information  on social media --</p><p> HILARY CLINTON: One of the most serious challenges we face going forward in  politics.  </p><p> UNITENTIFIED MALE: And it's not just democrats.  Republicans worry about  the amount influence these companies exert over the American electorate,  anti liberal.  There's been almost no supervision.  </p><p> FISHER: Facebook once called himself a social utility.  Now the question  facing congress is whether it and the rest of Big Tech should be regulated  as one.  </p><p> MCMASTER: This is the equivalent of gigantic public utilities.  The  information has enormous power and I don't think even in a free society you  can have power hidden in secret controlled by a handful of billionaires.  </p><p> FISHER: Now we ask facebook officials if they will be willing to be  interviewed.  They declined to except to say the company will continue to  work with U.S authorities investigating these issues.  Bret?</p><p> BAIER:  Kristen, thank you. Back to the panel.  Katie, Charlie, Catherine.   Katie, what about this?  Is it turning of the tide?  There is always some  evil villain if you will, somewhere.  Is it Silicon valley?  </p><p> PAVLICH: I think the government has to shred very lightly when it comes to  their goals.  This is a very political hunch for people in Silicon Valley.   I'm not exactly sure what the government is trying to get out of Facebook  and these big tech giants.  These are serious questions here.  Not only  about Facebook's operations as a private company.  </p><p> And what they are allowed to do.  They are allowed to sell ads to whoever  they want.  They are providing a service whether the government should be  regulating batch.  And there is serious questions about their clients, so  to speak, and whether the government should be regulating what private  people say in private business on the internet.  </p><p> BAIER: Stew on the Facebook statement, we should point out says the vast  majority of ads run by these accounts, didn't specifically reference the  U.S presidential election.  Voting, or particular candidate rather the ads  and accounts appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political  messages across the ideological spectrum.  That was the Facebook Staement. </p><p> LUCY: Yes and I think as the reporting reached a (inaudible) was saying  this is a new moment of accountability for Facebook, and how is that going  to unfold.  There's law makers with a lot of question.  It seems like  they're either going to want to bring people in, could there be hearings,  could Mark Sufferberg have to come in and testify.  That's certainly  something that's being speculated on.  But I think the other issue we're  going to have to look at is, what might regulation look like.  And I don't  know if that there's been a consensus on it, and how that would work,  because there isn't a ton of president on how we do this.  </p><p> BAIER: And that is the question Charlie, I mean if you start going down the  regulation road and it seems like we're heading down that way.  For the  longest time Silicon Valley has said, you know they're bigger if you will  than Washington and didn't pay a ton of attention to inside Washington  Politics, but now they may have to.  </p><p> HURT: Yes and the whole thing sort of high lights, what I would call  another false failed promise, from the federal government, where congress  tried to regulate with (inaudible) sort of stuff with campaign finance  reform.  And what happened in the end was -- and remember you're mucking  with freedom of speech, you're mucking with people's ability to say what  they want to say, and put as much money as they want to behind a message in  order to express, to express yourself.  And so through campaign finance  reforms, we had this weird situation where average Americans are capped at  how much they can give, how much of their speech is allowed to be paid for,  to promote certain candidates and then Russia and these maul factors that  are from outside of the country, who aren't even -- who don't'-- none of  these laws pertain to.  You walk in and drop $100,000 worth of propaganda  on us.  And I think it is a very dangerous thing that we're dealing with,  and we have to deal with it very carefully.  And these lawmakers that talk  like there's simple answer through campaign finance reform, we have to be  skeptically of that.  </p><p> BAIER: Yes, and Katie the big thing there is the Russia part.  The outside  country that is investing in whatever they are investing in.</p><p> PAVLICH: And there is presentment in terms of the law allowing foreign  donations to campaigns in America.  So maybe they could use that in terms  of some of the regulation that there going to come up with.  But when it  comes to what they're regulating, it really just seems like they're going  after Facebook based on not a lot of evidence that Russia was actually  working with Facebook to promote Donald Trump, and not to mention Facebook  had nothing to do with people actually going to the polls and deciding  which candidate they were going to vote for.  So I quite frankly at this  point, see this as a little bit of a witch hunt for -- on capitol hill for  these government panels, these congressional committees who are trying to  find something on Russia, going after a private company, and private  citizens for simply exercising their free speech. </p><p> BAIER: Catherine, we don't know much about Bob Maulers investigation, but  we do know that he has information from Facebook that the Capitol Hill  committees don't.  </p><p> LUCY: I think we really do know here is that the investigation is heating  up.  There's been a lot of reports this week about the things they're doing  and it's not going away.  Whatever  happens with facebook, t hat's going to  keep moving, and it's going to keep being you know a concern for this White  House.</p><p> BAIER: And does it -- is there an end date?  Do they have an expiration  date enable to make their case on all these? </p><p> LUCY: Not that I'm -- I mean I think the investigation is continuing and a  lot of people are saying it could go on for quite awhile.</p><p> BAIER: Do you agree Charlie?</p><p> HURT: I think it's -- that is possible.  And I think that the longer it  goes on, I think it gets more and more complicated for democrats.   Politically because of course, you know as long as you keep pointing to  these smoking guns, but there's clearly not been any real hard evidence  that anybody within the Trump Campaign actually did anything to conclude  with Russia.  It makes all of this look like somewhat of a Witch Hunt. </p><p> BAIER: We will follow it all.  Panel, as always thank you.  That does it  for hour number one.  A special report a brand new hour, including a live  interview with the secretary of state.  Coming up after a quick break.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

I'm Bret Baier at the  White House.  We are following two breaking stories of two potential  natural disasters.  On the left of your screen you're looking at scenes  from Mexico.  A Magnitude 7.1 earthquake has rocked that nation on the 32nd  anniversary of the massive 1985 quake that killed thousands.  Right now the  governor of one central Mexican state has at least 42 people are dead, but  that number is expected to rise.  The U.S. geological survey says the quake  was centered about 76 miles southeast of Mexico City.  We'll have a live  report from our west coast newsroom shortly.  On the right hand of your  screen, Hurricane Maria is bearing down on the Caribbean right now.  It is  a category 5 hurricane with winds of 165 miles per hour.  It is going over  much of the same territory that was ravaged by Hurricane Irma just days  ago.  Puerto Rico is bracing for a major hit tomorrow.  We'll have the  latest from our Fox weather center, and we'll go to Puerto Rico where our  own Steve Harrigan has just arrived on the scene.  There is a third top  story today, and it is out of New York, President Trump making his first  speech to the United Nations General Assembly, and he made quite a first  impression.</p><p/><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  We meet at a time  of both immense promise and great peril.  The depraved regime in North  Korea.  Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.   We must work together and confront together those who threaten us with  chaos, turmoil and terror.  The Iran deal was one of the worst and most  one-sided transactions.  We cannot abide by an agreement if it provides  cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  He was not shy in trying to rally the world against the nuclear  ambitions of Iran and North Korea.  Chief White House correspondent John  Roberts is outside the U.N. tonight.  Good evening, John.  Quite a speech.  </p><p> JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Bret, good evening  to you.  It was quite a speech, but it was exactly what the president  intended.  He came to Washington to be a disruptor, to shake things up, and  that's what he did here at the United Nations in his speech this morning.   The president was really reaching out to the United Nations to do something  about North Korea.  I mean, clearly, if North Korea does get a  thermonuclear warhead that it can mount on an intercontinental ballistic  missile and were to fire one towards the United States, well, that would  unleash the total destruction that President Trump threatened this morning.   But don't forget, he said if the United States is forced to defend itself,  it will totally destroy North Korea.   But that is not the president's preferred course of action.  He has said  that.  His aides have said that.  So what the president would really like  to see is for the United Nations Security Council to come together to  impose more tough sanctions on North Korea.  For China and Russia to use  their collective influence against North Korea.  He slapped, as Nikki Haley  said he would, the right people, and he hugged the right people, according  to the U.S. delegation.  And the president did reach out and gave a nice  big hug to China and Russia, thanking them for their actions last week at  the U.N. Security Council in passing these tough new sanctions.  So, while  people like Dianne Feinstein are criticizing the president, Bret, for using  his United Nations speech as a platform to threaten war, the president sees  it completely the opposite, saying those would be the ultimate consequences  if something doesn't happen with North Korea.  Now it's time for the U.N.  to act.  Bret?  </p><p> BAIER:  Interesting to hear the ambassador from Venezuela say that he  thought he was listening to Ronald Reagan in 1982 as a jab.  </p><p> ROBERTS:  You know, yeah -- Jorge Arreaza, he's the foreign minister of  Venezuela, who's reacting to the president, calling out the Nicholas Medora  regime, saying it wasn't a failed imposition of socialism.  It was a  faithful imposition of socialism.  Calling it a corrupt dictatorship which  has stolen democracy from the people of Venezuela.  Well, Arreaza came back  out, accused President Trump of reigniting the cold war saying he didn't  know if he was listening to Ronald Reagan in 1982 when he was talking tough  about the Soviet Union or Donald Trump in 2017.  Note to the Venezuelan  prime minister, if you're going to try to insult a Republican, don't  compare him or her to Ronald Reagan.  Bret?  </p><p> BAIER:  John, we'll see you at 6:00 PM.  Thank you.  We'll also have a live  interview with secretary of state Rex Tillerson in the next hour.  But  first, let's get some analysis of the president's speech.  Dana Perino is  co-host of The Five, she is in New York, and Chris Stirewalt is Fox News  politics editor, he's in our Washington bureau.  Dana, first to you, your  thought on the speech.</p><p> DANA PERINO, THE FIVE CO-HOST:  Well, presidential speeches in their maiden  voyage to the United Nation General Assembly are often defining moments of  a presidency.  It only happens once a year.  And I love that today  President Trump had the stage to himself.  And that meant that -- not only  was he there to give a speech, but there were some people that weren't  there.  I think it's good that President Putin and President Xi, Russia and  China weren't there, so that he could have the stage and the world could  listen to him.  And if you see people on the right, even people who might  consider themselves sort of moderate or the neo-cons, they love the speech.  </p><p> The left seems alarmed but at least they have something, which is a defined  foreign policy.  They've been sort of wondering where is he going to fall  on this or that.  This was a speech that was really grand in scope.  It  didn't touch everything.  It didn't hit everybody's words, like freedom and  liberty.  Maybe that wasn't in there as much.  But he did talk about  diplomacy and how the United Nations could be better.  And I think that it  was just well received, not just on the right but even in the middle.  The  left are going to be upset no matter what.  But I would say that he really  rose to the occasion today and gave a great speech.  </p><p> BAIER:  Now Chris, there were strains in here that you could hear from  other Republican presidents, definitely.  But there were Trumpian moments,  the rocket man moment and other phrases.  What's interesting is if you look  at the scope of speeches though -- there, you see the joint address to  congress, and then you see Saudi Arabia, then you see Warsaw, and that  speech in Poland, the Afghan policy rollout, and then you have today.  I  mean, you're beginning to see the contours of Trump doctrine that is  America first, but other countries can be independently able to handle  their own issues too.  </p><p> CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR:  Yeah.  And more humane and  thoughtful version of the Trumpism.  I thought of two speeches when I heard  the president today.  One was -- remember when he went to Mexico, went down  there and it was not a good look.  He was -- seemed very uncomfortable on  the world stage.  When he went down and he had his meeting with the Mexican  president, and it looked like he came out on the short end of that.  You  can thrash that to today, where he was in command, and he was speaking  authoritatively on subjects that were complex.  He put forward -- I know it  didn't sound nuanced, but there were nuanced points that he made  throughout.  And he put forward a basically straightforward American  foreign policy that, as you said, could have come from the mouths of almost  any Republican president.  </p><p> BAIER:  Yeah.  Dana, the one thing that a lot of critics are focusing on is  that North Korea threat.  And they're leaving out the, if, part of that  sentence.  If North Korea and Kim Jong-un do this, then this is going to  happen.  I wonder what the message -- how it's going to be digested by  countries like China.  </p><p> PERINO:  Well, one of the things you've also heard the administration say  that they're out of road.  You had McMaster, Haley, and Tillerson, all  saying that over the weekend.  So that's actually means that they are  trying to send quite a clear message.  Remember, that when a president  speaks he's not only speaking to the people that are directly in front of  him or even those that are on television.  This was a message meant  directly for Kim Jong-un, and I'm sure the president words are going to be  parsed.  And they were going to try to think, what does he mean by that?   </p><p> And I actually think in this occasion, when it comes to presidential  speeches, you do not have to wonder what President Trump would actually do.   What he's saying is it was a strong warning.  And it was enough also to get  the attention of the world to say I'm actually not kidding.  We are at the  end of the road.  And you're very survival, the people that you care about  that you're here representing, it all comes down to us.  So we will  actively have to.  And you're right.  The important word is, if.  It might  be the first time that a world leader was given a nickname on stage at the  United Nations.  I don't know if it will become routine, but rocket man  will never be the same.  </p><p> BAIER:  I didn't know what the over-under was about the marble being  commented on at the U.N.  But rocket man is surely going to get in.  Chris,  final thought here, what else struck your ear of this speech?  There were  some pointed criticism of the U.N. overall, but also some praise for what  they can get done in the U.N. Security Council.  </p><p> STIREWALT:  So Trump's foreign policy has evolved rather rapidly over the  course of his presidency.  There's been considerable move towards -- as we  talked about before, normal, a more normal, predictable American foreign  policy than what we've been expecting.  But his tough talk about North  Korea before makes his challenge greater because every president has had to  come to terms with, eventually, the fact that there is no good solution for  North Korea, and there continues not to be one.  Now, because of the way  that Trump addressed the problem when he came into office.  Status quo is  not an option, and the North Koreans continue to escalate the situation.   This one is intractable and he's going to need to pull off a Hail Mary on  this.  </p><p> BAIER:  And Dana, there was a tease in here, and sometimes Trump speeches  include that, like coming up next week, the Iran deal and whether there is  going to be some change.  </p><p> PERINO:  There is a deadline of October 15 for the president to respond to  congress.  I think that if you look at Nikki Haley's speech from about two  weeks ago at the American Enterprise Institute, she laid out pretty much  what's going to happen, which is the United States would basically say this  deal is not good.  And congress, if you look at the law, the law congress  passed, it's up to them to decide what to do going forward.  And I think  that the president will say that's what he expects them to do.  So, now  congress' list just got a little bit longer.  </p><p> BAIER:  All right.  Dana, Chris, as always, thank you.  </p><p> STIREWALT:  You bet.</p><p> BAIER:  This is a Fox News alert.  At least 42 people are now dead in a  massive earthquake that struck central Mexico today.  Correspondent Trace  Gallagher is in our west coast newsroom tonight with the latest.  Good  evening, Trace.  </p><p> TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Bret.  Before I  show you more of these disturbing pictures of the earthquake destruction in  and around Mexico City.  I want to, kind of, give you an idea of the area.   The 7.1 quake hit 70 miles south of Mexico City in the state of Puebla.  We  have not gotten a death toll in Puebla, but in the next-door state of  Morelos, the governor there said the death toll is now at 42.  In Mexico  City, which is in the district of Mexico, two people have died.  But if you  look at these pictures of collapsed buildings and buckled bridges, the  death toll will almost certainly rise.  We know there are numerous people  trapped inside some of these fallen buildings, but it's unclear if  authorities are in contact with these people.  </p><p> We are also getting word that dozens, if not hundreds of roads in and out  of Mexico City are fractured and impossible, which means the recovery  effort will be that much slower, especially in the very vulnerable areas  outside of Mexico City where millions of poor people live.  Thirty two  years ago today, an 8.0 quake in Mexico City claimed at least 5,000 lives  and thousands of buildings.  Now the construction codes have become much  stricter over the past three decades, but in the poorer areas there are  hundreds of thousands of structures that have not been retrofitted or  reinforce.  So it's worth noting, Mexico City was built on a dry lake bed,  so earthquake waves tend to echo and multiply the damage.  Dry lake beds  are also prone to liquefaction, which means the ground simply turns to  water.  </p><p> And in the outlying areas of Mexico where millions of poor people live,  there are still many buildings, again, that are not reinforced.  Even  though the epicenter of this quake was 70 miles south of Mexico City,  because it was 32 miles deep the damage will be felt over a very wide area.   And for some context, today's quake in Mexico City was six times stronger  than the 6.9 quake that hit San Francisco in 1989, 12 times stronger than  the quake that hit Northridge, California, in 1994.  And, of course, just  last week, Bret, an 8.1 quake in the southwestern part of Mexico killed 58  people.  The death toll of this Mexico City quake will certainly rise in  the hours ahead, Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  It's a big story.  And we'll head back with breaking details as  they become available.  Trace, thank you.  Who has the presidents back  after his speech today at the U.N.?  We'll find out after the break.  Plus,  health care, Russia, and the budget.  A tick-tock of what's happening on  Capitol Hill.  And we're watching that big storm out there, Hurricane  Maria.   Next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  Here at the White House today, we do this once a week.  Meantime,  just down Pennsylvania Avenue, congress has more than a full plate in the  final 11 days of this fiscal year.  Let's get more on that tonight from Fox  senior Capitol Hill producer Chad Pergram.  He's at the capitol this  evening.  Good evening, Chad.  </p><p> CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER:  Good evening.</p><p> BAIER:  You know, we're talking about a lot of things, but really on the  focus for a lot of folks is health care.  We thought efforts to repeal and  replace Obamacare might be finished, might be done.  But now, they've been  resurrected.  Explain what's going on.  </p><p> PERGRAM:  This is like one of those old horror movies, Bret, where they  think that they've killed off the monster, and yet, it's really alive and  keeps coming around the corner.  You can almost hear the creepy music.   That's the take the Democrats say, because they thought they killed this  off.  There's going to be an effort to try to resurrect this by Republicans  in the next week and a half.  They've only have until September 30th to use  this special process which avoids filibusters, and then it goes poof.  It  goes away.  </p><p> Now, the thing about health care is that it's always been about the math.   The average repeal and replace bill would always get in the upper 40's in  the Republican side.  They need at least 50 with Vice President Pence to  potentially break a tie here.  John McCain and Susan Collins are on the  fence.  Collins says that this bill is more flawed than the last one.  Rand  Paul is a hard no.  And so, what a lot of people are looking at, Lisa  Murkowski, the Republican senator from Alaska.  I have senior sources here  telling me that all roads lead to her.  And they would have to move this  next week.  Vice president Pence was at the capitol today talking to  Republican senators about this, and he says it's all in.  And they have to  get this off the table so they can go to tax reform next, Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  Yeah.  And we should point out the Cassidy-Graham bill, essentially  is a federalist version, pushes a lot of it to the states. So we're  watching those votes.  Next week, a big week, as you mentioned, for tax  reform in congress.  </p><p> PERGRAM:  Right.  And what we expect is Kevin Brady, the chairman of the  ways and means committee from Texas, to put out some general specifics  here.  This has been the criticism from Republicans that they don't have  enough specifics.  People who've been riding this bill say, yes, you do.   But we'll actually see what the proof is in the pudding when they put that  together next week.  Kevin Brady has not yet scheduled a markup section.   That would be the signal to know that they're really getting somewhere in  the committee.  And again, Republicans have always been in general  agreement on tax reform.  The devil will be in the details on this and  that's what's going to be hard.  And that might be why they need Democrats,  and they need to avoid a filibuster, and that's why they need a second  special budget reconciliation package which neuters those filibusters.  </p><p> BAIER:  Yeah, a lot of moving parts up on the hill.  The senate  intelligence committee today heard from President Trump's personal attorney  Michael Cohen as part of this Russian investigation, but it didn't really  all go as well as planned.  </p><p> PERGRAM:  That's right.  And that's because he leaked out some of the  information that he was going to tell the committee.  They didn't like  that.  Richard Burr, the chairman of the committee, Republican senator from  North Carolina, indicated that you don't get to say things in public and  then say other things in private.  And so, just in the past 15 minutes or  so here, they've asked Michael Cohen to appear in a public session on the  25th of October.  </p><p> BAIER:  OK.  Chad Pergram with all the latest up on Capitol Hill.  Chad,  thanks.  As we mentioned at the top of the show, Hurricane Maria tearing  through the Caribbean tonight.  It's going over a lot of the same territory  already devastated, unfortunately, by Hurricane Irma.  Let's get the latest  on the storm's path from meteorologist Adam Klotz.  He's in the Fox weather  center in New York.  Adam, Puerto Rico looks like it's in the target range.  </p><p> ADAM KLOTZ, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST:  Yeah, it is.  Overnight tonight, Bret,  into tomorrow, really throughout the day tomorrow, that's what we're going  to be looking at.  Here it is.  It's a big storm.  Winds currently at 165  miles an hour.  Gusting at times even up to 190, 185, right around there.   So it's a powerful one.  Going to continue to move that direction.  As a  category five storm, you are going to see this -- maybe weakened a little  bit once it begins to run over the U.S. Virgin Islands, over Puerto Rico.   But either way, a very powerful storm.  Following there to a category four.  </p><p> Really think early, early tomorrow morning to the U.S. Virgin Islands,  throughout the day tomorrow.  Folks in Puerto Rico are going to be dealing  with it.  We've saw a little bit of indecision on specifically where it's  going to cross over the island, but either way it looks like the largest  city, San Juan, is going to be heavily impacted with this.  You see it  eventually begin to turn just east of the Bahamas before it heads to the  north.  </p><p> So no concerns for Florida with this particular system, even though it's a  system that is taking, at least, early on, a similar path to Irma.  The big  concerns, initially, are going to be these winds as they cross over yet the  U.S. Virgin Islands, and then into Puerto Rico tomorrow.  All of these  getting hurricane force winds.  That's what that is indicating, right in  that area.  What kind of winds that I'm talking about?  Real quickly here,  these are some of the wind gusts forecasted for you on Wednesday, getting  up to about 120, 130, in some areas.  This is going to be a real powerful  storm, Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  Adam, thanks.  We'll track that.  Back over to the United Nation  now, Israel's prime minister gave President Trump some serious backup today  at the U.N.  Senior correspondent Eric Shawn is there tonight.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Let's give this  as a toast to the potential, the great, great potential of the United  Nations.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPINDENT:  While the international  spotlight was on President Trump's debut on the world body stage, other  leaders echoed similar themes warning of threats to the global order.   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu focus on Iran.  Each year he has  used the annual General Assembly platform to denounce Iran's nuclear  ambitions.  And did so, yet, again, today.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAEL PRIME MINISTER:  President Trump rightly called  the nuclear deal with Iran, he called it an embarrassment.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAWN:  The Israeli leader is calling for the agreement, in his words, to  be fixed or canceled.  Saying revisions that left a restriction on Iran's  nuclear program in ten years will certainly clear the way for a nuclear  bomb.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NETANYAHU:  Fix it or nix it.  Nixing the deal means restoring massive  pressure on Iran, including crippling sanctions until Iran fully dismantles  its nuclear weapons capability.  Fixing the deal requires many things,  among them inspecting military and any other sites that is a suspect.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAWN:  In a little noticed development, Netanyahu had a private sit down  with Egyptian president, Abdel el-Sisi, an important bond with Israel's  Arab neighbor that has also suffered numerous terrorist attacks.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  I would like to speak in favor of the nuclear  agreement with Iran.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAWN:  But in contrast to President Trump and Netanyahu's view, French  president, Emmanuel Macron, praise the Iran deal, saying changing or  scrapping it would be a mistake. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  If we put together a solid, robust, and fare agreement  with Iran that, will ensure that Iran does not obtain nuclear weapons.   Renouncing it would be a grave error.  It would be irresponsible for us to  fail to uphold that agreement because this is good agreement. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAWN:  The Venezuelan foreign minister reacted sharply to President  Trump's speech, saying he came to talk of war, treats the countries like  his employees.  It's a sad day for the world, he said.  Tomorrow, there'll  likely be more reaction.  That's when it's Iranian president Hassan  Rouhani's turn to speak before the green marble podium of the General  Assembly.  Bret?  </p><p> BAIER:  Eric Shawn outside of the United Nation.  Eric, thanks.  Stay with  us.  Millions of people personal information compromised.  Now Equifax is  admitting it's not the first time.  Plus, rough sailing for the U.S. navy,  and now the top admirals are facing tough questions.  Keep it here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  Welcome back to the White House.  The last few months have been  anything but smooth sailing for the U.S. navy.  A series of accidents has  led to the deaths of 17 sailors and the replacement of several senior  officers.  Today, some of those still left were on Capitol Hill.  National  security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest tonight from the  Pentagon.  Good evening, Jennifer.  </p><p> JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening,  Bret.  Angry lawmakers directed tough questions at the navy's top officer,  Admiral John Richardson, while family members of the victim sat behind him.   Richardson admitted today that changes to training may be part of the  problem.  In 2003, the navy closed its surface warfare schoolhouse.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  We thought we could achieve the aim and then train  surface warfare officers, junior officers with a computer-based approach  combined with on-the-job training at sea.  And we found that was woefully  inadequate.  </p><p> UNINDENTIFIED MALE:  How in the world is a billion-dollar destroyer not  know that there's a freighter closing in on it?  I don't understand how  this could possibly happen.  And I've talked to Maine lobstermen, they're  scratching their heads.  They can tell when there's a flock of seagulls of  their bowels.  Don't we have sailors on the bridge with binoculars anymore?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GRIFFIN:  Many of them, watch officers, are exhausted.  The chief of naval  operations admitted many sailors are working 100 hour weeks.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, R-ARIZONA: I think I know what 100 hours a week does to  people over time.  When somebody is working 100 hours a week, over a period  of time, they're going to make mistakes.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GRIFFIN: For McCain, this is a personal one.  One of the two destroyers  that crashed was named for his father and grandfather.  The Navy is down to  two destroyers, badly needed right now in the Pacific, both capable of  shooting down North Korean missiles.  </p><p> The outgoing head of the Navy's surface forces has ordered all Navy ships  to keep their automatic identification systems on while operating in busy  shipping lanes.  It will alert adversities to the location of the U.S  warships, the system can force merchant ships on autopilot to change  course.  He also wants to get rid of five hour watches the Navy.  Six Navy  leaders have been fired since the collisions.  </p><p> Rear admiral Charles Williams and Captain Bennett were terminated  yesterday.  One-third of all Navy Warship training certifications have  expired, according to a government watchdog.  Those ships are still  sailing.  Today the Navy Officers admitted ten of the USS Fitzgerald  certifications had expired at the time of the crash. </p><p> BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST:  A big story for the Navy.  Jennifer Griffin  live at the Pentagon.  Thank you.  New trouble tonight for Equifax, the  credit card monitoring company was dealing with the fallout from a massive  security breach.  Now we are learning it was not the first.  Equifax says  the earlier incident was not related to the most recent breach which  compromised the personal information of more than 140 billion Americans.   Let's get more from Fox business network, good evening.  </p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX NEWS HOST: Some industry watchers were speculating that  hackers did the first tack and marked as a test for the bigger one that  followed. Equifax saying that's not the case.  After the March hack,  Equifax hired an outside security firm which was retained to help with the  May through July data set.  </p><p> Equifax says they found no evidence these two hacks were related but its  worth noting they have declined to comment.  What cast longer of a shadow  is there's evidence that Equifax executives should have realized how  vulnerable their company was.  This March hack casting doubts on claims of  these three high level executives who said they had no knowledge of data  breaches selling $2 million worth of stock this summer. </p><p>  Some experts say if you believe three high ranking executives didn't know  about one breach, it's less believable that they were unaware of two  breachers.  They have opened a criminal probe into Equifax.  Earlier today,  the Attorney General filed a suit against Equifax.  This matches with New  York Attorney General did.  This is a sign of things to come.  It's worth  cyber experts say none of the data from this Equifax pack showed up  anywhere.  In other words, it's not for sale.  </p><p> All of the social security numbers, dates of birth and some cases driver's  license numbers.  It's not on sale on the web.  A lot of experts are saying  the lack of commercial activity is near proof that state sponsored group is  behind this big data breach.  May through July Data breach affected 40% of  Americans.  The theory is a hack this big and sophisticated must be the  work of a governmental organization.  People can only protect themselves by  only freezing their credit reports.  </p><p> BAIER: It's a good thing to do. Thank you.  Next up, President Trump  threatens North Korea and blisters Iran and Venezuela.  We will get  reaction to his U.N speech from our panel.  A little later, I will ask  secretary of state Rex Tillerson out the fallout from the speech in the  latest hot spots around the world. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The United States has great  strength and patience.  But if it's forced to defend itself or it's allies,  we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.  Rocket man is  on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.  No nation on Earth  has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with Nuclear  weapons and missiles.  </p><p> BAIER: President Trump at the United States today, a speech that's getting  a lot of reaction here and around the world.  Democratic Senator saying  this.  Dianne Feinstein \"President Trumps Bombastic threat to destroy North  Korea and his refusal to present any positive pathways forward on many  global challenges we face are severe disappointments.  </p><p> He aims to unify the world through tactics of intimidation but in reality,  he only further isolates the United States.\"  Republicans came out with  positive tweets and reaction as well as a the Israeli Prime Minister with  the big kudos.  Lets bring the panel.  Joining me at the White House,  Catherine Lucey, White House reported for the associated press.  From the  Washington Bureau, Katie Pavlich.  Charles Hart, opinion editor for the  \"Washington Times\".  It was bold, direct.  </p><p> CATHERINE LUCY, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: He really put the world on Notice  today.  The president came in with a clear message.  I've been watching his  speeches throughout the year and the campaign, it was a continuation of a  vintage and of a vision we've seen before.  He revealed his frustration and  the way he thinks, and it's the way he thinks that needs to deliver the  message.  This is the kind of rhetoric he's comfortable with.  This is the  way he wants to communicate.  He wanted to make a stand today.</p><p> BAIER: We have seen these kinds of speeches before.  I mentioned Saudi  Arabia and Warsaw big speeches.  It's a bit of a Trump doctrine that's  forming here.</p><p> CHARLES HURT, WASHINGTON TIMES: Absolutely.  I think a fairly consistent  Trump Doctrine and a departure from the kind of speeches you would hear  from President Obama a year ago when he was giving a similar speech before  the U.N.  He was talking about how America had to learn to subjugate its  interests for other countries and just sort of rein in some of our freedom  in order to make better, grander world.  </p><p> Donald Trump went out there talking about how much more money we're going  to invest in our military we've ever been, and then went names and terms of  calling out enemies.  And then went out to even criticize the U.N for  completely failing in central parts of its mission.  I look back and I  cannot think of another -- even George W. Bush who got sort of criticized  for being somewhat of a cowboy wouldn't have delivered a speech like this.   This is tough stuff.  I think a lot of people are thrilled to hear it.</p><p> BAIER: He mentioned Russia and China wants.  I want to play this sound  bite.  Russia and China, the leaders, were not in the room at the time.    Here is that part.  </p><p> TRUMP: We must reject threats to sovereignty from the Ukraine to South  China Sea.  It's time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization  is its only acceptable future.  I want to thank China and Russia for  joining the vote to impose sanctions along with all the other members of  the Security Council.  </p><p> BAIER: He mentioned China, except for that once, they North Korea part was  aimed at China specifically.  </p><p> KATIE PAVLICH, AMERICAN JOURNALIST: This is going to be the next step here,  we saw a lot coming from President Trump today in terms of rhetoric and  he's a man who expects results.  We've had these votes on sanctions now.   The Chinese and Russians have signed on, and the question going forward is  going to be due this sanctions get enforced and does the U.N make sure  those sanctions get enforced?  </p><p> In terms of the general message and theme of the speech, he did reject  globalism as Charlie was saying, of Americans giving some of their ideology  to fit into this global -- international community.  At the same time, did  not reject international partnerships with different countries in terms of  solving the big problems on North Korea and Iran.  I think that goes to  show he's very serious that it's an America first but not alone.  </p><p> BAIER: What about the tease about the Iran Nuclear deal?  It seemed like he  suggested there'll be some sort of change. </p><p> LUCY: It's possible.  He didn't tell us today what's going to happen.  He  had tough rhetoric today.  He has been very clear.  He was vocal last week  that he's not happy with the deal.  We're going to have to wait a little  bit longer to see exactly what he does. </p><p> BAIER: I will be asking the Secretary of State about that next hour.   Charlie, final thoughts on the broad messaging here.  You've got North  Korea, Iran, Venezuela, Radical Islamic terrorism, taking target to all of  it.</p><p> HURT:  Much like everything we've seen with we've seen with the Trump  Presidency from his election, so much of it is a rejection of the previous  administration and the previous administration strategic patience in North  Korea or the Iran deal of Russia's entanglement, broadening entanglement  come all over its region and interference in our election.  This really is  not only a domestic slap in the face to the previous administration.   Lawyer seeing here is a stark departure from the Obama administration  policies.  </p><p> BAIER: Panel, standby.  Washington Versus Silicon Valley, up next. </p><p> (COMMERICAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER: Gorgeous day here at the White House.  The heads of Facebook are  under new scrutiny tonight over how they may have unwittingly helped  Russia's efforts to influence last year's U.S election.  This is part of a  growing backlash here in Washington towards Silicon Valley.  Correspondent  Kristen Fisher reports.</p><p> KRISTIN FISHER, FOX CORRESPONDENT: The tech giants have long been admired  by congress, companies that embodies American innovations in job creation.   But then the 2016 election happened.  Big Tech could be in big trouble on  Capitol Hill.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED PARTCIPANT: I think frankly they need to come and testify  before congress because there's a lot we need to know about this.  </p><p> FISHER: Right now to no company is a bigger target than Facebook from  unwittingly allowing the spread of fake news during the campaign to  Facebook's most recent admission selling thousands of ads to groups backed  by the Russian government.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED PARTCIPANT: I am distressed it's taken this long to be  informed that the Russians had paid for at least $100,000 of ads designed  or tried to influence our electoral process.  </p><p> FISHER: Congressman Adam distressed that Facebook shared evidence with the  special counsel but not his committee, which is also investigating Russian  interference in the 2016 election.  Added up and you can see why analysts  say this may be the moment congress turns its back on big tech. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are entering an era of accountability because we have  system platforms that reached nearly every citizen in the country.  </p><p> FISHER: Last night Hillary Clinton called the weaponization of information  on social media --</p><p> HILARY CLINTON: One of the most serious challenges we face going forward in  politics.  </p><p> UNITENTIFIED MALE: And it's not just democrats.  Republicans worry about  the amount influence these companies exert over the American electorate,  anti liberal.  There's been almost no supervision.  </p><p> FISHER: Facebook once called himself a social utility.  Now the question  facing congress is whether it and the rest of Big Tech should be regulated  as one.  </p><p> MCMASTER: This is the equivalent of gigantic public utilities.  The  information has enormous power and I don't think even in a free society you  can have power hidden in secret controlled by a handful of billionaires.  </p><p> FISHER: Now we ask facebook officials if they will be willing to be  interviewed.  They declined to except to say the company will continue to  work with U.S authorities investigating these issues.  Bret?</p><p> BAIER:  Kristen, thank you. Back to the panel.  Katie, Charlie, Catherine.   Katie, what about this?  Is it turning of the tide?  There is always some  evil villain if you will, somewhere.  Is it Silicon valley?  </p><p> PAVLICH: I think the government has to shred very lightly when it comes to  their goals.  This is a very political hunch for people in Silicon Valley.   I'm not exactly sure what the government is trying to get out of Facebook  and these big tech giants.  These are serious questions here.  Not only  about Facebook's operations as a private company.  </p><p> And what they are allowed to do.  They are allowed to sell ads to whoever  they want.  They are providing a service whether the government should be  regulating batch.  And there is serious questions about their clients, so  to speak, and whether the government should be regulating what private  people say in private business on the internet.  </p><p> BAIER: Stew on the Facebook statement, we should point out says the vast  majority of ads run by these accounts, didn't specifically reference the  U.S presidential election.  Voting, or particular candidate rather the ads  and accounts appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political  messages across the ideological spectrum.  That was the Facebook Staement. </p><p> LUCY: Yes and I think as the reporting reached a (inaudible) was saying  this is a new moment of accountability for Facebook, and how is that going  to unfold.  There's law makers with a lot of question.  It seems like  they're either going to want to bring people in, could there be hearings,  could Mark Sufferberg have to come in and testify.  That's certainly  something that's being speculated on.  But I think the other issue we're  going to have to look at is, what might regulation look like.  And I don't  know if that there's been a consensus on it, and how that would work,  because there isn't a ton of president on how we do this.  </p><p> BAIER: And that is the question Charlie, I mean if you start going down the  regulation road and it seems like we're heading down that way.  For the  longest time Silicon Valley has said, you know they're bigger if you will  than Washington and didn't pay a ton of attention to inside Washington  Politics, but now they may have to.  </p><p> HURT: Yes and the whole thing sort of high lights, what I would call  another false failed promise, from the federal government, where congress  tried to regulate with (inaudible) sort of stuff with campaign finance  reform.  And what happened in the end was -- and remember you're mucking  with freedom of speech, you're mucking with people's ability to say what  they want to say, and put as much money as they want to behind a message in  order to express, to express yourself.  And so through campaign finance  reforms, we had this weird situation where average Americans are capped at  how much they can give, how much of their speech is allowed to be paid for,  to promote certain candidates and then Russia and these maul factors that  are from outside of the country, who aren't even -- who don't'-- none of  these laws pertain to.  You walk in and drop $100,000 worth of propaganda  on us.  And I think it is a very dangerous thing that we're dealing with,  and we have to deal with it very carefully.  And these lawmakers that talk  like there's simple answer through campaign finance reform, we have to be  skeptically of that.  </p><p> BAIER: Yes, and Katie the big thing there is the Russia part.  The outside  country that is investing in whatever they are investing in.</p><p> PAVLICH: And there is presentment in terms of the law allowing foreign  donations to campaigns in America.  So maybe they could use that in terms  of some of the regulation that there going to come up with.  But when it  comes to what they're regulating, it really just seems like they're going  after Facebook based on not a lot of evidence that Russia was actually  working with Facebook to promote Donald Trump, and not to mention Facebook  had nothing to do with people actually going to the polls and deciding  which candidate they were going to vote for.  So I quite frankly at this  point, see this as a little bit of a witch hunt for -- on capitol hill for  these government panels, these congressional committees who are trying to  find something on Russia, going after a private company, and private  citizens for simply exercising their free speech. </p><p> BAIER: Catherine, we don't know much about Bob Maulers investigation, but  we do know that he has information from Facebook that the Capitol Hill  committees don't.  </p><p> LUCY: I think we really do know here is that the investigation is heating  up.  There's been a lot of reports this week about the things they're doing  and it's not going away.  Whatever  happens with facebook, t hat's going to  keep moving, and it's going to keep being you know a concern for this White  House.</p><p> BAIER: And does it -- is there an end date?  Do they have an expiration  date enable to make their case on all these? </p><p> LUCY: Not that I'm -- I mean I think the investigation is continuing and a  lot of people are saying it could go on for quite awhile.</p><p> BAIER: Do you agree Charlie?</p><p> HURT: I think it's -- that is possible.  And I think that the longer it  goes on, I think it gets more and more complicated for democrats.   Politically because of course, you know as long as you keep pointing to  these smoking guns, but there's clearly not been any real hard evidence  that anybody within the Trump Campaign actually did anything to conclude  with Russia.  It makes all of this look like somewhat of a Witch Hunt. </p><p> BAIER: We will follow it all.  Panel, as always thank you.  That does it  for hour number one.  A special report a brand new hour, including a live  interview with the secretary of state.  Coming up after a quick break.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

I'm Bret Baier at the White House. We are following two breaking stories of two potential natural disasters. On the left of your screen you're looking at scenes from Mexico. A Magnitude 7.1 earthquake has rocked that nation on the 32nd anniversary of the massive 1985 quake that killed thousands. Right now the governor of one central Mexican state has at least 42 people are dead, but that number is expected to rise. The U.S. geological survey says the quake was centered about 76 miles southeast of Mexico City. We'll have a live report from our west coast newsroom shortly. On the right hand of your screen, Hurricane Maria is bearing down on the Caribbean right now. It is a category 5 hurricane with winds of 165 miles per hour. It is going over much of the same territory that was ravaged by Hurricane Irma just days ago. Puerto Rico is bracing for a major hit tomorrow. We'll have the latest from our Fox weather center, and we'll go to Puerto Rico where our own Steve Harrigan has just arrived on the scene. There is a third top story today, and it is out of New York, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>making his first speech to the United Nations General Assembly, and he made quite a first impression.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We meet at a time of both immense promise and great peril. The depraved regime in North Korea. Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. We must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil and terror. The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions. We cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: He was not shy in trying to rally the world against the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts is outside the U.N. tonight. Good evening, John. Quite a speech.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening to you. It was quite a speech, but it was exactly what the president intended. He came to Washington to be a disruptor, to shake things up, and that's what he did here at the United Nations in his speech this morning. The president was really reaching out to the United Nations to do something about North Korea. I mean, clearly, if North Korea does get a thermonuclear warhead that it can mount on an intercontinental ballistic missile and were to fire one towards the United States, well, that would unleash the total destruction that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>threatened this morning. But don't forget, he said if the United States is forced to defend itself, it will totally destroy North Korea. But that is not the president's preferred course of action. He has said that. His aides have said that. So what the president would really like to see is for the United Nations Security Council to come together to impose more tough sanctions on North Korea. For China and Russia to use their collective influence against North Korea. He slapped, as Nikki Haley said he would, the right people, and he hugged the right people, according to the U.S. delegation. And the president did reach out and gave a nice big hug to China and Russia, thanking them for their actions last week at the U.N. Security Council in passing these tough new sanctions. So, while people like Dianne Feinstein are criticizing the president, Bret, for using his United Nations speech as a platform to threaten war, the president sees it completely the opposite, saying those would be the ultimate consequences if something doesn't happen with North Korea. Now it's time for the U.N. to act. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Interesting to hear the ambassador from Venezuela say that he thought he was listening to Ronald Reagan in 1982 as a jab.</p><p>ROBERTS: You know, yeah -- Jorge Arreaza, he's the foreign minister of Venezuela, who's reacting to the president, calling out the Nicholas Medora regime, saying it wasn't a failed imposition of socialism. It was a faithful imposition of socialism. Calling it a corrupt dictatorship which has stolen democracy from the people of Venezuela. Well, Arreaza came back out, accused <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>of reigniting the cold war saying he didn't know if he was listening to Ronald Reagan in 1982 when he was talking tough about the Soviet Union or <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>in 2017. Note to the Venezuelan prime minister, if you're going to try to insult a Republican, don't compare him or her to Ronald Reagan. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: John, we'll see you at 6:00 PM. Thank you. We'll also have a live interview with secretary of state Rex Tillerson in the next hour. But first, let's get some analysis of the president's speech. Dana Perino is co-host of The Five, she is in New York, and Chris Stirewalt is <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>politics editor, he's in our Washington bureau. Dana, first to you, your thought on the speech.</p><p>DANA PERINO, THE FIVE CO-HOST: Well, presidential speeches in their maiden voyage to the United Nation General Assembly are often defining moments of a presidency. It only happens once a year. And I love that today <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>had the stage to himself. And that meant that -- not only was he there to give a speech, but there were some people that weren't there. I think it's good that President Putin and President Xi, Russia and China weren't there, so that he could have the stage and the world could listen to him. And if you see people on the right, even people who might consider themselves sort of moderate or the neo-cons, they love the speech.</p><p>The left seems alarmed but at least they have something, which is a defined foreign policy. They've been sort of wondering where is he going to fall on this or that. This was a speech that was really grand in scope. It didn't touch everything. It didn't hit everybody's words, like freedom and liberty. Maybe that wasn't in there as much. But he did talk about diplomacy and how the United Nations could be better. And I think that it was just well received, not just on the right but even in the middle. The left are going to be upset no matter what. But I would say that he really rose to the occasion today and gave a great speech.</p><p>BAIER: Now Chris, there were strains in here that you could hear from other Republican presidents, definitely. But there were Trumpian moments, the rocket man moment and other phrases. What's interesting is if you look at the scope of speeches though -- there, you see the joint address to congress, and then you see Saudi Arabia, then you see Warsaw, and that speech in Poland, the Afghan policy rollout, and then you have today. I mean, you're beginning to see the contours of Trump doctrine that is America first, but other countries can be independently able to handle their own issues too.</p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>POLITICS EDITOR: Yeah. And more humane and thoughtful version of the Trumpism. I thought of two speeches when I heard the president today. One was -- remember when he went to Mexico, went down there and it was not a good look. He was -- seemed very uncomfortable on the world stage. When he went down and he had his meeting with the Mexican president, and it looked like he came out on the short end of that. You can thrash that to today, where he was in command, and he was speaking authoritatively on subjects that were complex. He put forward -- I know it didn't sound nuanced, but there were nuanced points that he made throughout. And he put forward a basically straightforward American foreign policy that, as you said, could have come from the mouths of almost any Republican president.</p><p>BAIER: Yeah. Dana, the one thing that a lot of critics are focusing on is that North Korea threat. And they're leaving out the, if, part of that sentence. If North Korea and Kim Jong-un do this, then this is going to happen. I wonder what the message -- how it's going to be digested by countries like China.</p><p>PERINO: Well, one of the things you've also heard the administration say that they're out of road. You had McMaster, Haley, and Tillerson, all saying that over the weekend. So that's actually means that they are trying to send quite a clear message. Remember, that when a president speaks he's not only speaking to the people that are directly in front of him or even those that are on television. This was a message meant directly for Kim Jong-un, and I'm sure the president words are going to be parsed. And they were going to try to think, what does he mean by that?</p><p>And I actually think in this occasion, when it comes to presidential speeches, you do not have to wonder what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>would actually do. What he's saying is it was a strong warning. And it was enough also to get the attention of the world to say I'm actually not kidding. We are at the end of the road. And you're very survival, the people that you care about that you're here representing, it all comes down to us. So we will actively have to. And you're right. The important word is, if. It might be the first time that a world leader was given a nickname on stage at the United Nations. I don't know if it will become routine, but rocket man will never be the same.</p><p>BAIER: I didn't know what the over-under was about the marble being commented on at the U.N. But rocket man is surely going to get in. Chris, final thought here, what else struck your ear of this speech? There were some pointed criticism of the U.N. overall, but also some praise for what they can get done in the U.N. Security Council.</p><p>STIREWALT: So Trump's foreign policy has evolved rather rapidly over the course of his presidency. There's been considerable move towards -- as we talked about before, normal, a more normal, predictable American foreign policy than what we've been expecting. But his tough talk about North Korea before makes his challenge greater because every president has had to come to terms with, eventually, the fact that there is no good solution for North Korea, and there continues not to be one. Now, because of the way that Trump addressed the problem when he came into office. Status quo is not an option, and the North Koreans continue to escalate the situation. This one is intractable and he's going to need to pull off a Hail Mary on this.</p><p>BAIER: And Dana, there was a tease in here, and sometimes Trump speeches include that, like coming up next week, the Iran deal and whether there is going to be some change.</p><p>PERINO: There is a deadline of October 15 for the president to respond to congress. I think that if you look at Nikki Haley's speech from about two weeks ago at the American Enterprise Institute, she laid out pretty much what's going to happen, which is the United States would basically say this deal is not good. And congress, if you look at the law, the law congress passed, it's up to them to decide what to do going forward. And I think that the president will say that's what he expects them to do. So, now congress' list just got a little bit longer.</p><p>BAIER: All right. Dana, Chris, as always, thank you.</p><p>STIREWALT: You bet.</p><p>BAIER: This is a <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>alert. At least 42 people are now dead in a massive earthquake that struck central Mexico today. Correspondent Trace Gallagher is in our west coast newsroom tonight with the latest. Good evening, Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Before I show you more of these disturbing pictures of the earthquake destruction in and around Mexico City. I want to, kind of, give you an idea of the area. The 7.1 quake hit 70 miles south of Mexico City in the state of Puebla. We have not gotten a death toll in Puebla, but in the next-door state of Morelos, the governor there said the death toll is now at 42. In Mexico City, which is in the district of Mexico, two people have died. But if you look at these pictures of collapsed buildings and buckled bridges, the death toll will almost certainly rise. We know there are numerous people trapped inside some of these fallen buildings, but it's unclear if authorities are in contact with these people.</p><p>We are also getting word that dozens, if not hundreds of roads in and out of Mexico City are fractured and impossible, which means the recovery effort will be that much slower, especially in the very vulnerable areas outside of Mexico City where millions of poor people live. Thirty two years ago today, an 8.0 quake in Mexico City claimed at least 5,000 lives and thousands of buildings. Now the construction codes have become much stricter over the past three decades, but in the poorer areas there are hundreds of thousands of structures that have not been retrofitted or reinforce. So it's worth noting, Mexico City was built on a dry lake bed, so earthquake waves tend to echo and multiply the damage. Dry lake beds are also prone to liquefaction, which means the ground simply turns to water.</p><p>And in the outlying areas of Mexico where millions of poor people live, there are still many buildings, again, that are not reinforced. Even though the epicenter of this quake was 70 miles south of Mexico City, because it was 32 miles deep the damage will be felt over a very wide area. And for some context, today's quake in Mexico City was six times stronger than the 6.9 quake that hit San Francisco in 1989, 12 times stronger than the quake that hit Northridge, California, in 1994. And, of course, just last week, Bret, an 8.1 quake in the southwestern part of Mexico killed 58 people. The death toll of this Mexico City quake will certainly rise in the hours ahead, Bret.</p><p>BAIER: It's a big story. And we'll head back with breaking details as they become available. Trace, thank you. Who has the presidents back after his speech today at the U.N.? We'll find out after the break. Plus, health care, Russia, and the budget. A tick-tock of what's happening on Capitol Hill. And we're watching that big storm out there, Hurricane Maria. Next.</p><p>BAIER: Here at the White House today, we do this once a week. Meantime, just down Pennsylvania Avenue, congress has more than a full plate in the final 11 days of this fiscal year. Let's get more on that tonight from Fox senior Capitol Hill producer Chad Pergram. He's at the capitol this evening. Good evening, Chad.</p><p>CHAD PERGRAM, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER: Good evening.</p><p>BAIER: You know, we're talking about a lot of things, but really on the focus for a lot of folks is health care. We thought efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare might be finished, might be done. But now, they've been resurrected. Explain what's going on.</p><p>PERGRAM: This is like one of those old horror movies, Bret, where they think that they've killed off the monster, and yet, it's really alive and keeps coming around the corner. You can almost hear the creepy music. That's the take the Democrats say, because they thought they killed this off. There's going to be an effort to try to resurrect this by Republicans in the next week and a half. They've only have until September 30th to use this special process which avoids filibusters, and then it goes poof. It goes away.</p><p>Now, the thing about health care is that it's always been about the math. The average repeal and replace bill would always get in the upper 40's in the Republican side. They need at least 50 with Vice President Pence to potentially break a tie here. <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>and Susan Collins are on the fence. Collins says that this bill is more flawed than the last one. Rand Paul is a hard no. And so, what a lot of people are looking at, Lisa Murkowski, the Republican senator from Alaska. I have senior sources here telling me that all roads lead to her. And they would have to move this next week. Vice president Pence was at the capitol today talking to Republican senators about this, and he says it's all in. And they have to get this off the table so they can go to tax reform next, Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Yeah. And we should point out the Cassidy-Graham bill, essentially is a federalist version, pushes a lot of it to the states. So we're watching those votes. Next week, a big week, as you mentioned, for tax reform in congress.</p><p>PERGRAM: Right. And what we expect is Kevin Brady, the chairman of the ways and means committee from Texas, to put out some general specifics here. This has been the criticism from Republicans that they don't have enough specifics. People who've been riding this bill say, yes, you do. But we'll actually see what the proof is in the pudding when they put that together next week. Kevin Brady has not yet scheduled a markup section. That would be the signal to know that they're really getting somewhere in the committee. And again, Republicans have always been in general agreement on tax reform. The devil will be in the details on this and that's what's going to be hard. And that might be why they need Democrats, and they need to avoid a filibuster, and that's why they need a second special budget reconciliation package which neuters those filibusters.</p><p>BAIER: Yeah, a lot of moving parts up on the hill. The senate intelligence committee today heard from <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>personal attorney Michael Cohen as part of this Russian investigation, but it didn't really all go as well as planned.</p><p>PERGRAM: That's right. And that's because he leaked out some of the information that he was going to tell the committee. They didn't like that. Richard Burr, the chairman of the committee, Republican senator from North Carolina, indicated that you don't get to say things in public and then say other things in private. And so, just in the past 15 minutes or so here, they've asked Michael Cohen to appear in a public session on the 25th of October.</p><p>BAIER: OK. Chad Pergram with all the latest up on Capitol Hill. Chad, thanks. As we mentioned at the top of the show, Hurricane Maria tearing through the Caribbean tonight. It's going over a lot of the same territory already devastated, unfortunately, by Hurricane Irma. Let's get the latest on the storm's path from meteorologist Adam Klotz. He's in the Fox weather center in New York. Adam, Puerto Rico looks like it's in the target range.</p><p>ADAM KLOTZ, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>METEOROLOGIST: Yeah, it is. Overnight tonight, Bret, into tomorrow, really throughout the day tomorrow, that's what we're going to be looking at. Here it is. It's a big storm. Winds currently at 165 miles an hour. Gusting at times even up to 190, 185, right around there. So it's a powerful one. Going to continue to move that direction. As a category five storm, you are going to see this -- maybe weakened a little bit once it begins to run over the U.S.Virgin Islands, over Puerto Rico. But either way, a very powerful storm. Following there to a category four.</p><p>Really think early, early tomorrow morning to the U.S.Virgin Islands, throughout the day tomorrow. Folks in Puerto Rico are going to be dealing with it. We've saw a little bit of indecision on specifically where it's going to cross over the island, but either way it looks like the largest city, San Juan, is going to be heavily impacted with this. You see it eventually begin to turn just east of the Bahamas before it heads to the north.</p><p>So no concerns for Florida with this particular system, even though it's a system that is taking, at least, early on, a similar path to Irma. The big concerns, initially, are going to be these winds as they cross over yet the U.S.Virgin Islands, and then into Puerto Rico tomorrow. All of these getting hurricane force winds. That's what that is indicating, right in that area. What kind of winds that I'm talking about? Real quickly here, these are some of the wind gusts forecasted for you on Wednesday, getting up to about 120, 130, in some areas. This is going to be a real powerful storm, Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Adam, thanks. We'll track that. Back over to the United Nation now, Israel's prime minister gave <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>some serious backup today at the U.N. Senior correspondent Eric Shawn is there tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Let's give this as a toast to the potential, the great, great potential of the United Nations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIC SHAWN, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>SENIOR CORRESPINDENT: While the international spotlight was on <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>debut on the world body stage, other leaders echoed similar themes warning of threats to the global order. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu focus on Iran. Each year he has used the annual General Assembly platform to denounce Iran's nuclear ambitions. And did so, yet, again, today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAEL PRIME MINISTER: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>rightly called the nuclear deal with Iran, he called it an embarrassment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAWN: The Israeli leader is calling for the agreement, in his words, to be fixed or canceled. Saying revisions that left a restriction on Iran's nuclear program in ten years will certainly clear the way for a nuclear bomb.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NETANYAHU: Fix it or nix it. Nixing the deal means restoring massive pressure on Iran, including crippling sanctions until Iran fully dismantles its nuclear weapons capability. Fixing the deal requires many things, among them inspecting military and any other sites that is a suspect.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAWN: In a little noticed development, Netanyahu had a private sit down with Egyptian president, Abdel el-Sisi, an important bond with Israel's Arab neighbor that has also suffered numerous terrorist attacks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE: I would like to speak in favor of the nuclear agreement with Iran.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAWN: But in contrast to <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and Netanyahu's view, French president, Emmanuel Macron, praise the Iran deal, saying changing or scrapping it would be a mistake.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE: If we put together a solid, robust, and fare agreement with Iran that, will ensure that Iran does not obtain nuclear weapons. Renouncing it would be a grave error. It would be irresponsible for us to fail to uphold that agreement because this is good agreement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAWN: The Venezuelan foreign minister reacted sharply to <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>speech, saying he came to talk of war, treats the countries like his employees. It's a sad day for the world, he said. Tomorrow, there'll likely be more reaction. That's when it's Iranian president Hassan Rouhani's turn to speak before the green marble podium of the General Assembly. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Eric Shawn outside of the United Nation. Eric, thanks. Stay with us. Millions of people personal information compromised. Now Equifax is admitting it's not the first time. Plus, rough sailing for the U.S. navy, and now the top admirals are facing tough questions. Keep it here.</p><p>BAIER: Welcome back to the White House. The last few months have been anything but smooth sailing for the U.S. navy. A series of accidents has led to the deaths of 17 sailors and the replacement of several senior officers. Today, some of those still left were on Capitol Hill. National security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest tonight from the Pentagon. Good evening, Jennifer.</p><p>JENNIFER GRIFFIN, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Angry lawmakers directed tough questions at the navy's top officer, Admiral John Richardson, while family members of the victim sat behind him. Richardson admitted today that changes to training may be part of the problem. In 2003, the navy closed its surface warfare schoolhouse.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE: We thought we could achieve the aim and then train surface warfare officers, junior officers with a computer-based approach combined with on-the-job training at sea. And we found that was woefully inadequate.</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE: How in the world is a billion-dollar destroyer not know that there's a freighter closing in on it? I don't understand how this could possibly happen. And I've talked to Maine lobstermen, they're scratching their heads. They can tell when there's a flock of seagulls of their bowels. Don't we have sailors on the bridge with binoculars anymore?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFIN: Many of them, watch officers, are exhausted. The chief of naval operations admitted many sailors are working 100 hour weeks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>JOHN MCCAIN, </nameText></person>R-ARIZONA: I think I know what 100 hours a week does to people over time. When somebody is working 100 hours a week, over a period of time, they're going to make mistakes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFIN: For McCain, this is a personal one. One of the two destroyers that crashed was named for his father and grandfather. The Navy is down to two destroyers, badly needed right now in the Pacific, both capable of shooting down North Korean missiles.</p><p>The outgoing head of the Navy's surface forces has ordered all Navy ships to keep their automatic identification systems on while operating in busy shipping lanes. It will alert adversities to the location of the U.S warships, the system can force merchant ships on autopilot to change course. He also wants to get rid of five hour watches the Navy. Six Navy leaders have been fired since the collisions.</p><p>Rear admiral Charles Williams and Captain Bennett were terminated yesterday. One-third of all Navy Warship training certifications have expired, according to a government watchdog. Those ships are still sailing. Today the Navy Officers admitted ten of the USS Fitzgerald certifications had expired at the time of the crash.</p><p>BRET BAIER, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>HOST: A big story for the Navy. Jennifer Griffin live at the Pentagon. Thank you. New trouble tonight for Equifax, the credit card monitoring company was dealing with the fallout from a massive security breach. Now we are learning it was not the first. Equifax says the earlier incident was not related to the most recent breach which compromised the personal information of more than 140 billion Americans. Let's get more from Fox business network, good evening.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>HOST: Some industry watchers were speculating that hackers did the first tack and marked as a test for the bigger one that followed. Equifax saying that's not the case. After the March hack, Equifax hired an outside security firm which was retained to help with the May through July data set.</p><p>Equifax says they found no evidence these two hacks were related but its worth noting they have declined to comment. What cast longer of a shadow is there's evidence that Equifax executives should have realized how vulnerable their company was. This March hack casting doubts on claims of these three high level executives who said they had no knowledge of data breaches selling $2 million worth of stock this summer.</p><p>Some experts say if you believe three high ranking executives didn't know about one breach, it's less believable that they were unaware of two breachers. They have opened a criminal probe into Equifax. Earlier today, the Attorney General filed a suit against Equifax. This matches with New York Attorney General did. This is a sign of things to come. It's worth cyber experts say none of the data from this Equifax pack showed up anywhere. In other words, it's not for sale.</p><p>All of the social security numbers, dates of birth and some cases driver's license numbers. It's not on sale on the web. A lot of experts are saying the lack of commercial activity is near proof that state sponsored group is behind this big data breach. May through July Data breach affected 40% of Americans. The theory is a hack this big and sophisticated must be the work of a governmental organization. People can only protect themselves by only freezing their credit reports.</p><p>BAIER: It's a good thing to do. Thank you. Next up, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>threatens North Korea and blisters Iran and Venezuela. We will get reaction to his U.N speech from our panel. A little later, I will ask secretary of state Rex Tillerson out the fallout from the speech in the latest hot spots around the world.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The United States has great strength and patience. But if it's forced to defend itself or it's allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. No nation on Earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with Nuclear weapons and missiles.</p><p>BAIER: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>at the United States today, a speech that's getting a lot of reaction here and around the world. Democratic Senator saying this. Dianne Feinstein \"President Trumps Bombastic threat to destroy North Korea and his refusal to present any positive pathways forward on many global challenges we face are severe disappointments.</p><p>He aims to unify the world through tactics of intimidation but in reality, he only further isolates the United States.\" Republicans came out with positive tweets and reaction as well as a the Israeli Prime Minister with the big kudos. Lets bring the panel. Joining me at the White House, Catherine Lucey, White House reported for the associated press. From the Washington Bureau, Katie Pavlich. Charles Hart, opinion editor for the \"Washington Times\". It was bold, direct.</p><p>CATHERINE LUCY, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: He really put the world on Notice today. The president came in with a clear message. I've been watching his speeches throughout the year and the campaign, it was a continuation of a vintage and of a vision we've seen before. He revealed his frustration and the way he thinks, and it's the way he thinks that needs to deliver the message. This is the kind of rhetoric he's comfortable with. This is the way he wants to communicate. He wanted to make a stand today.</p><p>BAIER: We have seen these kinds of speeches before. I mentioned Saudi Arabia and Warsaw big speeches. It's a bit of a Trump doctrine that's forming here.</p><p>CHARLES HURT, WASHINGTON TIMES: Absolutely. I think a fairly consistent Trump Doctrine and a departure from the kind of speeches you would hear from President Obama a year ago when he was giving a similar speech before the U.N. He was talking about how America had to learn to subjugate its interests for other countries and just sort of rein in some of our freedom in order to make better, grander world.</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>went out there talking about how much more money we're going to invest in our military we've ever been, and then went names and terms of calling out enemies. And then went out to even criticize the U.N for completely failing in central parts of its mission. I look back and I cannot think of another -- even George W. Bush who got sort of criticized for being somewhat of a cowboy wouldn't have delivered a speech like this. This is tough stuff. I think a lot of people are thrilled to hear it.</p><p>BAIER: He mentioned Russia and China wants. I want to play this sound bite. Russia and China, the leaders, were not in the room at the time. Here is that part.</p><p>TRUMP: We must reject threats to sovereignty from the Ukraine to South China Sea. It's time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. I want to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions along with all the other members of the Security Council.</p><p>BAIER: He mentioned China, except for that once, they North Korea part was aimed at China specifically.</p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, AMERICAN JOURNALIST: This is going to be the next step here, we saw a lot coming from <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>today in terms of rhetoric and he's a man who expects results. We've had these votes on sanctions now. The Chinese and Russians have signed on, and the question going forward is going to be due this sanctions get enforced and does the U.N make sure those sanctions get enforced?</p><p>In terms of the general message and theme of the speech, he did reject globalism as Charlie was saying, of Americans giving some of their ideology to fit into this global -- international community. At the same time, did not reject international partnerships with different countries in terms of solving the big problems on North Korea and Iran. I think that goes to show he's very serious that it's an America first but not alone.</p><p>BAIER: What about the tease about the Iran Nuclear deal? It seemed like he suggested there'll be some sort of change.</p><p>LUCY: It's possible. He didn't tell us today what's going to happen. He had tough rhetoric today. He has been very clear. He was vocal last week that he's not happy with the deal. We're going to have to wait a little bit longer to see exactly what he does.</p><p>BAIER: I will be asking the Secretary of State about that next hour. Charlie, final thoughts on the broad messaging here. You've got North Korea, Iran, Venezuela, Radical Islamic terrorism, taking target to all of it.</p><p>HURT: Much like everything we've seen with we've seen with the Trump Presidency from his election, so much of it is a rejection of the previous administration and the previous administration strategic patience in North Korea or the Iran deal of Russia's entanglement, broadening entanglement come all over its region and interference in our election. This really is not only a domestic slap in the face to the previous administration. Lawyer seeing here is a stark departure from the Obama administration policies.</p><p>BAIER: Panel, standby. Washington Versus Silicon Valley, up next.</p><p>(COMMERICAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER: Gorgeous day here at the White House. The heads of Facebook are under new scrutiny tonight over how they may have unwittingly helped Russia's efforts to influence last year's U.S election. This is part of a growing backlash here in Washington towards Silicon Valley. Correspondent Kristen Fisher reports.</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX CORRESPONDENT: The tech giants have long been admired by congress, companies that embodies American innovations in job creation. But then the 2016 election happened. Big Tech could be in big trouble on Capitol Hill.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTCIPANT: I think frankly they need to come and testify before congress because there's a lot we need to know about this.</p><p>FISHER: Right now to no company is a bigger target than Facebook from unwittingly allowing the spread of fake news during the campaign to Facebook's most recent admission selling thousands of ads to groups backed by the Russian government.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTCIPANT: I am distressed it's taken this long to be informed that the Russians had paid for at least $100,000 of ads designed or tried to influence our electoral process.</p><p>FISHER: Congressman Adam distressed that Facebook shared evidence with the special counsel but not his committee, which is also investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Added up and you can see why analysts say this may be the moment congress turns its back on big tech.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are entering an era of accountability because we have system platforms that reached nearly every citizen in the country.</p><p>FISHER: Last night Hillary Clinton called the weaponization of information on social media --</p><p>HILARY CLINTON: One of the most serious challenges we face going forward in politics.</p><p>UNITENTIFIED MALE: And it's not just democrats. Republicans worry about the amount influence these companies exert over the American electorate, anti liberal. There's been almost no supervision.</p><p>FISHER: Facebook once called himself a social utility. Now the question facing congress is whether it and the rest of Big Tech should be regulated as one.</p><p>MCMASTER: This is the equivalent of gigantic public utilities. The information has enormous power and I don't think even in a free society you can have power hidden in secret controlled by a handful of billionaires.</p><p>FISHER: Now we ask facebook officials if they will be willing to be interviewed. They declined to except to say the company will continue to work with U.S authorities investigating these issues. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Kristen, thank you. Back to the panel. Katie, Charlie, Catherine. Katie, what about this? Is it turning of the tide? There is always some evil villain if you will, somewhere. Is it Silicon valley?</p><p>PAVLICH: I think the government has to shred very lightly when it comes to their goals. This is a very political hunch for people in Silicon Valley. I'm not exactly sure what the government is trying to get out of Facebook and these big tech giants. These are serious questions here. Not only about Facebook's operations as a private company.</p><p>And what they are allowed to do. They are allowed to sell ads to whoever they want. They are providing a service whether the government should be regulating batch. And there is serious questions about their clients, so to speak, and whether the government should be regulating what private people say in private business on the internet.</p><p>BAIER: Stew on the Facebook statement, we should point out says the vast majority of ads run by these accounts, didn't specifically reference the U.S presidential election. Voting, or particular candidate rather the ads and accounts appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum. That was the Facebook Staement.</p><p>LUCY: Yes and I think as the reporting reached a (inaudible) was saying this is a new moment of accountability for Facebook, and how is that going to unfold. There's law makers with a lot of question. It seems like they're either going to want to bring people in, could there be hearings, could Mark Sufferberg have to come in and testify. That's certainly something that's being speculated on. But I think the other issue we're going to have to look at is, what might regulation look like. And I don't know if that there's been a consensus on it, and how that would work, because there isn't a ton of president on how we do this.</p><p>BAIER: And that is the question Charlie, I mean if you start going down the regulation road and it seems like we're heading down that way. For the longest time Silicon Valley has said, you know they're bigger if you will than Washington and didn't pay a ton of attention to inside Washington Politics, but now they may have to.</p><p>HURT: Yes and the whole thing sort of high lights, what I would call another false failed promise, from the federal government, where congress tried to regulate with (inaudible) sort of stuff with campaign finance reform. And what happened in the end was -- and remember you're mucking with freedom of speech, you're mucking with people's ability to say what they want to say, and put as much money as they want to behind a message in order to express, to express yourself. And so through campaign finance reforms, we had this weird situation where average Americans are capped at how much they can give, how much of their speech is allowed to be paid for, to promote certain candidates and then Russia and these maul factors that are from outside of the country, who aren't even -- who don't'-- none of these laws pertain to. You walk in and drop $100,000 worth of propaganda on us. And I think it is a very dangerous thing that we're dealing with, and we have to deal with it very carefully. And these lawmakers that talk like there's simple answer through campaign finance reform, we have to be skeptically of that.</p><p>BAIER: Yes, and Katie the big thing there is the Russia part. The outside country that is investing in whatever they are investing in.</p><p>PAVLICH: And there is presentment in terms of the law allowing foreign donations to campaigns in America. So maybe they could use that in terms of some of the regulation that there going to come up with. But when it comes to what they're regulating, it really just seems like they're going after Facebook based on not a lot of evidence that Russia was actually working with Facebook to promote <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>and not to mention Facebook had nothing to do with people actually going to the polls and deciding which candidate they were going to vote for. So I quite frankly at this point, see this as a little bit of a witch hunt for -- on capitol hill for these government panels, these congressional committees who are trying to find something on Russia, going after a private company, and private citizens for simply exercising their free speech.</p><p>BAIER: Catherine, we don't know much about Bob Maulers investigation, but we do know that he has information from Facebook that the Capitol Hill committees don't.</p><p>LUCY: I think we really do know here is that the investigation is heating up. There's been a lot of reports this week about the things they're doing and it's not going away. Whatever happens with facebook, t hat's going to keep moving, and it's going to keep being you know a concern for this White House.</p><p>BAIER: And does it -- is there an end date? Do they have an expiration date enable to make their case on all these?</p><p>LUCY: Not that I'm -- I mean I think the investigation is continuing and a lot of people are saying it could go on for quite awhile.</p><p>BAIER: Do you agree Charlie?</p><p>HURT: I think it's -- that is possible. And I think that the longer it goes on, I think it gets more and more complicated for democrats. Politically because of course, you know as long as you keep pointing to these smoking guns, but there's clearly not been any real hard evidence that anybody within the Trump Campaign actually did anything to conclude with Russia. It makes all of this look like somewhat of a Witch Hunt.</p><p>BAIER: We will follow it all. Panel, as always thank you. That does it for hour number one. A special report a brand new hour, including a live interview with the secretary of state. Coming up after a quick break.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2017091901cb262</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHV-4MT1-JB20-G36P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6891\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 19, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Earthquakes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Storms</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Death</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United Nation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Insurance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Accidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>North Korea, John McCain, Navy, Destroyers, Threats against North Korea, Facebook, Washington</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Military &amp;

We haven't found a hub.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moreno is among the South Florida entrepreneurs, angel investors and board members of Endeavor Miami who have met with Innovation District developer Michael Simkins to discuss the project. Moreno, who also recently founded Next University, is among the more bullish: He said he would move his companies there. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">National players may share his enthusiasm, according to Simkins, who said he is in active discussions with large tech companies as potential anchor tenants. Already lined up, Simkins said, is Silicon Valley's , a well-known global venture fund for early-stage tech companies.</p><p>According to Simkins, the \"verbal understanding\" with 500 Startups calls for the organization to open an accelerator for top Latin American startups in one of the existing buildings on his property, possibly as early as this fall, with the goal of moving to a new tower when complete. Dave McClure, founder of 500 Startups, brought the company's  in March and said then  to expand to Miami. 500 Startups did not return calls seeking comment for this story. </p><p>To be sure, Simkins and his Innovate Development Group have been promoting the benefits of clustering large tech companies, mid-sized companies, startups, incubators, co-working and public spaces, services and cafes in a common area wired with super high speed Internet access as a way to accelerate the growth of a tech ecosystem -- an effort supported locally by the Knight Foundation and eMerge Americas, among others. Similar districts are found in Boston/Cambridge, New York, Seattle, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Las Vegas and one emerging now in downtown Detroit, as well as London, Barcelona, Berlin, Stockholm, Medellin and many other cities, according to a 34-page . Many are in walkable-bikeable urban downtown-midtown areas close to public transportation and contain housing. </p><p>\"The one thing Miami is lacking as a great city is the high-paying jobs that will allow us to evolve and elevate us overall. We visited innovation districts. We chose an architecture firm that has designed other innovation projects\" -- including recently Uber's new headquarters, said Simkins, in an interview in his Miami Beach office. He has not done a project of this scale before. </p><p>Simkins's proposal has faced a mountain of negative sentiment that would contain an observation deck, restaurants, retail, event space - and advertising in lights visible from the freeways. An electronic billboard in the sky is one of the nicer ways .</p><p>Simkins prefers \"a $250 million icon in the sky\" and said the tower could also be used for public service messaging - a dashboard for the city if you will. But he is also quick to point out that the media tower, called the Miami Innovation Tower, is just for the live-work-play district, which includes nine towers with 7.4 million square feet - more than half of that earmarked for office space.</p><p>But it's the overall concept, not the media tower, that interests the early tech supporters.</p><p>What distinguishes successful innovation districts are big tech anchors. Juan Pablo Cappello, a lawyer and co-founder of the AGP angel network, said having a place - with literally the space - to house large companies is what excites him most about the Innovation District plan for Miami. </p><p>\"If Miami can offer a place where enterprise tech companies like a Google, like a Facebook can have the space and resources to hire 100, 200, 500 people, that could be transformative,\" Cappello said. \"Companies like to cluster ... With a project like this you can get some momentum building.\"</p><p>Patrick McKenna, managing partner of HighRidge Global and an investor and entrepreneur who moved here a year ago from Silicon Valley, saw the power of momentum first hand. About six years ago, he said, San Francisco risked losing Twitter and other tech companies that were outgrowing their spaces. Meetings between the tech community and government ensued. Thanks to tax breaks and the rezoning of blighted sections of the city, the offices of Twitter, Square, Salesforce and Zynga lie within walking distance of one another. A district can attract both critical mass and tech anchor tenants, both critical to Miami's tech development, he said.</p><p>Colombia-born entrepreneur Juan Franco, who moved to Miami from Silicon Valley about a decade ago to launch social gaming publisher Mentez and since has started three more companies, met Simkins through YPO, the Young Presidents Network. He, too, is a supporter of the project.</p><p>\"What is missing here is an environment of entrepreneurs. That is what I like most about this project. ... It will bring people together - young people with new ideas, people with experience, hopefully [venture capitalists]  in the future. They are close together and that creates the interactions and the new ideas,\" said Franco.</p><p>Franco even likes the controversial tower: \"I believe he [Simkins] needs to create a statement, that's why I like the tower. It could be an icon of the city very related to technology and around the tower we can start to create that excitement.\"</p><p>Moreno said he spent some time recently talking about the importance of frequent collisions - entrepreneur-speak for interactions that happen in tech clusters that Franco spoke about - during a visit with CEO Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos and engineer of Las Vegas' innovation district. For Hsieh, moving his company headquarters and more than 2,000 employees there wasn't enough. Hsieh also funded and led a resurgence of a once-blighted downtown area that now includes multiple big companies, startups, services, weekly speaker series, regular conferences, cafes, bars and a dog park. </p><p>Matt Haggman, Miami program director of the Knight Foundation, said he has talked with Simkins about the project in concept but has not seen the plans.</p><p>\"I don't know the details of the proposal, but our focus at Knight Foundation is to expand Miami's entrepreneurial ecosystem, helping it become more diverse and broad-based. Any project that advances those goals would be good for the community,\" Haggman said. In the past three years, Knight Foundation has invested more than $10 million in Miami entrepreneurship programs. </p><p>Simkins plans to continue meeting with tech community leaders and wants to share plans and hear feedback at a future event by  Refresh Miami,  South Florida's largest tech meet-up organization. He is also taking part in  hosted by the Commercial Industrial Association about \"Miami's tech footprint\" on Thursday. Moreno, a member of the Miami board of the global entrepreneurship nonprofit Endeavor, said a tech community advisory board is being formed for the Miami Innovation District project.</p><p>\"The developer has spent a lot of time and money on what it will look like, but what will happen inside that venue is still to be defined. As a community, we still have an opportunity to shape this to be a really core part of the ecosystem. I think that is hugely exciting,\" said Moreno. </p><p>Simkins, born and raised in Miami Beach, has become increasingly involved in the tech community and helped fund donations to various organizations and conferences, including Black Tech Week, Start-Up City: Miami, 500 Startups PreMoney Conference, Smart City Startups and eMerge Americas. About a year ago, he joined the AGP network, a group of angel investors, and has invested in six local startups.</p><p>He said his involvement and \"brainstorming meetings\" have helped shape features of the project, such as adding more community space. The plans by New York-based SHoP Architects, which  new San Francisco headquarters, include a \"cloud layer\" - elevated public space with gardens and gathering places connecting all the towers. Also in the plans: parking lots near the I-95 exit so cars would be off the roads quickly to create a walk-bike culture, and 250- to 350-square-foot micro-unit apartments that would appeal to millenials. Nearly a third of the project - 2.4 million square feet - is earmarked for residential. </p><p>Though Simkins has already acquired the land needed, many political, legal and regulatory hurdles remain, particularly when it comes to the controversial media tower. Still, Simkins hopes to break ground next year. If that happens, he hopes to open the first buildings within three years and complete build out within seven. The developer said he is focusing first on securing a large anchor tenant. He then will move to middle-sized companies, startups, funding and support organizations in addition to 500 Startups, coworking spaces and university involvement. He's also looking at ways to activate part of the property before construction, such as locating 500 Startups there.</p><p>Yet, the Miami Innovation District is just one piece of a much larger picture of Miami as a technology hub of the Americas, Simkins says.</p><p>\"It is a component that is needed, along with a lot of the other things that are already taking shape,\" he said. \"But this provides the infrastructure ... We need the enterprise companies that will bring the employees. That will keep the talent here.\" </p><p>Follow Nancy Dahlberg on Twitter @ndahlberg.</p><p>PANEL DISCUSSIONMiami Innovation District developer Michael Simkins is set to appear on a Thursday lunch panel titled \"What is Miami's Tech Footprint?\" hosted by the Commercial Industrial Association of South Florida at Venture Hive in downtown Miami.

Jon Fortt, as we said, is in Las Vegas today at Dell Technologies World where he sat down with Michael Dell for an exclusive interview. Jon? JON FORTT: Carl, Dell Technologies World in large part about flexibility in this cloud enterprise area. We covered a lot of ground in our conversation, Michael Dell and I. One of the things we talked about, in the broader tech landscape - investment landscape, is founder control. And we just heard from Brian Chesky[6] earlier in the show. Airbnb expected to come to market, the public markets, with dual class, at least two classes of shares and founder control. And we've got Slack, expected to do something similar. Lyft already in the market with dual class shares. Michael Dell has control in the new public iteration of Dell, makes no apologies for it. Here is what he had to say about it. MICHAEL DELL: I can only speak from my own experience. A few days before our -- the 35th birthday of our company, and that is that I think having a long-term perspective and a long-term time horizon with which, you know, one approaches the development of a company can be very helpful. And, you know, last year we had 91 billion dollars in revenues. I started the company with $1,000 in my dorm room. And it's worked out pretty well. So, I'm, you know, the ultimate long-term investor. JON FORTT: We also talked M...nd consolidation. VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger joined us. Of course, only makes sense\u2014it's part of Dell Technologies. Dell Technologies owns 81% of VMware, though VMware's market cap is actually bigger through some kind of odd math. I asked him whether history is repeating itself in the enterprise tech cycle. We might actually see big tech companies buying other big tech companies now that the cloud is maturing. Short answer: yes. Take a listen. PAT GELSINGER: I think there is this explosion of innovation that's going on around, I call them the four super powers: cloud[7], mobility, AI and IoT. And these are just causing so many new companies, investment of capital, you know, major new IPOs that are going on. And I think with each sort of wave of these innovative cycles, there's an explosion of new companies but then there's also a consolidation of existing companies. Right? Because sort of the layers start to reform. So, up here, you've got a whole new set of them emerging in many of these areas. And in the existing areas, yeah, there is some level of consolidation. So, I do believe there will be some. Because fundamentally at the infrastructure layer, I believe customers want fewer, more strategic vendors. And as I talk to CIOs, I say, 'My job is every one of your engineers that's looking down the stack at infrastructure, I want to enable you to have them look up to the application and business differentiating services. And we're increasingly going to automate, standardize, cloud deliver those infrastructure layers, so you don't have to do it. We're doing it for you in an automated, AI standardized way. So, every one of your resources gets to look up to create business differentiating circumstances. So yes, I believe both of those will be true, consolidation and explosion of innovation. JON FORTT: Michael, assuming you agree, how long before we see that wave of massive consolidation? Not again just big companies buying small companies, but big companies buying big companies. Three years, five years? MICHAEL DELL: Well, certainly the combination of Dell EMC VMware - PAT GELSINGER: It is pretty big. MICHAEL DELL: -- was the biggest one yet to date. So, that was a pretty big one. And last year we added more than $11 billion in revenue, so that was some additional industry consolidation there for you. You know, look, I think customers, to Pat's point, have told us very clearly, they don't want to be systems integrators anymore. And they are looking for fewer partners. And bringing together a broad sense of capabilities across the infrastructure, security, client devices, the cloud, digital transformation, you know, enabling all those capabilities for customers, they would much rather work with one leading company than 20 or 30 smaller ones. JON FORTT: And this is a key theme for investors to really zero in on. Think about it, we heard it from Satya Nadella[8] at Microsoft and the way they're trying to work with enterprises to bring their legacy systems into the cloud. We've heard it from Ginni Rommety at IBM. Look, they're trying to gobble down Red Hat. That should close in the second half of the year. I also talked to Michael Dell about VMware. He's trying to make the case for VMware as kind of a lingua franca of the cloud era allowing companies to move their workloads, their data back and forth between the public cloud, private cloud, under this hybrid model. He says that's important. Take a listen. MICHAEL DELL: I think if you look at the rise of Kubernetes, you see clearly customers want to have an ability to move workloads around, not only among all the public clouds but into their own data centers, and into colos, and you know, out to the edge. And, you know, customers are concerned about sending all their data away to somebody else and then rendering it back. And so - JON FORTT: Not because of security but because of performance and convenience? MICHAEL DELL: I think it's going to be performance, cost, regulatory concerns, you know, latency for sure. So, a variety of concerns won't dictate that all your data and all your applications will end up in one place. The debate is over, Jon. It's no longer is it the private cloud or is it the public cloud? It's both. JON FORTT: And that's the story of the next three years that investors are going to be paying attention to. Can Amazon[9] adjust to -- not just Amazon, say Google, adjust to that legacy enterprise reality of holding customers' hands through regulatory issues, all of that, can they get that together faster than the likes of Dell and others, can move into the cloud era with flexibility, new technology and keep those enterprise customers. The battle is on from so many different directions in tech and that's a big theme here at Dell Technologies World that makes for a lot of competition and interesting alliances, guys.

We begin this show with some shocking news. Lying has been detected here in Washington. Mendacity, deceit, duplicitousness (ph), saying things that aren't true that here my arms is going up just telling you about this. But it happened. And we can prove it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, to be clear, news anchors didn't do it. News anchors don't lie. They're good people. Neither do professional cable news commentators, the one making millions on the side as lobbyists for foreign governments or big multinational corporations. Commentators always tell the truth. And that's why they, and their scrupulously honest news anchor friends are so utterly disgusted tonight, horrified really by what retired General Michael Flynn has done. Watch their stunned reactions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON LEMON, ANCHOR, CNN: Michael Flynn lied to the FBI. Flynn lied again and again and again to FBI agents. Just lied. Lies, lies, and more lies.</p><p>UNKNOWN: Hold on for just a minute about who is significant and who is not. Flynn lied. The tone should be when you speak to a prosecutor, you speak to the truth. Everybody lied.</p><p>LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, ANCHOR, MSNBC: Michael Flynn was betraying his country. Michael Flynn was betraying his office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: \"He lied,\" says Don Lemon and his news anchors friend. Lied, lied, lied. He's a very bad man, a lying kind of man. The worst kind. He could never work in television. For his crime of lying, Michael Flynn, the liar, may soon be locked away in a cell. That would keep the rest of us safe from his perfidious lies. That day can't come fast enough say the news anchors. Cuff him. America longs to breathe free once more.</p><p>Michael Flynn will be 60 years old next week. The Washington Post calculates he faces five years in prison. And let that be a warning to all of us. That's what happens to people who lie in Washington. Or does it?</p><p>From a golf course somewhere in Dubai, you can almost hear Bill Clinton chuckling softly. Lied under oath, still making $300,000 a speech; not everyone faces the same penalties for lying it turns out.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg came to Washington last spring to talk about Facebook that's the sole destroying social media company that has made him a multibillionaire. While in town, Zuckerberg stopped by the Congress where - and you might want to ask the kids to leave the room for this - he lied. Yep. Don't tell Don Lemon. But Mark Zuckerberg is a liar. Watch him do it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: This is the most important principle for Facebook. Every piece of content that you share on Facebook, you own and you have complete control over who sees it and how you share it. And you can remove it at any time.</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA: Are you willing to give me more control over my data?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Senator, as somebody who uses Facebook, I believe that you should have complete control over your data.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. You have complete control over your data. You control who sees it. You own it. That's really the most important principle at Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg says so with a completely straight face.</p><p>The only problem, it was a lie. Sorry, kids. According to a piece in the New York Times, Facebook does not actually allow you or anyone else to control your data. Not at all. In fact, they secretly hand over your data, personal data, to other big tech companies. Now, that decision has made Mark Zuckerberg even richer, adding on to the house in Hawaii probably. Unfortunately, he's had to lie in the process, including to Congress, and that's a crime.</p><p>As Robespierre once famously noted, \"You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.\" In this case, the eggs are your privacy. Apparently, Facebook allowed Microsoft search engine, Bing, to see the names of your Facebook friends without telling you about it. Facebook also allowed Netflix and Spotify to read your private messages without telling you.</p><p>Now, there's no evidence so far as of tonight that Facebook has a video camera hidden in your shower, but close enough. That's what Mark Zuckerberg lied about. Not a small lie, really.</p><p>What did Mike Flynn lie about? Well, according to the FBI, Flynn lied about conversations he had had with the Russian Ambassador Kislyak. You remember him. Flynn said that he and Kislyak had never talked about expelling Russian diplomats or about Russia voting in the U.N. on symbolic resolutions. And in fact, they had talked about both of those things. The feds already knew that because they were listening in, secretly.</p><p>There was nothing improper about the conversations that Flynn and Kislyak had. The crime was the lie. It's always the crime. Except when it's Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg can lie about something that affects hundreds of millions of Americans, but it's not really a big deal. Zuckerberg is not looking at five years in prison. Zuckerberg will not be sanctioned by Congress ever.</p><p>So what's the difference? Well, unlike Mike Flynn, Mark Zuckerberg is a hero to the American news media. He is who they want to be. He is richer than God. He went to Harvard. He wears T-shirts at work for real. He's for open borders. All the cool people like Mark Zuckerberg, even foreign countries.</p><p>For example, when the fascist government of China was looking for new tools to oppress its own population, you think they went to Mike Flynn for help? Yes, OK. I don't think so. Flynn is tough on china, old fashioned as he is. But Mark Zuckerberg, by contrast, was happy to help.</p><p>As they say at McKenzie, Mark Zuckerberg gets it.</p><p>Boy, what has Mike Flynn ever done for anyone? 33 years in uniform? That's not very innovative. Two lies told by two high-profile Americans. One is going to prison in late middle age. The other will be available for like 40 years for commencement addresses and awards dinners held in his honor. That's the tale of Mike Flynn and Mark Zuckerberg. It tells you everything.</p><p>Joining us now to break down what's happening to Mike Flynn is Harvard Law Professor Emeritus, Alan Dershowitz. He is the case of the book - the author, rather, of the book The Case Against Impeaching Trump.</p><p>Professor, thanks very much for coming on. So I read in The Washington Post this morning--</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Well, thank you so much.</p><p>CARLSON: --I read Mike Flynn described as a double agent in The Washington Post. And then I saw the Judge Sullivan yesterday describe him as someone who had committed treason. Is that the crime for which he is facing prison?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: No, not at all. And I'll get to that in a second. But Tucker, I just want to make one point. I hope you don't mind me making it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARLSON: --you will.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: I hate boycotts and attempts - I hope - I hate boycotts and attempts to censor free speech. I'm in favor of complete dialogue. But as such, I feel impelled to tell you that I, with due respect, disagree with the way you categorize mass immigration. That's all. I just want to say that. And--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's OK. And by the way--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Now--</p><p>CARLSON: I would expect that you would. We differ probably on a lot of issues. But the one issue that we--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --agree on and that--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --I respect you for is your willingness to say what you think in public to defend your views, to have a conversation and to let others decide which side is right. And that's something that I wish we were able to do a lot more of. But you're one of the only liberals who will come on this show.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: I completely agree.</p><p>CARLSON: Amen. So thank you very much for saying that.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Well, I agree. And I come on this show because I also have the right to say what I think and when I disagree with you, you'll allow me to say I disagree with you. And I do. I wish you hadn't used that language. Language like that was used to describe my grandparents and great grandparents and probably some of yours. So let's move on. But--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, actually, just in point of--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --I would hope you--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARLSON: --just in point of fact since you brought it up, as noted on Monday--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: That was in the context of a conversation with an elected official in Tijuana about the filth--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --of his city and he was complaining about how dirty it had become, which was a byproduct of the policy decisions pushed by the American left and I noted.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: I understand that.</p><p>CARLSON: There's a lesson there perhaps for us. So I'm not - and I would never describe people as inherently dirty. I don't think that they are and pro-people. That's one of the reasons I'm against abortion, strongly. But anyway, whatever. The point is, I wish we were able--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Yes - no. I'm glad you - I'm glad you cleared that up. Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Well, I mean, I think it was clear and I think that the people who are mischaracterizing it are always welcome on the show to talk it through and to hear my side and I will hear their side because, again, this is one of the last forums in America for open conversation.</p><p>Anyway - but tell me that--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: That's very fair. Let's--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Well, I mean, that--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --turn to Flynn. Yes. OK.</p><p>CARLSON: --that's how I feel. I'm not afraid to defend what I think, obviously.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: No, I - look, I agree. Neither am I. On the Flynn issue, look, there's a big issue. I've been teaching this for 50 years. Should it really ever be a crime to lie when you're not under oath?</p><p>I think you can make a very, very strong case that before you can be convicted of a crime for lying, you should have to raise your hand, put it on a Bible, look to your God or look to your ethics, have a solemn moment where you look the person in the face and swear to him that you are going to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</p><p>That's so different from when two guys evade the usual procedures, come in to try to hang out with you and be chummy, say you don't need a lawyer, we just want to ask you a couple of questions--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --and then trap him by asking him questions that they already knew the answer to and had videotapes and audiotapes that could make it clear that they are only asking him the question in order to give him an opportunity to lie.</p><p>So I really do think that we have kind of three criteria. Just lying politically. It's done too often. I hate it. But it's done too often. It's not a crime. Second, lying only to government officials, which is a crime but probably shouldn't be a crime, or if it is, it should be a misdemeanor, not a serious felony akin to raising your right arm and swearing under oath that you will tell the truth.</p><p>There's too much lying in Washington and there are too many, as you point out correctly, double standards about who is prosecuted for lying. In civil cases, people lie in depositions all the time. And they're never prosecuted. I tried to bring a case recently against people who lied. Prosecutors laugh at you. Lying in a deposition? That's like gambling in Casablanca. It's just done all the time, and it's tragic that it's done.</p><p>I testified in front of Congress about this. When they were going after Bill Clinton and trying to - and impeaching him for his lies. I had a whole session where I talked about how many lies are told in how many different places and how selective they are in going after people. That's one of the problems of not requiring an oath. It gives you the opportunity to selectively pick people to prosecute for lying not under oath.</p><p>CARLSON: We're almost out of time, but - it is a lie to - I mean - rather, it is a crime to lie to federal investigators, but it's not a crime for them to lie to you. Why?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: No, not only that. The Supreme Court has said it's perfectly OK for police and FBI agents to lie to you, and that happens every day. You'll have two people who they suspect of a crime. They'll bring one person in and say, oh, by the way, your buddy just ratted you out, just turned you in, you're going to get executed unless you tell us that he did it too. And of course, it was a total lie. They say the same thing to the other person. And the Supreme Court has said, lying by FBI agents, lying by federal officials is permissible and (inaudible) it's done all the time.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: But if you lie back to them, then it's a crime. It's even a crime, the Supreme Court has said, to deny that you did something. If somebody asks you, \"Did you do something, a crime?\" --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --and you say, \"No,\" and you did, you've doubled your punishment by now lying about whether you committed a crime. The irony about Flynn is he wasn't lying about committing a crime. He did nothing wrong. What he did was perfectly legal. I'm still scratching my head and trying to figure out why he lied. What was his motive?</p><p>CARLSON: I was thinking - I saw a little--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Is it possible he misremembered?</p><p>CARLSON: I mean - and by the way--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Yes. Now, he did say the court--</p><p>CARLSON: --why were the feds spying on the incoming national security advisor? Is that normal? I don't know. Professor, thank you very much.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: No. Comey told us. Comey said, look, I could get away with it, Comey said.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I don't know. I don't think you should be spying on members of your own executive branch unless there's a good reason to do that. But anyway, thank you very much. Good to see you.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Right. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, yesterday, the President accused the Mueller investigation of intentionally and illegally deleting 19,000 text messages, those are between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. The DOJ claims the text messages were not erased intentionally, but they were lost due to technical errors.</p><p>Speaking of lying, is that a lie or is it true? Tom Fitton, the President of Judicial Watch, joins us tonight. Really simple. It's hard to believe that the Department of Justice would lie about something like that. Are they? Are they not?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: Well, we don't know the truth. We've got these two categories of text messages. These are the text messages the DOJ had or the FBI had back when Page and Strzok were not members of the Mueller special counsel team. And there was a gap in terms of capturing those text messages. And there were about 19,000--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>FITTON: --that were subsequently recovered supposedly by the IG. And then they go work for Mueller's operation. They get removed because of these text messages that they were sending around, talking about insurance policies against Trump and being pro-Hillary. And IG asked for their phone because he wants to look at more of these text messages. And their phones have been wiped, have been reset. Unrecoverable.</p><p>We don't know how many text messages were erased by the Mueller special counsel operation. They remove him for - Page - removed Strzok specifically for misconduct and bias that was found in his text messages, but no one looks at his text messages from the time he was in the Mueller special counsel operation, the most sensitive investigation the Justice Department has been involved in in decades. Unbelievable.</p><p>CARLSON: Investigations are, by definition, supposed to be preserving evidence. So - I mean, do you think it's plausible that the Mueller people might have been implicated in erasing evidence? I mean, that - that just seems like shocking.</p><p>FITTON: Well, you know what? Manafort was accused of withholding evidence. You know what they did. They didn't know for sure whether he was. They issued a search warrant and they raided his home with guns drawn and no warning.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I noticed.</p><p>FITTON: That's not what happens when the government erases evidence on purpose or accidentally. And it's so bad, the special counsel. You see in the Flynn investigation questions about how that investigation was handled? Now we have these missing text messages and the Strzok--</p><p>CARLSON: It really makes you wish we had elected officials in this country who could protect the rest of from us these abuses. I wonder where they are.</p><p>FITTON: We need a special counsel for the special counsel.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. How about just someone who'd like (ph) to do something? Thank you very much.</p><p>FITTON: You're welcome.</p><p>CARLSON: Mark Zuckerberg hid the truth from Congress. He lied. So lawmakers planning to do anything about his lies? We'll ask an incoming senator about that next.</p><p>CARLSON: So Mark Zuckerberg just got caught lying in front of Congress about selling the deeply private data of more than 200 million Americans, probably your data by the way, is one of the more flagrant abuses big tech has committed recently. There's a long list of those. But it's hardly the only abuse. All the major tech platforms have colluded to silence opinions they don't like and to destroy the people who express those opinions. They've done this in the open. We've watched it happen.</p><p>Google employees secretly, meanwhile, discussed hiding conservative websites and search results because they're just not legitimate. Facebook's founding president Sean Parker admitted that his company created an intentionally addictive product, like cigarettes, that could destroy children's brains, which is exactly, of course, what it's done.</p><p>It all adds up to a terrifying picture, a serious menace to this country, to a democracy, to our mental health - check the numbers on that sometime - to our cohesion as a nation. It's a real threat, obviously. And everybody knows it. How is Congress doing protecting us from any of these threats? Good question. They're not. And they're not even trying.</p><p>And if you're wondering why they're not trying, the answer might be, in part anyway, the outgoing Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Ryan didn't seem interested in reigning in the tech companies in any way, when he was the third most powerful man in America. In part, he was too busy preventing a wall from being built on our southern border to get to the tech question.</p><p>But there might have been other reasons we're just speculating now. Now that he is leaving the Congress and moving to the private sector, will Paul Ryan be taking any money from any of the big tech firms like Facebook or Google or Twitter? Seemed like an interesting question. Obvious, but then no one has asked. So we called Paul Ryan's office today and we asked that question. We haven't got an answer yet. And it's 8:20 p.m. Eastern. We're going to keep checking and get back to you when they respond.</p><p>So the leadership of the House, of course, is changing. Democrats are taking over. But the Republicans still hold the Senate. Is there any interest, will there be, in reigning in tech at all?</p><p>Josh Hawley was just elected Senator. He's a Republican from Missouri, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Mr. Senator Elect, thanks very much for coming on. Now, I'm not going to force you to join me in pointing fingers as to why this hasn't been done up to this point. But I will ask the question, do you think the Congress, maybe on a bipartisan basis going forward, will recognize that maybe there's some tweaking that needs to be done in the government's relationship with these companies?</p><p>JOSH HAWLEY, REPUBLICAN, MISSOURI SENATOR-ELECT: Tucker, thanks for having me on. And I certainly hope so. I mean, it's time that Congress got serious about protecting the privacy, the data, the personal confidential information of hundreds of millions of Americans.</p><p>And to see this report today that Facebook has allowed these big tech companies, Amazon, Microsoft, Spotify, Netflix to have access to the personal information of users, after Facebook said that it would not allow, it would not give away users' personal data is really extraordinary. And look, it's time Congress did something about it. It's time the FTC did something about it.</p><p>CARLSON: So you often hear people say, well, Congress can't actually act to regulate these companies because its members are too old and they don't understand technology. I'll freely admit I don't understand technology at all. I try not to participate in it at any level. And yet the abuses are so obvious to me. That doesn't really seem like a very good excuse.</p><p>HAWLEY: Well, listen, I mean, what needs to happen here is, number one, Facebook promised the FTC in 2011 in a binding consent decree. They said that they would not share personal, private confidential data of users without the users' consent. Well, Tucker, it looks like that's exactly what Facebook is doing though that they are sharing that data in order to make a profit, as you pointed out, without users' consent.</p><p>So, number one, FTC needs to enforce the consent decree, they need to investigate right now, whether or not Facebook has violated it. Number two, Congress needs to investigate and Congress needs to take steps to protect the privacy of Americans. They need to make sure that Americans own their own data and can protect it.</p><p>CARLSON: So this is a little bit out of left field. But I think that maybe there is a connection. The CDC just came out with the suicide numbers. And suicide is one of the leading causes of death in this country. Its incidences dramatically increased. And all of this in middle age, people tragically have killed themselves recently. There is a lot of speculation and some evidence that there's a connection between increased use of tech products and this tragic epidemic of suicide.</p><p>Is anyone, do you think, at the federal level going to look a little more closely into this? It seems like something worth investigating.</p><p>HAWLEY: I think it is worth studying. And I think that - look, it's time that we asked about the role of big tech in our lives. I mean, we've--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HAWLEY: --you've talked a lot about the sweetheart deals big tech gets from government. I think it's time we took a hard look at those. I think it's time we looked at the effect big tech is having on our personal lives, on our families, on our schools, on our society. These are major companies. Many of them monopolies. They make billions of dollars a year. There've never been more powerful companies in the history of the world, and they need to be held accountable.</p><p>CARLSON: Man! I wish I was in Missouri, so I could vote for you again. I just - I - it's so nice to hear an elected official say that. I'm sorry to suck up. I couldn't control myself.</p><p>Mr. Hawley, thank you very much.</p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, we're just hours away right now from a potential government shutdown. The debate is over funding for the border wall. Will there be a border wall or has that dream died? Details ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: Insulin is one of the basic human hormones. Everyone needs insulin to live. Diabetics, though, can't properly produce insulin. And that's a big question in this country. In America right now, about 6 million people are dependent on daily injections of insulin just to survive. It's a great thing that they can do that.</p><p>Almost a century ago, scientists discovered how to produce synthetic insulin. The scientists who did that sold the patents to a university for $1. Their goal was to help humanity. That's why they did that. It turned out to be one of the great health advances in human history.</p><p>Diabetes went from almost a certain death sentence to a manageable illness, as it is today or was. Cheaply available insulin has extended the lives of tens of millions of people. But in this country, that seems to be changing.</p><p>For the last 20 years or so, the price of insulin has been rising very quickly, even relative to other healthcare costs. When top insulin drug, NovoLog, rose in price 353 percent in just 14 years. It isn't exceptional, and the growth has shown no signs of stopping.</p><p>Thanks to these price hikes, millions of diabetics have started rationing their insulin, gambling with their health and likely shortening their lives to save money. They have no choice. A cheap medicine that your parents took for granted increasingly is inaccessible to poor Americans though, already the group most likely to suffer from diabetes in the first place, as you probably know.</p><p>Now, there are a lot of reasons this is happening. One is the drug companies keep slightly tweaking their formulas so their drugs never leave patent and generic competitors can't enter the market to compete with them.</p><p>Another reason is rigid FDA regulations, which make it costly and time- consuming to put a new insulin drug in the market. Pharmaceutical companies use legal challenges to deter competition too. Of course, most companies do do that. And of course, greed plays a role, too. That's a word that we don't use very often, but it's still real. One of the deadly sins for good reason.</p><p>But whatever the reasons for the spike in prices of insulin, it's a huge problem. And you would think it's something that Congress and the administration would consider taking action on. There are some things they could do. Maybe they should streamline an FDA approval process or adjust patent law. Maybe they should subsidize the creation of a generic insulin brand.</p><p>After all, we spend billions subsidizing solar panels and electric cars that only rich people can afford. So before you give us a lecture about the market, remind us we already do that, we're not sure what the best solution is, we're not scientists or economists. What we can say, this is a real problem that Congress appears to be ignoring.</p><p>In October, the President pitched a plan to lower drug prices across the board by tying Medicare reimbursement to drug prices in other countries. Republicans in Congress and on K Street hate that idea. Pharma's bottom line is important to them and it's not an unimportant factor. On the other hand, Americans are dying from easily treated illnesses. That's a factor too.</p><p>On the left, well, they don't care at all, at least not right now. Their top priority is impeaching Trump, not collaborating with Trump on healthcare. And just like on tech and other issues, they're easily distracted by superficial political signaling.</p><p>Sanofi is one of the companies now driving up insulin prices, but that company won some degree of credibility from the left last summer and is now insulated from criticism. Why? Well, because when Roseanne Barr blamed Ambien for the ill-advised tweets that got her show cancelled, that company tweeted that racism is not a side effect of its medications. And the left roared with laughter. Go, big pharma. If only they'd roar about that company extorting poor Americans with life-saving drugs!</p><p>But just like on immigration or trade or automation or global warming, it doesn't matter when America's most vulnerable are hurt. It's actual most vulnerable people no one in D.C. and particularly no one on the left seems to care. Not their constituency.</p><p>So the debate over the wall on our southern border continues. Not a single person in Washington, D.C. is in favor of building a wall on our southern border. They are terrified, not because they think it won't work but because they believe that it might work and it might clamp down on a source, a ready source of cheap labor. And that's why they're willing to risk a government shutdown rather than give a mere $5 million to start the wall.</p><p>So what is going to happen? Is the wall over? Will the administration surrender on this? And what will the voters on either side think of the outcome?</p><p>Dana Perino hosts The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino, of course, the most popular person here on Fox, and she joins us tonight.</p><p>DANA PERINO, ANCHOR, THE DAILY BRIEFING, FOX NEWS: All right.</p><p>CARLSON: So, Dana, super simple question. Are the people who want the wall more inflamed than the people who don't want the wall? Which is the more, in the end, when it's all over, a more powerful, politically powerful constituency?</p><p>PERINO: I don't think that President Trump has fair weather fans. OK?</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PERINO: I think that he has strong supporters who understand that he came in strong. Right? He said the wall is going to get built. Mexico is going to pay for it. Like, I never actually really took that seriously in terms of Mexico paying for it.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PERINO: I do think that--</p><p>CARLSON: It's hard to see.</p><p>PERINO: --he has not done a good enough job persuading people as to the merits why we need border security even though - look, he's tried, but I do think that an Oval Office address on immigration security would actually be very helpful. He could even use visual aids. There's clearly plenty to show.</p><p>And I think that there might just be a way for him to have a nod to reality, that he's not going to get this wall funding before the end of the year. I think they're going to try to figure out a way just to punt this for a little bit. Now he's going to have a different Congress to work with.</p><p>A lot of those members of Congress had already voted for border security, which included fencing, which some people might call a wall. But Democrats, many of them who are running for President, right, they're already in Congress, they - it's like they can't say the \"W\" word. They can't say wall. They can call it all sorts of other things, not a wall. I think that there might be some room for compromise here in the New Year on the merits.</p><p>On the politics of it, well, the Democrats continue to push back against him, maybe say, oh ha ha, we proved you wrong. Mexico didn't pay for it. You didn't get your wall. Maybe. But there is a political cost to that as well. People understand that our borders need to be secure and that we can be a welcoming, opening, compassionate people at the same time.</p><p>CARLSON: So, for whatever reason, and I do think it's a little more complicated just Democrats opposing it. I think a lot of Republicans in the current Congress aren't fully (inaudible) with the wall either. But whatever reason, hard - impossible to get this through the Congress. What if the President said he just announced we're pulling our troops out of Syria? What if he were to say I'm going to take the cost savings from that and apply it to border security?</p><p>PERINO: Well, he could say that, but it's just not how the system works, right? There is money that's programmed for certain places. Now, the President has said to his cabinet, look for any money that we could put towards this virtual wall, border security, wall, whatever you're going to call it.</p><p>The Democrats are going to fuss about that because of just technical reasons of reprogramming money is not that easy to do. But the President has two opportunities coming up in the next six weeks. He'll have the State of the Union. That's a big moment. Right? That's all eyes on the President.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PERINO: And then he has about a week later or two weeks later, he introduces his budget proposal. A budget proposal is a prioritizing document, and the President could say this is what I agree with. I just feel like, if his fans are concerned that there's not going to be a wall, just give him a minute. OK? Give him a chance. This is not a sprint. Right? He's in a marathon.</p><p>CARLSON: And so you think it is - and you know the system very well. You think it is at least possible that in the next two years some kind of wall like structure appears on the southern border?</p><p>PERINO: Well, I just feel like - will there be - is it - this is what I think is possible. It is possible to get border security funding and for construction to start. Will that look like a steel wall all across the border? Probably not. But no matter what President Trump gets in terms of border security, he is going to call that a wall. He's a good communicator. He'll figure that out. And no matter what, the Democrats will say, see, we told you he wasn't going to get that steel wall all across the border.</p><p>But border security, I think, it's a real possibility. I think there're some new members of Congress that are going to be willing. And remember this. For Republicans and Democrats, there's a lot more veterans that just got elected to Congress. They're used to working with the other side. There are responsible people who care deeply about the national security of the United States.</p><p>The President ought to invite all of them, Democrats, Republicans, bring that coalition together. I think that's a really exciting group. And that America has a lot to be proud of that these veterans have come back and are still willing to serve their country just in a different way.</p><p>CARLSON: Interesting idea. Thank you.</p><p>PERINO: I know I'm too optimistic for you--</p><p>CARLSON: No--</p><p>PERINO: --a little bit, but--</p><p>CARLSON: No, I don't know - look, I've - trust me. This week, I'm looking for all optimism possible and you are an ever-flowing well-spring of optimism.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: OK. I'm glad I could be here.</p><p>CARLSON: You are loved. Thank you. Dana Perino--</p><p>PERINO: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --great to see you.</p><p>Well, American forces are withdrawing from Syria. Is that good for the world? And more important, is it good for the United States? We will unpack its effects after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: The war on Christmas doesn't exist. Obviously, you know that. You'd have to be a moron or some kind of Fox News viewer to think there is a war on Christmas. And nowhere does the war on Christmas exist less than in China. And that's why the city officials of Langfang, China, have issued a total ban on the public celebration of Christmas.</p><p>That means no Santa, no lights, and obviously no nativity scenes. The ban is part of a wider religious crackdown in China, which has seen churches shut down and believers thrown in prison, a story that hasn't gotten a ton of ink here among our elites who are getting rich in China.</p><p>In Russia, by contrast, and even in Assad's Syria, millions of Christians will happily celebrate Christmas without any oppression. Just take a guess which countries are despised and which ones they suck up to? And maybe that's why they love China's government so much. Beijing does what Washington wishes it could do, with efficiency too.</p><p>I want to bring you a major development tonight in America's involvement in Syria despite heavy pressure from Saudi Arabia and thousands of foreign policy experts. The United States has managed to avoid a full intervention into the Syrian civil war, praise God. Now we're finally pulling out the forces we do have there. Trace Gallagher has more on that.</p><p>Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR, FOX NEWS: Tucker, the decision to remove the entire U.S. force from Syria, more than 2,000 troops, surprised virtually everyone, and it officially marked the end of an extended ground campaign against ISIS. Moments ago, the President released this video statement. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've been President for almost two years and we've really stepped it up. And we have won against ISIS. We've beaten them and we've beaten them badly. We have taken back the land. And now it's time for our troops to come back home.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said this does not end the global campaign against ISIS, quoting, \"The United States and our allies stand ready to re-engage at all levels to defend American interest whenever necessary.\" But Trump ally and frequent advisor Senator Lindsey Graham does not like it. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LINDSEY GRAHAM, REPUBLICAN, SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR: ISIS is more likely to come back because I don't agree with the President that they're defeated in Syria and Iraq.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Florida Senator Marco Rubio called the decision a major blunder. Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor John Bolton have both argued that a precipitous withdrawal in Syria would embolden ISIS to make a comeback. But Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul applauded the move and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the U.S. pull-out will not impede his country's ability to defend itself against regional threats.</p><p>Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, great to see you tonight. Thank you for that.</p><p>David Tafuri is an attorney. He is the former Obama campaign advisor, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>David, thanks so much for coming on. So, moments like this are so instructive because they really do divide the world into very clear sectors. You sort of know who's on whose side. And I find this interesting because the rationale has changed. So people are saying we need to fight ISIS. But that's not really the point. The point is to counterbalance Russia and Iran. And I'm wondering, is that, A, our goal; B, achievable with 2,000 troops in Syria? Like, what actually is the goal? I'm losing track.</p><p>DAVID TAFURI, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Well, there are a couple of goals. It's to fight ISIS. It's also to push back on Iran and on Russia. So what's stunning about this development is all of President Trump's foreign policy advisors and top military advisors were against this decision. And he reversed them today, suddenly, in a rash decision.</p><p>Now, the reason why we should stay in Syria--</p><p>CARLSON: But that's the same people who think we should stay in Afghanistan, right? So how much--</p><p>TAFURI: Some of them are the same, but--</p><p>CARLSON: How much credible--</p><p>TAFURI: --the reasons are different.</p><p>CARLSON: --ones you say that you have?</p><p>TAFURI: The reasons are different.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>TAFURI: Look, Trump's top policy advisor said we are going to stay in Syria until we have, one, rolled back Iran. That has not happened. Two, defeated ISIS. We have made major progress in fighting ISIS, but we haven't fully defeated them. I was in Iraq in October. Nobody on the ground in Iraq tells me we defeated ISIS there. And ISIS is even stronger in Syria, still. Moreover, all of Trump's policy advisors have said we should stay in Syria until there's a political solution in Syria. None of those three things have happened.</p><p>Wouldn't it be a wrong thing if the most--</p><p>CARLSON: Wait, wait, wait. Can I just--</p><p>TAFURI: Go ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: --stress maybe another option? So there wasn't actually ISIS in Syria when the Assad government controlled the whole country. Christians and other religious minorities, a lot of them, lived in relative peace. Now they're hunted down and murdered. Why wouldn't it just be the simplest, most elegant best solution for everyone involved if Assad managed his entire country again?</p><p>TAFURI: Because you are ignoring the history and the development of the revolution in Syria. The revolution in Syria happened--</p><p>CARLSON: It just happened a few years ago.</p><p>TAFURI: It happened organically. It began in 2011. It happened organically. Right? And so Syria was an authoritarian state before that with tons of oppression. Maybe Christians were OK there.</p><p>CARLSON: Is there a non-authoritarian--</p><p>TAFURI: But - but people were not - people were--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARLSON: Is there a non-authoritarian state in that region other than Israel?</p><p>TAFURI: There are - there are less authoritarian states--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARLSON: Oh. But they're all authoritarian--</p><p>TAFURI: --much less authoritarian--</p><p>CARLSON: --there. I mean, Jordan is an authoritarian state. Criticize the king and see what happens. So, like, that's the rule in the region.</p><p>TAFURI: You cannot compare Jordan to Syria.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not attacking--</p><p>TAFURI: You can't even compare Syria to Iraq--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not attacking Jordan.</p><p>TAFURI: --which has a fledgling democracy.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm just saying authoritarian justifies nothing. They're all authoritarians, OK?</p><p>TAFURI: OK. But the point is that this was an organic revolution. The U.S. didn't start this revolution. It's started by the Syrian people, majority of whom are Sunni Arabs. They stood up against Assad. He chose - rather than to reconcile with them, he chose to mow them down and slaughter tens of thousands of innocent, peaceful protesters.</p><p>CARLSON: No--</p><p>TAFURI: That's how the revolution began.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm sure Assad's - OK. But I'm not defending Assad's character. I'm merely saying--</p><p>TAFURI: Good.</p><p>CARLSON: --from the perspective--</p><p>TAFURI: You shouldn't.</p><p>CARLSON: Why would I?</p><p>TAFURI: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not Syrian. I don't work for Assad. I'm an American. And I want to know what's best for us. And if you're worried about the chaos and the huge refugee problems caused by this civil war and by the emergence of ISIS, again, abetted by the civil war, then why wouldn't you long for the days where Christians could live unmolested in Syria under this authoritarian Assad? I'm totally missing it. What am I missing?</p><p>TAFURI: Because that's not - this is actually going to cause more refugees. OK? Northern - northeastern Syria right now is secure. The reason it's secure is because of the great work by our U.S. Special Forces working with the SDF, the local Syrian and moderate Sunni forces on the ground. They've secured it. And actually, there are less refugees coming from that area. The people can say they're peaceful.</p><p>CARLSON: How did the--</p><p>TAFURI: They're not getting bombed by Assad.</p><p>CARLSON: How do the Christians - how do the Christians do?</p><p>TAFURI: And when we pull out - when we pull out, it's going to cause a massive wave of Syrian refugees again because forces are going to go in and slaughter the forces--</p><p>CARLSON: Forces.</p><p>TAFURI: --that we've been working with on the ground.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>TAFURI: Assad's forces, Iranian, Shia militia forces, and possibly even Russian forces.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. And so we're responsible for that?</p><p>TAFURI: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: Because - so this is halfway around the world. We have crises like Venezuela's collapses right there. Mexico has probably as many murders as Syria - I mean, not close. Right? So, like, I'm just saying there are a lot of things going on. But we have a moral obligation to keep 2,000 American troops in this country around the world because why - I'm honest - I'm confused.</p><p>TAFURI: Well, first of all, we are there already, and it's successful. So why pull out? We also do have some obligations of forces on the ground--</p><p>CARLSON: It's successful in what way?</p><p>TAFURI: --who fought - who fought bravely alongside us. Moreover, this is going to impact us because ISIS will come back. And if we don't have forces on the ground to monitor ISIS and to continue to combat ISIS, ISIS will come back. ISIS are sworn enemies of the U.S. they want to kill Americans.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>TAFURI: And when they become stronger in Syria, they'll strike out against America again.</p><p>CARLSON: So by this--</p><p>TAFURI: So your viewers should worry about their own security because of this decision.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, there are a lot of reasons to worry about our own security. A lot.</p><p>TAFURI: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: Many. And our mental health and our economy and our healthcare system. A lot of things to worry about. But by the standards that you've just articulated, like we're never going to leave there or Afghanistan or any place that we've been for more than eight months. So--</p><p>TAFURI: I wouldn't say we're never going to leave there. But we have to see progress on the ground. We have to see full defeat of ISIS.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>TAFURI: We have to see political progress--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARLSON: --why shouldn't--</p><p>TAFURI: --towards a peaceful revolution in Syria, and there ought to be a democracy in Syria.</p><p>CARLSON: Why shouldn't--</p><p>TAFURI: And then we can leave.</p><p>CARLSON: Who cares about - who cares about that? The question--</p><p>TAFURI: Who care about democracy?</p><p>CARLSON: --that I care about - I'll tell you what I care about is what's happening to the Christians there? Like, nobody cares. I don't understand. We invade Iraq. There's a huge Christian community. They'll leave.</p><p>TAFURI: Well, who are killing the Christians in Iraq?</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not--</p><p>TAFURI: ISIS.</p><p>CARLSON: Look--</p><p>TAFURI: ISIS.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course--</p><p>TAFURI: And--</p><p>CARLSON: --but I'm just saying why don't we make it an explicit--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TAFURI: Islamic militants are killing Christians in Iraq.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not defending ISIS. I'm just saying, why don't we make it an explicit concern of the United States to protect the Christians? But we don't.</p><p>TAFURI: It is an explicit--</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's not--</p><p>TAFURI: --concern.</p><p>CARLSON: --actually. We don't let in the end.</p><p>TAFURI: It's an explicit concern of the U.S. to protect all minorities in Syria and Iraq, of which the Christian minorities are important part of.</p><p>CARLSON: They don't seem that important to anyone here.</p><p>Anyway, I hope they are. They're important to me. I'm glad they're important to you. David, thank you.</p><p>TAFURI: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Democrats claim to care about sexual harassment so very much because they're good people. Are they prepared to expose the congressman who paid your tax dollars in hush money to accusers? It's a pretty simple question. We'll see if we can get an answer after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, a couple weeks ago, we invited on this program a New York Senator named Kevin Parker. He's a Democrat. He wants to force all citizens in the State of New York to turn over their social media password so their accounts can be inspected by the thought-police before they buy guns. If they say something naughty or threatening, no gun.</p><p>Well, given that, we are fascinated to see the news yesterday. Parker grew angry with the Republican spokeswoman and tweeted her this. \"Kill yourself.\" Well, the irony, obviously, pretty obvious. So Parker apologized. He said he was making a donation to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. We applaud that.</p><p>Has he learned the lesson embedded in his own actions though? The anti-gun bill he sponsored is still pending in the New York State legislature. We've asked Senator Parker to come back on this show, so he can explain once again why he ought to have the power to police thought-crime on Twitter. And by the way, should he, given his record, be allowed to own a gun? So far, his office has not responded, but we'll keep asking him. Great guest. Happy to have him again.</p><p>Well, yesterday in Capitol Hill, the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sharply attacked a proposal to give the President an immigration enforcement slush fund, as he called it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHARLES SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Leader McConnell proposed the bipartisan Senate DHS bill, which has $1.6 billion for border security plus a $1 billion slush fund for the President to use for his radical immigration agenda. I called Leader McConnell and told him we would not accept their $1 billion slush fund and that our offers to fund the government remain.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Now, don't take those words the wrong way. The problem Democrats have is with border enforcement. They don't have a problem with slush funds. Congress loves slush funds. That's why, for years, Congress has maintained a slush fund at your expense, taxpayer funded, to pay off people who accuse members of Congress of sexual harassment.</p><p>The Democrats will control the House in just a couple of weeks, of course. Are they going to end the slush fund, and more to the point, will they tell us who has been protected by it? What are the names?</p><p>Penny Nance is President of Concerned Women for America, and she joins us tonight.</p><p>Penny, thanks so much for coming on. This seems like a very simple ask. Why shouldn't the public know who got paid with our money to settle these claims?</p><p>PENNY NANCE, PRESIDENT, CONCERNED WOMEN FOR AMERICA: That's a very good question. And by the way, Concerned Women for America members sent thousands of petitions asking Congress to tell us. Over 20 years, 264 cases, $15 million of our money was paid out to hide what members of Congress did. And these weren't little allegations. These were big things.</p><p>We have the case of Blake Farenthold, who sexually harassed his communications director, shared his sexual fantasies about her. And when she dared to complain, he fired her. And you remember Eric Massa and his groping of young men, and then he called it tickle fights. He had to pay out $100,000--</p><p>CARLSON: And that was--</p><p>NANCE: --of our money.</p><p>CARLSON: --taxpayer money.</p><p>NANCE: Taxpayer money. And we were never paid back. Now, Congress did just pass a piece of compromise legislation, but it doesn't do anything about what we just talked about. It doesn't pay back at all the slush fund that the taxpayers paid out to cover up the wrongdoing by members of Congress.</p><p>CARLSON: Now, do we know the identities of the people on whose behalf these payments were made?</p><p>NANCE: No. And we have tried - and by the way, FOIA doesn't apply to Congress. Isn't that interesting?</p><p>CARLSON: So - I mean, so Nancy Pelosi, who obviously is America's chief defender of women--</p><p>NANCE: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --I mean, she's told us that many times, and a deeply good person. She's told us that too. She'll be in charge of this.</p><p>NANCE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: So she can release these names if she wanted to. Will she want to? Will she?</p><p>NANCE: We have called on her to do that, but she so far has chosen to shield her colleagues. She even went as far as to say that John Conyers was a hero and a great American. Remember John Conyers was hosting meetings with his staff in his underwear and was caught on film - caught on video on a airline flight on the taxpayer dollars watching porn. This is the guy, by the way, who used to be the Judiciary Committee Chairman who had oversight over pornography. So you can't make this stuff up.</p><p>The new bill does make some improvements and, going forward, requires restitution. But it's not clear whether or not even then we'll know for sure, going forward, who actually is the perpetrator. Because in the new legislation, you just disclose the office. It could be the Chief of Staff, it could be the legislative director, it could be the Press Secretary, and like they're going to write off their boss. So--</p><p>CARLSON: Or it could be the member.</p><p>NANCE: It could be the member. And that's the point. We've got to have more transparency. And we're not going to let this go.</p><p>CARLSON: You will keep pushing?</p><p>NANCE: I will keep pushing. I promise.</p><p>CARLSON: Penny Nance, it seems like a simple ask.</p><p>NANCE: It does.</p><p>CARLSON: I hope you get it.</p><p>NANCE: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks very much.</p><p>NANCE: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, as you've seen tonight, permanent Washington cares a great deal about protecting the way things are, the status quo. It's great for them. They get richer and they can believe, and many do believe that they are morally superior to you. And that's why they destroy anyone who threatens the status quo.</p><p>Mike Flynn, for example, is being destroyed. Mark Zuckerberg lied as well. He's being protected because he's on the side of the people who make those decisions. That's also why the establishment has become so obsessed with crushing free speech. It's getting harder and harder for them to win arguments on the merits.</p><p>The best option then is to keep the arguments from being made at all. When you can tar your opponent as immoral, as a bigot, you don't have to defend you own position, you can just do what you want. You can also ruin the lives of anyone who gets in your way and feel good about it.</p><p>How do we get to this place? So that entire story is in a new book called Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution. Christmas is coming. This tells a story that might rattle you, but it's still worth knowing. You can find it on our website, tuckercarlson.com.</p><p>That's about it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn enemy - and we mean it - of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink; the show that says what we think is true, whether they like it or not.</p><p>Good night from Washington. Sean Hannity is next. Dan Bongino is sitting in--</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

We begin this show with some shocking news. Lying has been detected here in  Washington. Mendacity, deceit, duplicitousness (ph), saying things that  aren't true that here my arms is going up just telling you about this. But  it happened. And we can prove it. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, to be clear, news anchors didn't do it. News anchors don't lie.  They're good people. Neither do professional cable news commentators, the  one making millions on the side as lobbyists for foreign governments or big  multinational corporations. Commentators always tell the truth. And that's  why they, and their scrupulously honest news anchor friends are so utterly  disgusted tonight, horrified really by what retired General Michael Flynn  has done. Watch their stunned reactions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON LEMON, ANCHOR, CNN: Michael Flynn lied to the FBI. Flynn lied again and  again and again to FBI agents. Just lied. Lies, lies, and more lies. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Hold on for just a minute about who is significant and who is not.  Flynn lied. The tone should be when you speak to a prosecutor, you speak to  the truth. Everybody lied. </p><p>LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, ANCHOR, MSNBC: Michael Flynn was betraying his country.  Michael Flynn was betraying his office. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: \"He lied,\" says Don Lemon and his news anchors friend. Lied, lied,  lied. He's a very bad man, a lying kind of man. The worst kind. He could  never work in television. For his crime of lying, Michael Flynn, the liar,  may soon be locked away in a cell. That would keep the rest of us safe from  his perfidious lies. That day can't come fast enough say the news anchors.  Cuff him. America longs to breathe free once more. </p><p>Michael Flynn will be 60 years old next week. The Washington Post  calculates he faces five years in prison. And let that be a warning to all  of us. That's what happens to people who lie in Washington. Or does it?</p><p>From a golf course somewhere in Dubai, you can almost hear Bill Clinton  chuckling softly. Lied under oath, still making $300,000 a speech; not  everyone faces the same penalties for lying it turns out.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg came to Washington last spring to talk about Facebook  that's the sole destroying social media company that has made him a  multibillionaire. While in town, Zuckerberg stopped by the Congress where -  and you might want to ask the kids to leave the room for this - he lied.  Yep. Don't tell Don Lemon. But Mark Zuckerberg is a liar. Watch him do it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: This is the most important principle for  Facebook. Every piece of content that you share on Facebook, you own and  you have complete control over who sees it and how you share it. And you  can remove it at any time. </p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA: Are you willing to give me more control  over my data? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Senator, as somebody who uses Facebook, I believe that you  should have complete control over your data.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. You have complete control over your data. You control who  sees it. You own it. That's really the most important principle at  Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg says so with a completely straight face. </p><p>The only problem, it was a lie. Sorry, kids. According to a piece in the  New York Times, Facebook does not actually allow you or anyone else to  control your data. Not at all. In fact, they secretly hand over your data,  personal data, to other big tech companies. Now, that decision has made  Mark Zuckerberg even richer, adding on to the house in Hawaii probably.  Unfortunately, he's had to lie in the process, including to Congress, and  that's a crime. </p><p>As Robespierre once famously noted, \"You can't make an omelet without  breaking a few eggs.\" In this case, the eggs are your privacy. Apparently,  Facebook allowed Microsoft search engine, Bing, to see the names of your  Facebook friends without telling you about it. Facebook also allowed  Netflix and Spotify to read your private messages without telling you. </p><p>Now, there's no evidence so far as of tonight that Facebook has a video  camera hidden in your shower, but close enough. That's what Mark Zuckerberg  lied about. Not a small lie, really. </p><p>What did Mike Flynn lie about? Well, according to the FBI, Flynn lied about  conversations he had had with the Russian Ambassador Kislyak. You remember  him. Flynn said that he and Kislyak had never talked about expelling  Russian diplomats or about Russia voting in the U.N. on symbolic  resolutions. And in fact, they had talked about both of those things. The  feds already knew that because they were listening in, secretly. </p><p>There was nothing improper about the conversations that Flynn and Kislyak  had. The crime was the lie. It's always the crime. Except when it's Mark  Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg can lie about something that affects hundreds  of millions of Americans, but it's not really a big deal. Zuckerberg is not  looking at five years in prison. Zuckerberg will not be sanctioned by  Congress ever. </p><p>So what's the difference? Well, unlike Mike Flynn, Mark Zuckerberg is a  hero to the American news media. He is who they want to be. He is richer  than God. He went to Harvard. He wears T-shirts at work for real. He's for  open borders. All the cool people like Mark Zuckerberg, even foreign  countries. </p><p>For example, when the fascist government of China was looking for new tools  to oppress its own population, you think they went to Mike Flynn for help?  Yes, OK. I don't think so. Flynn is tough on china, old fashioned as he is.  But Mark Zuckerberg, by contrast, was happy to help. </p><p>As they say at McKenzie, Mark Zuckerberg gets it. </p><p>Boy, what has Mike Flynn ever done for anyone? 33 years in uniform? That's  not very innovative. Two lies told by two high-profile Americans. One is  going to prison in late middle age. The other will be available for like 40  years for commencement addresses and awards dinners held in his honor.  That's the tale of Mike Flynn and Mark Zuckerberg. It tells you everything. </p><p>Joining us now to break down what's happening to Mike Flynn is Harvard Law  Professor Emeritus, Alan Dershowitz. He is the case of the book - the  author, rather, of the book The Case Against Impeaching Trump. </p><p>Professor, thanks very much for coming on. So I read in The Washington Post  this morning--</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Well, thank you so much. </p><p>CARLSON: --I read Mike Flynn described as a double agent in The Washington  Post. And then I saw the Judge Sullivan yesterday describe him as someone  who had committed treason. Is that the crime for which he is facing prison? </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: No, not at all. And I'll get to that in a second. But Tucker, I  just want to make one point. I hope you don't mind me making it. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARLSON: --you will.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: I hate boycotts and attempts - I hope - I hate boycotts and  attempts to censor free speech. I'm in favor of complete dialogue. But as  such, I feel impelled to tell you that I, with due respect, disagree with  the way you categorize mass immigration. That's all. I just want to say  that. And--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's OK. And by the way--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Now--</p><p>CARLSON: I would expect that you would. We differ probably on a lot of  issues. But the one issue that we--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Right. </p><p>CARLSON: --agree on and that--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Yes. </p><p>CARLSON: --I respect you for is your willingness to say what you think in  public to defend your views, to have a conversation and to let others  decide which side is right. And that's something that I wish we were able  to do a lot more of. But you're one of the only liberals who will come on  this show. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: I completely agree.</p><p>CARLSON: Amen. So thank you very much for saying that. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Well, I agree. And I come on this show because I also have the  right to say what I think and when I disagree with you, you'll allow me to  say I disagree with you. And I do. I wish you hadn't used that language.  Language like that was used to describe my grandparents and great  grandparents and probably some of yours. So let's move on. But--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, actually, just in point of--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --I would hope you--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARLSON: --just in point of fact since you brought it up, as noted on  Monday--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Yes. </p><p>CARLSON: That was in the context of a conversation with an elected official  in Tijuana about the filth--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Right. </p><p>CARLSON: --of his city and he was complaining about how dirty it had  become, which was a byproduct of the policy decisions pushed by the  American left and I noted. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: I understand that. </p><p>CARLSON: There's a lesson there perhaps for us. So I'm not - and I would  never describe people as inherently dirty. I don't think that they are and  pro-people. That's one of the reasons I'm against abortion, strongly. But  anyway, whatever. The point is, I wish we were able--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Yes - no. I'm glad you - I'm glad you cleared that up. Yes. </p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Well, I mean, I think it was clear and I think that the  people who are mischaracterizing it are always welcome on the show to talk  it through and to hear my side and I will hear their side because, again,  this is one of the last forums in America for open conversation. </p><p>Anyway - but tell me that--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: That's very fair. Let's--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Well, I mean, that--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --turn to Flynn. Yes. OK. </p><p>CARLSON: --that's how I feel. I'm not afraid to defend what I think,  obviously. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: No, I - look, I agree. Neither am I. On the Flynn issue, look,  there's a big issue. I've been teaching this for 50 years. Should it really  ever be a crime to lie when you're not under oath? </p><p>I think you can make a very, very strong case that before you can be  convicted of a crime for lying, you should have to raise your hand, put it  on a Bible, look to your God or look to your ethics, have a solemn moment  where you look the person in the face and swear to him that you are going  to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. </p><p>That's so different from when two guys evade the usual procedures, come in  to try to hang out with you and be chummy, say you don't need a lawyer, we  just want to ask you a couple of questions--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --and then trap him by asking him questions that they already  knew the answer to and had videotapes and audiotapes that could make it  clear that they are only asking him the question in order to give him an  opportunity to lie. </p><p>So I really do think that we have kind of three criteria. Just lying  politically. It's done too often. I hate it. But it's done too often. It's  not a crime. Second, lying only to government officials, which is a crime  but probably shouldn't be a crime, or if it is, it should be a misdemeanor,  not a serious felony akin to raising your right arm and swearing under oath  that you will tell the truth. </p><p>There's too much lying in Washington and there are too many, as you point  out correctly, double standards about who is prosecuted for lying. In civil  cases, people lie in depositions all the time. And they're never  prosecuted. I tried to bring a case recently against people who lied.  Prosecutors laugh at you. Lying in a deposition? That's like gambling in  Casablanca. It's just done all the time, and it's tragic that it's done. </p><p>I testified in front of Congress about this. When they were going after  Bill Clinton and trying to - and impeaching him for his lies. I had a whole  session where I talked about how many lies are told in how many different  places and how selective they are in going after people. That's one of the  problems of not requiring an oath. It gives you the opportunity to  selectively pick people to prosecute for lying not under oath. </p><p>CARLSON: We're almost out of time, but - it is a lie to - I mean - rather,  it is a crime to lie to federal investigators, but it's not a crime for  them to lie to you. Why?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: No, not only that. The Supreme Court has said it's perfectly OK  for police and FBI agents to lie to you, and that happens every day. You'll  have two people who they suspect of a crime. They'll bring one person in  and say, oh, by the way, your buddy just ratted you out, just turned you  in, you're going to get executed unless you tell us that he did it too. And  of course, it was a total lie. They say the same thing to the other person.  And the Supreme Court has said, lying by FBI agents, lying by federal  officials is permissible and (inaudible) it's done all the time. </p><p>CARLSON: Right. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: But if you lie back to them, then it's a crime. It's even a  crime, the Supreme Court has said, to deny that you did something. If  somebody asks you, \"Did you do something, a crime?\" --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --and you say, \"No,\" and you did, you've doubled your  punishment by now lying about whether you committed a crime. The irony  about Flynn is he wasn't lying about committing a crime. He did nothing  wrong. What he did was perfectly legal. I'm still scratching my head and  trying to figure out why he lied. What was his motive? </p><p>CARLSON: I was thinking - I saw a little--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Is it possible he misremembered? </p><p>CARLSON: I mean - and by the way--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Yes. Now, he did say the court--</p><p>CARLSON: --why were the feds spying on the incoming national security  advisor? Is that normal? I don't know. Professor, thank you very much. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: No. Comey told us. Comey said, look, I could get away with it,  Comey said.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I don't know. I don't think you should be spying on members  of your own executive branch unless there's a good reason to do that. But  anyway, thank you very much. Good to see you.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Right. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, yesterday, the President accused the Mueller investigation  of intentionally and illegally deleting 19,000 text messages, those are  between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. The DOJ claims the text messages were  not erased intentionally, but they were lost due to technical errors. </p><p>Speaking of lying, is that a lie or is it true? Tom Fitton, the President  of Judicial Watch, joins us tonight. Really simple. It's hard to believe  that the Department of Justice would lie about something like that. Are  they? Are they not?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: Well, we don't know the truth. We've  got these two categories of text messages. These are the text messages the  DOJ had or the FBI had back when Page and Strzok were not members of the  Mueller special counsel team. And there was a gap in terms of capturing  those text messages. And there were about 19,000--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. </p><p>FITTON: --that were subsequently recovered supposedly by the IG. And then  they go work for Mueller's operation. They get removed because of these  text messages that they were sending around, talking about insurance  policies against Trump and being pro-Hillary. And IG asked for their phone  because he wants to look at more of these text messages. And their phones  have been wiped, have been reset. Unrecoverable. </p><p>We don't know how many text messages were erased by the Mueller special  counsel operation. They remove him for - Page - removed Strzok specifically  for misconduct and bias that was found in his text messages, but no one  looks at his text messages from the time he was in the Mueller special  counsel operation, the most sensitive investigation the Justice Department  has been involved in in decades. Unbelievable. </p><p>CARLSON: Investigations are, by definition, supposed to be preserving  evidence. So - I mean, do you think it's plausible that the Mueller people  might have been implicated in erasing evidence? I mean, that - that just  seems like shocking. </p><p>FITTON: Well, you know what? Manafort was accused of withholding evidence.  You know what they did. They didn't know for sure whether he was. They  issued a search warrant and they raided his home with guns drawn and no  warning. </p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I noticed. </p><p>FITTON: That's not what happens when the government erases evidence on  purpose or accidentally. And it's so bad, the special counsel. You see in  the Flynn investigation questions about how that investigation was handled?  Now we have these missing text messages and the Strzok--</p><p>CARLSON: It really makes you wish we had elected officials in this country  who could protect the rest of from us these abuses. I wonder where they  are.</p><p>FITTON: We need a special counsel for the special counsel.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. How about just someone who'd like (ph) to do something? Thank  you very much. </p><p>FITTON: You're welcome. </p><p>CARLSON: Mark Zuckerberg hid the truth from Congress. He lied. So lawmakers  planning to do anything about his lies? We'll ask an incoming senator about  that next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: So Mark Zuckerberg just got caught lying in front of Congress  about selling the deeply private data of more than 200 million Americans,  probably your data by the way, is one of the more flagrant abuses big tech  has committed recently. There's a long list of those. But it's hardly the  only abuse. All the major tech platforms have colluded to silence opinions  they don't like and to destroy the people who express those opinions.  They've done this in the open. We've watched it happen. </p><p>Google employees secretly, meanwhile, discussed hiding conservative  websites and search results because they're just not legitimate. Facebook's  founding president Sean Parker admitted that his company created an  intentionally addictive product, like cigarettes, that could destroy  children's brains, which is exactly, of course, what it's done. </p><p>It all adds up to a terrifying picture, a serious menace to this country,  to a democracy, to our mental health - check the numbers on that sometime -  to our cohesion as a nation. It's a real threat, obviously. And everybody  knows it. How is Congress doing protecting us from any of these threats?  Good question. They're not. And they're not even trying. </p><p>And if you're wondering why they're not trying, the answer might be, in  part anyway, the outgoing Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Ryan didn't seem  interested in reigning in the tech companies in any way, when he was the  third most powerful man in America. In part, he was too busy preventing a  wall from being built on our southern border to get to the tech question. </p><p>But there might have been other reasons we're just speculating now. Now  that he is leaving the Congress and moving to the private sector, will Paul  Ryan be taking any money from any of the big tech firms like Facebook or  Google or Twitter? Seemed like an interesting question. Obvious, but then  no one has asked. So we called Paul Ryan's office today and we asked that  question. We haven't got an answer yet. And it's 8:20 p.m. Eastern. We're  going to keep checking and get back to you when they respond.</p><p>So the leadership of the House, of course, is changing. Democrats are  taking over. But the Republicans still hold the Senate. Is there any  interest, will there be, in reigning in tech at all? </p><p>Josh Hawley was just elected Senator. He's a Republican from Missouri, and  he joins us tonight. </p><p>Mr. Senator Elect, thanks very much for coming on. Now, I'm not going to  force you to join me in pointing fingers as to why this hasn't been done up  to this point. But I will ask the question, do you think the Congress,  maybe on a bipartisan basis going forward, will recognize that maybe  there's some tweaking that needs to be done in the government's  relationship with these companies?</p><p>JOSH HAWLEY, REPUBLICAN, MISSOURI SENATOR-ELECT: Tucker, thanks for having  me on. And I certainly hope so. I mean, it's time that Congress got serious  about protecting the privacy, the data, the personal confidential  information of hundreds of millions of Americans. </p><p>And to see this report today that Facebook has allowed these big tech  companies, Amazon, Microsoft, Spotify, Netflix to have access to the  personal information of users, after Facebook said that it would not allow,  it would not give away users' personal data is really extraordinary. And  look, it's time Congress did something about it. It's time the FTC did  something about it.</p><p>CARLSON: So you often hear people say, well, Congress can't actually act to  regulate these companies because its members are too old and they don't  understand technology. I'll freely admit I don't understand technology at  all. I try not to participate in it at any level. And yet the abuses are so  obvious to me. That doesn't really seem like a very good excuse.</p><p>HAWLEY: Well, listen, I mean, what needs to happen here is, number one,  Facebook promised the FTC in 2011 in a binding consent decree. They said  that they would not share personal, private confidential data of users  without the users' consent. Well, Tucker, it looks like that's exactly what  Facebook is doing though that they are sharing that data in order to make a  profit, as you pointed out, without users' consent. </p><p>So, number one, FTC needs to enforce the consent decree, they need to  investigate right now, whether or not Facebook has violated it. Number two,  Congress needs to investigate and Congress needs to take steps to protect  the privacy of Americans. They need to make sure that Americans own their  own data and can protect it. </p><p>CARLSON: So this is a little bit out of left field. But I think that maybe  there is a connection. The CDC just came out with the suicide numbers. And  suicide is one of the leading causes of death in this country. Its  incidences dramatically increased. And all of this in middle age, people  tragically have killed themselves recently. There is a lot of speculation  and some evidence that there's a connection between increased use of tech  products and this tragic epidemic of suicide. </p><p>Is anyone, do you think, at the federal level going to look a little more  closely into this? It seems like something worth investigating.</p><p>HAWLEY: I think it is worth studying. And I think that - look, it's time  that we asked about the role of big tech in our lives. I mean, we've--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. </p><p>HAWLEY: --you've talked a lot about the sweetheart deals big tech gets from  government. I think it's time we took a hard look at those. I think it's  time we looked at the effect big tech is having on our personal lives, on  our families, on our schools, on our society. These are major companies.  Many of them monopolies. They make billions of dollars a year. There've  never been more powerful companies in the history of the world, and they  need to be held accountable.</p><p>CARLSON: Man! I wish I was in Missouri, so I could vote for you again. I  just - I - it's so nice to hear an elected official say that. I'm sorry to  suck up. I couldn't control myself. </p><p>Mr. Hawley, thank you very much.</p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, we're just hours away right now from a potential government  shutdown. The debate is over funding for the border wall. Will there be a  border wall or has that dream died? Details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Insulin is one of the basic human hormones. Everyone needs insulin  to live. Diabetics, though, can't properly produce insulin. And that's a  big question in this country. In America right now, about 6 million people  are dependent on daily injections of insulin just to survive. It's a great  thing that they can do that. </p><p>Almost a century ago, scientists discovered how to produce synthetic  insulin. The scientists who did that sold the patents to a university for  $1. Their goal was to help humanity. That's why they did that. It turned  out to be one of the great health advances in human history. </p><p>Diabetes went from almost a certain death sentence to a manageable illness,  as it is today or was. Cheaply available insulin has extended the lives of  tens of millions of people. But in this country, that seems to be changing. </p><p>For the last 20 years or so, the price of insulin has been rising very  quickly, even relative to other healthcare costs. When top insulin drug,  NovoLog, rose in price 353 percent in just 14 years. It isn't exceptional,  and the growth has shown no signs of stopping. </p><p>Thanks to these price hikes, millions of diabetics have started rationing  their insulin, gambling with their health and likely shortening their lives  to save money. They have no choice. A cheap medicine that your parents took  for granted increasingly is inaccessible to poor Americans though, already  the group most likely to suffer from diabetes in the first place, as you  probably know. </p><p>Now, there are a lot of reasons this is happening. One is the drug  companies keep slightly tweaking their formulas so their drugs never leave  patent and generic competitors can't enter the market to compete with them. </p><p>Another reason is rigid FDA regulations, which make it costly and time- consuming to put a new insulin drug in the market. Pharmaceutical companies  use legal challenges to deter competition too. Of course, most companies do  do that. And of course, greed plays a role, too. That's a word that we  don't use very often, but it's still real. One of the deadly sins for good  reason. </p><p>But whatever the reasons for the spike in prices of insulin, it's a huge  problem. And you would think it's something that Congress and the  administration would consider taking action on. There are some things they  could do. Maybe they should streamline an FDA approval process or adjust  patent law. Maybe they should subsidize the creation of a generic insulin  brand. </p><p>After all, we spend billions subsidizing solar panels and electric cars  that only rich people can afford. So before you give us a lecture about the  market, remind us we already do that, we're not sure what the best solution  is, we're not scientists or economists. What we can say, this is a real  problem that Congress appears to be ignoring. </p><p>In October, the President pitched a plan to lower drug prices across the  board by tying Medicare reimbursement to drug prices in other countries.  Republicans in Congress and on K Street hate that idea. Pharma's bottom  line is important to them and it's not an unimportant factor. On the other  hand, Americans are dying from easily treated illnesses. That's a factor  too. </p><p>On the left, well, they don't care at all, at least not right now. Their  top priority is impeaching Trump, not collaborating with Trump on  healthcare. And just like on tech and other issues, they're easily  distracted by superficial political signaling. </p><p>Sanofi is one of the companies now driving up insulin prices, but that  company won some degree of credibility from the left last summer and is now  insulated from criticism. Why? Well, because when Roseanne Barr blamed  Ambien for the ill-advised tweets that got her show cancelled, that company  tweeted that racism is not a side effect of its medications. And the left  roared with laughter. Go, big pharma. If only they'd roar about that  company extorting poor Americans with life-saving drugs! </p><p>But just like on immigration or trade or automation or global warming, it  doesn't matter when America's most vulnerable are hurt. It's actual most  vulnerable people no one in D.C. and particularly no one on the left seems  to care. Not their constituency.</p><p>So the debate over the wall on our southern border continues. Not a single  person in Washington, D.C. is in favor of building a wall on our southern  border. They are terrified, not because they think it won't work but  because they believe that it might work and it might clamp down on a  source, a ready source of cheap labor. And that's why they're willing to  risk a government shutdown rather than give a mere $5 million to start the  wall. </p><p>So what is going to happen? Is the wall over? Will the administration  surrender on this? And what will the voters on either side think of the  outcome? </p><p>Dana Perino hosts The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino, of course, the most  popular person here on Fox, and she joins us tonight.</p><p>DANA PERINO, ANCHOR, THE DAILY BRIEFING, FOX NEWS: All right.</p><p>CARLSON: So, Dana, super simple question. Are the people who want the wall  more inflamed than the people who don't want the wall? Which is the more,  in the end, when it's all over, a more powerful, politically powerful  constituency? </p><p>PERINO: I don't think that President Trump has fair weather fans. OK?</p><p>CARLSON: Right. </p><p>PERINO: I think that he has strong supporters who understand that he came  in strong. Right? He said the wall is going to get built. Mexico is going  to pay for it. Like, I never actually really took that seriously in terms  of Mexico paying for it.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. </p><p>PERINO: I do think that--</p><p>CARLSON: It's hard to see.</p><p>PERINO: --he has not done a good enough job persuading people as to the  merits why we need border security even though - look, he's tried, but I do  think that an Oval Office address on immigration security would actually be  very helpful. He could even use visual aids. There's clearly plenty to  show. </p><p>And I think that there might just be a way for him to have a nod to  reality, that he's not going to get this wall funding before the end of the  year. I think they're going to try to figure out a way just to punt this  for a little bit. Now he's going to have a different Congress to work with. </p><p>A lot of those members of Congress had already voted for border security,  which included fencing, which some people might call a wall. But Democrats,  many of them who are running for President, right, they're already in  Congress, they - it's like they can't say the \"W\" word. They can't say  wall. They can call it all sorts of other things, not a wall. I think that  there might be some room for compromise here in the New Year on the merits. </p><p>On the politics of it, well, the Democrats continue to push back against  him, maybe say, oh ha ha, we proved you wrong. Mexico didn't pay for it.  You didn't get your wall. Maybe. But there is a political cost to that as  well. People understand that our borders need to be secure and that we can  be a welcoming, opening, compassionate people at the same time. </p><p>CARLSON: So, for whatever reason, and I do think it's a little more  complicated just Democrats opposing it. I think a lot of Republicans in the  current Congress aren't fully (inaudible) with the wall either. But  whatever reason, hard - impossible to get this through the Congress. What  if the President said he just announced we're pulling our troops out of  Syria? What if he were to say I'm going to take the cost savings from that  and apply it to border security? </p><p>PERINO: Well, he could say that, but it's just not how the system works,  right? There is money that's programmed for certain places. Now, the  President has said to his cabinet, look for any money that we could put  towards this virtual wall, border security, wall, whatever you're going to  call it. </p><p>The Democrats are going to fuss about that because of just technical  reasons of reprogramming money is not that easy to do. But the President  has two opportunities coming up in the next six weeks. He'll have the State  of the Union. That's a big moment. Right? That's all eyes on the President. </p><p>CARLSON: Right. </p><p>PERINO: And then he has about a week later or two weeks later, he  introduces his budget proposal. A budget proposal is a prioritizing  document, and the President could say this is what I agree with. I just  feel like, if his fans are concerned that there's not going to be a wall,  just give him a minute. OK? Give him a chance. This is not a sprint. Right?  He's in a marathon. </p><p>CARLSON: And so you think it is - and you know the system very well. You  think it is at least possible that in the next two years some kind of wall  like structure appears on the southern border?</p><p>PERINO: Well, I just feel like - will there be - is it - this is what I  think is possible. It is possible to get border security funding and for  construction to start. Will that look like a steel wall all across the  border? Probably not. But no matter what President Trump gets in terms of  border security, he is going to call that a wall. He's a good communicator.  He'll figure that out. And no matter what, the Democrats will say, see, we  told you he wasn't going to get that steel wall all across the border. </p><p>But border security, I think, it's a real possibility. I think there're  some new members of Congress that are going to be willing. And remember  this. For Republicans and Democrats, there's a lot more veterans that just  got elected to Congress. They're used to working with the other side. There  are responsible people who care deeply about the national security of the  United States. </p><p>The President ought to invite all of them, Democrats, Republicans, bring  that coalition together. I think that's a really exciting group. And that  America has a lot to be proud of that these veterans have come back and are  still willing to serve their country just in a different way.</p><p>CARLSON: Interesting idea. Thank you.</p><p>PERINO: I know I'm too optimistic for you--</p><p>CARLSON: No--</p><p>PERINO: --a little bit, but--</p><p>CARLSON: No, I don't know - look, I've - trust me. This week, I'm looking  for all optimism possible and you are an ever-flowing well-spring of  optimism. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PERINO: OK. I'm glad I could be here.</p><p>CARLSON: You are loved. Thank you. Dana Perino--</p><p>PERINO: Thank you. </p><p>CARLSON: --great to see you.</p><p>Well, American forces are withdrawing from Syria. Is that good for the  world? And more important, is it good for the United States? We will unpack  its effects after the break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: The war on Christmas doesn't exist. Obviously, you know that.  You'd have to be a moron or some kind of Fox News viewer to think there is  a war on Christmas. And nowhere does the war on Christmas exist less than  in China. And that's why the city officials of Langfang, China, have issued  a total ban on the public celebration of Christmas. </p><p>That means no Santa, no lights, and obviously no nativity scenes. The ban  is part of a wider religious crackdown in China, which has seen churches  shut down and believers thrown in prison, a story that hasn't gotten a ton  of ink here among our elites who are getting rich in China.</p><p>In Russia, by contrast, and even in Assad's Syria, millions of Christians  will happily celebrate Christmas without any oppression. Just take a guess  which countries are despised and which ones they suck up to? And maybe  that's why they love China's government so much. Beijing does what  Washington wishes it could do, with efficiency too. </p><p>I want to bring you a major development tonight in America's involvement in  Syria despite heavy pressure from Saudi Arabia and thousands of foreign  policy experts. The United States has managed to avoid a full intervention  into the Syrian civil war, praise God. Now we're finally pulling out the  forces we do have there. Trace Gallagher has more on that. </p><p>Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR, FOX NEWS: Tucker, the decision to remove the  entire U.S. force from Syria, more than 2,000 troops, surprised virtually  everyone, and it officially marked the end of an extended ground campaign  against ISIS. Moments ago, the President released this video statement.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've been President for  almost two years and we've really stepped it up. And we have won against  ISIS. We've beaten them and we've beaten them badly. We have taken back the  land. And now it's time for our troops to come back home. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said this does not end  the global campaign against ISIS, quoting, \"The United States and our  allies stand ready to re-engage at all levels to defend American interest  whenever necessary.\" But Trump ally and frequent advisor Senator Lindsey  Graham does not like it. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LINDSEY GRAHAM, REPUBLICAN, SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR: ISIS is more likely to  come back because I don't agree with the President that they're defeated in  Syria and Iraq.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Florida Senator Marco Rubio called the decision a major blunder.  Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor John Bolton  have both argued that a precipitous withdrawal in Syria would embolden ISIS  to make a comeback. But Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul applauded the move  and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the U.S. pull-out will  not impede his country's ability to defend itself against regional threats. </p><p>Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, great to see you tonight. Thank you for that. </p><p>David Tafuri is an attorney. He is the former Obama campaign advisor, and  he joins us tonight. </p><p>David, thanks so much for coming on. So, moments like this are so  instructive because they really do divide the world into very clear  sectors. You sort of know who's on whose side. And I find this interesting  because the rationale has changed. So people are saying we need to fight  ISIS. But that's not really the point. The point is to counterbalance  Russia and Iran. And I'm wondering, is that, A, our goal; B, achievable  with 2,000 troops in Syria? Like, what actually is the goal? I'm losing  track.</p><p>DAVID TAFURI, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Well, there are a couple of  goals. It's to fight ISIS. It's also to push back on Iran and on Russia. So  what's stunning about this development is all of President Trump's foreign  policy advisors and top military advisors were against this decision. And  he reversed them today, suddenly, in a rash decision. </p><p>Now, the reason why we should stay in Syria--</p><p>CARLSON: But that's the same people who think we should stay in  Afghanistan, right? So how much--</p><p>TAFURI: Some of them are the same, but--</p><p>CARLSON: How much credible--</p><p>TAFURI: --the reasons are different. </p><p>CARLSON: --ones you say that you have? </p><p>TAFURI: The reasons are different.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. </p><p>TAFURI: Look, Trump's top policy advisor said we are going to stay in Syria  until we have, one, rolled back Iran. That has not happened. Two, defeated  ISIS. We have made major progress in fighting ISIS, but we haven't fully  defeated them. I was in Iraq in October. Nobody on the ground in Iraq tells  me we defeated ISIS there. And ISIS is even stronger in Syria, still.  Moreover, all of Trump's policy advisors have said we should stay in Syria  until there's a political solution in Syria. None of those three things  have happened.</p><p>Wouldn't it be a wrong thing if the most--</p><p>CARLSON: Wait, wait, wait. Can I just--</p><p>TAFURI: Go ahead. </p><p>CARLSON: --stress maybe another option? So there wasn't actually ISIS in  Syria when the Assad government controlled the whole country. Christians  and other religious minorities, a lot of them, lived in relative peace. Now  they're hunted down and murdered. Why wouldn't it just be the simplest,  most elegant best solution for everyone involved if Assad managed his  entire country again?</p><p>TAFURI: Because you are ignoring the history and the development of the  revolution in Syria. The revolution in Syria happened--</p><p>CARLSON: It just happened a few years ago. </p><p>TAFURI: It happened organically. It began in 2011. It happened organically.  Right? And so Syria was an authoritarian state before that with tons of  oppression. Maybe Christians were OK there. </p><p>CARLSON: Is there a non-authoritarian--</p><p>TAFURI: But - but people were not - people were--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARLSON: Is there a non-authoritarian state in that region other than  Israel? </p><p>TAFURI: There are - there are less authoritarian states-- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARLSON: Oh. But they're all authoritarian-- </p><p>TAFURI: --much less authoritarian--</p><p>CARLSON: --there. I mean, Jordan is an authoritarian state. Criticize the  king and see what happens. So, like, that's the rule in the region. </p><p>TAFURI: You cannot compare Jordan to Syria. </p><p>CARLSON: I'm not attacking--</p><p>TAFURI: You can't even compare Syria to Iraq--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not attacking Jordan. </p><p>TAFURI: --which has a fledgling democracy. </p><p>CARLSON: I'm just saying authoritarian justifies nothing. They're all  authoritarians, OK? </p><p>TAFURI: OK. But the point is that this was an organic revolution. The U.S.  didn't start this revolution. It's started by the Syrian people, majority  of whom are Sunni Arabs. They stood up against Assad. He chose - rather  than to reconcile with them, he chose to mow them down and slaughter tens  of thousands of innocent, peaceful protesters. </p><p>CARLSON: No--</p><p>TAFURI: That's how the revolution began.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm sure Assad's - OK. But I'm not defending Assad's character.  I'm merely saying--</p><p>TAFURI: Good. </p><p>CARLSON: --from the perspective--</p><p>TAFURI: You shouldn't. </p><p>CARLSON: Why would I? </p><p>TAFURI: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not Syrian. I don't work for Assad. I'm an American. And I  want to know what's best for us. And if you're worried about the chaos and  the huge refugee problems caused by this civil war and by the emergence of  ISIS, again, abetted by the civil war, then why wouldn't you long for the  days where Christians could live unmolested in Syria under this  authoritarian Assad? I'm totally missing it. What am I missing?</p><p>TAFURI: Because that's not - this is actually going to cause more refugees.  OK? Northern - northeastern Syria right now is secure. The reason it's  secure is because of the great work by our U.S. Special Forces working with  the SDF, the local Syrian and moderate Sunni forces on the ground. They've  secured it. And actually, there are less refugees coming from that area.  The people can say they're peaceful.</p><p>CARLSON: How did the--</p><p>TAFURI: They're not getting bombed by Assad. </p><p>CARLSON: How do the Christians - how do the Christians do? </p><p>TAFURI: And when we pull out - when we pull out, it's going to cause a  massive wave of Syrian refugees again because forces are going to go in and  slaughter the forces--</p><p>CARLSON: Forces. </p><p>TAFURI: --that we've been working with on the ground. </p><p>CARLSON: Yes. </p><p>TAFURI: Assad's forces, Iranian, Shia militia forces, and possibly even  Russian forces.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. And so we're responsible for that? </p><p>TAFURI: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: Because - so this is halfway around the world. We have crises like  Venezuela's collapses right there. Mexico has probably as many murders as  Syria - I mean, not close. Right? So, like, I'm just saying there are a lot  of things going on. But we have a moral obligation to keep 2,000 American  troops in this country around the world because why - I'm honest - I'm  confused. </p><p>TAFURI: Well, first of all, we are there already, and it's successful. So  why pull out? We also do have some obligations of forces on the ground--</p><p>CARLSON: It's successful in what way? </p><p>TAFURI: --who fought - who fought bravely alongside us. Moreover, this is  going to impact us because ISIS will come back. And if we don't have forces  on the ground to monitor ISIS and to continue to combat ISIS, ISIS will  come back. ISIS are sworn enemies of the U.S. they want to kill Americans. </p><p>CARLSON: Right. </p><p>TAFURI: And when they become stronger in Syria, they'll strike out against  America again. </p><p>CARLSON: So by this--</p><p>TAFURI: So your viewers should worry about their own security because of  this decision. </p><p>CARLSON: Well, there are a lot of reasons to worry about our own security.  A lot.</p><p>TAFURI: Sure. </p><p>CARLSON: Many. And our mental health and our economy and our healthcare  system. A lot of things to worry about. But by the standards that you've  just articulated, like we're never going to leave there or Afghanistan or  any place that we've been for more than eight months. So--</p><p>TAFURI: I wouldn't say we're never going to leave there. But we have to see  progress on the ground. We have to see full defeat of ISIS.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. </p><p>TAFURI: We have to see political progress--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARLSON: --why shouldn't--</p><p>TAFURI: --towards a peaceful revolution in Syria, and there ought to be a  democracy in Syria.</p><p>CARLSON: Why shouldn't--</p><p>TAFURI: And then we can leave. </p><p>CARLSON: Who cares about - who cares about that? The question--</p><p>TAFURI: Who care about democracy?</p><p>CARLSON: --that I care about - I'll tell you what I care about is what's  happening to the Christians there? Like, nobody cares. I don't understand.  We invade Iraq. There's a huge Christian community. They'll leave. </p><p>TAFURI: Well, who are killing the Christians in Iraq?</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not--</p><p>TAFURI: ISIS. </p><p>CARLSON: Look--</p><p>TAFURI: ISIS. </p><p>CARLSON: Of course-- </p><p>TAFURI: And--</p><p>CARLSON: --but I'm just saying why don't we make it an explicit--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TAFURI: Islamic militants are killing Christians in Iraq. </p><p>CARLSON: I'm not defending ISIS. I'm just saying, why don't we make it an  explicit concern of the United States to protect the Christians? But we  don't. </p><p>TAFURI: It is an explicit--</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's not-- </p><p>TAFURI: --concern. </p><p>CARLSON: --actually. We don't let in the end. </p><p>TAFURI: It's an explicit concern of the U.S. to protect all minorities in  Syria and Iraq, of which the Christian minorities are important part of. </p><p>CARLSON: They don't seem that important to anyone here. </p><p>Anyway, I hope they are. They're important to me. I'm glad they're  important to you. David, thank you. </p><p>TAFURI: Yes. Thank you. </p><p>CARLSON: Democrats claim to care about sexual harassment so very much  because they're good people. Are they prepared to expose the congressman  who paid your tax dollars in hush money to accusers? It's a pretty simple  question. We'll see if we can get an answer after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, a couple weeks ago, we invited on this program a New York  Senator named Kevin Parker. He's a Democrat. He wants to force all citizens  in the State of New York to turn over their social media password so their  accounts can be inspected by the thought-police before they buy guns. If  they say something naughty or threatening, no gun. </p><p>Well, given that, we are fascinated to see the news yesterday. Parker grew  angry with the Republican spokeswoman and tweeted her this. \"Kill  yourself.\" Well, the irony, obviously, pretty obvious. So Parker  apologized. He said he was making a donation to the National Alliance on  Mental Illness. We applaud that. </p><p>Has he learned the lesson embedded in his own actions though? The anti-gun  bill he sponsored is still pending in the New York State legislature. We've  asked Senator Parker to come back on this show, so he can explain once  again why he ought to have the power to police thought-crime on Twitter.  And by the way, should he, given his record, be allowed to own a gun? So  far, his office has not responded, but we'll keep asking him. Great guest.  Happy to have him again.</p><p>Well, yesterday in Capitol Hill, the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  sharply attacked a proposal to give the President an immigration  enforcement slush fund, as he called it. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHARLES SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Leader McConnell proposed the  bipartisan Senate DHS bill, which has $1.6 billion for border security plus  a $1 billion slush fund for the President to use for his radical  immigration agenda. I called Leader McConnell and told him we would not  accept their $1 billion slush fund and that our offers to fund the  government remain. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Now, don't take those words the wrong way. The problem Democrats  have is with border enforcement. They don't have a problem with slush  funds. Congress loves slush funds. That's why, for years, Congress has  maintained a slush fund at your expense, taxpayer funded, to pay off people  who accuse members of Congress of sexual harassment. </p><p>The Democrats will control the House in just a couple of weeks, of course.  Are they going to end the slush fund, and more to the point, will they tell  us who has been protected by it? What are the names?</p><p>Penny Nance is President of Concerned Women for America, and she joins us  tonight. </p><p>Penny, thanks so much for coming on. This seems like a very simple ask. Why  shouldn't the public know who got paid with our money to settle these  claims? </p><p>PENNY NANCE, PRESIDENT, CONCERNED WOMEN FOR AMERICA: That's a very good  question. And by the way, Concerned Women for America members sent  thousands of petitions asking Congress to tell us. Over 20 years, 264  cases, $15 million of our money was paid out to hide what members of  Congress did. And these weren't little allegations. These were big things. </p><p>We have the case of Blake Farenthold, who sexually harassed his  communications director, shared his sexual fantasies about her. And when  she dared to complain, he fired her. And you remember Eric Massa and his  groping of young men, and then he called it tickle fights. He had to pay  out $100,000--</p><p>CARLSON: And that was--</p><p>NANCE: --of our money.</p><p>CARLSON: --taxpayer money.</p><p>NANCE: Taxpayer money. And we were never paid back. Now, Congress did just  pass a piece of compromise legislation, but it doesn't do anything about  what we just talked about. It doesn't pay back at all the slush fund that  the taxpayers paid out to cover up the wrongdoing by members of Congress.</p><p>CARLSON: Now, do we know the identities of the people on whose behalf these  payments were made?</p><p>NANCE: No. And we have tried - and by the way, FOIA doesn't apply to  Congress. Isn't that interesting?</p><p>CARLSON: So - I mean, so Nancy Pelosi, who obviously is America's chief  defender of women--</p><p>NANCE: Right. </p><p>CARLSON: --I mean, she's told us that many times, and a deeply good person.  She's told us that too. She'll be in charge of this. </p><p>NANCE: Yes. </p><p>CARLSON: So she can release these names if she wanted to. Will she want to?  Will she?</p><p>NANCE: We have called on her to do that, but she so far has chosen to  shield her colleagues. She even went as far as to say that John Conyers was  a hero and a great American. Remember John Conyers was hosting meetings  with his staff in his underwear and was caught on film - caught on video on  a airline flight on the taxpayer dollars watching porn. This is the guy, by  the way, who used to be the Judiciary Committee Chairman who had oversight  over pornography. So you can't make this stuff up. </p><p>The new bill does make some improvements and, going forward, requires  restitution. But it's not clear whether or not even then we'll know for  sure, going forward, who actually is the perpetrator. Because in the new  legislation, you just disclose the office. It could be the Chief of Staff,  it could be the legislative director, it could be the Press Secretary, and  like they're going to write off their boss. So--</p><p>CARLSON: Or it could be the member.</p><p>NANCE: It could be the member. And that's the point. We've got to have more  transparency. And we're not going to let this go. </p><p>CARLSON: You will keep pushing? </p><p>NANCE: I will keep pushing. I promise.</p><p>CARLSON: Penny Nance, it seems like a simple ask. </p><p>NANCE: It does. </p><p>CARLSON: I hope you get it. </p><p>NANCE: Thank you. </p><p>CARLSON: Thanks very much. </p><p>NANCE: Thank you. </p><p>CARLSON: Well, as you've seen tonight, permanent Washington cares a great  deal about protecting the way things are, the status quo. It's great for  them. They get richer and they can believe, and many do believe that they  are morally superior to you. And that's why they destroy anyone who  threatens the status quo. </p><p>Mike Flynn, for example, is being destroyed. Mark Zuckerberg lied as well.  He's being protected because he's on the side of the people who make those  decisions. That's also why the establishment has become so obsessed with  crushing free speech. It's getting harder and harder for them to win  arguments on the merits. </p><p>The best option then is to keep the arguments from being made at all. When  you can tar your opponent as immoral, as a bigot, you don't have to defend  you own position, you can just do what you want. You can also ruin the  lives of anyone who gets in your way and feel good about it. </p><p>How do we get to this place? So that entire story is in a new book called  Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Bringing America to the Brink  of Revolution. Christmas is coming. This tells a story that might rattle  you, but it's still worth knowing. You can find it on our website,  tuckercarlson.com.</p><p>That's about it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m.,  the show that is the sworn enemy - and we mean it - of lying, pomposity,  smugness and groupthink; the show that says what we think is true, whether  they like it or not. </p><p>Good night from Washington.

We begin this show with some shocking news. Lying has been detected here in  Washington. Mendacity, deceit, duplicitousness (ph), saying things that  aren't true that here my arms is going up just telling you about this. But  it happened. And we can prove it. </p><p> Now, to be clear, news anchors didn't do it. News anchors don't lie.  They're good people. Neither do professional cable news commentators, the  one making millions on the side as lobbyists for foreign governments or big  multinational corporations. Commentators always tell the truth. And that's  why they, and their scrupulously honest news anchor friends are so utterly  disgusted tonight, horrified really by what retired General Michael Flynn  has done. Watch their stunned reactions.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DON LEMON, ANCHOR, CNN: Michael Flynn lied to the FBI. Flynn lied again and  again and again to FBI agents. Just lied. Lies, lies, and more lies. </p><p> UNKNOWN: Hold on for just a minute about who is significant and who is not.  Flynn lied. The tone should be when you speak to a prosecutor, you speak to  the truth. Everybody lied. </p><p> LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, ANCHOR, MSNBC: Michael Flynn was betraying his country.  Michael Flynn was betraying his office. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: \"He lied,\" says Don Lemon and his news anchors friend. Lied, lied,  lied. He's a very bad man, a lying kind of man. The worst kind. He could  never work in television. For his crime of lying, Michael Flynn, the liar,  may soon be locked away in a cell. That would keep the rest of us safe from  his perfidious lies. That day can't come fast enough say the news anchors.  Cuff him. America longs to breathe free once more. </p><p> Michael Flynn will be 60 years old next week. The Washington Post  calculates he faces five years in prison. And let that be a warning to all  of us. That's what happens to people who lie in Washington. Or does it?</p><p> From a golf course somewhere in Dubai, you can almost hear Bill Clinton  chuckling softly. Lied under oath, still making $300,000 a speech; not  everyone faces the same penalties for lying it turns out.</p><p> Mark Zuckerberg came to Washington last spring to talk about Facebook  that's the sole destroying social media company that has made him a  multibillionaire. While in town, Zuckerberg stopped by the Congress where -  and you might want to ask the kids to leave the room for this - he lied.  Yep. Don't tell Don Lemon. But Mark Zuckerberg is a liar. Watch him do it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: This is the most important principle for  Facebook. Every piece of content that you share on Facebook, you own and  you have complete control over who sees it and how you share it. And you  can remove it at any time. </p><p> SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA: Are you willing to give me more control  over my data? </p><p> ZUCKERBERG: Senator, as somebody who uses Facebook, I believe that you  should have complete control over your data.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. You have complete control over your data. You control who  sees it. You own it. That's really the most important principle at  Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg says so with a completely straight face. </p><p> The only problem, it was a lie. Sorry, kids. According to a piece in the  New York Times, Facebook does not actually allow you or anyone else to  control your data. Not at all. In fact, they secretly hand over your data,  personal data, to other big tech companies. Now, that decision has made  Mark Zuckerberg even richer, adding on to the house in Hawaii probably.  Unfortunately, he's had to lie in the process, including to Congress, and  that's a crime. </p><p> As Robespierre once famously noted, \"You can't make an omelet without  breaking a few eggs.\" In this case, the eggs are your privacy. Apparently,  Facebook allowed Microsoft search engine, Bing, to see the names of your  Facebook friends without telling you about it. Facebook also allowed  Netflix and Spotify to read your private messages without telling you. </p><p> Now, there's no evidence so far as of tonight that Facebook has a video  camera hidden in your shower, but close enough. That's what Mark Zuckerberg  lied about. Not a small lie, really. </p><p> What did Mike Flynn lie about? Well, according to the FBI, Flynn lied about  conversations he had had with the Russian Ambassador Kislyak. You remember  him. Flynn said that he and Kislyak had never talked about expelling  Russian diplomats or about Russia voting in the U.N. on symbolic  resolutions. And in fact, they had talked about both of those things. The  feds already knew that because they were listening in, secretly. </p><p> There was nothing improper about the conversations that Flynn and Kislyak  had. The crime was the lie. It's always the crime. Except when it's Mark  Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg can lie about something that affects hundreds  of millions of Americans, but it's not really a big deal. Zuckerberg is not  looking at five years in prison. Zuckerberg will not be sanctioned by  Congress ever. </p><p> So what's the difference? Well, unlike Mike Flynn, Mark Zuckerberg is a  hero to the American news media. He is who they want to be. He is richer  than God. He went to Harvard. He wears T-shirts at work for real. He's for  open borders. All the cool people like Mark Zuckerberg, even foreign  countries. </p><p> For example, when the fascist government of China was looking for new tools  to oppress its own population, you think they went to Mike Flynn for help?  Yes, OK. I don't think so. Flynn is tough on china, old fashioned as he is.  But Mark Zuckerberg, by contrast, was happy to help. </p><p> As they say at McKenzie, Mark Zuckerberg gets it. </p><p> Boy, what has Mike Flynn ever done for anyone? 33 years in uniform? That's  not very innovative. Two lies told by two high-profile Americans. One is  going to prison in late middle age. The other will be available for like 40  years for commencement addresses and awards dinners held in his honor.  That's the tale of Mike Flynn and Mark Zuckerberg. It tells you everything. </p><p> Joining us now to break down what's happening to Mike Flynn is Harvard Law  Professor Emeritus, Alan Dershowitz. He is the case of the book - the  author, rather, of the book The Case Against Impeaching Trump. </p><p> Professor, thanks very much for coming on. So I read in The Washington Post  this morning--</p><p> ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Well, thank you so much. </p><p> CARLSON: --I read Mike Flynn described as a double agent in The Washington  Post. And then I saw the Judge Sullivan yesterday describe him as someone  who had committed treason. Is that the crime for which he is facing prison? </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: No, not at all. And I'll get to that in a second. But Tucker, I  just want to make one point. I hope you don't mind me making it. </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CARLSON: --you will.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: I hate boycotts and attempts - I hope - I hate boycotts and  attempts to censor free speech. I'm in favor of complete dialogue. But as  such, I feel impelled to tell you that I, with due respect, disagree with  the way you categorize mass immigration. That's all. I just want to say  that. And--</p><p> CARLSON: Well, that's OK. And by the way--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Now--</p><p> CARLSON: I would expect that you would. We differ probably on a lot of  issues. But the one issue that we--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Right. </p><p> CARLSON: --agree on and that--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Yes. </p><p> CARLSON: --I respect you for is your willingness to say what you think in  public to defend your views, to have a conversation and to let others  decide which side is right. And that's something that I wish we were able  to do a lot more of. But you're one of the only liberals who will come on  this show. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: I completely agree.</p><p> CARLSON: Amen. So thank you very much for saying that. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Well, I agree. And I come on this show because I also have the  right to say what I think and when I disagree with you, you'll allow me to  say I disagree with you. And I do. I wish you hadn't used that language.  Language like that was used to describe my grandparents and great  grandparents and probably some of yours. So let's move on. But--</p><p> CARLSON: Well, actually, just in point of--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: --I would hope you--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CARLSON: --just in point of fact since you brought it up, as noted on  Monday--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Yes. </p><p> CARLSON: That was in the context of a conversation with an elected official  in Tijuana about the filth--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Right. </p><p> CARLSON: --of his city and he was complaining about how dirty it had  become, which was a byproduct of the policy decisions pushed by the  American left and I noted. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: I understand that. </p><p> CARLSON: There's a lesson there perhaps for us. So I'm not - and I would  never describe people as inherently dirty. I don't think that they are and  pro-people. That's one of the reasons I'm against abortion, strongly. But  anyway, whatever. The point is, I wish we were able--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Yes - no. I'm glad you - I'm glad you cleared that up. Yes. </p><p> CARLSON: Yes. Well, I mean, I think it was clear and I think that the  people who are mischaracterizing it are always welcome on the show to talk  it through and to hear my side and I will hear their side because, again,  this is one of the last forums in America for open conversation. </p><p> Anyway - but tell me that--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: That's very fair. Let's--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. Well, I mean, that--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: --turn to Flynn. Yes. OK. </p><p> CARLSON: --that's how I feel. I'm not afraid to defend what I think,  obviously. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: No, I - look, I agree. Neither am I. On the Flynn issue, look,  there's a big issue. I've been teaching this for 50 years. Should it really  ever be a crime to lie when you're not under oath? </p><p> I think you can make a very, very strong case that before you can be  convicted of a crime for lying, you should have to raise your hand, put it  on a Bible, look to your God or look to your ethics, have a solemn moment  where you look the person in the face and swear to him that you are going  to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. </p><p> That's so different from when two guys evade the usual procedures, come in  to try to hang out with you and be chummy, say you don't need a lawyer, we  just want to ask you a couple of questions--</p><p> CARLSON: Right. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: --and then trap him by asking him questions that they already  knew the answer to and had videotapes and audiotapes that could make it  clear that they are only asking him the question in order to give him an  opportunity to lie. </p><p> So I really do think that we have kind of three criteria. Just lying  politically. It's done too often. I hate it. But it's done too often. It's  not a crime. Second, lying only to government officials, which is a crime  but probably shouldn't be a crime, or if it is, it should be a misdemeanor,  not a serious felony akin to raising your right arm and swearing under oath  that you will tell the truth. </p><p> There's too much lying in Washington and there are too many, as you point  out correctly, double standards about who is prosecuted for lying. In civil  cases, people lie in depositions all the time. And they're never  prosecuted. I tried to bring a case recently against people who lied.  Prosecutors laugh at you. Lying in a deposition? That's like gambling in  Casablanca. It's just done all the time, and it's tragic that it's done. </p><p> I testified in front of Congress about this. When they were going after  Bill Clinton and trying to - and impeaching him for his lies. I had a whole  session where I talked about how many lies are told in how many different  places and how selective they are in going after people. That's one of the  problems of not requiring an oath. It gives you the opportunity to  selectively pick people to prosecute for lying not under oath. </p><p> CARLSON: We're almost out of time, but - it is a lie to - I mean - rather,  it is a crime to lie to federal investigators, but it's not a crime for  them to lie to you. Why?</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: No, not only that. The Supreme Court has said it's perfectly OK  for police and FBI agents to lie to you, and that happens every day. You'll  have two people who they suspect of a crime. They'll bring one person in  and say, oh, by the way, your buddy just ratted you out, just turned you  in, you're going to get executed unless you tell us that he did it too. And  of course, it was a total lie. They say the same thing to the other person.  And the Supreme Court has said, lying by FBI agents, lying by federal  officials is permissible and (inaudible) it's done all the time. </p><p> CARLSON: Right. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: But if you lie back to them, then it's a crime. It's even a  crime, the Supreme Court has said, to deny that you did something. If  somebody asks you, \"Did you do something, a crime?\" --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: --and you say, \"No,\" and you did, you've doubled your  punishment by now lying about whether you committed a crime. The irony  about Flynn is he wasn't lying about committing a crime. He did nothing  wrong. What he did was perfectly legal. I'm still scratching my head and  trying to figure out why he lied. What was his motive? </p><p> CARLSON: I was thinking - I saw a little--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Is it possible he misremembered? </p><p> CARLSON: I mean - and by the way--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Yes. Now, he did say the court--</p><p> CARLSON: --why were the feds spying on the incoming national security  advisor? Is that normal? I don't know. Professor, thank you very much. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: No. Comey told us. Comey said, look, I could get away with it,  Comey said.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. I don't know. I don't think you should be spying on members  of your own executive branch unless there's a good reason to do that. But  anyway, thank you very much. Good to see you.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Right. Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, yesterday, the President accused the Mueller investigation  of intentionally and illegally deleting 19,000 text messages, those are  between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. The DOJ claims the text messages were  not erased intentionally, but they were lost due to technical errors. </p><p> Speaking of lying, is that a lie or is it true? Tom Fitton, the President  of Judicial Watch, joins us tonight. Really simple. It's hard to believe  that the Department of Justice would lie about something like that. Are  they? Are they not?</p><p> TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: Well, we don't know the truth. We've  got these two categories of text messages. These are the text messages the  DOJ had or the FBI had back when Page and Strzok were not members of the  Mueller special counsel team. And there was a gap in terms of capturing  those text messages. And there were about 19,000--</p><p> CARLSON: Right. </p><p> FITTON: --that were subsequently recovered supposedly by the IG. And then  they go work for Mueller's operation. They get removed because of these  text messages that they were sending around, talking about insurance  policies against Trump and being pro-Hillary. And IG asked for their phone  because he wants to look at more of these text messages. And their phones  have been wiped, have been reset. Unrecoverable. </p><p> We don't know how many text messages were erased by the Mueller special  counsel operation. They remove him for - Page - removed Strzok specifically  for misconduct and bias that was found in his text messages, but no one  looks at his text messages from the time he was in the Mueller special  counsel operation, the most sensitive investigation the Justice Department  has been involved in in decades. Unbelievable. </p><p> CARLSON: Investigations are, by definition, supposed to be preserving  evidence. So - I mean, do you think it's plausible that the Mueller people  might have been implicated in erasing evidence? I mean, that - that just  seems like shocking. </p><p> FITTON: Well, you know what? Manafort was accused of withholding evidence.  You know what they did. They didn't know for sure whether he was. They  issued a search warrant and they raided his home with guns drawn and no  warning. </p><p> CARLSON: Yes, I noticed. </p><p> FITTON: That's not what happens when the government erases evidence on  purpose or accidentally. And it's so bad, the special counsel. You see in  the Flynn investigation questions about how that investigation was handled?  Now we have these missing text messages and the Strzok--</p><p> CARLSON: It really makes you wish we had elected officials in this country  who could protect the rest of from us these abuses. I wonder where they  are.</p><p> FITTON: We need a special counsel for the special counsel.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. How about just someone who'd like (ph) to do something? Thank  you very much. </p><p> FITTON: You're welcome. </p><p> CARLSON: Mark Zuckerberg hid the truth from Congress. He lied. So lawmakers  planning to do anything about his lies? We'll ask an incoming senator about  that next. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: So Mark Zuckerberg just got caught lying in front of Congress  about selling the deeply private data of more than 200 million Americans,  probably your data by the way, is one of the more flagrant abuses big tech  has committed recently. There's a long list of those. But it's hardly the  only abuse. All the major tech platforms have colluded to silence opinions  they don't like and to destroy the people who express those opinions.  They've done this in the open. We've watched it happen. </p><p>Google employees secretly, meanwhile, discussed hiding conservative  websites and search results because they're just not legitimate. Facebook's  founding president Sean Parker admitted that his company created an  intentionally addictive product, like cigarettes, that could destroy  children's brains, which is exactly, of course, what it's done. </p><p> It all adds up to a terrifying picture, a serious menace to this country,  to a democracy, to our mental health - check the numbers on that sometime -  to our cohesion as a nation. It's a real threat, obviously. And everybody  knows it. How is Congress doing protecting us from any of these threats?  Good question. They're not. And they're not even trying. </p><p> And if you're wondering why they're not trying, the answer might be, in  part anyway, the outgoing Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Ryan didn't seem  interested in reigning in the tech companies in any way, when he was the  third most powerful man in America. In part, he was too busy preventing a  wall from being built on our southern border to get to the tech question. </p><p> But there might have been other reasons we're just speculating now. Now  that he is leaving the Congress and moving to the private sector, will Paul  Ryan be taking any money from any of the big tech firms like Facebook or  Google or Twitter? Seemed like an interesting question. Obvious, but then  no one has asked. So we called Paul Ryan's office today and we asked that  question. We haven't got an answer yet. And it's 8:20 p.m. Eastern. We're  going to keep checking and get back to you when they respond.</p><p> So the leadership of the House, of course, is changing. Democrats are  taking over. But the Republicans still hold the Senate. Is there any  interest, will there be, in reigning in tech at all? </p><p> Josh Hawley was just elected Senator. He's a Republican from Missouri, and  he joins us tonight. </p><p> Mr. Senator Elect, thanks very much for coming on. Now, I'm not going to  force you to join me in pointing fingers as to why this hasn't been done up  to this point. But I will ask the question, do you think the Congress,  maybe on a bipartisan basis going forward, will recognize that maybe  there's some tweaking that needs to be done in the government's  relationship with these companies?</p><p> JOSH HAWLEY, REPUBLICAN, MISSOURI SENATOR-ELECT: Tucker, thanks for having  me on. And I certainly hope so. I mean, it's time that Congress got serious  about protecting the privacy, the data, the personal confidential  information of hundreds of millions of Americans. </p><p> And to see this report today that Facebook has allowed these big tech  companies, Amazon, Microsoft, Spotify, Netflix to have access to the  personal information of users, after Facebook said that it would not allow,  it would not give away users' personal data is really extraordinary. And  look, it's time Congress did something about it. It's time the FTC did  something about it.</p><p> CARLSON: So you often hear people say, well, Congress can't actually act to  regulate these companies because its members are too old and they don't  understand technology. I'll freely admit I don't understand technology at  all. I try not to participate in it at any level. And yet the abuses are so  obvious to me. That doesn't really seem like a very good excuse.</p><p> HAWLEY: Well, listen, I mean, what needs to happen here is, number one,  Facebook promised the FTC in 2011 in a binding consent decree. They said  that they would not share personal, private confidential data of users  without the users' consent. Well, Tucker, it looks like that's exactly what  Facebook is doing though that they are sharing that data in order to make a  profit, as you pointed out, without users' consent. </p><p> So, number one, FTC needs to enforce the consent decree, they need to  investigate right now, whether or not Facebook has violated it. Number two,  Congress needs to investigate and Congress needs to take steps to protect  the privacy of Americans. They need to make sure that Americans own their  own data and can protect it. </p><p> CARLSON: So this is a little bit out of left field. But I think that maybe  there is a connection. The CDC just came out with the suicide numbers. And  suicide is one of the leading causes of death in this country. Its  incidences dramatically increased. And all of this in middle age, people  tragically have killed themselves recently. There is a lot of speculation  and some evidence that there's a connection between increased use of tech  products and this tragic epidemic of suicide. </p><p> Is anyone, do you think, at the federal level going to look a little more  closely into this? It seems like something worth investigating.</p><p> HAWLEY: I think it is worth studying. And I think that - look, it's time  that we asked about the role of big tech in our lives. I mean, we've--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. </p><p> HAWLEY: --you've talked a lot about the sweetheart deals big tech gets from  government. I think it's time we took a hard look at those. I think it's  time we looked at the effect big tech is having on our personal lives, on  our families, on our schools, on our society. These are major companies.  Many of them monopolies. They make billions of dollars a year. There've  never been more powerful companies in the history of the world, and they  need to be held accountable.</p><p> CARLSON: Man! I wish I was in Missouri, so I could vote for you again. I  just - I - it's so nice to hear an elected official say that. I'm sorry to  suck up. I couldn't control myself. </p><p> Mr. Hawley, thank you very much.</p><p> HAWLEY: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, we're just hours away right now from a potential government  shutdown. The debate is over funding for the border wall. Will there be a  border wall or has that dream died? Details ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Insulin is one of the basic human hormones. Everyone needs insulin  to live. Diabetics, though, can't properly produce insulin. And that's a  big question in this country. In America right now, about 6 million people  are dependent on daily injections of insulin just to survive. It's a great  thing that they can do that. </p><p> Almost a century ago, scientists discovered how to produce synthetic  insulin. The scientists who did that sold the patents to a university for  $1. Their goal was to help humanity. That's why they did that. It turned  out to be one of the great health advances in human history. </p><p> Diabetes went from almost a certain death sentence to a manageable illness,  as it is today or was. Cheaply available insulin has extended the lives of  tens of millions of people. But in this country, that seems to be changing. </p><p> For the last 20 years or so, the price of insulin has been rising very  quickly, even relative to other healthcare costs. When top insulin drug,  NovoLog, rose in price 353 percent in just 14 years. It isn't exceptional,  and the growth has shown no signs of stopping. </p><p> Thanks to these price hikes, millions of diabetics have started rationing  their insulin, gambling with their health and likely shortening their lives  to save money. They have no choice. A cheap medicine that your parents took  for granted increasingly is inaccessible to poor Americans though, already  the group most likely to suffer from diabetes in the first place, as you  probably know. </p><p> Now, there are a lot of reasons this is happening. One is the drug  companies keep slightly tweaking their formulas so their drugs never leave  patent and generic competitors can't enter the market to compete with them. </p><p> Another reason is rigid FDA regulations, which make it costly and time- consuming to put a new insulin drug in the market. Pharmaceutical companies  use legal challenges to deter competition too. Of course, most companies do  do that. And of course, greed plays a role, too. That's a word that we  don't use very often, but it's still real. One of the deadly sins for good  reason. </p><p> But whatever the reasons for the spike in prices of insulin, it's a huge  problem. And you would think it's something that Congress and the  administration would consider taking action on. There are some things they  could do. Maybe they should streamline an FDA approval process or adjust  patent law. Maybe they should subsidize the creation of a generic insulin  brand. </p><p> After all, we spend billions subsidizing solar panels and electric cars  that only rich people can afford. So before you give us a lecture about the  market, remind us we already do that, we're not sure what the best solution  is, we're not scientists or economists. What we can say, this is a real  problem that Congress appears to be ignoring. </p><p> In October, the President pitched a plan to lower drug prices across the  board by tying Medicare reimbursement to drug prices in other countries.  Republicans in Congress and on K Street hate that idea. Pharma's bottom  line is important to them and it's not an unimportant factor. On the other  hand, Americans are dying from easily treated illnesses. That's a factor  too. </p><p> On the left, well, they don't care at all, at least not right now. Their  top priority is impeaching Trump, not collaborating with Trump on  healthcare. And just like on tech and other issues, they're easily  distracted by superficial political signaling. </p><p>Sanofi is one of the companies now driving up insulin prices, but that  company won some degree of credibility from the left last summer and is now  insulated from criticism. Why? Well, because when Roseanne Barr blamed  Ambien for the ill-advised tweets that got her show cancelled, that company  tweeted that racism is not a side effect of its medications. And the left  roared with laughter. Go, big pharma. If only they'd roar about that  company extorting poor Americans with life-saving drugs! </p><p> But just like on immigration or trade or automation or global warming, it  doesn't matter when America's most vulnerable are hurt. It's actual most  vulnerable people no one in D.C. and particularly no one on the left seems  to care. Not their constituency.</p><p> So the debate over the wall on our southern border continues. Not a single  person in Washington, D.C. is in favor of building a wall on our southern  border. They are terrified, not because they think it won't work but  because they believe that it might work and it might clamp down on a  source, a ready source of cheap labor. And that's why they're willing to  risk a government shutdown rather than give a mere $5 million to start the  wall. </p><p> So what is going to happen? Is the wall over? Will the administration  surrender on this? And what will the voters on either side think of the  outcome? </p><p> Dana Perino hosts The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino, of course, the most  popular person here on Fox, and she joins us tonight.</p><p> DANA PERINO, ANCHOR, THE DAILY BRIEFING, FOX NEWS: All right.</p><p> CARLSON: So, Dana, super simple question. Are the people who want the wall  more inflamed than the people who don't want the wall? Which is the more,  in the end, when it's all over, a more powerful, politically powerful  constituency? </p><p> PERINO: I don't think that President Trump has fair weather fans. OK?</p><p> CARLSON: Right. </p><p> PERINO: I think that he has strong supporters who understand that he came  in strong. Right? He said the wall is going to get built. Mexico is going  to pay for it. Like, I never actually really took that seriously in terms  of Mexico paying for it.</p><p> CARLSON: Right. </p><p> PERINO: I do think that--</p><p> CARLSON: It's hard to see.</p><p> PERINO: --he has not done a good enough job persuading people as to the  merits why we need border security even though - look, he's tried, but I do  think that an Oval Office address on immigration security would actually be  very helpful. He could even use visual aids. There's clearly plenty to  show. </p><p> And I think that there might just be a way for him to have a nod to  reality, that he's not going to get this wall funding before the end of the  year. I think they're going to try to figure out a way just to punt this  for a little bit. Now he's going to have a different Congress to work with. </p><p> A lot of those members of Congress had already voted for border security,  which included fencing, which some people might call a wall. But Democrats,  many of them who are running for President, right, they're already in  Congress, they - it's like they can't say the \"W\" word. They can't say  wall. They can call it all sorts of other things, not a wall. I think that  there might be some room for compromise here in the New Year on the merits. </p><p> On the politics of it, well, the Democrats continue to push back against  him, maybe say, oh ha ha, we proved you wrong. Mexico didn't pay for it.  You didn't get your wall. Maybe. But there is a political cost to that as  well. People understand that our borders need to be secure and that we can  be a welcoming, opening, compassionate people at the same time. </p><p> CARLSON: So, for whatever reason, and I do think it's a little more  complicated just Democrats opposing it. I think a lot of Republicans in the  current Congress aren't fully (inaudible) with the wall either. But  whatever reason, hard - impossible to get this through the Congress. What  if the President said he just announced we're pulling our troops out of  Syria? What if he were to say I'm going to take the cost savings from that  and apply it to border security? </p><p> PERINO: Well, he could say that, but it's just not how the system works,  right? There is money that's programmed for certain places. Now, the  President has said to his cabinet, look for any money that we could put  towards this virtual wall, border security, wall, whatever you're going to  call it. </p><p> The Democrats are going to fuss about that because of just technical  reasons of reprogramming money is not that easy to do. But the President  has two opportunities coming up in the next six weeks. He'll have the State  of the Union. That's a big moment. Right? That's all eyes on the President. </p><p> CARLSON: Right. </p><p> PERINO: And then he has about a week later or two weeks later, he  introduces his budget proposal. A budget proposal is a prioritizing  document, and the President could say this is what I agree with. I just  feel like, if his fans are concerned that there's not going to be a wall,  just give him a minute. OK? Give him a chance. This is not a sprint. Right?  He's in a marathon. </p><p> CARLSON: And so you think it is - and you know the system very well. You  think it is at least possible that in the next two years some kind of wall  like structure appears on the southern border?</p><p> PERINO: Well, I just feel like - will there be - is it - this is what I  think is possible. It is possible to get border security funding and for  construction to start. Will that look like a steel wall all across the  border? Probably not. But no matter what President Trump gets in terms of  border security, he is going to call that a wall. He's a good communicator.  He'll figure that out. And no matter what, the Democrats will say, see, we  told you he wasn't going to get that steel wall all across the border. </p><p> But border security, I think, it's a real possibility. I think there're  some new members of Congress that are going to be willing. And remember  this. For Republicans and Democrats, there's a lot more veterans that just  got elected to Congress. They're used to working with the other side. There  are responsible people who care deeply about the national security of the  United States. </p><p> The President ought to invite all of them, Democrats, Republicans, bring  that coalition together. I think that's a really exciting group. And that  America has a lot to be proud of that these veterans have come back and are  still willing to serve their country just in a different way.</p><p> CARLSON: Interesting idea. Thank you.</p><p> PERINO: I know I'm too optimistic for you--</p><p> CARLSON: No--</p><p> PERINO: --a little bit, but--</p><p> CARLSON: No, I don't know - look, I've - trust me. This week, I'm looking  for all optimism possible and you are an ever-flowing well-spring of  optimism. </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PERINO: OK. I'm glad I could be here.</p><p> CARLSON: You are loved. Thank you. Dana Perino--</p><p> PERINO: Thank you. </p><p> CARLSON: --great to see you.</p><p> Well, American forces are withdrawing from Syria. Is that good for the  world? And more important, is it good for the United States? We will unpack  its effects after the break. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: The war on Christmas doesn't exist. Obviously, you know that.  You'd have to be a moron or some kind of Fox News viewer to think there is  a war on Christmas. And nowhere does the war on Christmas exist less than  in China. And that's why the city officials of Langfang, China, have issued  a total ban on the public celebration of Christmas. </p><p> That means no Santa, no lights, and obviously no nativity scenes. The ban  is part of a wider religious crackdown in China, which has seen churches  shut down and believers thrown in prison, a story that hasn't gotten a ton  of ink here among our elites who are getting rich in China.</p><p> In Russia, by contrast, and even in Assad's Syria, millions of Christians  will happily celebrate Christmas without any oppression. Just take a guess  which countries are despised and which ones they suck up to? And maybe  that's why they love China's government so much. Beijing does what  Washington wishes it could do, with efficiency too. </p><p> I want to bring you a major development tonight in America's involvement in  Syria despite heavy pressure from Saudi Arabia and thousands of foreign  policy experts. The United States has managed to avoid a full intervention  into the Syrian civil war, praise God. Now we're finally pulling out the  forces we do have there. Trace Gallagher has more on that. </p><p> Trace?</p><p> TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR, FOX NEWS: Tucker, the decision to remove the  entire U.S. force from Syria, more than 2,000 troops, surprised virtually  everyone, and it officially marked the end of an extended ground campaign  against ISIS. Moments ago, the President released this video statement.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've been President for  almost two years and we've really stepped it up. And we have won against  ISIS. We've beaten them and we've beaten them badly. We have taken back the  land. And now it's time for our troops to come back home. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GALLAGHER: White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said this does not end  the global campaign against ISIS, quoting, \"The United States and our  allies stand ready to re-engage at all levels to defend American interest  whenever necessary.\" But Trump ally and frequent advisor Senator Lindsey  Graham does not like it. Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LINDSEY GRAHAM, REPUBLICAN, SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR: ISIS is more likely to  come back because I don't agree with the President that they're defeated in  Syria and Iraq.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GALLAGHER: Florida Senator Marco Rubio called the decision a major blunder.  Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor John Bolton  have both argued that a precipitous withdrawal in Syria would embolden ISIS  to make a comeback. But Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul applauded the move  and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the U.S. pull-out will  not impede his country's ability to defend itself against regional threats. </p><p> Tucker?</p><p> CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, great to see you tonight. Thank you for that. </p><p>David Tafuri is an attorney. He is the former Obama campaign advisor, and  he joins us tonight. </p><p>David, thanks so much for coming on. So, moments like this are so  instructive because they really do divide the world into very clear  sectors. You sort of know who's on whose side. And I find this interesting  because the rationale has changed. So people are saying we need to fight  ISIS. But that's not really the point. The point is to counterbalance  Russia and Iran. And I'm wondering, is that, A, our goal; B, achievable  with 2,000 troops in Syria? Like, what actually is the goal? I'm losing  track.</p><p>DAVID TAFURI, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Well, there are a couple of  goals. It's to fight ISIS. It's also to push back on Iran and on Russia. So  what's stunning about this development is all of President Trump's foreign  policy advisors and top military advisors were against this decision. And  he reversed them today, suddenly, in a rash decision. </p><p> Now, the reason why we should stay in Syria--</p><p> CARLSON: But that's the same people who think we should stay in  Afghanistan, right? So how much--</p><p>TAFURI: Some of them are the same, but--</p><p> CARLSON: How much credible--</p><p>TAFURI: --the reasons are different. </p><p> CARLSON: --ones you say that you have? </p><p>TAFURI: The reasons are different.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. </p><p>TAFURI: Look, Trump's top policy advisor said we are going to stay in Syria  until we have, one, rolled back Iran. That has not happened. Two, defeated  ISIS. We have made major progress in fighting ISIS, but we haven't fully  defeated them. I was in Iraq in October. Nobody on the ground in Iraq tells  me we defeated ISIS there. And ISIS is even stronger in Syria, still.  Moreover, all of Trump's policy advisors have said we should stay in Syria  until there's a political solution in Syria. None of those three things  have happened.</p><p> Wouldn't it be a wrong thing if the most--</p><p> CARLSON: Wait, wait, wait. Can I just--</p><p>TAFURI: Go ahead. </p><p> CARLSON: --stress maybe another option? So there wasn't actually ISIS in  Syria when the Assad government controlled the whole country. Christians  and other religious minorities, a lot of them, lived in relative peace. Now  they're hunted down and murdered. Why wouldn't it just be the simplest,  most elegant best solution for everyone involved if Assad managed his  entire country again?</p><p>TAFURI: Because you are ignoring the history and the development of the  revolution in Syria. The revolution in Syria happened--</p><p> CARLSON: It just happened a few years ago. </p><p>TAFURI: It happened organically. It began in 2011. It happened organically.  Right? And so Syria was an authoritarian state before that with tons of  oppression. Maybe Christians were OK there. </p><p> CARLSON: Is there a non-authoritarian--</p><p>TAFURI: But - but people were not - people were--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CARLSON: Is there a non-authoritarian state in that region other than  Israel? </p><p>TAFURI: There are - there are less authoritarian states-- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CARLSON: Oh. But they're all authoritarian-- </p><p>TAFURI: --much less authoritarian--</p><p> CARLSON: --there. I mean, Jordan is an authoritarian state. Criticize the  king and see what happens. So, like, that's the rule in the region. </p><p>TAFURI: You cannot compare Jordan to Syria. </p><p> CARLSON: I'm not attacking--</p><p>TAFURI: You can't even compare Syria to Iraq--</p><p> CARLSON: I'm not attacking Jordan. </p><p>TAFURI: --which has a fledgling democracy. </p><p> CARLSON: I'm just saying authoritarian justifies nothing. They're all  authoritarians, OK? </p><p>TAFURI: OK. But the point is that this was an organic revolution. The U.S.  didn't start this revolution. It's started by the Syrian people, majority  of whom are Sunni Arabs. They stood up against Assad. He chose - rather  than to reconcile with them, he chose to mow them down and slaughter tens  of thousands of innocent, peaceful protesters. </p><p> CARLSON: No--</p><p>TAFURI: That's how the revolution began.</p><p> CARLSON: I'm sure Assad's - OK. But I'm not defending Assad's character.  I'm merely saying--</p><p>TAFURI: Good. </p><p> CARLSON: --from the perspective--</p><p>TAFURI: You shouldn't. </p><p> CARLSON: Why would I? </p><p>TAFURI: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: I'm not Syrian. I don't work for Assad. I'm an American. And I  want to know what's best for us. And if you're worried about the chaos and  the huge refugee problems caused by this civil war and by the emergence of  ISIS, again, abetted by the civil war, then why wouldn't you long for the  days where Christians could live unmolested in Syria under this  authoritarian Assad? I'm totally missing it. What am I missing?</p><p>TAFURI: Because that's not - this is actually going to cause more refugees.  OK? Northern - northeastern Syria right now is secure. The reason it's  secure is because of the great work by our U.S. Special Forces working with  the SDF, the local Syrian and moderate Sunni forces on the ground. They've  secured it. And actually, there are less refugees coming from that area.  The people can say they're peaceful.</p><p> CARLSON: How did the--</p><p>TAFURI: They're not getting bombed by Assad. </p><p> CARLSON: How do the Christians - how do the Christians do? </p><p>TAFURI: And when we pull out - when we pull out, it's going to cause a  massive wave of Syrian refugees again because forces are going to go in and  slaughter the forces--</p><p> CARLSON: Forces. </p><p>TAFURI: --that we've been working with on the ground. </p><p> CARLSON: Yes. </p><p>TAFURI: Assad's forces, Iranian, Shia militia forces, and possibly even  Russian forces.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. And so we're responsible for that? </p><p>TAFURI: Well--</p><p> CARLSON: Because - so this is halfway around the world. We have crises like  Venezuela's collapses right there. Mexico has probably as many murders as  Syria - I mean, not close. Right? So, like, I'm just saying there are a lot  of things going on. But we have a moral obligation to keep 2,000 American  troops in this country around the world because why - I'm honest - I'm  confused. </p><p>TAFURI: Well, first of all, we are there already, and it's successful. So  why pull out? We also do have some obligations of forces on the ground--</p><p> CARLSON: It's successful in what way? </p><p>TAFURI: --who fought - who fought bravely alongside us. Moreover, this is  going to impact us because ISIS will come back. And if we don't have forces  on the ground to monitor ISIS and to continue to combat ISIS, ISIS will  come back. ISIS are sworn enemies of the U.S. they want to kill Americans. </p><p> CARLSON: Right. </p><p>TAFURI: And when they become stronger in Syria, they'll strike out against  America again. </p><p> CARLSON: So by this--</p><p>TAFURI: So your viewers should worry about their own security because of  this decision. </p><p> CARLSON: Well, there are a lot of reasons to worry about our own security.  A lot.</p><p>TAFURI: Sure. </p><p> CARLSON: Many. And our mental health and our economy and our healthcare  system. A lot of things to worry about. But by the standards that you've  just articulated, like we're never going to leave there or Afghanistan or  any place that we've been for more than eight months. So--</p><p>TAFURI: I wouldn't say we're never going to leave there. But we have to see  progress on the ground. We have to see full defeat of ISIS.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. </p><p>TAFURI: We have to see political progress--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CARLSON: --why shouldn't--</p><p>TAFURI: --towards a peaceful revolution in Syria, and there ought to be a  democracy in Syria.</p><p> CARLSON: Why shouldn't--</p><p>TAFURI: And then we can leave. </p><p> CARLSON: Who cares about - who cares about that? The question--</p><p>TAFURI: Who care about democracy?</p><p> CARLSON: --that I care about - I'll tell you what I care about is what's  happening to the Christians there? Like, nobody cares. I don't understand.  We invade Iraq. There's a huge Christian community. They'll leave. </p><p>TAFURI: Well, who are killing the Christians in Iraq?</p><p> CARLSON: I'm not--</p><p>TAFURI: ISIS. </p><p> CARLSON: Look--</p><p>TAFURI: ISIS. </p><p> CARLSON: Of course-- </p><p>TAFURI: And--</p><p> CARLSON: --but I'm just saying why don't we make it an explicit--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p>TAFURI: Islamic militants are killing Christians in Iraq. </p><p> CARLSON: I'm not defending ISIS. I'm just saying, why don't we make it an  explicit concern of the United States to protect the Christians? But we  don't. </p><p>TAFURI: It is an explicit--</p><p> CARLSON: No, it's not-- </p><p>TAFURI: --concern. </p><p> CARLSON: --actually. We don't let in the end. </p><p>TAFURI: It's an explicit concern of the U.S. to protect all minorities in  Syria and Iraq, of which the Christian minorities are important part of. </p><p> CARLSON: They don't seem that important to anyone here. </p><p> Anyway, I hope they are. They're important to me. I'm glad they're  important to you. David, thank you. </p><p>TAFURI: Yes. Thank you. </p><p> CARLSON: Democrats claim to care about sexual harassment so very much  because they're good people. Are they prepared to expose the congressman  who paid your tax dollars in hush money to accusers? It's a pretty simple  question. We'll see if we can get an answer after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well, a couple weeks ago, we invited on this program a New York  Senator named Kevin Parker. He's a Democrat. He wants to force all citizens  in the State of New York to turn over their social media password so their  accounts can be inspected by the thought-police before they buy guns. If  they say something naughty or threatening, no gun. </p><p> Well, given that, we are fascinated to see the news yesterday. Parker grew  angry with the Republican spokeswoman and tweeted her this. \"Kill  yourself.\" Well, the irony, obviously, pretty obvious. So Parker  apologized. He said he was making a donation to the National Alliance on  Mental Illness. We applaud that. </p><p> Has he learned the lesson embedded in his own actions though? The anti-gun  bill he sponsored is still pending in the New York State legislature. We've  asked Senator Parker to come back on this show, so he can explain once  again why he ought to have the power to police thought-crime on Twitter.  And by the way, should he, given his record, be allowed to own a gun? So  far, his office has not responded, but we'll keep asking him. Great guest.  Happy to have him again.</p><p> Well, yesterday in Capitol Hill, the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  sharply attacked a proposal to give the President an immigration  enforcement slush fund, as he called it. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHARLES SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Leader McConnell proposed the  bipartisan Senate DHS bill, which has $1.6 billion for border security plus  a $1 billion slush fund for the President to use for his radical  immigration agenda. I called Leader McConnell and told him we would not  accept their $1 billion slush fund and that our offers to fund the  government remain. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Now, don't take those words the wrong way. The problem Democrats  have is with border enforcement. They don't have a problem with slush  funds. Congress loves slush funds. That's why, for years, Congress has  maintained a slush fund at your expense, taxpayer funded, to pay off people  who accuse members of Congress of sexual harassment. </p><p> The Democrats will control the House in just a couple of weeks, of course.  Are they going to end the slush fund, and more to the point, will they tell  us who has been protected by it? What are the names?</p><p> Penny Nance is President of Concerned Women for America, and she joins us  tonight. </p><p> Penny, thanks so much for coming on. This seems like a very simple ask. Why  shouldn't the public know who got paid with our money to settle these  claims? </p><p> PENNY NANCE, PRESIDENT, CONCERNED WOMEN FOR AMERICA: That's a very good  question. And by the way, Concerned Women for America members sent  thousands of petitions asking Congress to tell us. Over 20 years, 264  cases, $15 million of our money was paid out to hide what members of  Congress did. And these weren't little allegations. These were big things. </p><p> We have the case of Blake Farenthold, who sexually harassed his  communications director, shared his sexual fantasies about her. And when  she dared to complain, he fired her. And you remember Eric Massa and his  groping of young men, and then he called it tickle fights. He had to pay  out $100,000--</p><p> CARLSON: And that was--</p><p> NANCE: --of our money.</p><p> CARLSON: --taxpayer money.</p><p> NANCE: Taxpayer money. And we were never paid back. Now, Congress did just  pass a piece of compromise legislation, but it doesn't do anything about  what we just talked about. It doesn't pay back at all the slush fund that  the taxpayers paid out to cover up the wrongdoing by members of Congress.</p><p> CARLSON: Now, do we know the identities of the people on whose behalf these  payments were made?</p><p> NANCE: No. And we have tried - and by the way, FOIA doesn't apply to  Congress. Isn't that interesting?</p><p> CARLSON: So - I mean, so Nancy Pelosi, who obviously is America's chief  defender of women--</p><p> NANCE: Right. </p><p> CARLSON: --I mean, she's told us that many times, and a deeply good person.  She's told us that too. She'll be in charge of this. </p><p> NANCE: Yes. </p><p> CARLSON: So she can release these names if she wanted to. Will she want to?  Will she?</p><p> NANCE: We have called on her to do that, but she so far has chosen to  shield her colleagues. She even went as far as to say that John Conyers was  a hero and a great American. Remember John Conyers was hosting meetings  with his staff in his underwear and was caught on film - caught on video on  a airline flight on the taxpayer dollars watching porn. This is the guy, by  the way, who used to be the Judiciary Committee Chairman who had oversight  over pornography. So you can't make this stuff up. </p><p> The new bill does make some improvements and, going forward, requires  restitution. But it's not clear whether or not even then we'll know for  sure, going forward, who actually is the perpetrator. Because in the new  legislation, you just disclose the office. It could be the Chief of Staff,  it could be the legislative director, it could be the Press Secretary, and  like they're going to write off their boss. So--</p><p> CARLSON: Or it could be the member.</p><p> NANCE: It could be the member. And that's the point. We've got to have more  transparency. And we're not going to let this go. </p><p> CARLSON: You will keep pushing? </p><p> NANCE: I will keep pushing. I promise.</p><p> CARLSON: Penny Nance, it seems like a simple ask. </p><p> NANCE: It does. </p><p> CARLSON: I hope you get it. </p><p> NANCE: Thank you. </p><p> CARLSON: Thanks very much. </p><p> NANCE: Thank you. </p><p> CARLSON: Well, as you've seen tonight, permanent Washington cares a great  deal about protecting the way things are, the status quo. It's great for  them. They get richer and they can believe, and many do believe that they  are morally superior to you. And that's why they destroy anyone who  threatens the status quo. </p><p> Mike Flynn, for example, is being destroyed. Mark Zuckerberg lied as well.  He's being protected because he's on the side of the people who make those  decisions. That's also why the establishment has become so obsessed with  crushing free speech. It's getting harder and harder for them to win  arguments on the merits. </p><p> The best option then is to keep the arguments from being made at all. When  you can tar your opponent as immoral, as a bigot, you don't have to defend  you own position, you can just do what you want. You can also ruin the  lives of anyone who gets in your way and feel good about it. </p><p> How do we get to this place? So that entire story is in a new book called  Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Bringing America to the Brink  of Revolution. Christmas is coming. This tells a story that might rattle  you, but it's still worth knowing. You can find it on our website,  tuckercarlson.com.</p><p> That's about it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m.,  the show that is the sworn enemy - and we mean it - of lying, pomposity,  smugness and groupthink; the show that says what we think is true, whether  they like it or not. </p><p> Good night from Washington. Sean Hannity is next. Dan Bongino is sitting  in--</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

We begin this show with some shocking news. Lying has been detected here in  Washington. Mendacity, deceit, duplicitousness (ph), saying things that  aren't true that here my arms is going up just telling you about this. But  it happened. And we can prove it. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, to be clear, news anchors didn't do it. News anchors don't lie.  They're good people. Neither do professional cable news commentators, the  one making millions on the side as lobbyists for foreign governments or big  multinational corporations. Commentators always tell the truth. And that's  why they, and their scrupulously honest news anchor friends are so utterly  disgusted tonight, horrified really by what retired General Michael Flynn  has done. Watch their stunned reactions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON LEMON, ANCHOR, CNN: Michael Flynn lied to the FBI. Flynn lied again and  again and again to FBI agents. Just lied. Lies, lies, and more lies. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Hold on for just a minute about who is significant and who is not.  Flynn lied. The tone should be when you speak to a prosecutor, you speak to  the truth. Everybody lied. </p><p>LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, ANCHOR, MSNBC: Michael Flynn was betraying his country.  Michael Flynn was betraying his office. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: \"He lied,\" says Don Lemon and his news anchors friend. Lied, lied,  lied. He's a very bad man, a lying kind of man. The worst kind. He could  never work in television. For his crime of lying, Michael Flynn, the liar,  may soon be locked away in a cell. That would keep the rest of us safe from  his perfidious lies. That day can't come fast enough say the news anchors.  Cuff him. America longs to breathe free once more. </p><p>Michael Flynn will be 60 years old next week. The Washington Post  calculates he faces five years in prison. And let that be a warning to all  of us. That's what happens to people who lie in Washington. Or does it?</p><p>From a golf course somewhere in Dubai, you can almost hear Bill Clinton  chuckling softly. Lied under oath, still making $300,000 a speech; not  everyone faces the same penalties for lying it turns out.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg came to Washington last spring to talk about Facebook  that's the sole destroying social media company that has made him a  multibillionaire. While in town, Zuckerberg stopped by the Congress where -  and you might want to ask the kids to leave the room for this - he lied.  Yep. Don't tell Don Lemon. But Mark Zuckerberg is a liar. Watch him do it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: This is the most important principle for  Facebook. Every piece of content that you share on Facebook, you own and  you have complete control over who sees it and how you share it. And you  can remove it at any time. </p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA: Are you willing to give me more control  over my data? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Senator, as somebody who uses Facebook, I believe that you  should have complete control over your data.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. You have complete control over your data. You control who  sees it. You own it. That's really the most important principle at  Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg says so with a completely straight face. </p><p>The only problem, it was a lie. Sorry, kids. According to a piece in the  New York Times, Facebook does not actually allow you or anyone else to  control your data. Not at all. In fact, they secretly hand over your data,  personal data, to other big tech companies. Now, that decision has made  Mark Zuckerberg even richer, adding on to the house in Hawaii probably.  Unfortunately, he's had to lie in the process, including to Congress, and  that's a crime. </p><p>As Robespierre once famously noted, \"You can't make an omelet without  breaking a few eggs.\" In this case, the eggs are your privacy. Apparently,  Facebook allowed Microsoft search engine, Bing, to see the names of your  Facebook friends without telling you about it. Facebook also allowed  Netflix and Spotify to read your private messages without telling you. </p><p>Now, there's no evidence so far as of tonight that Facebook has a video  camera hidden in your shower, but close enough. That's what Mark Zuckerberg  lied about. Not a small lie, really. </p><p>What did Mike Flynn lie about? Well, according to the FBI, Flynn lied about  conversations he had had with the Russian Ambassador Kislyak. You remember  him. Flynn said that he and Kislyak had never talked about expelling  Russian diplomats or about Russia voting in the U.N. on symbolic  resolutions. And in fact, they had talked about both of those things. The  feds already knew that because they were listening in, secretly. </p><p>There was nothing improper about the conversations that Flynn and Kislyak  had. The crime was the lie. It's always the crime. Except when it's Mark  Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg can lie about something that affects hundreds  of millions of Americans, but it's not really a big deal. Zuckerberg is not  looking at five years in prison. Zuckerberg will not be sanctioned by  Congress ever. </p><p>So what's the difference? Well, unlike Mike Flynn, Mark Zuckerberg is a  hero to the American news media. He is who they want to be. He is richer  than God. He went to Harvard. He wears T-shirts at work for real. He's for  open borders. All the cool people like Mark Zuckerberg, even foreign  countries. </p><p>For example, when the fascist government of China was looking for new tools  to oppress its own population, you think they went to Mike Flynn for help?  Yes, OK. I don't think so. Flynn is tough on china, old fashioned as he is.  But Mark Zuckerberg, by contrast, was happy to help. </p><p>As they say at McKenzie, Mark Zuckerberg gets it. </p><p>Boy, what has Mike Flynn ever done for anyone? 33 years in uniform? That's  not very innovative. Two lies told by two high-profile Americans. One is  going to prison in late middle age. The other will be available for like 40  years for commencement addresses and awards dinners held in his honor.  That's the tale of Mike Flynn and Mark Zuckerberg. It tells you everything. </p><p>Joining us now to break down what's happening to Mike Flynn is Harvard Law  Professor Emeritus, Alan Dershowitz. He is the case of the book - the  author, rather, of the book The Case Against Impeaching Trump. </p><p>Professor, thanks very much for coming on. So I read in The Washington Post  this morning--</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Well, thank you so much. </p><p>CARLSON: --I read Mike Flynn described as a double agent in The Washington  Post. And then I saw the Judge Sullivan yesterday describe him as someone  who had committed treason. Is that the crime for which he is facing prison? </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: No, not at all. And I'll get to that in a second. But Tucker, I  just want to make one point. I hope you don't mind me making it. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARLSON: --you will.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: I hate boycotts and attempts - I hope - I hate boycotts and  attempts to censor free speech. I'm in favor of complete dialogue. But as  such, I feel impelled to tell you that I, with due respect, disagree with  the way you categorize mass immigration. That's all. I just want to say  that. And--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's OK. And by the way--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Now--</p><p>CARLSON: I would expect that you would. We differ probably on a lot of  issues. But the one issue that we--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Right. </p><p>CARLSON: --agree on and that--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Yes. </p><p>CARLSON: --I respect you for is your willingness to say what you think in  public to defend your views, to have a conversation and to let others  decide which side is right. And that's something that I wish we were able  to do a lot more of. But you're one of the only liberals who will come on  this show. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: I completely agree.</p><p>CARLSON: Amen. So thank you very much for saying that. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Well, I agree. And I come on this show because I also have the  right to say what I think and when I disagree with you, you'll allow me to  say I disagree with you. And I do. I wish you hadn't used that language.  Language like that was used to describe my grandparents and great  grandparents and probably some of yours. So let's move on. But--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, actually, just in point of--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --I would hope you--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARLSON: --just in point of fact since you brought it up, as noted on  Monday--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Yes. </p><p>CARLSON: That was in the context of a conversation with an elected official  in Tijuana about the filth--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Right. </p><p>CARLSON: --of his city and he was complaining about how dirty it had  become, which was a byproduct of the policy decisions pushed by the  American left and I noted. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: I understand that. </p><p>CARLSON: There's a lesson there perhaps for us. So I'm not - and I would  never describe people as inherently dirty. I don't think that they are and  pro-people. That's one of the reasons I'm against abortion, strongly. But  anyway, whatever. The point is, I wish we were able--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Yes - no. I'm glad you - I'm glad you cleared that up. Yes. </p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Well, I mean, I think it was clear and I think that the  people who are mischaracterizing it are always welcome on the show to talk  it through and to hear my side and I will hear their side because, again,  this is one of the last forums in America for open conversation. </p><p>Anyway - but tell me that--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: That's very fair. Let's--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Well, I mean, that--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --turn to Flynn. Yes. OK. </p><p>CARLSON: --that's how I feel. I'm not afraid to defend what I think,  obviously. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: No, I - look, I agree. Neither am I. On the Flynn issue, look,  there's a big issue. I've been teaching this for 50 years. Should it really  ever be a crime to lie when you're not under oath? </p><p>I think you can make a very, very strong case that before you can be  convicted of a crime for lying, you should have to raise your hand, put it  on a Bible, look to your God or look to your ethics, have a solemn moment  where you look the person in the face and swear to him that you are going  to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. </p><p>That's so different from when two guys evade the usual procedures, come in  to try to hang out with you and be chummy, say you don't need a lawyer, we  just want to ask you a couple of questions--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --and then trap him by asking him questions that they already  knew the answer to and had videotapes and audiotapes that could make it  clear that they are only asking him the question in order to give him an  opportunity to lie. </p><p>So I really do think that we have kind of three criteria. Just lying  politically. It's done too often. I hate it. But it's done too often. It's  not a crime. Second, lying only to government officials, which is a crime  but probably shouldn't be a crime, or if it is, it should be a misdemeanor,  not a serious felony akin to raising your right arm and swearing under oath  that you will tell the truth. </p><p>There's too much lying in Washington and there are too many, as you point  out correctly, double standards about who is prosecuted for lying. In civil  cases, people lie in depositions all the time. And they're never  prosecuted. I tried to bring a case recently against people who lied.  Prosecutors laugh at you. Lying in a deposition? That's like gambling in  Casablanca. It's just done all the time, and it's tragic that it's done. </p><p>I testified in front of Congress about this. When they were going after  Bill Clinton and trying to - and impeaching him for his lies. I had a whole  session where I talked about how many lies are told in how many different  places and how selective they are in going after people. That's one of the  problems of not requiring an oath. It gives you the opportunity to  selectively pick people to prosecute for lying not under oath. </p><p>CARLSON: We're almost out of time, but - it is a lie to - I mean - rather,  it is a crime to lie to federal investigators, but it's not a crime for  them to lie to you. Why?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: No, not only that. The Supreme Court has said it's perfectly OK  for police and FBI agents to lie to you, and that happens every day. You'll  have two people who they suspect of a crime. They'll bring one person in  and say, oh, by the way, your buddy just ratted you out, just turned you  in, you're going to get executed unless you tell us that he did it too. And  of course, it was a total lie. They say the same thing to the other person.  And the Supreme Court has said, lying by FBI agents, lying by federal  officials is permissible and (inaudible) it's done all the time. </p><p>CARLSON: Right. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: But if you lie back to them, then it's a crime. It's even a  crime, the Supreme Court has said, to deny that you did something. If  somebody asks you, \"Did you do something, a crime?\" --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --and you say, \"No,\" and you did, you've doubled your  punishment by now lying about whether you committed a crime. The irony  about Flynn is he wasn't lying about committing a crime. He did nothing  wrong. What he did was perfectly legal. I'm still scratching my head and  trying to figure out why he lied. What was his motive? </p><p>CARLSON: I was thinking - I saw a little--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Is it possible he misremembered? </p><p>CARLSON: I mean - and by the way--</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Yes. Now, he did say the court--</p><p>CARLSON: --why were the feds spying on the incoming national security  advisor? Is that normal? I don't know. Professor, thank you very much. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ: No. Comey told us. Comey said, look, I could get away with it,  Comey said.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I don't know. I don't think you should be spying on members  of your own executive branch unless there's a good reason to do that. But  anyway, thank you very much. Good to see you.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Right. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, yesterday, the President accused the Mueller investigation  of intentionally and illegally deleting 19,000 text messages, those are  between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. The DOJ claims the text messages were  not erased intentionally, but they were lost due to technical errors. </p><p>Speaking of lying, is that a lie or is it true? Tom Fitton, the President  of Judicial Watch, joins us tonight. Really simple. It's hard to believe  that the Department of Justice would lie about something like that. Are  they? Are they not?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: Well, we don't know the truth. We've  got these two categories of text messages. These are the text messages the  DOJ had or the FBI had back when Page and Strzok were not members of the  Mueller special counsel team. And there was a gap in terms of capturing  those text messages. And there were about 19,000--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. </p><p>FITTON: --that were subsequently recovered supposedly by the IG. And then  they go work for Mueller's operation. They get removed because of these  text messages that they were sending around, talking about insurance  policies against Trump and being pro-Hillary. And IG asked for their phone  because he wants to look at more of these text messages. And their phones  have been wiped, have been reset. Unrecoverable. </p><p>We don't know how many text messages were erased by the Mueller special  counsel operation. They remove him for - Page - removed Strzok specifically  for misconduct and bias that was found in his text messages, but no one  looks at his text messages from the time he was in the Mueller special  counsel operation, the most sensitive investigation the Justice Department  has been involved in in decades. Unbelievable. </p><p>CARLSON: Investigations are, by definition, supposed to be preserving  evidence. So - I mean, do you think it's plausible that the Mueller people  might have been implicated in erasing evidence? I mean, that - that just  seems like shocking. </p><p>FITTON: Well, you know what? Manafort was accused of withholding evidence.  You know what they did. They didn't know for sure whether he was. They  issued a search warrant and they raided his home with guns drawn and no  warning. </p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I noticed. </p><p>FITTON: That's not what happens when the government erases evidence on  purpose or accidentally. And it's so bad, the special counsel. You see in  the Flynn investigation questions about how that investigation was handled?  Now we have these missing text messages and the Strzok--</p><p>CARLSON: It really makes you wish we had elected officials in this country  who could protect the rest of from us these abuses. I wonder where they  are.</p><p>FITTON: We need a special counsel for the special counsel.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. How about just someone who'd like (ph) to do something? Thank  you very much. </p><p>FITTON: You're welcome. </p><p>CARLSON: Mark Zuckerberg hid the truth from Congress. He lied. So lawmakers  planning to do anything about his lies? We'll ask an incoming senator about  that next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: So Mark Zuckerberg just got caught lying in front of Congress  about selling the deeply private data of more than 200 million Americans,  probably your data by the way, is one of the more flagrant abuses big tech  has committed recently. There's a long list of those. But it's hardly the  only abuse. All the major tech platforms have colluded to silence opinions  they don't like and to destroy the people who express those opinions.  They've done this in the open. We've watched it happen. </p><p>Google employees secretly, meanwhile, discussed hiding conservative  websites and search results because they're just not legitimate. Facebook's  founding president Sean Parker admitted that his company created an  intentionally addictive product, like cigarettes, that could destroy  children's brains, which is exactly, of course, what it's done. </p><p>It all adds up to a terrifying picture, a serious menace to this country,  to a democracy, to our mental health - check the numbers on that sometime -  to our cohesion as a nation. It's a real threat, obviously. And everybody  knows it. How is Congress doing protecting us from any of these threats?  Good question. They're not. And they're not even trying. </p><p>And if you're wondering why they're not trying, the answer might be, in  part anyway, the outgoing Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Ryan didn't seem  interested in reigning in the tech companies in any way, when he was the  third most powerful man in America. In part, he was too busy preventing a  wall from being built on our southern border to get to the tech question. </p><p>But there might have been other reasons we're just speculating now. Now  that he is leaving the Congress and moving to the private sector, will Paul  Ryan be taking any money from any of the big tech firms like Facebook or  Google or Twitter? Seemed like an interesting question. Obvious, but then  no one has asked. So we called Paul Ryan's office today and we asked that  question. We haven't got an answer yet. And it's 8:20 p.m. Eastern. We're  going to keep checking and get back to you when they respond.</p><p>So the leadership of the House, of course, is changing. Democrats are  taking over. But the Republicans still hold the Senate. Is there any  interest, will there be, in reigning in tech at all? </p><p>Josh Hawley was just elected Senator. He's a Republican from Missouri, and  he joins us tonight. </p><p>Mr. Senator Elect, thanks very much for coming on. Now, I'm not going to  force you to join me in pointing fingers as to why this hasn't been done up  to this point. But I will ask the question, do you think the Congress,  maybe on a bipartisan basis going forward, will recognize that maybe  there's some tweaking that needs to be done in the government's  relationship with these companies?</p><p>JOSH HAWLEY, REPUBLICAN, MISSOURI SENATOR-ELECT: Tucker, thanks for having  me on. And I certainly hope so. I mean, it's time that Congress got serious  about protecting the privacy, the data, the personal confidential  information of hundreds of millions of Americans. </p><p>And to see this report today that Facebook has allowed these big tech  companies, Amazon, Microsoft, Spotify, Netflix to have access to the  personal information of users, after Facebook said that it would not allow,  it would not give away users' personal data is really extraordinary. And  look, it's time Congress did something about it. It's time the FTC did  something about it.</p><p>CARLSON: So you often hear people say, well, Congress can't actually act to  regulate these companies because its members are too old and they don't  understand technology. I'll freely admit I don't understand technology at  all. I try not to participate in it at any level. And yet the abuses are so  obvious to me. That doesn't really seem like a very good excuse.</p><p>HAWLEY: Well, listen, I mean, what needs to happen here is, number one,  Facebook promised the FTC in 2011 in a binding consent decree. They said  that they would not share personal, private confidential data of users  without the users' consent. Well, Tucker, it looks like that's exactly what  Facebook is doing though that they are sharing that data in order to make a  profit, as you pointed out, without users' consent. </p><p>So, number one, FTC needs to enforce the consent decree, they need to  investigate right now, whether or not Facebook has violated it. Number two,  Congress needs to investigate and Congress needs to take steps to protect  the privacy of Americans. They need to make sure that Americans own their  own data and can protect it. </p><p>CARLSON: So this is a little bit out of left field. But I think that maybe  there is a connection. The CDC just came out with the suicide numbers. And  suicide is one of the leading causes of death in this country. Its  incidences dramatically increased. And all of this in middle age, people  tragically have killed themselves recently. There is a lot of speculation  and some evidence that there's a connection between increased use of tech  products and this tragic epidemic of suicide. </p><p>Is anyone, do you think, at the federal level going to look a little more  closely into this? It seems like something worth investigating.</p><p>HAWLEY: I think it is worth studying. And I think that - look, it's time  that we asked about the role of big tech in our lives. I mean, we've--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. </p><p>HAWLEY: --you've talked a lot about the sweetheart deals big tech gets from  government. I think it's time we took a hard look at those. I think it's  time we looked at the effect big tech is having on our personal lives, on  our families, on our schools, on our society. These are major companies.  Many of them monopolies. They make billions of dollars a year. There've  never been more powerful companies in the history of the world, and they  need to be held accountable.</p><p>CARLSON: Man! I wish I was in Missouri, so I could vote for you again. I  just - I - it's so nice to hear an elected official say that. I'm sorry to  suck up. I couldn't control myself. </p><p>Mr. Hawley, thank you very much.</p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, we're just hours away right now from a potential government  shutdown. The debate is over funding for the border wall. Will there be a  border wall or has that dream died? Details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Insulin is one of the basic human hormones. Everyone needs insulin  to live. Diabetics, though, can't properly produce insulin. And that's a  big question in this country. In America right now, about 6 million people  are dependent on daily injections of insulin just to survive. It's a great  thing that they can do that. </p><p>Almost a century ago, scientists discovered how to produce synthetic  insulin. The scientists who did that sold the patents to a university for  $1. Their goal was to help humanity. That's why they did that. It turned  out to be one of the great health advances in human history. </p><p>Diabetes went from almost a certain death sentence to a manageable illness,  as it is today or was. Cheaply available insulin has extended the lives of  tens of millions of people. But in this country, that seems to be changing. </p><p>For the last 20 years or so, the price of insulin has been rising very  quickly, even relative to other healthcare costs. When top insulin drug,  NovoLog, rose in price 353 percent in just 14 years. It isn't exceptional,  and the growth has shown no signs of stopping. </p><p>Thanks to these price hikes, millions of diabetics have started rationing  their insulin, gambling with their health and likely shortening their lives  to save money. They have no choice. A cheap medicine that your parents took  for granted increasingly is inaccessible to poor Americans though, already  the group most likely to suffer from diabetes in the first place, as you  probably know. </p><p>Now, there are a lot of reasons this is happening. One is the drug  companies keep slightly tweaking their formulas so their drugs never leave  patent and generic competitors can't enter the market to compete with them. </p><p>Another reason is rigid FDA regulations, which make it costly and time- consuming to put a new insulin drug in the market. Pharmaceutical companies  use legal challenges to deter competition too. Of course, most companies do  do that. And of course, greed plays a role, too. That's a word that we  don't use very often, but it's still real. One of the deadly sins for good  reason. </p><p>But whatever the reasons for the spike in prices of insulin, it's a huge  problem. And you would think it's something that Congress and the  administration would consider taking action on. There are some things they  could do. Maybe they should streamline an FDA approval process or adjust  patent law. Maybe they should subsidize the creation of a generic insulin  brand. </p><p>After all, we spend billions subsidizing solar panels and electric cars  that only rich people can afford. So before you give us a lecture about the  market, remind us we already do that, we're not sure what the best solution  is, we're not scientists or economists. What we can say, this is a real  problem that Congress appears to be ignoring. </p><p>In October, the President pitched a plan to lower drug prices across the  board by tying Medicare reimbursement to drug prices in other countries.  Republicans in Congress and on K Street hate that idea. Pharma's bottom  line is important to them and it's not an unimportant factor. On the other  hand, Americans are dying from easily treated illnesses. That's a factor  too. </p><p>On the left, well, they don't care at all, at least not right now. Their  top priority is impeaching Trump, not collaborating with Trump on  healthcare. And just like on tech and other issues, they're easily  distracted by superficial political signaling. </p><p>Sanofi is one of the companies now driving up insulin prices, but that  company won some degree of credibility from the left last summer and is now  insulated from criticism. Why? Well, because when Roseanne Barr blamed  Ambien for the ill-advised tweets that got her show cancelled, that company  tweeted that racism is not a side effect of its medications. And the left  roared with laughter. Go, big pharma. If only they'd roar about that  company extorting poor Americans with life-saving drugs! </p><p>But just like on immigration or trade or automation or global warming, it  doesn't matter when America's most vulnerable are hurt. It's actual most  vulnerable people no one in D.C. and particularly no one on the left seems  to care. Not their constituency.</p><p>So the debate over the wall on our southern border continues. Not a single  person in Washington, D.C. is in favor of building a wall on our southern  border. They are terrified, not because they think it won't work but  because they believe that it might work and it might clamp down on a  source, a ready source of cheap labor. And that's why they're willing to  risk a government shutdown rather than give a mere $5 million to start the  wall. </p><p>So what is going to happen? Is the wall over? Will the administration  surrender on this? And what will the voters on either side think of the  outcome? </p><p>Dana Perino hosts The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino, of course, the most  popular person here on Fox, and she joins us tonight.</p><p>DANA PERINO, ANCHOR, THE DAILY BRIEFING, FOX NEWS: All right.</p><p>CARLSON: So, Dana, super simple question. Are the people who want the wall  more inflamed than the people who don't want the wall? Which is the more,  in the end, when it's all over, a more powerful, politically powerful  constituency? </p><p>PERINO: I don't think that President Trump has fair weather fans. OK?</p><p>CARLSON: Right. </p><p>PERINO: I think that he has strong supporters who understand that he came  in strong. Right? He said the wall is going to get built. Mexico is going  to pay for it. Like, I never actually really took that seriously in terms  of Mexico paying for it.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. </p><p>PERINO: I do think that--</p><p>CARLSON: It's hard to see.</p><p>PERINO: --he has not done a good enough job persuading people as to the  merits why we need border security even though - look, he's tried, but I do  think that an Oval Office address on immigration security would actually be  very helpful. He could even use visual aids. There's clearly plenty to  show. </p><p>And I think that there might just be a way for him to have a nod to  reality, that he's not going to get this wall funding before the end of the  year. I think they're going to try to figure out a way just to punt this  for a little bit. Now he's going to have a different Congress to work with. </p><p>A lot of those members of Congress had already voted for border security,  which included fencing, which some people might call a wall. But Democrats,  many of them who are running for President, right, they're already in  Congress, they - it's like they can't say the \"W\" word. They can't say  wall. They can call it all sorts of other things, not a wall. I think that  there might be some room for compromise here in the New Year on the merits. </p><p>On the politics of it, well, the Democrats continue to push back against  him, maybe say, oh ha ha, we proved you wrong. Mexico didn't pay for it.  You didn't get your wall. Maybe. But there is a political cost to that as  well. People understand that our borders need to be secure and that we can  be a welcoming, opening, compassionate people at the same time. </p><p>CARLSON: So, for whatever reason, and I do think it's a little more  complicated just Democrats opposing it. I think a lot of Republicans in the  current Congress aren't fully (inaudible) with the wall either. But  whatever reason, hard - impossible to get this through the Congress. What  if the President said he just announced we're pulling our troops out of  Syria? What if he were to say I'm going to take the cost savings from that  and apply it to border security? </p><p>PERINO: Well, he could say that, but it's just not how the system works,  right? There is money that's programmed for certain places. Now, the  President has said to his cabinet, look for any money that we could put  towards this virtual wall, border security, wall, whatever you're going to  call it. </p><p>The Democrats are going to fuss about that because of just technical  reasons of reprogramming money is not that easy to do. But the President  has two opportunities coming up in the next six weeks. He'll have the State  of the Union. That's a big moment. Right? That's all eyes on the President. </p><p>CARLSON: Right. </p><p>PERINO: And then he has about a week later or two weeks later, he  introduces his budget proposal. A budget proposal is a prioritizing  document, and the President could say this is what I agree with. I just  feel like, if his fans are concerned that there's not going to be a wall,  just give him a minute. OK? Give him a chance. This is not a sprint. Right?  He's in a marathon. </p><p>CARLSON: And so you think it is - and you know the system very well. You  think it is at least possible that in the next two years some kind of wall  like structure appears on the southern border?</p><p>PERINO: Well, I just feel like - will there be - is it - this is what I  think is possible. It is possible to get border security funding and for  construction to start. Will that look like a steel wall all across the  border? Probably not. But no matter what President Trump gets in terms of  border security, he is going to call that a wall. He's a good communicator.  He'll figure that out. And no matter what, the Democrats will say, see, we  told you he wasn't going to get that steel wall all across the border. </p><p>But border security, I think, it's a real possibility. I think there're  some new members of Congress that are going to be willing. And remember  this. For Republicans and Democrats, there's a lot more veterans that just  got elected to Congress. They're used to working with the other side. There  are responsible people who care deeply about the national security of the  United States. </p><p>The President ought to invite all of them, Democrats, Republicans, bring  that coalition together. I think that's a really exciting group. And that  America has a lot to be proud of that these veterans have come back and are  still willing to serve their country just in a different way.</p><p>CARLSON: Interesting idea. Thank you.</p><p>PERINO: I know I'm too optimistic for you--</p><p>CARLSON: No--</p><p>PERINO: --a little bit, but--</p><p>CARLSON: No, I don't know - look, I've - trust me. This week, I'm looking  for all optimism possible and you are an ever-flowing well-spring of  optimism. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PERINO: OK. I'm glad I could be here.</p><p>CARLSON: You are loved. Thank you. Dana Perino--</p><p>PERINO: Thank you. </p><p>CARLSON: --great to see you.</p><p>Well, American forces are withdrawing from Syria. Is that good for the  world? And more important, is it good for the United States? We will unpack  its effects after the break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: The war on Christmas doesn't exist. Obviously, you know that.  You'd have to be a moron or some kind of Fox News viewer to think there is  a war on Christmas. And nowhere does the war on Christmas exist less than  in China. And that's why the city officials of Langfang, China, have issued  a total ban on the public celebration of Christmas. </p><p>That means no Santa, no lights, and obviously no nativity scenes. The ban  is part of a wider religious crackdown in China, which has seen churches  shut down and believers thrown in prison, a story that hasn't gotten a ton  of ink here among our elites who are getting rich in China.</p><p>In Russia, by contrast, and even in Assad's Syria, millions of Christians  will happily celebrate Christmas without any oppression. Just take a guess  which countries are despised and which ones they suck up to? And maybe  that's why they love China's government so much. Beijing does what  Washington wishes it could do, with efficiency too. </p><p>I want to bring you a major development tonight in America's involvement in  Syria despite heavy pressure from Saudi Arabia and thousands of foreign  policy experts. The United States has managed to avoid a full intervention  into the Syrian civil war, praise God. Now we're finally pulling out the  forces we do have there. Trace Gallagher has more on that. </p><p>Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR, FOX NEWS: Tucker, the decision to remove the  entire U.S. force from Syria, more than 2,000 troops, surprised virtually  everyone, and it officially marked the end of an extended ground campaign  against ISIS. Moments ago, the President released this video statement.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've been President for  almost two years and we've really stepped it up. And we have won against  ISIS. We've beaten them and we've beaten them badly. We have taken back the  land. And now it's time for our troops to come back home. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said this does not end  the global campaign against ISIS, quoting, \"The United States and our  allies stand ready to re-engage at all levels to defend American interest  whenever necessary.\" But Trump ally and frequent advisor Senator Lindsey  Graham does not like it. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LINDSEY GRAHAM, REPUBLICAN, SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR: ISIS is more likely to  come back because I don't agree with the President that they're defeated in  Syria and Iraq.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Florida Senator Marco Rubio called the decision a major blunder.  Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor John Bolton  have both argued that a precipitous withdrawal in Syria would embolden ISIS  to make a comeback. But Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul applauded the move  and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the U.S. pull-out will  not impede his country's ability to defend itself against regional threats. </p><p>Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, great to see you tonight. Thank you for that. </p><p>David Tafuri is an attorney. He is the former Obama campaign advisor, and  he joins us tonight. </p><p>David, thanks so much for coming on. So, moments like this are so  instructive because they really do divide the world into very clear  sectors. You sort of know who's on whose side. And I find this interesting  because the rationale has changed. So people are saying we need to fight  ISIS. But that's not really the point. The point is to counterbalance  Russia and Iran. And I'm wondering, is that, A, our goal; B, achievable  with 2,000 troops in Syria? Like, what actually is the goal? I'm losing  track.</p><p>DAVID TAFURI, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Well, there are a couple of  goals. It's to fight ISIS. It's also to push back on Iran and on Russia. So  what's stunning about this development is all of President Trump's foreign  policy advisors and top military advisors were against this decision. And  he reversed them today, suddenly, in a rash decision. </p><p>Now, the reason why we should stay in Syria--</p><p>CARLSON: But that's the same people who think we should stay in  Afghanistan, right? So how much--</p><p>TAFURI: Some of them are the same, but--</p><p>CARLSON: How much credible--</p><p>TAFURI: --the reasons are different. </p><p>CARLSON: --ones you say that you have? </p><p>TAFURI: The reasons are different.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. </p><p>TAFURI: Look, Trump's top policy advisor said we are going to stay in Syria  until we have, one, rolled back Iran. That has not happened. Two, defeated  ISIS. We have made major progress in fighting ISIS, but we haven't fully  defeated them. I was in Iraq in October. Nobody on the ground in Iraq tells  me we defeated ISIS there. And ISIS is even stronger in Syria, still.  Moreover, all of Trump's policy advisors have said we should stay in Syria  until there's a political solution in Syria. None of those three things  have happened.</p><p>Wouldn't it be a wrong thing if the most--</p><p>CARLSON: Wait, wait, wait. Can I just--</p><p>TAFURI: Go ahead. </p><p>CARLSON: --stress maybe another option? So there wasn't actually ISIS in  Syria when the Assad government controlled the whole country. Christians  and other religious minorities, a lot of them, lived in relative peace. Now  they're hunted down and murdered. Why wouldn't it just be the simplest,  most elegant best solution for everyone involved if Assad managed his  entire country again?</p><p>TAFURI: Because you are ignoring the history and the development of the  revolution in Syria. The revolution in Syria happened--</p><p>CARLSON: It just happened a few years ago. </p><p>TAFURI: It happened organically. It began in 2011. It happened organically.  Right? And so Syria was an authoritarian state before that with tons of  oppression. Maybe Christians were OK there. </p><p>CARLSON: Is there a non-authoritarian--</p><p>TAFURI: But - but people were not - people were--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARLSON: Is there a non-authoritarian state in that region other than  Israel? </p><p>TAFURI: There are - there are less authoritarian states-- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARLSON: Oh. But they're all authoritarian-- </p><p>TAFURI: --much less authoritarian--</p><p>CARLSON: --there. I mean, Jordan is an authoritarian state. Criticize the  king and see what happens. So, like, that's the rule in the region. </p><p>TAFURI: You cannot compare Jordan to Syria. </p><p>CARLSON: I'm not attacking--</p><p>TAFURI: You can't even compare Syria to Iraq--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not attacking Jordan. </p><p>TAFURI: --which has a fledgling democracy. </p><p>CARLSON: I'm just saying authoritarian justifies nothing. They're all  authoritarians, OK? </p><p>TAFURI: OK. But the point is that this was an organic revolution. The U.S.  didn't start this revolution. It's started by the Syrian people, majority  of whom are Sunni Arabs. They stood up against Assad. He chose - rather  than to reconcile with them, he chose to mow them down and slaughter tens  of thousands of innocent, peaceful protesters. </p><p>CARLSON: No--</p><p>TAFURI: That's how the revolution began.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm sure Assad's - OK. But I'm not defending Assad's character.  I'm merely saying--</p><p>TAFURI: Good. </p><p>CARLSON: --from the perspective--</p><p>TAFURI: You shouldn't. </p><p>CARLSON: Why would I? </p><p>TAFURI: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not Syrian. I don't work for Assad. I'm an American. And I  want to know what's best for us. And if you're worried about the chaos and  the huge refugee problems caused by this civil war and by the emergence of  ISIS, again, abetted by the civil war, then why wouldn't you long for the  days where Christians could live unmolested in Syria under this  authoritarian Assad? I'm totally missing it. What am I missing?</p><p>TAFURI: Because that's not - this is actually going to cause more refugees.  OK? Northern - northeastern Syria right now is secure. The reason it's  secure is because of the great work by our U.S. Special Forces working with  the SDF, the local Syrian and moderate Sunni forces on the ground. They've  secured it. And actually, there are less refugees coming from that area.  The people can say they're peaceful.</p><p>CARLSON: How did the--</p><p>TAFURI: They're not getting bombed by Assad. </p><p>CARLSON: How do the Christians - how do the Christians do? </p><p>TAFURI: And when we pull out - when we pull out, it's going to cause a  massive wave of Syrian refugees again because forces are going to go in and  slaughter the forces--</p><p>CARLSON: Forces. </p><p>TAFURI: --that we've been working with on the ground. </p><p>CARLSON: Yes. </p><p>TAFURI: Assad's forces, Iranian, Shia militia forces, and possibly even  Russian forces.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. And so we're responsible for that? </p><p>TAFURI: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: Because - so this is halfway around the world. We have crises like  Venezuela's collapses right there. Mexico has probably as many murders as  Syria - I mean, not close. Right? So, like, I'm just saying there are a lot  of things going on. But we have a moral obligation to keep 2,000 American  troops in this country around the world because why - I'm honest - I'm  confused. </p><p>TAFURI: Well, first of all, we are there already, and it's successful. So  why pull out? We also do have some obligations of forces on the ground--</p><p>CARLSON: It's successful in what way? </p><p>TAFURI: --who fought - who fought bravely alongside us. Moreover, this is  going to impact us because ISIS will come back. And if we don't have forces  on the ground to monitor ISIS and to continue to combat ISIS, ISIS will  come back. ISIS are sworn enemies of the U.S. they want to kill Americans. </p><p>CARLSON: Right. </p><p>TAFURI: And when they become stronger in Syria, they'll strike out against  America again. </p><p>CARLSON: So by this--</p><p>TAFURI: So your viewers should worry about their own security because of  this decision. </p><p>CARLSON: Well, there are a lot of reasons to worry about our own security.  A lot.</p><p>TAFURI: Sure. </p><p>CARLSON: Many. And our mental health and our economy and our healthcare  system. A lot of things to worry about. But by the standards that you've  just articulated, like we're never going to leave there or Afghanistan or  any place that we've been for more than eight months. So--</p><p>TAFURI: I wouldn't say we're never going to leave there. But we have to see  progress on the ground. We have to see full defeat of ISIS.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. </p><p>TAFURI: We have to see political progress--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARLSON: --why shouldn't--</p><p>TAFURI: --towards a peaceful revolution in Syria, and there ought to be a  democracy in Syria.</p><p>CARLSON: Why shouldn't--</p><p>TAFURI: And then we can leave. </p><p>CARLSON: Who cares about - who cares about that? The question--</p><p>TAFURI: Who care about democracy?</p><p>CARLSON: --that I care about - I'll tell you what I care about is what's  happening to the Christians there? Like, nobody cares. I don't understand.  We invade Iraq. There's a huge Christian community. They'll leave. </p><p>TAFURI: Well, who are killing the Christians in Iraq?</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not--</p><p>TAFURI: ISIS. </p><p>CARLSON: Look--</p><p>TAFURI: ISIS. </p><p>CARLSON: Of course-- </p><p>TAFURI: And--</p><p>CARLSON: --but I'm just saying why don't we make it an explicit--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TAFURI: Islamic militants are killing Christians in Iraq. </p><p>CARLSON: I'm not defending ISIS. I'm just saying, why don't we make it an  explicit concern of the United States to protect the Christians? But we  don't. </p><p>TAFURI: It is an explicit--</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's not-- </p><p>TAFURI: --concern. </p><p>CARLSON: --actually. We don't let in the end. </p><p>TAFURI: It's an explicit concern of the U.S. to protect all minorities in  Syria and Iraq, of which the Christian minorities are important part of. </p><p>CARLSON: They don't seem that important to anyone here. </p><p>Anyway, I hope they are. They're important to me. I'm glad they're  important to you. David, thank you. </p><p>TAFURI: Yes. Thank you. </p><p>CARLSON: Democrats claim to care about sexual harassment so very much  because they're good people. Are they prepared to expose the congressman  who paid your tax dollars in hush money to accusers? It's a pretty simple  question. We'll see if we can get an answer after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, a couple weeks ago, we invited on this program a New York  Senator named Kevin Parker. He's a Democrat. He wants to force all citizens  in the State of New York to turn over their social media password so their  accounts can be inspected by the thought-police before they buy guns. If  they say something naughty or threatening, no gun. </p><p>Well, given that, we are fascinated to see the news yesterday. Parker grew  angry with the Republican spokeswoman and tweeted her this. \"Kill  yourself.\" Well, the irony, obviously, pretty obvious. So Parker  apologized. He said he was making a donation to the National Alliance on  Mental Illness. We applaud that. </p><p>Has he learned the lesson embedded in his own actions though? The anti-gun  bill he sponsored is still pending in the New York State legislature. We've  asked Senator Parker to come back on this show, so he can explain once  again why he ought to have the power to police thought-crime on Twitter.  And by the way, should he, given his record, be allowed to own a gun? So  far, his office has not responded, but we'll keep asking him. Great guest.  Happy to have him again.</p><p>Well, yesterday in Capitol Hill, the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  sharply attacked a proposal to give the President an immigration  enforcement slush fund, as he called it. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHARLES SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Leader McConnell proposed the  bipartisan Senate DHS bill, which has $1.6 billion for border security plus  a $1 billion slush fund for the President to use for his radical  immigration agenda. I called Leader McConnell and told him we would not  accept their $1 billion slush fund and that our offers to fund the  government remain. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Now, don't take those words the wrong way. The problem Democrats  have is with border enforcement. They don't have a problem with slush  funds. Congress loves slush funds. That's why, for years, Congress has  maintained a slush fund at your expense, taxpayer funded, to pay off people  who accuse members of Congress of sexual harassment. </p><p>The Democrats will control the House in just a couple of weeks, of course.  Are they going to end the slush fund, and more to the point, will they tell  us who has been protected by it? What are the names?</p><p>Penny Nance is President of Concerned Women for America, and she joins us  tonight. </p><p>Penny, thanks so much for coming on. This seems like a very simple ask. Why  shouldn't the public know who got paid with our money to settle these  claims? </p><p>PENNY NANCE, PRESIDENT, CONCERNED WOMEN FOR AMERICA: That's a very good  question. And by the way, Concerned Women for America members sent  thousands of petitions asking Congress to tell us. Over 20 years, 264  cases, $15 million of our money was paid out to hide what members of  Congress did. And these weren't little allegations. These were big things. </p><p>We have the case of Blake Farenthold, who sexually harassed his  communications director, shared his sexual fantasies about her. And when  she dared to complain, he fired her. And you remember Eric Massa and his  groping of young men, and then he called it tickle fights. He had to pay  out $100,000--</p><p>CARLSON: And that was--</p><p>NANCE: --of our money.</p><p>CARLSON: --taxpayer money.</p><p>NANCE: Taxpayer money. And we were never paid back. Now, Congress did just  pass a piece of compromise legislation, but it doesn't do anything about  what we just talked about. It doesn't pay back at all the slush fund that  the taxpayers paid out to cover up the wrongdoing by members of Congress.</p><p>CARLSON: Now, do we know the identities of the people on whose behalf these  payments were made?</p><p>NANCE: No. And we have tried - and by the way, FOIA doesn't apply to  Congress. Isn't that interesting?</p><p>CARLSON: So - I mean, so Nancy Pelosi, who obviously is America's chief  defender of women--</p><p>NANCE: Right. </p><p>CARLSON: --I mean, she's told us that many times, and a deeply good person.  She's told us that too. She'll be in charge of this. </p><p>NANCE: Yes. </p><p>CARLSON: So she can release these names if she wanted to. Will she want to?  Will she?</p><p>NANCE: We have called on her to do that, but she so far has chosen to  shield her colleagues. She even went as far as to say that John Conyers was  a hero and a great American. Remember John Conyers was hosting meetings  with his staff in his underwear and was caught on film - caught on video on  a airline flight on the taxpayer dollars watching porn. This is the guy, by  the way, who used to be the Judiciary Committee Chairman who had oversight  over pornography. So you can't make this stuff up. </p><p>The new bill does make some improvements and, going forward, requires  restitution. But it's not clear whether or not even then we'll know for  sure, going forward, who actually is the perpetrator. Because in the new  legislation, you just disclose the office. It could be the Chief of Staff,  it could be the legislative director, it could be the Press Secretary, and  like they're going to write off their boss. So--</p><p>CARLSON: Or it could be the member.</p><p>NANCE: It could be the member. And that's the point. We've got to have more  transparency. And we're not going to let this go. </p><p>CARLSON: You will keep pushing? </p><p>NANCE: I will keep pushing. I promise.</p><p>CARLSON: Penny Nance, it seems like a simple ask. </p><p>NANCE: It does. </p><p>CARLSON: I hope you get it. </p><p>NANCE: Thank you. </p><p>CARLSON: Thanks very much. </p><p>NANCE: Thank you. </p><p>CARLSON: Well, as you've seen tonight, permanent Washington cares a great  deal about protecting the way things are, the status quo. It's great for  them. They get richer and they can believe, and many do believe that they  are morally superior to you. And that's why they destroy anyone who  threatens the status quo. </p><p>Mike Flynn, for example, is being destroyed. Mark Zuckerberg lied as well.  He's being protected because he's on the side of the people who make those  decisions. That's also why the establishment has become so obsessed with  crushing free speech. It's getting harder and harder for them to win  arguments on the merits. </p><p>The best option then is to keep the arguments from being made at all. When  you can tar your opponent as immoral, as a bigot, you don't have to defend  you own position, you can just do what you want. You can also ruin the  lives of anyone who gets in your way and feel good about it. </p><p>How do we get to this place? So that entire story is in a new book called  Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Bringing America to the Brink  of Revolution. Christmas is coming. This tells a story that might rattle  you, but it's still worth knowing. You can find it on our website,  tuckercarlson.com.</p><p>That's about it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m.,  the show that is the sworn enemy - and we mean it - of lying, pomposity,  smugness and groupthink; the show that says what we think is true, whether  they like it or not. </p><p>Good night from Washington. Sean Hannity is next. Dan Bongino is sitting  in--</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

We begin this show with some shocking news. Lying has been detected here in  Washington. Mendacity, deceit, duplicitousness (ph), saying things that  aren't true that here my arms is going up just telling you about this. But  it happened. And we can prove it. </p><p> Now, to be clear, news anchors didn't do it. News anchors don't lie.  They're good people. Neither do professional cable news commentators, the  one making millions on the side as lobbyists for foreign governments or big  multinational corporations. Commentators always tell the truth. And that's  why they, and their scrupulously honest news anchor friends are so utterly  disgusted tonight, horrified really by what retired General Michael Flynn  has done. Watch their stunned reactions.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DON LEMON, ANCHOR, CNN: Michael Flynn lied to the FBI. Flynn lied again and  again and again to FBI agents. Just lied. Lies, lies, and more lies. </p><p> UNKNOWN: Hold on for just a minute about who is significant and who is not.  Flynn lied. The tone should be when you speak to a prosecutor, you speak to  the truth. Everybody lied. </p><p> LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, ANCHOR, MSNBC: Michael Flynn was betraying his country.  Michael Flynn was betraying his office. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: \"He lied,\" says Don Lemon and his news anchors friend. Lied, lied,  lied. He's a very bad man, a lying kind of man. The worst kind. He could  never work in television. For his crime of lying, Michael Flynn, the liar,  may soon be locked away in a cell. That would keep the rest of us safe from  his perfidious lies. That day can't come fast enough say the news anchors.  Cuff him. America longs to breathe free once more. </p><p> Michael Flynn will be 60 years old next week. The Washington Post  calculates he faces five years in prison. And let that be a warning to all  of us. That's what happens to people who lie in Washington. Or does it?</p><p> From a golf course somewhere in Dubai, you can almost hear Bill Clinton  chuckling softly. Lied under oath, still making $300,000 a speech; not  everyone faces the same penalties for lying it turns out.</p><p> Mark Zuckerberg came to Washington last spring to talk about Facebook  that's the sole destroying social media company that has made him a  multibillionaire. While in town, Zuckerberg stopped by the Congress where -  and you might want to ask the kids to leave the room for this - he lied.  Yep. Don't tell Don Lemon. But Mark Zuckerberg is a liar. Watch him do it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: This is the most important principle for  Facebook. Every piece of content that you share on Facebook, you own and  you have complete control over who sees it and how you share it. And you  can remove it at any time. </p><p> SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA: Are you willing to give me more control  over my data? </p><p> ZUCKERBERG: Senator, as somebody who uses Facebook, I believe that you  should have complete control over your data.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. You have complete control over your data. You control who  sees it. You own it. That's really the most important principle at  Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg says so with a completely straight face. </p><p> The only problem, it was a lie. Sorry, kids. According to a piece in the  New York Times, Facebook does not actually allow you or anyone else to  control your data. Not at all. In fact, they secretly hand over your data,  personal data, to other big tech companies. Now, that decision has made  Mark Zuckerberg even richer, adding on to the house in Hawaii probably.  Unfortunately, he's had to lie in the process, including to Congress, and  that's a crime. </p><p> As Robespierre once famously noted, \"You can't make an omelet without  breaking a few eggs.\" In this case, the eggs are your privacy. Apparently,  Facebook allowed Microsoft search engine, Bing, to see the names of your  Facebook friends without telling you about it. Facebook also allowed  Netflix and Spotify to read your private messages without telling you. </p><p> Now, there's no evidence so far as of tonight that Facebook has a video  camera hidden in your shower, but close enough. That's what Mark Zuckerberg  lied about. Not a small lie, really. </p><p> What did Mike Flynn lie about? Well, according to the FBI, Flynn lied about  conversations he had had with the Russian Ambassador Kislyak. You remember  him. Flynn said that he and Kislyak had never talked about expelling  Russian diplomats or about Russia voting in the U.N. on symbolic  resolutions. And in fact, they had talked about both of those things. The  feds already knew that because they were listening in, secretly. </p><p> There was nothing improper about the conversations that Flynn and Kislyak  had. The crime was the lie. It's always the crime. Except when it's Mark  Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg can lie about something that affects hundreds  of millions of Americans, but it's not really a big deal. Zuckerberg is not  looking at five years in prison. Zuckerberg will not be sanctioned by  Congress ever. </p><p> So what's the difference? Well, unlike Mike Flynn, Mark Zuckerberg is a  hero to the American news media. He is who they want to be. He is richer  than God. He went to Harvard. He wears T-shirts at work for real. He's for  open borders. All the cool people like Mark Zuckerberg, even foreign  countries. </p><p> For example, when the fascist government of China was looking for new tools  to oppress its own population, you think they went to Mike Flynn for help?  Yes, OK. I don't think so. Flynn is tough on china, old fashioned as he is.  But Mark Zuckerberg, by contrast, was happy to help. </p><p> As they say at McKenzie, Mark Zuckerberg gets it. </p><p> Boy, what has Mike Flynn ever done for anyone? 33 years in uniform? That's  not very innovative. Two lies told by two high-profile Americans. One is  going to prison in late middle age. The other will be available for like 40  years for commencement addresses and awards dinners held in his honor.  That's the tale of Mike Flynn and Mark Zuckerberg. It tells you everything. </p><p> Joining us now to break down what's happening to Mike Flynn is Harvard Law  Professor Emeritus, Alan Dershowitz. He is the case of the book - the  author, rather, of the book The Case Against Impeaching Trump. </p><p> Professor, thanks very much for coming on. So I read in The Washington Post  this morning--</p><p> ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Well, thank you so much. </p><p> CARLSON: --I read Mike Flynn described as a double agent in The Washington  Post. And then I saw the Judge Sullivan yesterday describe him as someone  who had committed treason. Is that the crime for which he is facing prison? </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: No, not at all. And I'll get to that in a second. But Tucker, I  just want to make one point. I hope you don't mind me making it. </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CARLSON: --you will.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: I hate boycotts and attempts - I hope - I hate boycotts and  attempts to censor free speech. I'm in favor of complete dialogue. But as  such, I feel impelled to tell you that I, with due respect, disagree with  the way you categorize mass immigration. That's all. I just want to say  that. And--</p><p> CARLSON: Well, that's OK. And by the way--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Now--</p><p> CARLSON: I would expect that you would. We differ probably on a lot of  issues. But the one issue that we--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Right. </p><p> CARLSON: --agree on and that--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Yes. </p><p> CARLSON: --I respect you for is your willingness to say what you think in  public to defend your views, to have a conversation and to let others  decide which side is right. And that's something that I wish we were able  to do a lot more of. But you're one of the only liberals who will come on  this show. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: I completely agree.</p><p> CARLSON: Amen. So thank you very much for saying that. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Well, I agree. And I come on this show because I also have the  right to say what I think and when I disagree with you, you'll allow me to  say I disagree with you. And I do. I wish you hadn't used that language.  Language like that was used to describe my grandparents and great  grandparents and probably some of yours. So let's move on. But--</p><p> CARLSON: Well, actually, just in point of--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: --I would hope you--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CARLSON: --just in point of fact since you brought it up, as noted on  Monday--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Yes. </p><p> CARLSON: That was in the context of a conversation with an elected official  in Tijuana about the filth--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Right. </p><p> CARLSON: --of his city and he was complaining about how dirty it had  become, which was a byproduct of the policy decisions pushed by the  American left and I noted. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: I understand that. </p><p> CARLSON: There's a lesson there perhaps for us. So I'm not - and I would  never describe people as inherently dirty. I don't think that they are and  pro-people. That's one of the reasons I'm against abortion, strongly. But  anyway, whatever. The point is, I wish we were able--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Yes - no. I'm glad you - I'm glad you cleared that up. Yes. </p><p> CARLSON: Yes. Well, I mean, I think it was clear and I think that the  people who are mischaracterizing it are always welcome on the show to talk  it through and to hear my side and I will hear their side because, again,  this is one of the last forums in America for open conversation. </p><p> Anyway - but tell me that--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: That's very fair. Let's--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. Well, I mean, that--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: --turn to Flynn. Yes. OK. </p><p> CARLSON: --that's how I feel. I'm not afraid to defend what I think,  obviously. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: No, I - look, I agree. Neither am I. On the Flynn issue, look,  there's a big issue. I've been teaching this for 50 years. Should it really  ever be a crime to lie when you're not under oath? </p><p> I think you can make a very, very strong case that before you can be  convicted of a crime for lying, you should have to raise your hand, put it  on a Bible, look to your God or look to your ethics, have a solemn moment  where you look the person in the face and swear to him that you are going  to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. </p><p> That's so different from when two guys evade the usual procedures, come in  to try to hang out with you and be chummy, say you don't need a lawyer, we  just want to ask you a couple of questions--</p><p> CARLSON: Right. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: --and then trap him by asking him questions that they already  knew the answer to and had videotapes and audiotapes that could make it  clear that they are only asking him the question in order to give him an  opportunity to lie. </p><p> So I really do think that we have kind of three criteria. Just lying  politically. It's done too often. I hate it. But it's done too often. It's  not a crime. Second, lying only to government officials, which is a crime  but probably shouldn't be a crime, or if it is, it should be a misdemeanor,  not a serious felony akin to raising your right arm and swearing under oath  that you will tell the truth. </p><p> There's too much lying in Washington and there are too many, as you point  out correctly, double standards about who is prosecuted for lying. In civil  cases, people lie in depositions all the time. And they're never  prosecuted. I tried to bring a case recently against people who lied.  Prosecutors laugh at you. Lying in a deposition? That's like gambling in  Casablanca. It's just done all the time, and it's tragic that it's done. </p><p> I testified in front of Congress about this. When they were going after  Bill Clinton and trying to - and impeaching him for his lies. I had a whole  session where I talked about how many lies are told in how many different  places and how selective they are in going after people. That's one of the  problems of not requiring an oath. It gives you the opportunity to  selectively pick people to prosecute for lying not under oath. </p><p> CARLSON: We're almost out of time, but - it is a lie to - I mean - rather,  it is a crime to lie to federal investigators, but it's not a crime for  them to lie to you. Why?</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: No, not only that. The Supreme Court has said it's perfectly OK  for police and FBI agents to lie to you, and that happens every day. You'll  have two people who they suspect of a crime. They'll bring one person in  and say, oh, by the way, your buddy just ratted you out, just turned you  in, you're going to get executed unless you tell us that he did it too. And  of course, it was a total lie. They say the same thing to the other person.  And the Supreme Court has said, lying by FBI agents, lying by federal  officials is permissible and (inaudible) it's done all the time. </p><p> CARLSON: Right. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: But if you lie back to them, then it's a crime. It's even a  crime, the Supreme Court has said, to deny that you did something. If  somebody asks you, \"Did you do something, a crime?\" --</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: --and you say, \"No,\" and you did, you've doubled your  punishment by now lying about whether you committed a crime. The irony  about Flynn is he wasn't lying about committing a crime. He did nothing  wrong. What he did was perfectly legal. I'm still scratching my head and  trying to figure out why he lied. What was his motive? </p><p> CARLSON: I was thinking - I saw a little--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Is it possible he misremembered? </p><p> CARLSON: I mean - and by the way--</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Yes. Now, he did say the court--</p><p> CARLSON: --why were the feds spying on the incoming national security  advisor? Is that normal? I don't know. Professor, thank you very much. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ: No. Comey told us. Comey said, look, I could get away with it,  Comey said.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. I don't know. I don't think you should be spying on members  of your own executive branch unless there's a good reason to do that. But  anyway, thank you very much. Good to see you.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Right. Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, yesterday, the President accused the Mueller investigation  of intentionally and illegally deleting 19,000 text messages, those are  between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. The DOJ claims the text messages were  not erased intentionally, but they were lost due to technical errors. </p><p> Speaking of lying, is that a lie or is it true? Tom Fitton, the President  of Judicial Watch, joins us tonight. Really simple. It's hard to believe  that the Department of Justice would lie about something like that. Are  they? Are they not?</p><p> TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: Well, we don't know the truth. We've  got these two categories of text messages. These are the text messages the  DOJ had or the FBI had back when Page and Strzok were not members of the  Mueller special counsel team. And there was a gap in terms of capturing  those text messages. And there were about 19,000--</p><p> CARLSON: Right. </p><p> FITTON: --that were subsequently recovered supposedly by the IG. And then  they go work for Mueller's operation. They get removed because of these  text messages that they were sending around, talking about insurance  policies against Trump and being pro-Hillary. And IG asked for their phone  because he wants to look at more of these text messages. And their phones  have been wiped, have been reset. Unrecoverable. </p><p> We don't know how many text messages were erased by the Mueller special  counsel operation. They remove him for - Page - removed Strzok specifically  for misconduct and bias that was found in his text messages, but no one  looks at his text messages from the time he was in the Mueller special  counsel operation, the most sensitive investigation the Justice Department  has been involved in in decades. Unbelievable. </p><p> CARLSON: Investigations are, by definition, supposed to be preserving  evidence. So - I mean, do you think it's plausible that the Mueller people  might have been implicated in erasing evidence? I mean, that - that just  seems like shocking. </p><p> FITTON: Well, you know what? Manafort was accused of withholding evidence.  You know what they did. They didn't know for sure whether he was. They  issued a search warrant and they raided his home with guns drawn and no  warning. </p><p> CARLSON: Yes, I noticed. </p><p> FITTON: That's not what happens when the government erases evidence on  purpose or accidentally. And it's so bad, the special counsel. You see in  the Flynn investigation questions about how that investigation was handled?  Now we have these missing text messages and the Strzok--</p><p> CARLSON: It really makes you wish we had elected officials in this country  who could protect the rest of from us these abuses. I wonder where they  are.</p><p> FITTON: We need a special counsel for the special counsel.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. How about just someone who'd like (ph) to do something? Thank  you very much. </p><p> FITTON: You're welcome. </p><p> CARLSON: Mark Zuckerberg hid the truth from Congress. He lied. So lawmakers  planning to do anything about his lies? We'll ask an incoming senator about  that next. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: So Mark Zuckerberg just got caught lying in front of Congress  about selling the deeply private data of more than 200 million Americans,  probably your data by the way, is one of the more flagrant abuses big tech  has committed recently. There's a long list of those. But it's hardly the  only abuse. All the major tech platforms have colluded to silence opinions  they don't like and to destroy the people who express those opinions.  They've done this in the open. We've watched it happen. </p><p>Google employees secretly, meanwhile, discussed hiding conservative  websites and search results because they're just not legitimate. Facebook's  founding president Sean Parker admitted that his company created an  intentionally addictive product, like cigarettes, that could destroy  children's brains, which is exactly, of course, what it's done. </p><p> It all adds up to a terrifying picture, a serious menace to this country,  to a democracy, to our mental health - check the numbers on that sometime -  to our cohesion as a nation. It's a real threat, obviously. And everybody  knows it. How is Congress doing protecting us from any of these threats?  Good question. They're not. And they're not even trying. </p><p> And if you're wondering why they're not trying, the answer might be, in  part anyway, the outgoing Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Ryan didn't seem  interested in reigning in the tech companies in any way, when he was the  third most powerful man in America. In part, he was too busy preventing a  wall from being built on our southern border to get to the tech question. </p><p> But there might have been other reasons we're just speculating now. Now  that he is leaving the Congress and moving to the private sector, will Paul  Ryan be taking any money from any of the big tech firms like Facebook or  Google or Twitter? Seemed like an interesting question. Obvious, but then  no one has asked. So we called Paul Ryan's office today and we asked that  question. We haven't got an answer yet. And it's 8:20 p.m. Eastern. We're  going to keep checking and get back to you when they respond.</p><p> So the leadership of the House, of course, is changing. Democrats are  taking over. But the Republicans still hold the Senate. Is there any  interest, will there be, in reigning in tech at all? </p><p> Josh Hawley was just elected Senator. He's a Republican from Missouri, and  he joins us tonight. </p><p> Mr. Senator Elect, thanks very much for coming on. Now, I'm not going to  force you to join me in pointing fingers as to why this hasn't been done up  to this point. But I will ask the question, do you think the Congress,  maybe on a bipartisan basis going forward, will recognize that maybe  there's some tweaking that needs to be done in the government's  relationship with these companies?</p><p> JOSH HAWLEY, REPUBLICAN, MISSOURI SENATOR-ELECT: Tucker, thanks for having  me on. And I certainly hope so. I mean, it's time that Congress got serious  about protecting the privacy, the data, the personal confidential  information of hundreds of millions of Americans. </p><p> And to see this report today that Facebook has allowed these big tech  companies, Amazon, Microsoft, Spotify, Netflix to have access to the  personal information of users, after Facebook said that it would not allow,  it would not give away users' personal data is really extraordinary. And  look, it's time Congress did something about it. It's time the FTC did  something about it.</p><p> CARLSON: So you often hear people say, well, Congress can't actually act to  regulate these companies because its members are too old and they don't  understand technology. I'll freely admit I don't understand technology at  all. I try not to participate in it at any level. And yet the abuses are so  obvious to me. That doesn't really seem like a very good excuse.</p><p> HAWLEY: Well, listen, I mean, what needs to happen here is, number one,  Facebook promised the FTC in 2011 in a binding consent decree. They said  that they would not share personal, private confidential data of users  without the users' consent. Well, Tucker, it looks like that's exactly what  Facebook is doing though that they are sharing that data in order to make a  profit, as you pointed out, without users' consent. </p><p> So, number one, FTC needs to enforce the consent decree, they need to  investigate right now, whether or not Facebook has violated it. Number two,  Congress needs to investigate and Congress needs to take steps to protect  the privacy of Americans. They need to make sure that Americans own their  own data and can protect it. </p><p> CARLSON: So this is a little bit out of left field. But I think that maybe  there is a connection. The CDC just came out with the suicide numbers. And  suicide is one of the leading causes of death in this country. Its  incidences dramatically increased. And all of this in middle age, people  tragically have killed themselves recently. There is a lot of speculation  and some evidence that there's a connection between increased use of tech  products and this tragic epidemic of suicide. </p><p> Is anyone, do you think, at the federal level going to look a little more  closely into this? It seems like something worth investigating.</p><p> HAWLEY: I think it is worth studying. And I think that - look, it's time  that we asked about the role of big tech in our lives. I mean, we've--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. </p><p> HAWLEY: --you've talked a lot about the sweetheart deals big tech gets from  government. I think it's time we took a hard look at those. I think it's  time we looked at the effect big tech is having on our personal lives, on  our families, on our schools, on our society. These are major companies.  Many of them monopolies. They make billions of dollars a year. There've  never been more powerful companies in the history of the world, and they  need to be held accountable.</p><p> CARLSON: Man! I wish I was in Missouri, so I could vote for you again. I  just - I - it's so nice to hear an elected official say that. I'm sorry to  suck up. I couldn't control myself. </p><p> Mr. Hawley, thank you very much.</p><p> HAWLEY: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, we're just hours away right now from a potential government  shutdown. The debate is over funding for the border wall. Will there be a  border wall or has that dream died? Details ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Insulin is one of the basic human hormones. Everyone needs insulin  to live. Diabetics, though, can't properly produce insulin. And that's a  big question in this country. In America right now, about 6 million people  are dependent on daily injections of insulin just to survive. It's a great  thing that they can do that. </p><p> Almost a century ago, scientists discovered how to produce synthetic  insulin. The scientists who did that sold the patents to a university for  $1. Their goal was to help humanity. That's why they did that. It turned  out to be one of the great health advances in human history. </p><p> Diabetes went from almost a certain death sentence to a manageable illness,  as it is today or was. Cheaply available insulin has extended the lives of  tens of millions of people. But in this country, that seems to be changing. </p><p> For the last 20 years or so, the price of insulin has been rising very  quickly, even relative to other healthcare costs. When top insulin drug,  NovoLog, rose in price 353 percent in just 14 years. It isn't exceptional,  and the growth has shown no signs of stopping. </p><p> Thanks to these price hikes, millions of diabetics have started rationing  their insulin, gambling with their health and likely shortening their lives  to save money. They have no choice. A cheap medicine that your parents took  for granted increasingly is inaccessible to poor Americans though, already  the group most likely to suffer from diabetes in the first place, as you  probably know. </p><p> Now, there are a lot of reasons this is happening. One is the drug  companies keep slightly tweaking their formulas so their drugs never leave  patent and generic competitors can't enter the market to compete with them. </p><p> Another reason is rigid FDA regulations, which make it costly and time- consuming to put a new insulin drug in the market. Pharmaceutical companies  use legal challenges to deter competition too. Of course, most companies do  do that. And of course, greed plays a role, too. That's a word that we  don't use very often, but it's still real. One of the deadly sins for good  reason. </p><p> But whatever the reasons for the spike in prices of insulin, it's a huge  problem. And you would think it's something that Congress and the  administration would consider taking action on. There are some things they  could do. Maybe they should streamline an FDA approval process or adjust  patent law. Maybe they should subsidize the creation of a generic insulin  brand. </p><p> After all, we spend billions subsidizing solar panels and electric cars  that only rich people can afford. So before you give us a lecture about the  market, remind us we already do that, we're not sure what the best solution  is, we're not scientists or economists. What we can say, this is a real  problem that Congress appears to be ignoring. </p><p> In October, the President pitched a plan to lower drug prices across the  board by tying Medicare reimbursement to drug prices in other countries.  Republicans in Congress and on K Street hate that idea. Pharma's bottom  line is important to them and it's not an unimportant factor. On the other  hand, Americans are dying from easily treated illnesses. That's a factor  too. </p><p> On the left, well, they don't care at all, at least not right now. Their  top priority is impeaching Trump, not collaborating with Trump on  healthcare. And just like on tech and other issues, they're easily  distracted by superficial political signaling. </p><p>Sanofi is one of the companies now driving up insulin prices, but that  company won some degree of credibility from the left last summer and is now  insulated from criticism. Why? Well, because when Roseanne Barr blamed  Ambien for the ill-advised tweets that got her show cancelled, that company  tweeted that racism is not a side effect of its medications. And the left  roared with laughter. Go, big pharma. If only they'd roar about that  company extorting poor Americans with life-saving drugs! </p><p> But just like on immigration or trade or automation or global warming, it  doesn't matter when America's most vulnerable are hurt. It's actual most  vulnerable people no one in D.C. and particularly no one on the left seems  to care. Not their constituency.</p><p> So the debate over the wall on our southern border continues. Not a single  person in Washington, D.C. is in favor of building a wall on our southern  border. They are terrified, not because they think it won't work but  because they believe that it might work and it might clamp down on a  source, a ready source of cheap labor. And that's why they're willing to  risk a government shutdown rather than give a mere $5 million to start the  wall. </p><p> So what is going to happen? Is the wall over? Will the administration  surrender on this? And what will the voters on either side think of the  outcome? </p><p> Dana Perino hosts The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino, of course, the most  popular person here on Fox, and she joins us tonight.</p><p> DANA PERINO, ANCHOR, THE DAILY BRIEFING, FOX NEWS: All right.</p><p> CARLSON: So, Dana, super simple question. Are the people who want the wall  more inflamed than the people who don't want the wall? Which is the more,  in the end, when it's all over, a more powerful, politically powerful  constituency? </p><p> PERINO: I don't think that President Trump has fair weather fans. OK?</p><p> CARLSON: Right. </p><p> PERINO: I think that he has strong supporters who understand that he came  in strong. Right? He said the wall is going to get built. Mexico is going  to pay for it. Like, I never actually really took that seriously in terms  of Mexico paying for it.</p><p> CARLSON: Right. </p><p> PERINO: I do think that--</p><p> CARLSON: It's hard to see.</p><p> PERINO: --he has not done a good enough job persuading people as to the  merits why we need border security even though - look, he's tried, but I do  think that an Oval Office address on immigration security would actually be  very helpful. He could even use visual aids. There's clearly plenty to  show. </p><p> And I think that there might just be a way for him to have a nod to  reality, that he's not going to get this wall funding before the end of the  year. I think they're going to try to figure out a way just to punt this  for a little bit. Now he's going to have a different Congress to work with. </p><p> A lot of those members of Congress had already voted for border security,  which included fencing, which some people might call a wall. But Democrats,  many of them who are running for President, right, they're already in  Congress, they - it's like they can't say the \"W\" word. They can't say  wall. They can call it all sorts of other things, not a wall. I think that  there might be some room for compromise here in the New Year on the merits. </p><p> On the politics of it, well, the Democrats continue to push back against  him, maybe say, oh ha ha, we proved you wrong. Mexico didn't pay for it.  You didn't get your wall. Maybe. But there is a political cost to that as  well. People understand that our borders need to be secure and that we can  be a welcoming, opening, compassionate people at the same time. </p><p> CARLSON: So, for whatever reason, and I do think it's a little more  complicated just Democrats opposing it. I think a lot of Republicans in the  current Congress aren't fully (inaudible) with the wall either. But  whatever reason, hard - impossible to get this through the Congress. What  if the President said he just announced we're pulling our troops out of  Syria? What if he were to say I'm going to take the cost savings from that  and apply it to border security? </p><p> PERINO: Well, he could say that, but it's just not how the system works,  right? There is money that's programmed for certain places. Now, the  President has said to his cabinet, look for any money that we could put  towards this virtual wall, border security, wall, whatever you're going to  call it. </p><p> The Democrats are going to fuss about that because of just technical  reasons of reprogramming money is not that easy to do. But the President  has two opportunities coming up in the next six weeks. He'll have the State  of the Union. That's a big moment. Right? That's all eyes on the President. </p><p> CARLSON: Right. </p><p> PERINO: And then he has about a week later or two weeks later, he  introduces his budget proposal. A budget proposal is a prioritizing  document, and the President could say this is what I agree with. I just  feel like, if his fans are concerned that there's not going to be a wall,  just give him a minute. OK? Give him a chance. This is not a sprint. Right?  He's in a marathon. </p><p> CARLSON: And so you think it is - and you know the system very well. You  think it is at least possible that in the next two years some kind of wall  like structure appears on the southern border?</p><p> PERINO: Well, I just feel like - will there be - is it - this is what I  think is possible. It is possible to get border security funding and for  construction to start. Will that look like a steel wall all across the  border? Probably not. But no matter what President Trump gets in terms of  border security, he is going to call that a wall. He's a good communicator.  He'll figure that out. And no matter what, the Democrats will say, see, we  told you he wasn't going to get that steel wall all across the border. </p><p> But border security, I think, it's a real possibility. I think there're  some new members of Congress that are going to be willing. And remember  this. For Republicans and Democrats, there's a lot more veterans that just  got elected to Congress. They're used to working with the other side. There  are responsible people who care deeply about the national security of the  United States. </p><p> The President ought to invite all of them, Democrats, Republicans, bring  that coalition together. I think that's a really exciting group. And that  America has a lot to be proud of that these veterans have come back and are  still willing to serve their country just in a different way.</p><p> CARLSON: Interesting idea. Thank you.</p><p> PERINO: I know I'm too optimistic for you--</p><p> CARLSON: No--</p><p> PERINO: --a little bit, but--</p><p> CARLSON: No, I don't know - look, I've - trust me. This week, I'm looking  for all optimism possible and you are an ever-flowing well-spring of  optimism. </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PERINO: OK. I'm glad I could be here.</p><p> CARLSON: You are loved. Thank you. Dana Perino--</p><p> PERINO: Thank you. </p><p> CARLSON: --great to see you.</p><p> Well, American forces are withdrawing from Syria. Is that good for the  world? And more important, is it good for the United States? We will unpack  its effects after the break. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: The war on Christmas doesn't exist. Obviously, you know that.  You'd have to be a moron or some kind of Fox News viewer to think there is  a war on Christmas. And nowhere does the war on Christmas exist less than  in China. And that's why the city officials of Langfang, China, have issued  a total ban on the public celebration of Christmas. </p><p> That means no Santa, no lights, and obviously no nativity scenes. The ban  is part of a wider religious crackdown in China, which has seen churches  shut down and believers thrown in prison, a story that hasn't gotten a ton  of ink here among our elites who are getting rich in China.</p><p> In Russia, by contrast, and even in Assad's Syria, millions of Christians  will happily celebrate Christmas without any oppression. Just take a guess  which countries are despised and which ones they suck up to? And maybe  that's why they love China's government so much. Beijing does what  Washington wishes it could do, with efficiency too. </p><p> I want to bring you a major development tonight in America's involvement in  Syria despite heavy pressure from Saudi Arabia and thousands of foreign  policy experts. The United States has managed to avoid a full intervention  into the Syrian civil war, praise God. Now we're finally pulling out the  forces we do have there. Trace Gallagher has more on that. </p><p> Trace?</p><p> TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR, FOX NEWS: Tucker, the decision to remove the  entire U.S. force from Syria, more than 2,000 troops, surprised virtually  everyone, and it officially marked the end of an extended ground campaign  against ISIS. Moments ago, the President released this video statement.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've been President for  almost two years and we've really stepped it up. And we have won against  ISIS. We've beaten them and we've beaten them badly. We have taken back the  land. And now it's time for our troops to come back home. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GALLAGHER: White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said this does not end  the global campaign against ISIS, quoting, \"The United States and our  allies stand ready to re-engage at all levels to defend American interest  whenever necessary.\" But Trump ally and frequent advisor Senator Lindsey  Graham does not like it. Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LINDSEY GRAHAM, REPUBLICAN, SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR: ISIS is more likely to  come back because I don't agree with the President that they're defeated in  Syria and Iraq.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GALLAGHER: Florida Senator Marco Rubio called the decision a major blunder.  Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor John Bolton  have both argued that a precipitous withdrawal in Syria would embolden ISIS  to make a comeback. But Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul applauded the move  and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the U.S. pull-out will  not impede his country's ability to defend itself against regional threats. </p><p> Tucker?</p><p> CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, great to see you tonight. Thank you for that. </p><p>David Tafuri is an attorney. He is the former Obama campaign advisor, and  he joins us tonight. </p><p>David, thanks so much for coming on. So, moments like this are so  instructive because they really do divide the world into very clear  sectors. You sort of know who's on whose side. And I find this interesting  because the rationale has changed. So people are saying we need to fight  ISIS. But that's not really the point. The point is to counterbalance  Russia and Iran. And I'm wondering, is that, A, our goal; B, achievable  with 2,000 troops in Syria? Like, what actually is the goal? I'm losing  track.</p><p>DAVID TAFURI, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Well, there are a couple of  goals. It's to fight ISIS. It's also to push back on Iran and on Russia. So  what's stunning about this development is all of President Trump's foreign  policy advisors and top military advisors were against this decision. And  he reversed them today, suddenly, in a rash decision. </p><p> Now, the reason why we should stay in Syria--</p><p> CARLSON: But that's the same people who think we should stay in  Afghanistan, right? So how much--</p><p>TAFURI: Some of them are the same, but--</p><p> CARLSON: How much credible--</p><p>TAFURI: --the reasons are different. </p><p> CARLSON: --ones you say that you have? </p><p>TAFURI: The reasons are different.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. </p><p>TAFURI: Look, Trump's top policy advisor said we are going to stay in Syria  until we have, one, rolled back Iran. That has not happened. Two, defeated  ISIS. We have made major progress in fighting ISIS, but we haven't fully  defeated them. I was in Iraq in October. Nobody on the ground in Iraq tells  me we defeated ISIS there. And ISIS is even stronger in Syria, still.  Moreover, all of Trump's policy advisors have said we should stay in Syria  until there's a political solution in Syria. None of those three things  have happened.</p><p> Wouldn't it be a wrong thing if the most--</p><p> CARLSON: Wait, wait, wait. Can I just--</p><p>TAFURI: Go ahead. </p><p> CARLSON: --stress maybe another option? So there wasn't actually ISIS in  Syria when the Assad government controlled the whole country. Christians  and other religious minorities, a lot of them, lived in relative peace. Now  they're hunted down and murdered. Why wouldn't it just be the simplest,  most elegant best solution for everyone involved if Assad managed his  entire country again?</p><p>TAFURI: Because you are ignoring the history and the development of the  revolution in Syria. The revolution in Syria happened--</p><p> CARLSON: It just happened a few years ago. </p><p>TAFURI: It happened organically. It began in 2011. It happened organically.  Right? And so Syria was an authoritarian state before that with tons of  oppression. Maybe Christians were OK there. </p><p> CARLSON: Is there a non-authoritarian--</p><p>TAFURI: But - but people were not - people were--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CARLSON: Is there a non-authoritarian state in that region other than  Israel? </p><p>TAFURI: There are - there are less authoritarian states-- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CARLSON: Oh. But they're all authoritarian-- </p><p>TAFURI: --much less authoritarian--</p><p> CARLSON: --there. I mean, Jordan is an authoritarian state. Criticize the  king and see what happens. So, like, that's the rule in the region. </p><p>TAFURI: You cannot compare Jordan to Syria. </p><p> CARLSON: I'm not attacking--</p><p>TAFURI: You can't even compare Syria to Iraq--</p><p> CARLSON: I'm not attacking Jordan. </p><p>TAFURI: --which has a fledgling democracy. </p><p> CARLSON: I'm just saying authoritarian justifies nothing. They're all  authoritarians, OK? </p><p>TAFURI: OK. But the point is that this was an organic revolution. The U.S.  didn't start this revolution. It's started by the Syrian people, majority  of whom are Sunni Arabs. They stood up against Assad. He chose - rather  than to reconcile with them, he chose to mow them down and slaughter tens  of thousands of innocent, peaceful protesters. </p><p> CARLSON: No--</p><p>TAFURI: That's how the revolution began.</p><p> CARLSON: I'm sure Assad's - OK. But I'm not defending Assad's character.  I'm merely saying--</p><p>TAFURI: Good. </p><p> CARLSON: --from the perspective--</p><p>TAFURI: You shouldn't. </p><p> CARLSON: Why would I? </p><p>TAFURI: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: I'm not Syrian. I don't work for Assad. I'm an American. And I  want to know what's best for us. And if you're worried about the chaos and  the huge refugee problems caused by this civil war and by the emergence of  ISIS, again, abetted by the civil war, then why wouldn't you long for the  days where Christians could live unmolested in Syria under this  authoritarian Assad? I'm totally missing it. What am I missing?</p><p>TAFURI: Because that's not - this is actually going to cause more refugees.  OK? Northern - northeastern Syria right now is secure. The reason it's  secure is because of the great work by our U.S. Special Forces working with  the SDF, the local Syrian and moderate Sunni forces on the ground. They've  secured it. And actually, there are less refugees coming from that area.  The people can say they're peaceful.</p><p> CARLSON: How did the--</p><p>TAFURI: They're not getting bombed by Assad. </p><p> CARLSON: How do the Christians - how do the Christians do? </p><p>TAFURI: And when we pull out - when we pull out, it's going to cause a  massive wave of Syrian refugees again because forces are going to go in and  slaughter the forces--</p><p> CARLSON: Forces. </p><p>TAFURI: --that we've been working with on the ground. </p><p> CARLSON: Yes. </p><p>TAFURI: Assad's forces, Iranian, Shia militia forces, and possibly even  Russian forces.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. And so we're responsible for that? </p><p>TAFURI: Well--</p><p> CARLSON: Because - so this is halfway around the world. We have crises like  Venezuela's collapses right there. Mexico has probably as many murders as  Syria - I mean, not close. Right? So, like, I'm just saying there are a lot  of things going on. But we have a moral obligation to keep 2,000 American  troops in this country around the world because why - I'm honest - I'm  confused. </p><p>TAFURI: Well, first of all, we are there already, and it's successful. So  why pull out? We also do have some obligations of forces on the ground--</p><p> CARLSON: It's successful in what way? </p><p>TAFURI: --who fought - who fought bravely alongside us. Moreover, this is  going to impact us because ISIS will come back. And if we don't have forces  on the ground to monitor ISIS and to continue to combat ISIS, ISIS will  come back. ISIS are sworn enemies of the U.S. they want to kill Americans. </p><p> CARLSON: Right. </p><p>TAFURI: And when they become stronger in Syria, they'll strike out against  America again. </p><p> CARLSON: So by this--</p><p>TAFURI: So your viewers should worry about their own security because of  this decision. </p><p> CARLSON: Well, there are a lot of reasons to worry about our own security.  A lot.</p><p>TAFURI: Sure. </p><p> CARLSON: Many. And our mental health and our economy and our healthcare  system. A lot of things to worry about. But by the standards that you've  just articulated, like we're never going to leave there or Afghanistan or  any place that we've been for more than eight months. So--</p><p>TAFURI: I wouldn't say we're never going to leave there. But we have to see  progress on the ground. We have to see full defeat of ISIS.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. </p><p>TAFURI: We have to see political progress--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CARLSON: --why shouldn't--</p><p>TAFURI: --towards a peaceful revolution in Syria, and there ought to be a  democracy in Syria.</p><p> CARLSON: Why shouldn't--</p><p>TAFURI: And then we can leave. </p><p> CARLSON: Who cares about - who cares about that? The question--</p><p>TAFURI: Who care about democracy?</p><p> CARLSON: --that I care about - I'll tell you what I care about is what's  happening to the Christians there? Like, nobody cares. I don't understand.  We invade Iraq. There's a huge Christian community. They'll leave. </p><p>TAFURI: Well, who are killing the Christians in Iraq?</p><p> CARLSON: I'm not--</p><p>TAFURI: ISIS. </p><p> CARLSON: Look--</p><p>TAFURI: ISIS. </p><p> CARLSON: Of course-- </p><p>TAFURI: And--</p><p> CARLSON: --but I'm just saying why don't we make it an explicit--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p>TAFURI: Islamic militants are killing Christians in Iraq. </p><p> CARLSON: I'm not defending ISIS. I'm just saying, why don't we make it an  explicit concern of the United States to protect the Christians? But we  don't. </p><p>TAFURI: It is an explicit--</p><p> CARLSON: No, it's not-- </p><p>TAFURI: --concern. </p><p> CARLSON: --actually. We don't let in the end. </p><p>TAFURI: It's an explicit concern of the U.S. to protect all minorities in  Syria and Iraq, of which the Christian minorities are important part of. </p><p> CARLSON: They don't seem that important to anyone here. </p><p> Anyway, I hope they are. They're important to me. I'm glad they're  important to you. David, thank you. </p><p>TAFURI: Yes. Thank you. </p><p> CARLSON: Democrats claim to care about sexual harassment so very much  because they're good people. Are they prepared to expose the congressman  who paid your tax dollars in hush money to accusers? It's a pretty simple  question. We'll see if we can get an answer after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well, a couple weeks ago, we invited on this program a New York  Senator named Kevin Parker. He's a Democrat. He wants to force all citizens  in the State of New York to turn over their social media password so their  accounts can be inspected by the thought-police before they buy guns. If  they say something naughty or threatening, no gun. </p><p> Well, given that, we are fascinated to see the news yesterday. Parker grew  angry with the Republican spokeswoman and tweeted her this. \"Kill  yourself.\" Well, the irony, obviously, pretty obvious. So Parker  apologized. He said he was making a donation to the National Alliance on  Mental Illness. We applaud that. </p><p> Has he learned the lesson embedded in his own actions though? The anti-gun  bill he sponsored is still pending in the New York State legislature. We've  asked Senator Parker to come back on this show, so he can explain once  again why he ought to have the power to police thought-crime on Twitter.  And by the way, should he, given his record, be allowed to own a gun? So  far, his office has not responded, but we'll keep asking him. Great guest.  Happy to have him again.</p><p> Well, yesterday in Capitol Hill, the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  sharply attacked a proposal to give the President an immigration  enforcement slush fund, as he called it. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHARLES SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Leader McConnell proposed the  bipartisan Senate DHS bill, which has $1.6 billion for border security plus  a $1 billion slush fund for the President to use for his radical  immigration agenda. I called Leader McConnell and told him we would not  accept their $1 billion slush fund and that our offers to fund the  government remain. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Now, don't take those words the wrong way. The problem Democrats  have is with border enforcement. They don't have a problem with slush  funds. Congress loves slush funds. That's why, for years, Congress has  maintained a slush fund at your expense, taxpayer funded, to pay off people  who accuse members of Congress of sexual harassment. </p><p> The Democrats will control the House in just a couple of weeks, of course.  Are they going to end the slush fund, and more to the point, will they tell  us who has been protected by it? What are the names?</p><p> Penny Nance is President of Concerned Women for America, and she joins us  tonight. </p><p> Penny, thanks so much for coming on. This seems like a very simple ask. Why  shouldn't the public know who got paid with our money to settle these  claims? </p><p> PENNY NANCE, PRESIDENT, CONCERNED WOMEN FOR AMERICA: That's a very good  question. And by the way, Concerned Women for America members sent  thousands of petitions asking Congress to tell us. Over 20 years, 264  cases, $15 million of our money was paid out to hide what members of  Congress did. And these weren't little allegations. These were big things. </p><p> We have the case of Blake Farenthold, who sexually harassed his  communications director, shared his sexual fantasies about her. And when  she dared to complain, he fired her. And you remember Eric Massa and his  groping of young men, and then he called it tickle fights. He had to pay  out $100,000--</p><p> CARLSON: And that was--</p><p> NANCE: --of our money.</p><p> CARLSON: --taxpayer money.</p><p> NANCE: Taxpayer money. And we were never paid back. Now, Congress did just  pass a piece of compromise legislation, but it doesn't do anything about  what we just talked about. It doesn't pay back at all the slush fund that  the taxpayers paid out to cover up the wrongdoing by members of Congress.</p><p> CARLSON: Now, do we know the identities of the people on whose behalf these  payments were made?</p><p> NANCE: No. And we have tried - and by the way, FOIA doesn't apply to  Congress. Isn't that interesting?</p><p> CARLSON: So - I mean, so Nancy Pelosi, who obviously is America's chief  defender of women--</p><p> NANCE: Right. </p><p> CARLSON: --I mean, she's told us that many times, and a deeply good person.  She's told us that too. She'll be in charge of this. </p><p> NANCE: Yes. </p><p> CARLSON: So she can release these names if she wanted to. Will she want to?  Will she?</p><p> NANCE: We have called on her to do that, but she so far has chosen to  shield her colleagues. She even went as far as to say that John Conyers was  a hero and a great American. Remember John Conyers was hosting meetings  with his staff in his underwear and was caught on film - caught on video on  a airline flight on the taxpayer dollars watching porn. This is the guy, by  the way, who used to be the Judiciary Committee Chairman who had oversight  over pornography. So you can't make this stuff up. </p><p> The new bill does make some improvements and, going forward, requires  restitution. But it's not clear whether or not even then we'll know for  sure, going forward, who actually is the perpetrator. Because in the new  legislation, you just disclose the office. It could be the Chief of Staff,  it could be the legislative director, it could be the Press Secretary, and  like they're going to write off their boss. So--</p><p> CARLSON: Or it could be the member.</p><p> NANCE: It could be the member. And that's the point. We've got to have more  transparency. And we're not going to let this go. </p><p> CARLSON: You will keep pushing? </p><p> NANCE: I will keep pushing. I promise.</p><p> CARLSON: Penny Nance, it seems like a simple ask. </p><p> NANCE: It does. </p><p> CARLSON: I hope you get it. </p><p> NANCE: Thank you. </p><p> CARLSON: Thanks very much. </p><p> NANCE: Thank you. </p><p> CARLSON: Well, as you've seen tonight, permanent Washington cares a great  deal about protecting the way things are, the status quo. It's great for  them. They get richer and they can believe, and many do believe that they  are morally superior to you. And that's why they destroy anyone who  threatens the status quo. </p><p> Mike Flynn, for example, is being destroyed. Mark Zuckerberg lied as well.  He's being protected because he's on the side of the people who make those  decisions. That's also why the establishment has become so obsessed with  crushing free speech. It's getting harder and harder for them to win  arguments on the merits. </p><p> The best option then is to keep the arguments from being made at all. When  you can tar your opponent as immoral, as a bigot, you don't have to defend  you own position, you can just do what you want. You can also ruin the  lives of anyone who gets in your way and feel good about it. </p><p> How do we get to this place? So that entire story is in a new book called  Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Bringing America to the Brink  of Revolution. Christmas is coming. This tells a story that might rattle  you, but it's still worth knowing. You can find it on our website,  tuckercarlson.com.</p><p> That's about it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m.,  the show that is the sworn enemy - and we mean it - of lying, pomposity,  smugness and groupthink; the show that says what we think is true, whether  they like it or not. </p><p> Good night from Washington. Sean Hannity is next. Dan Bongino is sitting  in--</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

That would be for the crime of lying to FBI agents in his now-famous White  House interview at the very beginning of the Administration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a number of reasons, you've probably already heard about, none of them  very significant in the cosmic scheme of things, that sentencing has been  postponed until the New Year. And, of course, we'll bring you the details  when that happens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the meantime though, we thought we would seize this opportunity to take  stock of all that we have learned, Michael Flynn being, of course, the  first major target of the Mueller investigation. That was all the way back,  if you can believe it, at the beginning of last year, 2017.</p><p>So, it's been just about two years, almost, and the hunt for Russian spies  on our soil has not slowed down. It has metastasized into something vast  and remarkable. It's now practically its own agency of government. </p><p>There are now, we think this is right, there could be more, but what we  could find are a half a dozen separate Russia investigations now being  conducted by the Justice Department. </p><p>That does not even count the separate Congressional inquiries or - four,  five, maybe more, who knows, and then, of course, nearly a 100 percent of  the attention of every news organization in Washington, almost everyone. </p><p>So, what have we learned after all that time and all that money and all  that attention? Well, we know that the Russians spent a total of, let's  check the math, $4,700 on Google ads during the 2016 election. Try to buy a  car for that. </p><p>We also know that Jerome Corsi and George Papadopoulos, two people you  probably had never heard of before, likely did something bad, like  misremembering dates or emails, though apparently neither one of them spied  for anybody. That's what we've learned.</p><p>We've also learned that, and people are not noting this, but we thought  it'd be worth pointing out, virtually every issue that led voters  unexpectedly to support Donald Trump in 2016 remains as of now unresolved,  in some cases, not even addressed.</p><p>That would include the decline of the American middle class, the drop in  life expectancy, the opioid crisis, our unsecured Southern border, crushing  student loan debt, the global dominance of China, the quagmire in  Afghanistan, infrastructure, healthcare costs, we could go on, you know,  the little things.</p><p>You haven't heard a lot about any of that lately. The news anchors have not  had time to tell you about any of that because they're too busy shouting  self-righteously about Michael Flynn. \"He lied. He lied.\" They, by  contrast, never lie because they're good people, unlike Michael Flynn who  lied.</p><p>So, I guess the point is there's been a cost to our Russia fixation. Years  later, we may look back and wonder what happened during the last two years.  How did everybody in America with an Ivy League education simultaneously go  insane in the space of a single year? </p><p>Was there some kind of mass poisoning? Was it Ergotism? It happened in  medieval France maybe - maybe that's what happened.</p><p>We're going to let historians sort that out. We're not really sure. For  now, all we know for certain is that the people in charge have lost it,  they really have. And if you don't believe it, listen to them explain the  intricacies of the Russia conspiracy.  They're mesmerized by it. It's a tale so complex, so riddled with internal  contradictions, it sounds like an Eastern religion. Only they really  understand it, but they mean it and they do understand it. To them, Russia  is the touchstone. It's the comprehensive theory of everything.</p><p>Consider what happened, for example, last night in cable news, and it  really could have been any night on cable news. MSNBC, CNN, take your pick.  We just happened to be watching last night around 11:00 when this happened,  so we're bringing it to you tonight because it's interesting, and it tells  you a lot.</p><p>By the way, this is from the most serious news program that NBC offers on  cable. It's called The 11th Hour. There are two people in this segment  we're about to show you. The first is a man called Malcolm Nance. </p><p>Now, Nance identifies himself as a 35-year veteran of counterintelligence  work, whatever that means. His most recent book is called The Plot to Hack  America. It was a national bestseller, thanks to heavy promotion from  MSNBC.</p><p>The second man you're about to see is Brian Williams who, of course, needs  no introduction. He was the anchor of the NBC Nightly News, back when that  meant something. Williams is widely regarded as - as a good guy by people  who know him and he's absolutely in Washington anyway, is thought of as one  of the smartest people in the news business. </p><p>The point is these are not kooks on late-night radio. They are considered  highly impressive people. Keep that in mind as you watch this. </p><p>Williams opens the segment by explaining that Russian disinformation teams  have been working to divide America and convince the population, among  other totally implausible things, that Jim Comey and Robert Mueller might  have political agendas.</p><p>Ridiculous, right? Williams asked Malcolm Nance to comment on that  proposition and Nance says this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MALCOLM WRIGHTSON NANCE, AUTHOR, MEDIA COMMENTATOR, FORMER UNITED STATES  NAVY SENIOR CHIEF PETTY OFFICER: What Russia has done here and where the  true brilliance of this intelligence operation comes from is way back in  the early 2000s, the Russian military conducted a strategic study and  started carrying out a disinformation plan, in which they said that instead  of carrying out kinetic warfare against your enemies, the best thing we can  do is create a disinformation and (ph) frame around that nation to the  point where over time as we are constantly tearing them apart and feeding  them with false information, they would actually welcome an invasion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLSON: Huh? Wait, wait a second here. This is what we in the news  business call news. </p><p>So, for nearly 20 years, the Russians have been building a disinformation  frame around the United States. What's a disinformation frame? And how does  it manage to brainwash an entire population so thoroughly that they welcome  a foreign invasion?</p><p>I mean that's got to be the most powerful mind control device in human  history. More detail please. This - really this is the part of the  interview where the anchor politely interrupts the guest and ask them to  explain what the hell he's talking about.</p><p>But Williams does not do that. He just lets Malcolm Nance keep talking, so  Malcolm Nance does keep talking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCE: So Russia has done that to the United States. And it began way  before 2016. As a matter of fact, the earliest references I have with  relation to Donald Trump shows that it started back in 2011 with Maria  Butina and the NRA contacts, contacts with the fundamentalist Christian  Right and the Alt-Right in the United States. Russia was pushing these  disinformation themes then. </p><p>Then in 2013, they stood up the Russian Federation Internet Research  Agency, which built all of these memes and tropes, which became the cruise  missiles of fake news and disinformation designed to do what it did today,  take one-third of the United States population and make them refuse to  believe what they see before their very eyes and may have elected a  president in the process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Holy smokes! This is a tsunami of news. </p><p>It turns out that Donald Trump's collusion with Russia began years before  any of us suspected, way back in 2011. Here's the confusing part. In 2011,  by all outward appearances, Trump was still a pretty conventional New York  Liberal.</p><p>He went to David Letterman to read the Top 10 list. He endorsed gun  control. It was all a cover, a sophisticated ruse. As Malcolm Nance  reveals, Trump was, in fact, busy plotting with the NRA, Christian  fundamentalists, and the Alt-Right.</p><p>Now keep in mind, this was years before there was such a thing as the Alt- Right, but that's just how stealthy this operation was. Even the Steele  dossier missed it, so did the rest of us.</p><p>Well, that's not surprising, since as Malcolm Nance has explained, thanks  to Russian brainwashing, one-third of the U.S. population can no longer  perceive reality. That's Malcolm Nance's position.</p><p>What would you do if somebody repeated those exact same words to you on a  city bus? You'd likely be worried. At the very least, you'd probably switch  seats. Not Brian Williams. He'd move closer. </p><p>Williams didn't seem to consider Nance's explanation strange in the  slightest. He was deeply impressed by it. Williams asked how the Russians  could have pulled off an operation this extensive without the willing help  of American accomplices.</p><p>Of course, Nance - Nance had an answer to that. Keep in mind, as you watch  this clip, that we have not edited the tape in any way. This aired verbatim  last night on MSNBC. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCE: They have played on the - the themes of far-Right conspiracy  theorists from the 1960. The John Birch Society, a - a sideline group, you  know, and the farthest extremes of the libertarian parties. </p><p>They have amplified racism to the point where the Alt-Right, Steve Bannon's  own creation of Gamers is now the wholly owned subsidiary of the Trump  campaign and are believers in David Duke, the Ku Klux Klan, Richard -  Richard Spencer, the neo-Nazi, and Robert Spencer, the Islamophobe, to the  point where they're mainstreamed. This is how effective this information  warfare campaign has been carried out. </p><p>And let me tell you, this report shows how they went after to suppress the  African-American vote. And there's no doubt in my mind or anybody else's in  the intelligence community that doesn't believe that it took American  citizens to assist them in really getting down to where these voters were  who needed to be suppressed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Wow! So, in case you weren't transcribing that as you watch, let's  bottom-line it for you.</p><p>The Russia conspiracy just expanded to include a bewildering array of new  figures. These would include the John Birch Society, the KKK, David Duke,  people who play online video games, Steve Bannon, a religion blogger named  Robert Spencer, and others.</p><p>Collectively, their goal was not simply to elect Donald Trump but to hurt  African-Americans. Why would Russian intelligence want to do that, you  might ask? Well if you have to ask, you're probably working for Vladimir  Putin too, so shut up.</p><p>It goes without saying that all of this is completely insane. There's no  evidence to support any of it. It is not true. Worse than that, it's  irresponsible. Keep in mind this aired on a division of NBC News, so some  large number of people are likely going to believe it. </p><p>They'll go to sleep worrying about the invisible disinformation frame that  surrounds their country and the resurgence of the John Birch Society. And  they'll wake up a little more convinced that anyone who disagrees with them  is a tool of a foreign power because that is the real message here, and of  this whole conspiracy.</p><p>There's no other side of the debate. There's only Russian propaganda. To a  certain sort of fragile Liberal, that's probably comforting to know, but  it's a lie. In fact, it's its own form of propaganda. No news organization  should traffic in garbage like this. News anchors exist to push back  against nutty claims like these.</p><p>Brian Williams bought them completely.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN DOUGLAS WILLIAMS, AMERICAN JOURNALIST AT NBC NEWS, MSNBC ANCHOR, THE  11TH HOUR WITH BRIAN WILLIAMS HOST: Wow. Malcolm Nance, this is why we ask  you all the time to come on this broadcast. Scary stuff, but it needs to be  said, needs to be heard. Thank you, sir, so much for joining us once again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It needs to be said. It needs to be heard. This is why we ask you  to come on this broadcast. Save that video. Future generations won't  believe it. </p><p>And now to the actual monetary cost of all this Russia nonsense, what is it  costing taxpayers? Trace Gallagher has been tracking that for us and he  joins us tonight. Hey Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Hey, Tucker. If you back up the  clock to June, President Trump blasted Robert Mueller on Twitter saying,  quoting here, the Russian hoax investigation has now cost our government  over $17 million and going up fast. Turns out, the President was right. </p><p>Brand-new filings by the Department of Justice show that $17 million number  has now risen to $25 million and counting, and that does not include an  additional $5.5 million spent by the Department of Justice on other  expenses related to the Russia investigation. </p><p>Here's a quick rundown of how Mr. Mueller has spent your money over the  past six months. </p><p>$2.9 million went to the salaries and benefits of Special Counsel employees  and Department of Justice employees, 942-plus-thousand was spent on rent,  communication, and utilities, $60,000 for printing supplies and materials,  that's a lot of copies of something, $580,000 on transportation and travel,  and $310,000 for IT services.</p><p>Bottom line, trying to find collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia  is expensive, and working in IT for the Special Counsel is apparently  lucrative. Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, thanks for keeping track.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson is a historian. He's a Senior Fellow at the Hoover  Institution and, we're proud to say, a frequent guest on this show, he  joins us tonight. Professor, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>So, calculate--</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN CLASSICIST,  MILITARY HISTORIAN, COLUMNIST, FARMER: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --if you would in non-monetary terms what you think the costs of  these various Russia investigations have been to the country.</p><p>HANSON: Well I think there's a - they're sins (ph) of commission and  omission because why this is all going on, Tucker, we - we've cracked 3  percent GDP. We hadn't done that in 10 years. That's not an abstract  number. That means millions of people who were not working now have an  opportunity.</p><p>I really see it in where I live in Southwestern Fresno County, it's a human  story. We have peacetime unemployment of 3.7. Remember, just two years ago,  Larry Summers said you - this is - these were - this was the stuff of fairy  stories, and Barack Obama said you need a magic wand.</p><p>We're increasing oil production at 1.5 million barrels a year. We're the  largest oil producer in the world. Nothing hurts Russia more than that fact  alone that we - there's no such word in the English vocabulary for Peak Oil  anymore. So, there's just a human story going on.</p><p>This is not--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HANSON: --even talking about progress overseas. And we're just completely  uninterested in it. I don't know why because a lot of very poor people have  leverage over employers for higher wages that they never had before. </p><p>And the second is there's a really in - inequality of the law. I mean we  talk about the elites. But think of the - the array of people who have not  told the truth. </p><p>Andrew McCabe was fired for lying to federal investigators. We don't know  what's going to happen to him. So far, he hasn't faced criminal charges.  But the Inspector General said he was lying.</p><p>James Comey's statements about the FISA Court and the role of the dossier  are not true. James Clapper lied under oath to Congress. John Brennan lied  under oath to Congress. Susan Rice lied when she said she did not request  surveilled transcripts and have them unmask.</p><p>We know that Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills lied when they said they did not  have knowledge of the email server of Hillary - of their boss, Hillary  Clinton. That's not even getting into the deception of the FISA Court or  the way that the investigations went on the email scandal or putting  informants in a presidential campaign.</p><p>So, the second thing, it's really from a historical point of view, we've  had a lot of wrongdoing by elites. And nobody's - there's been no  consequences. So, the American--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HANSON: --people are not paranoid. They're saying, well the Mueller  investigation's going here but they're going after misdemeanors or nothing.  And here these felonies go completely unaddressed. Then finally, this  Mueller investigation's not in isolation. </p><p>We - we had, remember, from the day Trump was elected, we were told that  the voting machines were fraudulent. We're going to sue. And then there was  in a group, remember about the Electoral College, we had to overturn--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, very well.</p><p>HANSON: --get to the electors. And then we went to the 25th Amendment that  Trump was unbalanced, and then that didn't work. Then we went to the  Emoluments Clause. He profit - even though his businesses had lost a  billion dollars, and then we've gone to the Mueller.</p><p>And so, there's a slow motion, if you will. I don't want to be too  psychodramatic like MSNBC guest. </p><p>But there is sort of a slow-motion coup to overturn the elections when we  should just take a deep breath and say we have a chance to adjudicate this  in the next two - '20 election, and we do not want to destroy 2.5 - you  know, two - over two centuries of American constitutional jurisprudence,  because we know historically, Tucker, when you have whether it's successful  systems like ours or the Greek city-state of the Fourth Century or Rome in  the Fifth Century A.D. or the Byzantines in the 6 - 15th Century or the  ancient regime in Rome, why did they fall apart?</p><p>They fall apart because an elite no longer warrants the respect that they  think that they deserve--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>HANSON: --because they're out of touch with the people. And we have a whole  bunch of people on questions of global warming, as we see in Europe, or  immigration in Eastern Europe, or here at home, that feel that they can  unhide, dictate to people and they're never subject to the ramifications of  their own ideology and policy. </p><p>And it's like the emperor has no close (ph) and then they're - they're  surprised that Trump won or surprised that people are rioting in Paris.  What do they think was--</p><p>CARLSON: If--</p><p>HANSON: --going to happen?</p><p>CARLSON: --if they were wise and had perspective and made good decisions  and cared about their countries, it wouldn't bother me. But they're none of  those things, unfortunately, as you know. Professor, thank you very much.</p><p>HANSON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well for two years, the Fusion GPS dossier has dominated our  political conversation and has driven political events more than maybe any  other fact. What parts of the dossier have proved true over the past two  years?</p><p>Mollie Hemingway has been keeping track. Everybody should be keeping track.  But she's one of the rare few who is, and she'll join us after the break to  tell us what she's found.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well at the center of the two-year Russia investigation is the  Fusion GPS dossier. Hard to remember now, but it was originally compiled as  opposition research by the Hillary Clinton for President Campaign. It was  then passed around to journalists and lawmakers, and finally released on  BuzzFeed without its contents being verified.</p><p>Despite that, the dossier and its allegations have become more important  than America's entire middle class. So, the question is with two years of  thinking about it and poking around in the efforts of every news  organization in Washington to verify it or not, how much the dossier wound  up being true?</p><p>Mollie Hemingway has been following this. She's Senior Editor at The  Federalist. We're happy to have her tonight. So, Mollie, I just want to go  through a couple of the big claims in this, and you tell me if we - if this  happened or not.</p><p>So, the first was Michael Cohen's trip to Prague. Remember the famous trip  to Prague?</p><p>MOLLIE ZIEGLER HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST SENIOR EDITOR, FOX NEWS  CONTRIBUTOR: This is absolutely key. We're told that Michael Cohen, Donald  Trump's personal attorney, went to Prague, had a secret meeting with the  Duma's Konstantin Kosachev that they discussed the collusion arrangement  and that it - and that it went really, and that this was - this was a  really important thing.</p><p>In fact, not only had did that meeting not take place, there's no evidence  that the meeting took place. There's no evidence that Michael Cohen has  ever been to Prague.</p><p>CARLSON: But that was repeated as fact repeatedly.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Well, in fact, in just a few months ago, seven months ago, I  think there was a news report that falsely claimed that the Mueller - that  the Mueller team had evidence that that secret meeting had taken place. </p><p>It is just interesting to note, since we're actually in the sentencing  phase and we're dealing with all - with sort of some resolution here, it  wasn't even mentioned by Bob Mueller or anyone else--</p><p>CARLSON: And assuming they were not (ph)--</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --who's going after Cohen (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --one of the things that always struck me about the dossier was it  accused people of crimes, American citizens of crimes, and one of them was  Carter Page, who was described, in effect, as a - as a mastermind Russian  spy.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Carter Page, again, was all over the dossier. And it was so  important, the dossier was viewed so favorably by our federal government.  They used this to secure a wiretap against him. They portrayed him as a  mastermind spy who was setting up all sorts of important meetings and  arranging, again, collusion.</p><p>We were told that he had a - got a stake in - in a large Russian oil  company in exchange for the collusion. These meetings that we were told  took place in the dossier, there's no evidence that any of them happened. </p><p>And it's interesting to note that Carter Page was surveilled for an entire  year by our government, and has not been charged with any crime despite  being portrayed as this - as the central linchpin of the collusion theory  (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But I do think it destroyed his life, so there's that.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Now, at the very center of this were the salacious claims that  Trump was caught doing things with hookers, and he was subject to blackmail  as a result of this. Did that happen?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Right. So, this was - this was what made it so interesting and  what made the journalists so excited when the dossier was first published,  not just the tale of the - of the prostitutes at the Moscow hotel, but we  were told that Russia had all sorts of compromising information on Donald  Trump, and that he would be compromised and blackmailed by this.</p><p>Then you can look at his record over the last two years and see that if  Russia has anything compromising on him they should have deployed it while  he was going after them in such an aggressive fashion in foreign policy--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --and they haven't done anything of the kind. There is no  evidence to support this. But a lot of people are, in fact, druthers (ph)  on this.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Meanwhile, as Victor Davis Hanson just pointed out, the one  thing they care about is energy, and America is now the world's largest oil  producer, energy producer, so we haven't helped them too much. </p><p>The Trump Towers in Moscow, you hear that to this day.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: So, you need to have business interests in order to have this  collusion theory make sense. The dossier said a bunch of actually kind of  contradictory things that Trump was very interested in a business deal in  Russia, and also that he'd been offered sweetheart deals.</p><p>Well if you've been offered sweetheart deals, I think we can reasonably  assume he would have taken them. There's no evidence he has ever  successfully accomplished any business relationship in Russia.</p><p>CARLSON: And finally, and this claim, again, persists to this day that  Manafort manipulated WikiLeaks in order to hurt Hillary Clinton, and I  think it's basically wrecked Roger Stone's life, this - this claim from the  dossier. Is it true? Do we know that that's true?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: So, the dossier claimed that Manafort was really the one in  charge of the entire collusion theory that, in fact, Carter Page was  working on his orders. There's no evidence that they even met that he - we  were told that Manafort was the one who came up with the whole WikiLeaks  idea. There's no evidence.</p><p>And we have a lot of court filings where if there were any evidence of  this, you know darn well that this would have been mentioned in any of  these filings. Now the whole genius of this dossier is that it has a bunch  of allegations that are improb - impossible to disprove. </p><p>And that's not the way that justice is supposed to be done in this country  where you say, \"Well if you're innocent, you have to prove that these  things never happened.\" These are a bunch of wild allegations without  evidence to support them, and we are now years into this--</p><p>CARLSON: No, you're right.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --and it's--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean that's the--</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --it's a lie.</p><p>CARLSON: --standard we apply to Supreme Court justices, but not - not to  anyone else. Mollie Hemingway, great to see you. Thank you for that.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Great to be here with you.</p><p>CARLSON: For your rigorous look at that.</p><p>Well anti-Russia panic has reignited the Cold War and driven us apart from  Russia. But is that good for American interests? Why should we be Russia's  enemy? That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: At the center of the Russia panic is an accusation that bears  directly on a key foreign policy question that affects all of us, and it's  this. By colluding with Russia, Donald Trump and his team agreed to sell  out America's interests by aligning with Vladimir Putin's government. </p><p>That's what they're saying. In real life, of course, the opposite has  happened. In the past two years, relations with Russia have deteriorated to  historically bad levels, really the worst since the Cuban Missile Crisis of  1962. </p><p>The question is has that helped America in some way? And what is wrong with  improving relations with Russia? Donald Trump ran on improving relations  with Russia and got elected, as you remember.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Wouldn't it actually be  wonderful if we could get along with Russia?</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING YES)</p><p>TRUMP: Wouldn't that be nice?</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)</p><p>TRUMP: If we get along with Russia, we'd go out together with others and  we'd knock the hell out of ISIS, wouldn't that be great?</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING YES)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Steve Cohen is a former NYU professor, one of the eminent Russia  experts in America, Author of the new book, War with Russia: From Putin and  Ukraine To Trump and Russiagate, and he joins us tonight. Professor, thanks  very much for coming on. So--</p><p>STEPHEN COHEN, NYU PROFESSOR EMERITUS, THE NATION CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, WAR  WITH RUSSIA AUTHOR: Well, you've got quite a lot - you've got a quite a  lineup tonight, all the skeptics.</p><p>CARLSON: Well it's what's just so interesting you - at the heart of this is  a real foreign policy question, which is why we're always so grateful to  talk to you. </p><p>And that question is does the United States benefit in some way from  demonizing Russia? Should we be enemies with Russia? Or, could we benefit  more from some kind of loose alliance with Russia? </p><p>That's really the question that Trump's raised (ph) and I'm starting to  suspect that that view was so unpopular that it's driving the Russia  investigation, at least in part, do you think?</p><p>COHEN: It's a mystery of our time. And I promise you that your kids and my  grandkids and the historians of their generation will look back on this  terrible era, this Russiagate era, and ask who started it, why it got such  traction, and why it's done the damage it's done?</p><p>Now, one explanation, but I'm not sure it's a complete explanation is that  when Trump said during the campaign, it would be great to cooperate with  Russia, the enemies of such cooperation saw in Trump an enemy, and they  began this, literally unproven, allegation that he was somehow under the  control of the Kremlin.</p><p>But the damage it's done to our national security and to our institutions,  the you - you may be the only person who's - who's - who's asked the  question. But I guarantee you historians will ask it, what have been the  cost of these two years of Russiagate? </p><p>They've been grave. I mean Victor Hanson pointed out the corruption of our  elites. But what about the corruption of our institutions? The presidency,  elections, suspicions, doubts have been cast on these basic American  institutions. </p><p>And then I come to the thing that concerns me the most that I worry about  in this book, War with Russia? I mean it. I think it's a possibility that  Trump is not free to do crisis negotiation with Russia, and there's going  to be a crisis soon, for sure, the way every president since Eisenhower has  been.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>COHEN: I've said that before on your show. It's virtually an existential  constitutional duty of the American President in the nuclear age to be free  and powered to deal with questions of war and peace with Russia the way  John F. Kennedy was, Cuban Missile Crisis.</p><p>I can't imagine what's going to happen if we have such a crisis. Trump is  shackled. Remember what happened in July. I think you and I might have  talked about it on the air. Trump went to Helsinki for a perfectly  ritualistic, normal summit meeting with Putin. Comes home--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, we were there.</p><p>COHEN: --and he's accused of treason.</p><p>CARLSON: I remember.</p><p>COHEN: Accused for treason. So, that's the--</p><p>CARLSON: So - so let me--</p><p>COHEN: --cost.</p><p>CARLSON: --can I ask you - we only have a minute left. But I'm so  interested in this question and I don't know the answer. What was the -  what's the motive? Apart from disliking Trump, their political motives,  obviously, but there is - part of our foreign policy establishment really  believes that we ought to be in some sort of adversarial posture against  Russia. Why?</p><p>COHEN: I - I don't know. And when you don't know you got to say it. But  here is a theory that some people would offer you if asked that question.  When the Soviet Union ended in 1991, the Washington elites who controlled  foreign policy saw a world dominated or governed by or run by the United  States.</p><p>And that seemed to be a reality in the 1990s when Russia had a President  who was ill, often drunk, and very compliant to Washington. And we got used  to that. Russia is a kind of junior subservient partner in world affair  (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>COHEN: And then came Putin, and it was a shock, and they've been reacting  to the shock of Putin ever since. And I'll give you one quote.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>COHEN: Nicholas Kristof, a very influential New York Times Correspondent -  Columnist, lamented in (ph) print, listen to this, that Putin did not turn  out to be what he expected, namely, a sober Yeltsin, Yeltsin having been  the President of Russia in the 1990s. So, part of this--</p><p>CARLSON: The - the arrogance and dumbness--</p><p>COHEN: --was done (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --of our - of the people who make our policy and influence our  policy really will be the - the - the title of every history of this  period. Professor, thank you. It's--</p><p>COHEN: I agree with that.</p><p>CARLSON: --great to see you and congrats on the new book.</p><p>COHEN: Thanks, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: First it was Rudolph and bullying, now the Left's war on  Christmas, which is not real, but still continues unabated, is targeting  gingerbread men, man, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Recently, we interviewed a New York State Senator, a Democrat  called Kevin Parker. </p><p>Parker is sponsoring a law bill in New York that will require anybody who  wants to buy a gun to give the state the passwords to their social media  accounts, so politicians can make sure they didn't say anything naughty  that they disagree with, because when you say violent things online,  according to Kevin Parker, you shouldn't have a firearm. </p><p>Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN PARKER, NEW YORK STATE SENATOR, DEMOCRATIC MEMBER: This law simply  says let's look at, you know, what people are putting out on social media  as a, you know, the - you know, part of a - a set of criteria that we're  using to determine who gets handguns.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>Do you think that people have a right to say outrageous things, maybe even  things you disagree with, in public, do you think--</p><p>PARKER: They - they certainly--</p><p>CARLSON: --that that be good (ph)?</p><p>PARKER: --they certainly can say whatever they want to say. But we also  have the right--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, but then you punish them--</p><p>PARKER: --we also have--</p><p>CARLSON: --for saying that.</p><p>PARKER: --but we also have a right to deny them a gun permit if, in fact,  we believe that the things that they're saying may lead to them endangering  the people of the State of New York.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. So, if you say something threatening online, he doesn't think  you should have a gun. Well, as we've chronicled exhaustively on this show,  there's something called projection, and that's what you accuse people you  don't like of doing precisely the thing that you are doing. Freud wrote a  book about that, I think.</p><p>Well this morning, Parker, the guy you just saw, tweeted this, Kill  yourself!, at a GOP, I know I'm laughing because it's just hilarious, is  it's so grotesque, at Spokeswoman - Republican Spokeswoman Candice Giove. </p><p>Parker, turns out, was mad at being accused of improperly parking on the  streets of Manhattan. I'm sure that didn't happen. Well, the Spokeswoman  was shocked, she tweeted this. \"Did a Senator just write this to me?\" </p><p>And the answer, of course, is yes. Kill yourself, he said. Unbelievable.  That really does go into Hypocrisy Hall of Fame. We hope Mr. Parker will  come back and explain it to us. I'm sure he will.</p><p>Well the war on Christmas is not real, they tell you that all the time.  It's totally fake. And if you believe in it, you're dumb, you watch Fox  News or something. But it's also, of course, going on. And it's being  fought very fiercely here in America, but not just in America.</p><p>The war on Christmas is a global struggle. In the Parliament of Scotland,  they have a National Parliament, the coffee shop has stopped selling  gingerbread men. Why? Gender-specific. They're now called gingerbread  people. </p><p>You don't want to give them a gender without their consent. You don't even  want to know how many bathrooms there are in gingerbread houses now, a lot.</p><p>Tammy Bruce is a radio host and President of Independent Women's Voice, and  she joins us tonight. Tammy, so I have this - have this sneaking suspicion  that a lot of the people who are doing things like this are actually Right- wing plants there to discredit the progressives they live among. </p><p>Do you think that's possible?</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS ON-AIR CONTRIBUTOR, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE  PRESIDENT: I don't. I think though that they're - it's--</p><p>CARLSON: You don't--</p><p>BRUCE: --I - I know. It's - it's very funny. And now I've been - starting  to think about the complicated structure of gingerbread houses because of  your comment. I'm just wondering, how many bathrooms can they get into one  house? But look, here is the problem. And it just proves, of course, our  point, in general. </p><p>The Left has worked now for a couple of generations to condition us to  ahead of time worry about what we're going to say. Even your last segment,  of course, is about that little bit of - of challenging people and  threatening them and making sure that they know that there's danger in  those thoughts.</p><p>And so, this baker, she said it was a whim that she just thought you just -  like for no good reason that she should not call them gingerbread men and  call them a gingerbread person, and I couldn't tell, obviously, because  they're also not wearing clothes. So, it's hard to say what it is that  there - they - they are, and what they're doing and what they're not doing.</p><p>But she said she was also shocked by the response. And that's the good  news, Tucker, is that this is in - in, again, Scotland, the United Kingdom.  And the backlash, she was apparently shocked that people were really upset  about this. </p><p>And - and I contend after a series of, you know, living your entire life  being kind of bullied into what you can and cannot say and presumptions  that you're--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>BRUCE: --bad people that it can be the smallest thing that tips you over  the edge that's a - that's the tipping point. And in this case, it's, you  know, calling gingerbread men a gingerbread person when obviously they're  men. </p><p>CARLSON: Well, so maybe the lesson is that the rest of us shouldn't  participate in our own spiritual neutering and that we should--</p><p>BRUCE: That's correct.</p><p>CARLSON: --at every step along the way say, I'm not - I'm not complying  with that. I'm sorry--</p><p>BRUCE: That is correct.</p><p>CARLSON: --call HR on me, I'm not doing it.</p><p>BRUCE: And - and look, this Kentucky radio station is a very good example  of that. You know, Baby, It's Cold Outside, the famous song has come under  fire for being inappropriate. And a station in Ohio cut it off of their -  their list.</p><p>Well a - a Kentucky radio station decided to put it on a loop five  different versions they - because it's been covered by everybody, and they  played it continuously for two hours. Obviously, Kentucky for two hours on  Sunday was - was nirvana. </p><p>And they just play and everybody loved it. And they said, \"Look, we've  stand behind this. We're going to play it. We're not afraid.\" And that's a  very good idea is that this is the one way to stop it is to do the thing  that the bullies and the establishment tell you that you're not allowed to  do in an effort to control you. </p><p>And as a statement, I think--</p><p>CARLSON: That's right.</p><p>BRUCE: --sometimes that's important.</p><p>CARLSON: I agree. And also being an independent thinker in a time of  mandatory conformity pays off in the event (ph)--</p><p>BRUCE: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --we've got to hope. Tammy--</p><p>BRUCE: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --thank you very much.</p><p>BRUCE: Thank you. I'll get my gingerbread now. You too.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes (ph). </p><p>Well, Apple, the company that makes your phone and your tablet and your  laptop is one of the most profitable companies in the world, have the  biggest market cap in the world, may still. And yet, American taxpayers are  still subsidizing Apple. Why is that? Our investigation into big tech  continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for several years running, the tech giant Apple has been  this country's most lucrative company. It regularly earns tens of billions  in profits every year. Despite that, for reasons that aren't exactly clear,  lawmakers are eager to give Apple tax breaks, tax breaks that you're not  getting and could never get because sorry, you're not Apple.</p><p>For example, in return for expanding its campus in Austin, Texas,  Williamson County, where Austin is, is prepared to give Apple a property  tax break worth more than $20 million. Again, are you getting anything like  that? Probably not. Why are they getting it? </p><p>Chip Roy is a Republican. He's the Congressman-elect for the 21st  Congressional district of Texas, and he joins us tonight. Mr. Roy, thank  you very much. Congrats, by the way, on winning, and thanks for coming on  tonight. What - why in the world--</p><p>CHIP ROY, CONGRESSMAN-ELECT FOR THE 21ST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS,  REPUBLICAN MEMBER: Good evening, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --would any County give Apple a tax break?</p><p>ROY: Well, you know, that's a great question. It's a question that I've  been asking. And I know that there's a popular mode of doing business in  this country now to try to pay businesses to move to your state. </p><p>But I don't think you need to pay people to move to Texas. Texas is a great  state with low tax rates and--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ROY: --good reasons to move here. So, I don't understand why we would give  upwards of $50 million to a company that has up close to $250 billion in  cash in the bank and a trillion dollar market cap, which is bigger than the  GDP of about a 180 countries.</p><p>It's just more of the same corporate cronyism that we see at the federal,  state and local level that I think voters are getting tired of. I know that  - well I heard on the campaign trail, people are getting sick of that.</p><p>CARLSON: Nobody says anything about it. I mean when Amazon did this in New  York, one of the only people, and I'm ashamed to say this, was not a  Republican, just the opposite. It was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. </p><p>And everyone else on both sides were nodding, \"Oh, Amazon good, Amazon  good.\" Why does nobody raise an alarm over this kind of behavior?</p><p>ROY: Well I think a lot of people, particularly, on the Republican side of  the aisle, hide behind job creation, and they think that well, we just  throw money around, it's going to create jobs. And the fact of the matter  is I think we are chasing, you know, good money after bad, while we throw  money at corporations that have tons of - of resources.</p><p>And frankly, they don't - they're not sharing our values. Corporations are  attacking our core--</p><p>CARLSON: That's for sure.</p><p>ROY: --Texas values, our core American values. You got Tim Cook lecturing  us about border security, and how we're somehow inhumane because we want to  have border security. What is inhumane is having cheap labor in China prop  up your profits and then tell us how we should live our lives in Texas. </p><p>And I'm frankly kind of sick of it. I think it's inhumane that little girls  are getting sold into the sex trade because we don't have border security. </p><p>And yet, we're getting lectured by Tim Cook about what we need to do and  being held ransom for $50 million in Texas when they've got $250 billion in  cash in the bank, and I just don't think that's the way things ought to  fly.</p><p>CARLSON: I've been really hoping so fervently the Republican Party would  change, and the fact that you just got elected is evidence that it is. So,  thank you very much. Chip Roy, congrats again. God bless.</p><p>ROY: Thanks, Tucker, look forward to it, take care.</p><p>CARLSON: Instead of giving big tech huge tax breaks, what should lawmakers  be doing about their growing influence? One person who's been thinking  about this for a long time and getting no credit for it, believe it or not,  is Ralph Nader, of course, the long-time consumer advocate, Author of the  new book, How the Rats Re-Formed the Congress, he joins us tonight.</p><p>Mr. Nader, thank you very much for coming on. The reason I want to talk to  you is I don't think you've gotten the credit you deserve for being a lone  voice on the Left raising concerns about the concentration of power in the  tech sector. What happens when you say that out loud?</p><p>RALPH NADER, POLITICAL ACTIVIST, LECTURER, ATTORNEY, HOW THE RATS RE-FORMED  THE CONGRESS AUTHOR: Well the Congress always bemused by the razzle-dazzle  of Silicon Valley and - and, you know, supposedly clean industry has  horrible pollution coming in from the supply chain and all the rock (ph)  when they dismantle the stuff. And they have no tech capability to ask the  right question.</p><p>So Newt Gingrich in 1995 got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in  Congress, which is he not (ph) Professional Advisor. So, when they deal  with things like, you know, ballistic missile defense or Facebook or  Google, they would have the experts right there.</p><p>And so, there they are, they have these hearings and, you know, outrage and  admiration came from the Members of the House--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --and the Senate that went nowhere. So, the question coming up in  Congress is, are they going to regulate them like they, suppose, you know,  they regulate cars or pharmaceuticals.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: Or are they going to just have Quasi-regulation like the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation does for banks or are they going to create a  trade association to regulate them with standards overseen by some agency?  It doesn't look good.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission nailed Facebook in 2011, led by David Vladeck,  the Consumer Protection Bureau, and haven't (ph) enforced at all. And  Facebook has been violating or letting others, third-party, fourth-party,  Cambridge Analytics violate that consent decree. And it's--</p><p>CARLSON: It's but - but wait (ph) - OK, so you became famous--</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: 1965-ish going after--</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --General Motors.</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And the Right didn't like you because you were attacking business.  But the Left loved you. You became this huge hero. You're saying the same  thing now about the big tech companies, why is no one joining your side?</p><p>NADER: We don't get onto mass media. The civic communities that are raising  issues of crony capitalism, corporate welfare, these kind of tax breaks,  you know, for--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --Apple. Apple is just burning a $100 billion in stock buybacks,  they aren't (ph) giving it back to the shareholders or the workers or the  environment cleanup or the pension funds. </p><p>They want to buyback all that stock to increase the metrics for the  Executive Compensation packages for Tim Cook and others. And you can't get  on national TV on that. You can't even get on - NB - NPR and - and PBS.</p><p>CARLSON: Why?</p><p>NADER: And I've been talking about corporate welfare and the Right, it  talks about crony capitalism, so we're converging, right? </p><p>I think there are a lot of issues in this country, as I pointed out in my  book, Unstoppable, where Conservatives and Liberals back home where they  work, live, and raise their families, right, never mind the ideology--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>NADER: --red state, blue state. They bleed. They get ripped off the same  way--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>NADER: --disinfected, disempowered. And there's no publicity given - given  to it at all. And that - so I'm - I've resorted to a fable. How the Rats  Re-Formed the Congress. It's big rat infestation, you know--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --in D.C.</p><p>CARLSON: Literally.</p><p>NADER: Yes, literally. And they come up from the catacombs in this book and  they get into the toilet polls (ph) first with the Speaker. You can imagine  the result.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: You try to suppress an increasing rat infestation, massive derision  all over the country, it wakes people up. They look at 535 men and women in  Congress, who are using their delegated power under the - we, the people,  right?</p><p>Then they organize a mass movement and get control of Congress from the  corporatists, from the Wall Streeters. You pointed out in your book, the  ruling class should share power. Otherwise, they're going to lose in  whatever Democratic institutions we have.  So, Members of Congress have called this disgusting, outrageous, revolting,  because of the opening pages. But you go back on this, this is a single  most devastating document in--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --indictment (ph) of Congress on one page.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm going to read it. I don't know. I remember at one point  disagreeing with you--</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --on stuff. But I can't remember what it was. I now think that on  this stuff anyway, you're an important voice--</p><p>NADER: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: --and I'm grateful that you came on this show.</p><p>NADER: You go to ratsreformcongress.org--</p><p>CARLSON: Ratsreformcongress--</p><p>NADER: --and you'll get in a (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm going to. And I probably agree with a lot of it that you're  saying (ph).</p><p>NADER: You - you'll get instruction on how to organize back home--</p><p>CARLSON: I love it.</p><p>NADER: --Congress Ratwatcher Groups.</p><p>CARLSON: Ralph Nader, it's great to see you. Thank you.</p><p>NADER: Thanks for the sunglass (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: We've got a Fox News Alert. </p><p>The Senate has passed Criminal Justice Reform. The bill passed 87 to 12,  wow, big margin. The President strongly encouraged Congress to act on the  bill before the end of the lame-duck session. That bill now goes to the  House. Obviously, we'll continue to follow the story. </p><p>And we'll be right back with an important holiday message for you after the  break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: SHIP OF FOOLS.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well as the last hour has demonstrated, in fact, the last decade  has demonstrated, America's ruling class has lost the ability to govern  wisely. They're obsessed with trifles like the Russia investigation, or  gender politics or whatever the nonsense fad (ph) of the day is.</p><p>Meanwhile, they ignore our dying middle class. They know nothing about  falling life expectancy, they don't care. They're more interesting in the  wellbeing of anyone other than their own citizens. They do nothing to  counter the main threats to our wellbeing, big tech, or China.</p><p>Much of the time they directly enable these threats because they're getting  rich from it. How'd we get to this place? Well, it's the subject of a new  book called Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Bringing America  to the Brink of Revolution. It tells the long, gory story. But it may be  worth reading. We recommend it strongly.</p><p>That's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night 8:00 P.M, the show  that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially,  groupthink. Good night from Washington. </p><p>Sean Hannity is next.

That would be for the crime of lying to FBI agents in his now-famous White  House interview at the very beginning of the Administration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a number of reasons, you've probably already heard about, none of them  very significant in the cosmic scheme of things, that sentencing has been  postponed until the New Year. And, of course, we'll bring you the details  when that happens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the meantime though, we thought we would seize this opportunity to take  stock of all that we have learned, Michael Flynn being, of course, the  first major target of the Mueller investigation. That was all the way back,  if you can believe it, at the beginning of last year, 2017.</p><p>So, it's been just about two years, almost, and the hunt for Russian spies  on our soil has not slowed down. It has metastasized into something vast  and remarkable. It's now practically its own agency of government. </p><p>There are now, we think this is right, there could be more, but what we  could find are a half a dozen separate Russia investigations now being  conducted by the Justice Department. </p><p>That does not even count the separate Congressional inquiries or - four,  five, maybe more, who knows, and then, of course, nearly a 100 percent of  the attention of every news organization in Washington, almost everyone. </p><p>So, what have we learned after all that time and all that money and all  that attention? Well, we know that the Russians spent a total of, let's  check the math, $4,700 on Google ads during the 2016 election. Try to buy a  car for that. </p><p>We also know that Jerome Corsi and George Papadopoulos, two people you  probably had never heard of before, likely did something bad, like  misremembering dates or emails, though apparently neither one of them spied  for anybody. That's what we've learned.</p><p>We've also learned that, and people are not noting this, but we thought  it'd be worth pointing out, virtually every issue that led voters  unexpectedly to support Donald Trump in 2016 remains as of now unresolved,  in some cases, not even addressed.</p><p>That would include the decline of the American middle class, the drop in  life expectancy, the opioid crisis, our unsecured Southern border, crushing  student loan debt, the global dominance of China, the quagmire in  Afghanistan, infrastructure, healthcare costs, we could go on, you know,  the little things.</p><p>You haven't heard a lot about any of that lately. The news anchors have not  had time to tell you about any of that because they're too busy shouting  self-righteously about Michael Flynn. \"He lied. He lied.\" They, by  contrast, never lie because they're good people, unlike Michael Flynn who  lied.</p><p>So, I guess the point is there's been a cost to our Russia fixation. Years  later, we may look back and wonder what happened during the last two years.  How did everybody in America with an Ivy League education simultaneously go  insane in the space of a single year? </p><p>Was there some kind of mass poisoning? Was it Ergotism? It happened in  medieval France maybe - maybe that's what happened.</p><p>We're going to let historians sort that out. We're not really sure. For  now, all we know for certain is that the people in charge have lost it,  they really have. And if you don't believe it, listen to them explain the  intricacies of the Russia conspiracy.  They're mesmerized by it. It's a tale so complex, so riddled with internal  contradictions, it sounds like an Eastern religion. Only they really  understand it, but they mean it and they do understand it. To them, Russia  is the touchstone. It's the comprehensive theory of everything.</p><p>Consider what happened, for example, last night in cable news, and it  really could have been any night on cable news. MSNBC, CNN, take your pick.  We just happened to be watching last night around 11:00 when this happened,  so we're bringing it to you tonight because it's interesting, and it tells  you a lot.</p><p>By the way, this is from the most serious news program that NBC offers on  cable. It's called The 11th Hour. There are two people in this segment  we're about to show you. The first is a man called Malcolm Nance. </p><p>Now, Nance identifies himself as a 35-year veteran of counterintelligence  work, whatever that means. His most recent book is called The Plot to Hack  America. It was a national bestseller, thanks to heavy promotion from  MSNBC.</p><p>The second man you're about to see is Brian Williams who, of course, needs  no introduction. He was the anchor of the NBC Nightly News, back when that  meant something. Williams is widely regarded as - as a good guy by people  who know him and he's absolutely in Washington anyway, is thought of as one  of the smartest people in the news business. </p><p>The point is these are not kooks on late-night radio. They are considered  highly impressive people. Keep that in mind as you watch this. </p><p>Williams opens the segment by explaining that Russian disinformation teams  have been working to divide America and convince the population, among  other totally implausible things, that Jim Comey and Robert Mueller might  have political agendas.</p><p>Ridiculous, right? Williams asked Malcolm Nance to comment on that  proposition and Nance says this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MALCOLM WRIGHTSON NANCE, AUTHOR, MEDIA COMMENTATOR, FORMER UNITED STATES  NAVY SENIOR CHIEF PETTY OFFICER: What Russia has done here and where the  true brilliance of this intelligence operation comes from is way back in  the early 2000s, the Russian military conducted a strategic study and  started carrying out a disinformation plan, in which they said that instead  of carrying out kinetic warfare against your enemies, the best thing we can  do is create a disinformation and (ph) frame around that nation to the  point where over time as we are constantly tearing them apart and feeding  them with false information, they would actually welcome an invasion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLSON: Huh? Wait, wait a second here. This is what we in the news  business call news. </p><p>So, for nearly 20 years, the Russians have been building a disinformation  frame around the United States. What's a disinformation frame? And how does  it manage to brainwash an entire population so thoroughly that they welcome  a foreign invasion?</p><p>I mean that's got to be the most powerful mind control device in human  history. More detail please. This - really this is the part of the  interview where the anchor politely interrupts the guest and ask them to  explain what the hell he's talking about.</p><p>But Williams does not do that. He just lets Malcolm Nance keep talking, so  Malcolm Nance does keep talking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCE: So Russia has done that to the United States. And it began way  before 2016. As a matter of fact, the earliest references I have with  relation to Donald Trump shows that it started back in 2011 with Maria  Butina and the NRA contacts, contacts with the fundamentalist Christian  Right and the Alt-Right in the United States. Russia was pushing these  disinformation themes then. </p><p>Then in 2013, they stood up the Russian Federation Internet Research  Agency, which built all of these memes and tropes, which became the cruise  missiles of fake news and disinformation designed to do what it did today,  take one-third of the United States population and make them refuse to  believe what they see before their very eyes and may have elected a  president in the process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Holy smokes! This is a tsunami of news. </p><p>It turns out that Donald Trump's collusion with Russia began years before  any of us suspected, way back in 2011. Here's the confusing part. In 2011,  by all outward appearances, Trump was still a pretty conventional New York  Liberal.</p><p>He went to David Letterman to read the Top 10 list. He endorsed gun  control. It was all a cover, a sophisticated ruse. As Malcolm Nance  reveals, Trump was, in fact, busy plotting with the NRA, Christian  fundamentalists, and the Alt-Right.</p><p>Now keep in mind, this was years before there was such a thing as the Alt- Right, but that's just how stealthy this operation was. Even the Steele  dossier missed it, so did the rest of us.</p><p>Well, that's not surprising, since as Malcolm Nance has explained, thanks  to Russian brainwashing, one-third of the U.S. population can no longer  perceive reality. That's Malcolm Nance's position.</p><p>What would you do if somebody repeated those exact same words to you on a  city bus? You'd likely be worried. At the very least, you'd probably switch  seats. Not Brian Williams. He'd move closer. </p><p>Williams didn't seem to consider Nance's explanation strange in the  slightest. He was deeply impressed by it. Williams asked how the Russians  could have pulled off an operation this extensive without the willing help  of American accomplices.</p><p>Of course, Nance - Nance had an answer to that. Keep in mind, as you watch  this clip, that we have not edited the tape in any way. This aired verbatim  last night on MSNBC. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCE: They have played on the - the themes of far-Right conspiracy  theorists from the 1960. The John Birch Society, a - a sideline group, you  know, and the farthest extremes of the libertarian parties. </p><p>They have amplified racism to the point where the Alt-Right, Steve Bannon's  own creation of Gamers is now the wholly owned subsidiary of the Trump  campaign and are believers in David Duke, the Ku Klux Klan, Richard -  Richard Spencer, the neo-Nazi, and Robert Spencer, the Islamophobe, to the  point where they're mainstreamed. This is how effective this information  warfare campaign has been carried out. </p><p>And let me tell you, this report shows how they went after to suppress the  African-American vote. And there's no doubt in my mind or anybody else's in  the intelligence community that doesn't believe that it took American  citizens to assist them in really getting down to where these voters were  who needed to be suppressed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Wow! So, in case you weren't transcribing that as you watch, let's  bottom-line it for you.</p><p>The Russia conspiracy just expanded to include a bewildering array of new  figures. These would include the John Birch Society, the KKK, David Duke,  people who play online video games, Steve Bannon, a religion blogger named  Robert Spencer, and others.</p><p>Collectively, their goal was not simply to elect Donald Trump but to hurt  African-Americans. Why would Russian intelligence want to do that, you  might ask? Well if you have to ask, you're probably working for Vladimir  Putin too, so shut up.</p><p>It goes without saying that all of this is completely insane. There's no  evidence to support any of it. It is not true. Worse than that, it's  irresponsible. Keep in mind this aired on a division of NBC News, so some  large number of people are likely going to believe it. </p><p>They'll go to sleep worrying about the invisible disinformation frame that  surrounds their country and the resurgence of the John Birch Society. And  they'll wake up a little more convinced that anyone who disagrees with them  is a tool of a foreign power because that is the real message here, and of  this whole conspiracy.</p><p>There's no other side of the debate. There's only Russian propaganda. To a  certain sort of fragile Liberal, that's probably comforting to know, but  it's a lie. In fact, it's its own form of propaganda. No news organization  should traffic in garbage like this. News anchors exist to push back  against nutty claims like these.</p><p>Brian Williams bought them completely.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN DOUGLAS WILLIAMS, AMERICAN JOURNALIST AT NBC NEWS, MSNBC ANCHOR, THE  11TH HOUR WITH BRIAN WILLIAMS HOST: Wow. Malcolm Nance, this is why we ask  you all the time to come on this broadcast. Scary stuff, but it needs to be  said, needs to be heard. Thank you, sir, so much for joining us once again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It needs to be said. It needs to be heard. This is why we ask you  to come on this broadcast. Save that video. Future generations won't  believe it. </p><p>And now to the actual monetary cost of all this Russia nonsense, what is it  costing taxpayers? Trace Gallagher has been tracking that for us and he  joins us tonight. Hey Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Hey, Tucker. If you back up the  clock to June, President Trump blasted Robert Mueller on Twitter saying,  quoting here, the Russian hoax investigation has now cost our government  over $17 million and going up fast. Turns out, the President was right. </p><p>Brand-new filings by the Department of Justice show that $17 million number  has now risen to $25 million and counting, and that does not include an  additional $5.5 million spent by the Department of Justice on other  expenses related to the Russia investigation. </p><p>Here's a quick rundown of how Mr. Mueller has spent your money over the  past six months. </p><p>$2.9 million went to the salaries and benefits of Special Counsel employees  and Department of Justice employees, 942-plus-thousand was spent on rent,  communication, and utilities, $60,000 for printing supplies and materials,  that's a lot of copies of something, $580,000 on transportation and travel,  and $310,000 for IT services.</p><p>Bottom line, trying to find collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia  is expensive, and working in IT for the Special Counsel is apparently  lucrative. Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, thanks for keeping track.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson is a historian. He's a Senior Fellow at the Hoover  Institution and, we're proud to say, a frequent guest on this show, he  joins us tonight. Professor, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>So, calculate--</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN CLASSICIST,  MILITARY HISTORIAN, COLUMNIST, FARMER: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --if you would in non-monetary terms what you think the costs of  these various Russia investigations have been to the country.</p><p>HANSON: Well I think there's a - they're sins (ph) of commission and  omission because why this is all going on, Tucker, we - we've cracked 3  percent GDP. We hadn't done that in 10 years. That's not an abstract  number. That means millions of people who were not working now have an  opportunity.</p><p>I really see it in where I live in Southwestern Fresno County, it's a human  story. We have peacetime unemployment of 3.7. Remember, just two years ago,  Larry Summers said you - this is - these were - this was the stuff of fairy  stories, and Barack Obama said you need a magic wand.</p><p>We're increasing oil production at 1.5 million barrels a year. We're the  largest oil producer in the world. Nothing hurts Russia more than that fact  alone that we - there's no such word in the English vocabulary for Peak Oil  anymore. So, there's just a human story going on.</p><p>This is not--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HANSON: --even talking about progress overseas. And we're just completely  uninterested in it. I don't know why because a lot of very poor people have  leverage over employers for higher wages that they never had before. </p><p>And the second is there's a really in - inequality of the law. I mean we  talk about the elites. But think of the - the array of people who have not  told the truth. </p><p>Andrew McCabe was fired for lying to federal investigators. We don't know  what's going to happen to him. So far, he hasn't faced criminal charges.  But the Inspector General said he was lying.</p><p>James Comey's statements about the FISA Court and the role of the dossier  are not true. James Clapper lied under oath to Congress. John Brennan lied  under oath to Congress. Susan Rice lied when she said she did not request  surveilled transcripts and have them unmask.</p><p>We know that Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills lied when they said they did not  have knowledge of the email server of Hillary - of their boss, Hillary  Clinton. That's not even getting into the deception of the FISA Court or  the way that the investigations went on the email scandal or putting  informants in a presidential campaign.</p><p>So, the second thing, it's really from a historical point of view, we've  had a lot of wrongdoing by elites. And nobody's - there's been no  consequences. So, the American--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HANSON: --people are not paranoid. They're saying, well the Mueller  investigation's going here but they're going after misdemeanors or nothing.  And here these felonies go completely unaddressed. Then finally, this  Mueller investigation's not in isolation. </p><p>We - we had, remember, from the day Trump was elected, we were told that  the voting machines were fraudulent. We're going to sue. And then there was  in a group, remember about the Electoral College, we had to overturn--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, very well.</p><p>HANSON: --get to the electors. And then we went to the 25th Amendment that  Trump was unbalanced, and then that didn't work. Then we went to the  Emoluments Clause. He profit - even though his businesses had lost a  billion dollars, and then we've gone to the Mueller.</p><p>And so, there's a slow motion, if you will. I don't want to be too  psychodramatic like MSNBC guest. </p><p>But there is sort of a slow-motion coup to overturn the elections when we  should just take a deep breath and say we have a chance to adjudicate this  in the next two - '20 election, and we do not want to destroy 2.5 - you  know, two - over two centuries of American constitutional jurisprudence,  because we know historically, Tucker, when you have whether it's successful  systems like ours or the Greek city-state of the Fourth Century or Rome in  the Fifth Century A.D. or the Byzantines in the 6 - 15th Century or the  ancient regime in Rome, why did they fall apart?</p><p>They fall apart because an elite no longer warrants the respect that they  think that they deserve--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>HANSON: --because they're out of touch with the people. And we have a whole  bunch of people on questions of global warming, as we see in Europe, or  immigration in Eastern Europe, or here at home, that feel that they can  unhide, dictate to people and they're never subject to the ramifications of  their own ideology and policy. </p><p>And it's like the emperor has no close (ph) and then they're - they're  surprised that Trump won or surprised that people are rioting in Paris.  What do they think was--</p><p>CARLSON: If--</p><p>HANSON: --going to happen?</p><p>CARLSON: --if they were wise and had perspective and made good decisions  and cared about their countries, it wouldn't bother me. But they're none of  those things, unfortunately, as you know. Professor, thank you very much.</p><p>HANSON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well for two years, the Fusion GPS dossier has dominated our  political conversation and has driven political events more than maybe any  other fact. What parts of the dossier have proved true over the past two  years?</p><p>Mollie Hemingway has been keeping track. Everybody should be keeping track.  But she's one of the rare few who is, and she'll join us after the break to  tell us what she's found.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well at the center of the two-year Russia investigation is the  Fusion GPS dossier. Hard to remember now, but it was originally compiled as  opposition research by the Hillary Clinton for President Campaign. It was  then passed around to journalists and lawmakers, and finally released on  BuzzFeed without its contents being verified.</p><p>Despite that, the dossier and its allegations have become more important  than America's entire middle class. So, the question is with two years of  thinking about it and poking around in the efforts of every news  organization in Washington to verify it or not, how much the dossier wound  up being true?</p><p>Mollie Hemingway has been following this. She's Senior Editor at The  Federalist. We're happy to have her tonight. So, Mollie, I just want to go  through a couple of the big claims in this, and you tell me if we - if this  happened or not.</p><p>So, the first was Michael Cohen's trip to Prague. Remember the famous trip  to Prague?</p><p>MOLLIE ZIEGLER HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST SENIOR EDITOR, FOX NEWS  CONTRIBUTOR: This is absolutely key. We're told that Michael Cohen, Donald  Trump's personal attorney, went to Prague, had a secret meeting with the  Duma's Konstantin Kosachev that they discussed the collusion arrangement  and that it - and that it went really, and that this was - this was a  really important thing.</p><p>In fact, not only had did that meeting not take place, there's no evidence  that the meeting took place. There's no evidence that Michael Cohen has  ever been to Prague.</p><p>CARLSON: But that was repeated as fact repeatedly.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Well, in fact, in just a few months ago, seven months ago, I  think there was a news report that falsely claimed that the Mueller - that  the Mueller team had evidence that that secret meeting had taken place. </p><p>It is just interesting to note, since we're actually in the sentencing  phase and we're dealing with all - with sort of some resolution here, it  wasn't even mentioned by Bob Mueller or anyone else--</p><p>CARLSON: And assuming they were not (ph)--</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --who's going after Cohen (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --one of the things that always struck me about the dossier was it  accused people of crimes, American citizens of crimes, and one of them was  Carter Page, who was described, in effect, as a - as a mastermind Russian  spy.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Carter Page, again, was all over the dossier. And it was so  important, the dossier was viewed so favorably by our federal government.  They used this to secure a wiretap against him. They portrayed him as a  mastermind spy who was setting up all sorts of important meetings and  arranging, again, collusion.</p><p>We were told that he had a - got a stake in - in a large Russian oil  company in exchange for the collusion. These meetings that we were told  took place in the dossier, there's no evidence that any of them happened. </p><p>And it's interesting to note that Carter Page was surveilled for an entire  year by our government, and has not been charged with any crime despite  being portrayed as this - as the central linchpin of the collusion theory  (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But I do think it destroyed his life, so there's that.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Now, at the very center of this were the salacious claims that  Trump was caught doing things with hookers, and he was subject to blackmail  as a result of this. Did that happen?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Right. So, this was - this was what made it so interesting and  what made the journalists so excited when the dossier was first published,  not just the tale of the - of the prostitutes at the Moscow hotel, but we  were told that Russia had all sorts of compromising information on Donald  Trump, and that he would be compromised and blackmailed by this.</p><p>Then you can look at his record over the last two years and see that if  Russia has anything compromising on him they should have deployed it while  he was going after them in such an aggressive fashion in foreign policy--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --and they haven't done anything of the kind. There is no  evidence to support this. But a lot of people are, in fact, druthers (ph)  on this.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Meanwhile, as Victor Davis Hanson just pointed out, the one  thing they care about is energy, and America is now the world's largest oil  producer, energy producer, so we haven't helped them too much. </p><p>The Trump Towers in Moscow, you hear that to this day.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: So, you need to have business interests in order to have this  collusion theory make sense. The dossier said a bunch of actually kind of  contradictory things that Trump was very interested in a business deal in  Russia, and also that he'd been offered sweetheart deals.</p><p>Well if you've been offered sweetheart deals, I think we can reasonably  assume he would have taken them. There's no evidence he has ever  successfully accomplished any business relationship in Russia.</p><p>CARLSON: And finally, and this claim, again, persists to this day that  Manafort manipulated WikiLeaks in order to hurt Hillary Clinton, and I  think it's basically wrecked Roger Stone's life, this - this claim from the  dossier. Is it true? Do we know that that's true?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: So, the dossier claimed that Manafort was really the one in  charge of the entire collusion theory that, in fact, Carter Page was  working on his orders. There's no evidence that they even met that he - we  were told that Manafort was the one who came up with the whole WikiLeaks  idea. There's no evidence.</p><p>And we have a lot of court filings where if there were any evidence of  this, you know darn well that this would have been mentioned in any of  these filings. Now the whole genius of this dossier is that it has a bunch  of allegations that are improb - impossible to disprove. </p><p>And that's not the way that justice is supposed to be done in this country  where you say, \"Well if you're innocent, you have to prove that these  things never happened.\" These are a bunch of wild allegations without  evidence to support them, and we are now years into this--</p><p>CARLSON: No, you're right.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --and it's--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean that's the--</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --it's a lie.</p><p>CARLSON: --standard we apply to Supreme Court justices, but not - not to  anyone else. Mollie Hemingway, great to see you. Thank you for that.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Great to be here with you.</p><p>CARLSON: For your rigorous look at that.</p><p>Well anti-Russia panic has reignited the Cold War and driven us apart from  Russia. But is that good for American interests? Why should we be Russia's  enemy? That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: At the center of the Russia panic is an accusation that bears  directly on a key foreign policy question that affects all of us, and it's  this. By colluding with Russia, Donald Trump and his team agreed to sell  out America's interests by aligning with Vladimir Putin's government. </p><p>That's what they're saying. In real life, of course, the opposite has  happened. In the past two years, relations with Russia have deteriorated to  historically bad levels, really the worst since the Cuban Missile Crisis of  1962. </p><p>The question is has that helped America in some way? And what is wrong with  improving relations with Russia? Donald Trump ran on improving relations  with Russia and got elected, as you remember.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Wouldn't it actually be  wonderful if we could get along with Russia?</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING YES)</p><p>TRUMP: Wouldn't that be nice?</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)</p><p>TRUMP: If we get along with Russia, we'd go out together with others and  we'd knock the hell out of ISIS, wouldn't that be great?</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING YES)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Steve Cohen is a former NYU professor, one of the eminent Russia  experts in America, Author of the new book, War with Russia: From Putin and  Ukraine To Trump and Russiagate, and he joins us tonight. Professor, thanks  very much for coming on. So--</p><p>STEPHEN COHEN, NYU PROFESSOR EMERITUS, THE NATION CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, WAR  WITH RUSSIA AUTHOR: Well, you've got quite a lot - you've got a quite a  lineup tonight, all the skeptics.</p><p>CARLSON: Well it's what's just so interesting you - at the heart of this is  a real foreign policy question, which is why we're always so grateful to  talk to you. </p><p>And that question is does the United States benefit in some way from  demonizing Russia? Should we be enemies with Russia? Or, could we benefit  more from some kind of loose alliance with Russia? </p><p>That's really the question that Trump's raised (ph) and I'm starting to  suspect that that view was so unpopular that it's driving the Russia  investigation, at least in part, do you think?</p><p>COHEN: It's a mystery of our time. And I promise you that your kids and my  grandkids and the historians of their generation will look back on this  terrible era, this Russiagate era, and ask who started it, why it got such  traction, and why it's done the damage it's done?</p><p>Now, one explanation, but I'm not sure it's a complete explanation is that  when Trump said during the campaign, it would be great to cooperate with  Russia, the enemies of such cooperation saw in Trump an enemy, and they  began this, literally unproven, allegation that he was somehow under the  control of the Kremlin.</p><p>But the damage it's done to our national security and to our institutions,  the you - you may be the only person who's - who's - who's asked the  question. But I guarantee you historians will ask it, what have been the  cost of these two years of Russiagate? </p><p>They've been grave. I mean Victor Hanson pointed out the corruption of our  elites. But what about the corruption of our institutions? The presidency,  elections, suspicions, doubts have been cast on these basic American  institutions. </p><p>And then I come to the thing that concerns me the most that I worry about  in this book, War with Russia? I mean it. I think it's a possibility that  Trump is not free to do crisis negotiation with Russia, and there's going  to be a crisis soon, for sure, the way every president since Eisenhower has  been.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>COHEN: I've said that before on your show. It's virtually an existential  constitutional duty of the American President in the nuclear age to be free  and powered to deal with questions of war and peace with Russia the way  John F. Kennedy was, Cuban Missile Crisis.</p><p>I can't imagine what's going to happen if we have such a crisis. Trump is  shackled. Remember what happened in July. I think you and I might have  talked about it on the air. Trump went to Helsinki for a perfectly  ritualistic, normal summit meeting with Putin. Comes home--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, we were there.</p><p>COHEN: --and he's accused of treason.</p><p>CARLSON: I remember.</p><p>COHEN: Accused for treason. So, that's the--</p><p>CARLSON: So - so let me--</p><p>COHEN: --cost.</p><p>CARLSON: --can I ask you - we only have a minute left. But I'm so  interested in this question and I don't know the answer. What was the -  what's the motive? Apart from disliking Trump, their political motives,  obviously, but there is - part of our foreign policy establishment really  believes that we ought to be in some sort of adversarial posture against  Russia. Why?</p><p>COHEN: I - I don't know. And when you don't know you got to say it. But  here is a theory that some people would offer you if asked that question.  When the Soviet Union ended in 1991, the Washington elites who controlled  foreign policy saw a world dominated or governed by or run by the United  States.</p><p>And that seemed to be a reality in the 1990s when Russia had a President  who was ill, often drunk, and very compliant to Washington. And we got used  to that. Russia is a kind of junior subservient partner in world affair  (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>COHEN: And then came Putin, and it was a shock, and they've been reacting  to the shock of Putin ever since. And I'll give you one quote.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>COHEN: Nicholas Kristof, a very influential New York Times Correspondent -  Columnist, lamented in (ph) print, listen to this, that Putin did not turn  out to be what he expected, namely, a sober Yeltsin, Yeltsin having been  the President of Russia in the 1990s. So, part of this--</p><p>CARLSON: The - the arrogance and dumbness--</p><p>COHEN: --was done (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --of our - of the people who make our policy and influence our  policy really will be the - the - the title of every history of this  period. Professor, thank you. It's--</p><p>COHEN: I agree with that.</p><p>CARLSON: --great to see you and congrats on the new book.</p><p>COHEN: Thanks, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: First it was Rudolph and bullying, now the Left's war on  Christmas, which is not real, but still continues unabated, is targeting  gingerbread men, man, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Recently, we interviewed a New York State Senator, a Democrat  called Kevin Parker. </p><p>Parker is sponsoring a law bill in New York that will require anybody who  wants to buy a gun to give the state the passwords to their social media  accounts, so politicians can make sure they didn't say anything naughty  that they disagree with, because when you say violent things online,  according to Kevin Parker, you shouldn't have a firearm. </p><p>Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN PARKER, NEW YORK STATE SENATOR, DEMOCRATIC MEMBER: This law simply  says let's look at, you know, what people are putting out on social media  as a, you know, the - you know, part of a - a set of criteria that we're  using to determine who gets handguns.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>Do you think that people have a right to say outrageous things, maybe even  things you disagree with, in public, do you think--</p><p>PARKER: They - they certainly--</p><p>CARLSON: --that that be good (ph)?</p><p>PARKER: --they certainly can say whatever they want to say. But we also  have the right--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, but then you punish them--</p><p>PARKER: --we also have--</p><p>CARLSON: --for saying that.</p><p>PARKER: --but we also have a right to deny them a gun permit if, in fact,  we believe that the things that they're saying may lead to them endangering  the people of the State of New York.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. So, if you say something threatening online, he doesn't think  you should have a gun. Well, as we've chronicled exhaustively on this show,  there's something called projection, and that's what you accuse people you  don't like of doing precisely the thing that you are doing. Freud wrote a  book about that, I think.</p><p>Well this morning, Parker, the guy you just saw, tweeted this, Kill  yourself!, at a GOP, I know I'm laughing because it's just hilarious, is  it's so grotesque, at Spokeswoman - Republican Spokeswoman Candice Giove. </p><p>Parker, turns out, was mad at being accused of improperly parking on the  streets of Manhattan. I'm sure that didn't happen. Well, the Spokeswoman  was shocked, she tweeted this. \"Did a Senator just write this to me?\" </p><p>And the answer, of course, is yes. Kill yourself, he said. Unbelievable.  That really does go into Hypocrisy Hall of Fame. We hope Mr. Parker will  come back and explain it to us. I'm sure he will.</p><p>Well the war on Christmas is not real, they tell you that all the time.  It's totally fake. And if you believe in it, you're dumb, you watch Fox  News or something. But it's also, of course, going on. And it's being  fought very fiercely here in America, but not just in America.</p><p>The war on Christmas is a global struggle. In the Parliament of Scotland,  they have a National Parliament, the coffee shop has stopped selling  gingerbread men. Why? Gender-specific. They're now called gingerbread  people. </p><p>You don't want to give them a gender without their consent. You don't even  want to know how many bathrooms there are in gingerbread houses now, a lot.</p><p>Tammy Bruce is a radio host and President of Independent Women's Voice, and  she joins us tonight. Tammy, so I have this - have this sneaking suspicion  that a lot of the people who are doing things like this are actually Right- wing plants there to discredit the progressives they live among. </p><p>Do you think that's possible?</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS ON-AIR CONTRIBUTOR, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE  PRESIDENT: I don't. I think though that they're - it's--</p><p>CARLSON: You don't--</p><p>BRUCE: --I - I know. It's - it's very funny. And now I've been - starting  to think about the complicated structure of gingerbread houses because of  your comment. I'm just wondering, how many bathrooms can they get into one  house? But look, here is the problem. And it just proves, of course, our  point, in general. </p><p>The Left has worked now for a couple of generations to condition us to  ahead of time worry about what we're going to say. Even your last segment,  of course, is about that little bit of - of challenging people and  threatening them and making sure that they know that there's danger in  those thoughts.</p><p>And so, this baker, she said it was a whim that she just thought you just -  like for no good reason that she should not call them gingerbread men and  call them a gingerbread person, and I couldn't tell, obviously, because  they're also not wearing clothes. So, it's hard to say what it is that  there - they - they are, and what they're doing and what they're not doing.</p><p>But she said she was also shocked by the response. And that's the good  news, Tucker, is that this is in - in, again, Scotland, the United Kingdom.  And the backlash, she was apparently shocked that people were really upset  about this. </p><p>And - and I contend after a series of, you know, living your entire life  being kind of bullied into what you can and cannot say and presumptions  that you're--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>BRUCE: --bad people that it can be the smallest thing that tips you over  the edge that's a - that's the tipping point. And in this case, it's, you  know, calling gingerbread men a gingerbread person when obviously they're  men. </p><p>CARLSON: Well, so maybe the lesson is that the rest of us shouldn't  participate in our own spiritual neutering and that we should--</p><p>BRUCE: That's correct.</p><p>CARLSON: --at every step along the way say, I'm not - I'm not complying  with that. I'm sorry--</p><p>BRUCE: That is correct.</p><p>CARLSON: --call HR on me, I'm not doing it.</p><p>BRUCE: And - and look, this Kentucky radio station is a very good example  of that. You know, Baby, It's Cold Outside, the famous song has come under  fire for being inappropriate. And a station in Ohio cut it off of their -  their list.</p><p>Well a - a Kentucky radio station decided to put it on a loop five  different versions they - because it's been covered by everybody, and they  played it continuously for two hours. Obviously, Kentucky for two hours on  Sunday was - was nirvana. </p><p>And they just play and everybody loved it. And they said, \"Look, we've  stand behind this. We're going to play it. We're not afraid.\" And that's a  very good idea is that this is the one way to stop it is to do the thing  that the bullies and the establishment tell you that you're not allowed to  do in an effort to control you. </p><p>And as a statement, I think--</p><p>CARLSON: That's right.</p><p>BRUCE: --sometimes that's important.</p><p>CARLSON: I agree. And also being an independent thinker in a time of  mandatory conformity pays off in the event (ph)--</p><p>BRUCE: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --we've got to hope. Tammy--</p><p>BRUCE: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --thank you very much.</p><p>BRUCE: Thank you. I'll get my gingerbread now. You too.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes (ph). </p><p>Well, Apple, the company that makes your phone and your tablet and your  laptop is one of the most profitable companies in the world, have the  biggest market cap in the world, may still. And yet, American taxpayers are  still subsidizing Apple. Why is that? Our investigation into big tech  continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for several years running, the tech giant Apple has been  this country's most lucrative company. It regularly earns tens of billions  in profits every year. Despite that, for reasons that aren't exactly clear,  lawmakers are eager to give Apple tax breaks, tax breaks that you're not  getting and could never get because sorry, you're not Apple.</p><p>For example, in return for expanding its campus in Austin, Texas,  Williamson County, where Austin is, is prepared to give Apple a property  tax break worth more than $20 million. Again, are you getting anything like  that? Probably not. Why are they getting it? </p><p>Chip Roy is a Republican. He's the Congressman-elect for the 21st  Congressional district of Texas, and he joins us tonight. Mr. Roy, thank  you very much. Congrats, by the way, on winning, and thanks for coming on  tonight. What - why in the world--</p><p>CHIP ROY, CONGRESSMAN-ELECT FOR THE 21ST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS,  REPUBLICAN MEMBER: Good evening, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --would any County give Apple a tax break?</p><p>ROY: Well, you know, that's a great question. It's a question that I've  been asking. And I know that there's a popular mode of doing business in  this country now to try to pay businesses to move to your state. </p><p>But I don't think you need to pay people to move to Texas. Texas is a great  state with low tax rates and--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ROY: --good reasons to move here. So, I don't understand why we would give  upwards of $50 million to a company that has up close to $250 billion in  cash in the bank and a trillion dollar market cap, which is bigger than the  GDP of about a 180 countries.</p><p>It's just more of the same corporate cronyism that we see at the federal,  state and local level that I think voters are getting tired of. I know that  - well I heard on the campaign trail, people are getting sick of that.</p><p>CARLSON: Nobody says anything about it. I mean when Amazon did this in New  York, one of the only people, and I'm ashamed to say this, was not a  Republican, just the opposite. It was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. </p><p>And everyone else on both sides were nodding, \"Oh, Amazon good, Amazon  good.\" Why does nobody raise an alarm over this kind of behavior?</p><p>ROY: Well I think a lot of people, particularly, on the Republican side of  the aisle, hide behind job creation, and they think that well, we just  throw money around, it's going to create jobs. And the fact of the matter  is I think we are chasing, you know, good money after bad, while we throw  money at corporations that have tons of - of resources.</p><p>And frankly, they don't - they're not sharing our values. Corporations are  attacking our core--</p><p>CARLSON: That's for sure.</p><p>ROY: --Texas values, our core American values. You got Tim Cook lecturing  us about border security, and how we're somehow inhumane because we want to  have border security. What is inhumane is having cheap labor in China prop  up your profits and then tell us how we should live our lives in Texas. </p><p>And I'm frankly kind of sick of it. I think it's inhumane that little girls  are getting sold into the sex trade because we don't have border security. </p><p>And yet, we're getting lectured by Tim Cook about what we need to do and  being held ransom for $50 million in Texas when they've got $250 billion in  cash in the bank, and I just don't think that's the way things ought to  fly.</p><p>CARLSON: I've been really hoping so fervently the Republican Party would  change, and the fact that you just got elected is evidence that it is. So,  thank you very much. Chip Roy, congrats again. God bless.</p><p>ROY: Thanks, Tucker, look forward to it, take care.</p><p>CARLSON: Instead of giving big tech huge tax breaks, what should lawmakers  be doing about their growing influence? One person who's been thinking  about this for a long time and getting no credit for it, believe it or not,  is Ralph Nader, of course, the long-time consumer advocate, Author of the  new book, How the Rats Re-Formed the Congress, he joins us tonight.</p><p>Mr. Nader, thank you very much for coming on. The reason I want to talk to  you is I don't think you've gotten the credit you deserve for being a lone  voice on the Left raising concerns about the concentration of power in the  tech sector. What happens when you say that out loud?</p><p>RALPH NADER, POLITICAL ACTIVIST, LECTURER, ATTORNEY, HOW THE RATS RE-FORMED  THE CONGRESS AUTHOR: Well the Congress always bemused by the razzle-dazzle  of Silicon Valley and - and, you know, supposedly clean industry has  horrible pollution coming in from the supply chain and all the rock (ph)  when they dismantle the stuff. And they have no tech capability to ask the  right question.</p><p>So Newt Gingrich in 1995 got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in  Congress, which is he not (ph) Professional Advisor. So, when they deal  with things like, you know, ballistic missile defense or Facebook or  Google, they would have the experts right there.</p><p>And so, there they are, they have these hearings and, you know, outrage and  admiration came from the Members of the House--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --and the Senate that went nowhere. So, the question coming up in  Congress is, are they going to regulate them like they, suppose, you know,  they regulate cars or pharmaceuticals.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: Or are they going to just have Quasi-regulation like the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation does for banks or are they going to create a  trade association to regulate them with standards overseen by some agency?  It doesn't look good.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission nailed Facebook in 2011, led by David Vladeck,  the Consumer Protection Bureau, and haven't (ph) enforced at all. And  Facebook has been violating or letting others, third-party, fourth-party,  Cambridge Analytics violate that consent decree. And it's--</p><p>CARLSON: It's but - but wait (ph) - OK, so you became famous--</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: 1965-ish going after--</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --General Motors.</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And the Right didn't like you because you were attacking business.  But the Left loved you. You became this huge hero. You're saying the same  thing now about the big tech companies, why is no one joining your side?</p><p>NADER: We don't get onto mass media. The civic communities that are raising  issues of crony capitalism, corporate welfare, these kind of tax breaks,  you know, for--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --Apple. Apple is just burning a $100 billion in stock buybacks,  they aren't (ph) giving it back to the shareholders or the workers or the  environment cleanup or the pension funds. </p><p>They want to buyback all that stock to increase the metrics for the  Executive Compensation packages for Tim Cook and others. And you can't get  on national TV on that. You can't even get on - NB - NPR and - and PBS.</p><p>CARLSON: Why?</p><p>NADER: And I've been talking about corporate welfare and the Right, it  talks about crony capitalism, so we're converging, right? </p><p>I think there are a lot of issues in this country, as I pointed out in my  book, Unstoppable, where Conservatives and Liberals back home where they  work, live, and raise their families, right, never mind the ideology--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>NADER: --red state, blue state. They bleed. They get ripped off the same  way--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>NADER: --disinfected, disempowered. And there's no publicity given - given  to it at all. And that - so I'm - I've resorted to a fable. How the Rats  Re-Formed the Congress. It's big rat infestation, you know--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --in D.C.</p><p>CARLSON: Literally.</p><p>NADER: Yes, literally. And they come up from the catacombs in this book and  they get into the toilet polls (ph) first with the Speaker. You can imagine  the result.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: You try to suppress an increasing rat infestation, massive derision  all over the country, it wakes people up. They look at 535 men and women in  Congress, who are using their delegated power under the - we, the people,  right?</p><p>Then they organize a mass movement and get control of Congress from the  corporatists, from the Wall Streeters. You pointed out in your book, the  ruling class should share power. Otherwise, they're going to lose in  whatever Democratic institutions we have.  So, Members of Congress have called this disgusting, outrageous, revolting,  because of the opening pages. But you go back on this, this is a single  most devastating document in--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --indictment (ph) of Congress on one page.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm going to read it. I don't know. I remember at one point  disagreeing with you--</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --on stuff. But I can't remember what it was. I now think that on  this stuff anyway, you're an important voice--</p><p>NADER: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: --and I'm grateful that you came on this show.</p><p>NADER: You go to ratsreformcongress.org--</p><p>CARLSON: Ratsreformcongress--</p><p>NADER: --and you'll get in a (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm going to. And I probably agree with a lot of it that you're  saying (ph).</p><p>NADER: You - you'll get instruction on how to organize back home--</p><p>CARLSON: I love it.</p><p>NADER: --Congress Ratwatcher Groups.</p><p>CARLSON: Ralph Nader, it's great to see you. Thank you.</p><p>NADER: Thanks for the sunglass (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: We've got a Fox News Alert. </p><p>The Senate has passed Criminal Justice Reform. The bill passed 87 to 12,  wow, big margin. The President strongly encouraged Congress to act on the  bill before the end of the lame-duck session. That bill now goes to the  House. Obviously, we'll continue to follow the story. </p><p>And we'll be right back with an important holiday message for you after the  break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: SHIP OF FOOLS.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well as the last hour has demonstrated, in fact, the last decade  has demonstrated, America's ruling class has lost the ability to govern  wisely. They're obsessed with trifles like the Russia investigation, or  gender politics or whatever the nonsense fad (ph) of the day is.</p><p>Meanwhile, they ignore our dying middle class. They know nothing about  falling life expectancy, they don't care. They're more interesting in the  wellbeing of anyone other than their own citizens. They do nothing to  counter the main threats to our wellbeing, big tech, or China.</p><p>Much of the time they directly enable these threats because they're getting  rich from it. How'd we get to this place? Well, it's the subject of a new  book called Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Bringing America  to the Brink of Revolution. It tells the long, gory story. But it may be  worth reading. We recommend it strongly.</p><p>That's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night 8:00 P.M, the show  that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially,  groupthink. Good night from Washington. </p><p>Sean Hannity is next. Sitting in though, the most famous judge in America,  not Judge Judy, much better, Judge Jeanine. Hey, Judge.</p><p>JEANINE PIRRO- HOST: Thank you, Tucker. Great show.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>END </p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

That would be for the crime of lying to FBI agents in his now-famous White House interview at the very beginning of the Administration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a number of reasons, you've probably already heard about, none of them very significant in the cosmic scheme of things, that sentencing has been postponed until the New Year. And, of course, we'll bring you the details when that happens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the meantime though, we thought we would seize this opportunity to take stock of all that we have learned, Michael Flynn being, of course, the first major target of the Mueller investigation. That was all the way back, if you can believe it, at the beginning of last year, 2017.</p><p>So, it's been just about two years, almost, and the hunt for Russian spies on our soil has not slowed down. It has metastasized into something vast and remarkable. It's now practically its own agency of government.</p><p>There are now, we think this is right, there could be more, but what we could find are a half a dozen separate Russia investigations now being conducted by the Justice Department.</p><p>That does not even count the separate Congressional inquiries or - four, five, maybe more, who knows, and then, of course, nearly a 100 percent of the attention of every news organization in Washington, almost everyone.</p><p>So, what have we learned after all that time and all that money and all that attention? Well, we know that the Russians spent a total of, let's check the math, $4,700 on Google ads during the 2016 election. Try to buy a car for that.</p><p>We also know that Jerome Corsi and George Papadopoulos, two people you probably had never heard of before, likely did something bad, like misremembering dates or emails, though apparently neither one of them spied for anybody. That's what we've learned.</p><p>We've also learned that, and people are not noting this, but we thought it'd be worth pointing out, virtually every issue that led voters unexpectedly to support Donald Trump in 2016 remains as of now unresolved, in some cases, not even addressed.</p><p>That would include the decline of the American middle class, the drop in life expectancy, the opioid crisis, our unsecured Southern border, crushing student loan debt, the global dominance of China, the quagmire in Afghanistan, infrastructure, healthcare costs, we could go on, you know, the little things.</p><p>You haven't heard a lot about any of that lately. The news anchors have not had time to tell you about any of that because they're too busy shouting self-righteously about Michael Flynn. \"He lied. He lied.\" They, by contrast, never lie because they're good people, unlike Michael Flynn who lied.</p><p>So, I guess the point is there's been a cost to our Russia fixation. Years later, we may look back and wonder what happened during the last two years. How did everybody in America with an Ivy League education simultaneously go insane in the space of a single year?</p><p>Was there some kind of mass poisoning? Was it Ergotism? It happened in medieval France maybe - maybe that's what happened.</p><p>We're going to let historians sort that out. We're not really sure. For now, all we know for certain is that the people in charge have lost it, they really have. And if you don't believe it, listen to them explain the intricacies of the Russia conspiracy. They're mesmerized by it. It's a tale so complex, so riddled with internal contradictions, it sounds like an Eastern religion. Only they really understand it, but they mean it and they do understand it. To them, Russia is the touchstone. It's the comprehensive theory of everything.</p><p>Consider what happened, for example, last night in cable news, and it really could have been any night on cable news. MSNBC, CNN, take your pick. We just happened to be watching last night around 11:00 when this happened, so we're bringing it to you tonight because it's interesting, and it tells you a lot.</p><p>By the way, this is from the most serious news program that NBC offers on cable. It's called The 11th Hour. There are two people in this segment we're about to show you. The first is a man called Malcolm Nance.</p><p>Now, Nance identifies himself as a 35-year veteran of counterintelligence work, whatever that means. His most recent book is called The Plot to Hack America. It was a national bestseller, thanks to heavy promotion from MSNBC.</p><p>The second man you're about to see is Brian Williams who, of course, needs no introduction. He was the anchor of the NBC Nightly News, back when that meant something. Williams is widely regarded as - as a good guy by people who know him and he's absolutely in Washington anyway, is thought of as one of the smartest people in the news business.</p><p>The point is these are not kooks on late-night radio. They are considered highly impressive people. Keep that in mind as you watch this.</p><p>Williams opens the segment by explaining that Russian disinformation teams have been working to divide America and convince the population, among other totally implausible things, that Jim Comey and Robert Mueller might have political agendas.</p><p>Ridiculous, right? Williams asked Malcolm Nance to comment on that proposition and Nance says this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALCOLM WRIGHTSON NANCE, AUTHOR, MEDIA COMMENTATOR, FORMER UNITED STATES NAVY SENIOR CHIEF PETTY OFFICER: What Russia has done here and where the true brilliance of this intelligence operation comes from is way back in the early 2000s, the Russian military conducted a strategic study and started carrying out a disinformation plan, in which they said that instead of carrying out kinetic warfare against your enemies, the best thing we can do is create a disinformation and (ph) frame around that nation to the point where over time as we are constantly tearing them apart and feeding them with false information, they would actually welcome an invasion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Huh? Wait, wait a second here. This is what we in the news business call news.</p><p>So, for nearly 20 years, the Russians have been building a disinformation frame around the United States. What's a disinformation frame? And how does it manage to brainwash an entire population so thoroughly that they welcome a foreign invasion?</p><p>I mean that's got to be the most powerful mind control device in human history. More detail please. This - really this is the part of the interview where the anchor politely interrupts the guest and ask them to explain what the hell he's talking about.</p><p>But Williams does not do that. He just lets Malcolm Nance keep talking, so Malcolm Nance does keep talking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCE: So Russia has done that to the United States. And it began way before 2016. As a matter of fact, the earliest references I have with relation to Donald Trump shows that it started back in 2011 with Maria Butina and the NRA contacts, contacts with the fundamentalist Christian Right and the Alt-Right in the United States. Russia was pushing these disinformation themes then.</p><p>Then in 2013, they stood up the Russian Federation Internet Research Agency, which built all of these memes and tropes, which became the cruise missiles of fake news and disinformation designed to do what it did today, take one-third of the United States population and make them refuse to believe what they see before their very eyes and may have elected a president in the process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Holy smokes! This is a tsunami of news.</p><p>It turns out that Donald Trump's collusion with Russia began years before any of us suspected, way back in 2011. Here's the confusing part. In 2011, by all outward appearances, Trump was still a pretty conventional New York Liberal.</p><p>He went to David Letterman to read the Top 10 list. He endorsed gun control. It was all a cover, a sophisticated ruse. As Malcolm Nance reveals, Trump was, in fact, busy plotting with the NRA, Christian fundamentalists, and the Alt-Right.</p><p>Now keep in mind, this was years before there was such a thing as the Alt- Right, but that's just how stealthy this operation was. Even the Steele dossier missed it, so did the rest of us.</p><p>Well, that's not surprising, since as Malcolm Nance has explained, thanks to Russian brainwashing, one-third of the U.S. population can no longer perceive reality. That's Malcolm Nance's position.</p><p>What would you do if somebody repeated those exact same words to you on a city bus? You'd likely be worried. At the very least, you'd probably switch seats. Not Brian Williams. He'd move closer.</p><p>Williams didn't seem to consider Nance's explanation strange in the slightest. He was deeply impressed by it. Williams asked how the Russians could have pulled off an operation this extensive without the willing help of American accomplices.</p><p>Of course, Nance - Nance had an answer to that. Keep in mind, as you watch this clip, that we have not edited the tape in any way. This aired verbatim last night on MSNBC. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCE: They have played on the - the themes of far-Right conspiracy theorists from the 1960. The John Birch Society, a - a sideline group, you know, and the farthest extremes of the libertarian parties.</p><p>They have amplified racism to the point where the Alt-Right, Steve Bannon's own creation of Gamers is now the wholly owned subsidiary of the Trump campaign and are believers in David Duke, the Ku Klux Klan, Richard - Richard Spencer, the neo-Nazi, and Robert Spencer, the Islamophobe, to the point where they're mainstreamed. This is how effective this information warfare campaign has been carried out.</p><p>And let me tell you, this report shows how they went after to suppress the African-American vote. And there's no doubt in my mind or anybody else's in the intelligence community that doesn't believe that it took American citizens to assist them in really getting down to where these voters were who needed to be suppressed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Wow! So, in case you weren't transcribing that as you watch, let's bottom-line it for you.</p><p>The Russia conspiracy just expanded to include a bewildering array of new figures. These would include the John Birch Society, the KKK, David Duke, people who play online video games, Steve Bannon, a religion blogger named Robert Spencer, and others.</p><p>Collectively, their goal was not simply to elect Donald Trump but to hurt African-Americans. Why would Russian intelligence want to do that, you might ask? Well if you have to ask, you're probably working for Vladimir Putin too, so shut up.</p><p>It goes without saying that all of this is completely insane. There's no evidence to support any of it. It is not true. Worse than that, it's irresponsible. Keep in mind this aired on a division of NBC News, so some large number of people are likely going to believe it.</p><p>They'll go to sleep worrying about the invisible disinformation frame that surrounds their country and the resurgence of the John Birch Society. And they'll wake up a little more convinced that anyone who disagrees with them is a tool of a foreign power because that is the real message here, and of this whole conspiracy.</p><p>There's no other side of the debate. There's only Russian propaganda. To a certain sort of fragile Liberal, that's probably comforting to know, but it's a lie. In fact, it's its own form of propaganda. No news organization should traffic in garbage like this. News anchors exist to push back against nutty claims like these.</p><p>Brian Williams bought them completely.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN DOUGLAS WILLIAMS, AMERICAN JOURNALIST AT NBC NEWS, MSNBC ANCHOR, THE 11TH HOUR WITH BRIAN WILLIAMS HOST: Wow. Malcolm Nance, this is why we ask you all the time to come on this broadcast. Scary stuff, but it needs to be said, needs to be heard. Thank you, sir, so much for joining us once again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It needs to be said. It needs to be heard. This is why we ask you to come on this broadcast. Save that video. Future generations won't believe it.</p><p>And now to the actual monetary cost of all this Russia nonsense, what is it costing taxpayers? Trace Gallagher has been tracking that for us and he joins us tonight. Hey Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Hey, Tucker. If you back up the clock to June, President Trump blasted Robert Mueller on Twitter saying, quoting here, the Russian hoax investigation has now cost our government over $17 million and going up fast. Turns out, the President was right.</p><p>Brand-new filings by the Department of Justice show that $17 million number has now risen to $25 million and counting, and that does not include an additional $5.5 million spent by the Department of Justice on other expenses related to the Russia investigation.</p><p>Here's a quick rundown of how Mr. Mueller has spent your money over the past six months.</p><p>$2.9 million went to the salaries and benefits of Special Counsel employees and Department of Justice employees, 942-plus-thousand was spent on rent, communication, and utilities, $60,000 for printing supplies and materials, that's a lot of copies of something, $580,000 on transportation and travel, and $310,000 for IT services.</p><p>Bottom line, trying to find collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia is expensive, and working in IT for the Special Counsel is apparently lucrative. Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, thanks for keeping track.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson is a historian. He's a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and, we're proud to say, a frequent guest on this show, he joins us tonight. Professor, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>So, calculate--</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN CLASSICIST, MILITARY HISTORIAN, COLUMNIST, FARMER: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --if you would in non-monetary terms what you think the costs of these various Russia investigations have been to the country.</p><p>HANSON: Well I think there's a - they're sins (ph) of commission and omission because why this is all going on, Tucker, we - we've cracked 3 percent GDP. We hadn't done that in 10 years. That's not an abstract number. That means millions of people who were not working now have an opportunity.</p><p>I really see it in where I live in Southwestern Fresno County, it's a human story. We have peacetime unemployment of 3.7. Remember, just two years ago, Larry Summers said you - this is - these were - this was the stuff of fairy stories, and Barack Obama said you need a magic wand.</p><p>We're increasing oil production at 1.5 million barrels a year. We're the largest oil producer in the world. Nothing hurts Russia more than that fact alone that we - there's no such word in the English vocabulary for Peak Oil anymore. So, there's just a human story going on.</p><p>This is not--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HANSON: --even talking about progress overseas. And we're just completely uninterested in it. I don't know why because a lot of very poor people have leverage over employers for higher wages that they never had before.</p><p>And the second is there's a really in - inequality of the law. I mean we talk about the elites. But think of the - the array of people who have not told the truth.</p><p>Andrew McCabe was fired for lying to federal investigators. We don't know what's going to happen to him. So far, he hasn't faced criminal charges. But the Inspector General said he was lying.</p><p>James Comey's statements about the FISA Court and the role of the dossier are not true. James Clapper lied under oath to Congress. John Brennan lied under oath to Congress. Susan Rice lied when she said she did not request surveilled transcripts and have them unmask.</p><p>We know that Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills lied when they said they did not have knowledge of the email server of Hillary - of their boss, Hillary Clinton. That's not even getting into the deception of the FISA Court or the way that the investigations went on the email scandal or putting informants in a presidential campaign.</p><p>So, the second thing, it's really from a historical point of view, we've had a lot of wrongdoing by elites. And nobody's - there's been no consequences. So, the American--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HANSON: --people are not paranoid. They're saying, well the Mueller investigation's going here but they're going after misdemeanors or nothing. And here these felonies go completely unaddressed. Then finally, this Mueller investigation's not in isolation.</p><p>We - we had, remember, from the day Trump was elected, we were told that the voting machines were fraudulent. We're going to sue. And then there was in a group, remember about the Electoral College, we had to overturn--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, very well.</p><p>HANSON: --get to the electors. And then we went to the 25th Amendment that Trump was unbalanced, and then that didn't work. Then we went to the Emoluments Clause. He profit - even though his businesses had lost a billion dollars, and then we've gone to the Mueller.</p><p>And so, there's a slow motion, if you will. I don't want to be too psychodramatic like MSNBC guest.</p><p>But there is sort of a slow-motion coup to overturn the elections when we should just take a deep breath and say we have a chance to adjudicate this in the next two - '20 election, and we do not want to destroy 2.5 - you know, two - over two centuries of American constitutional jurisprudence, because we know historically, Tucker, when you have whether it's successful systems like ours or the Greek city-state of the Fourth Century or Rome in the Fifth Century A.D. or the Byzantines in the 6 - 15th Century or the ancient regime in Rome, why did they fall apart?</p><p>They fall apart because an elite no longer warrants the respect that they think that they deserve--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>HANSON: --because they're out of touch with the people. And we have a whole bunch of people on questions of global warming, as we see in Europe, or immigration in Eastern Europe, or here at home, that feel that they can unhide, dictate to people and they're never subject to the ramifications of their own ideology and policy.</p><p>And it's like the emperor has no close (ph) and then they're - they're surprised that Trump won or surprised that people are rioting in Paris. What do they think was--</p><p>CARLSON: If--</p><p>HANSON: --going to happen?</p><p>CARLSON: --if they were wise and had perspective and made good decisions and cared about their countries, it wouldn't bother me. But they're none of those things, unfortunately, as you know. Professor, thank you very much.</p><p>HANSON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well for two years, the Fusion GPS dossier has dominated our political conversation and has driven political events more than maybe any other fact. What parts of the dossier have proved true over the past two years?</p><p>Mollie Hemingway has been keeping track. Everybody should be keeping track. But she's one of the rare few who is, and she'll join us after the break to tell us what she's found.</p><p>CARLSON: Well at the center of the two-year Russia investigation is the Fusion GPS dossier. Hard to remember now, but it was originally compiled as opposition research by the Hillary Clinton for President Campaign. It was then passed around to journalists and lawmakers, and finally released on BuzzFeed without its contents being verified.</p><p>Despite that, the dossier and its allegations have become more important than America's entire middle class. So, the question is with two years of thinking about it and poking around in the efforts of every news organization in Washington to verify it or not, how much the dossier wound up being true?</p><p>Mollie Hemingway has been following this. She's Senior Editor at The Federalist. We're happy to have her tonight. So, Mollie, I just want to go through a couple of the big claims in this, and you tell me if we - if this happened or not.</p><p>So, the first was Michael Cohen's trip to Prague. Remember the famous trip to Prague?</p><p>MOLLIE ZIEGLER HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST SENIOR EDITOR, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: This is absolutely key. We're told that Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's personal attorney, went to Prague, had a secret meeting with the Duma's Konstantin Kosachev that they discussed the collusion arrangement and that it - and that it went really, and that this was - this was a really important thing.</p><p>In fact, not only had did that meeting not take place, there's no evidence that the meeting took place. There's no evidence that Michael Cohen has ever been to Prague.</p><p>CARLSON: But that was repeated as fact repeatedly.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Well, in fact, in just a few months ago, seven months ago, I think there was a news report that falsely claimed that the Mueller - that the Mueller team had evidence that that secret meeting had taken place.</p><p>It is just interesting to note, since we're actually in the sentencing phase and we're dealing with all - with sort of some resolution here, it wasn't even mentioned by Bob Mueller or anyone else--</p><p>CARLSON: And assuming they were not (ph)--</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --who's going after Cohen (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --one of the things that always struck me about the dossier was it accused people of crimes, American citizens of crimes, and one of them was Carter Page, who was described, in effect, as a - as a mastermind Russian spy.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Carter Page, again, was all over the dossier. And it was so important, the dossier was viewed so favorably by our federal government. They used this to secure a wiretap against him. They portrayed him as a mastermind spy who was setting up all sorts of important meetings and arranging, again, collusion.</p><p>We were told that he had a - got a stake in - in a large Russian oil company in exchange for the collusion. These meetings that we were told took place in the dossier, there's no evidence that any of them happened.</p><p>And it's interesting to note that Carter Page was surveilled for an entire year by our government, and has not been charged with any crime despite being portrayed as this - as the central linchpin of the collusion theory (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But I do think it destroyed his life, so there's that.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Now, at the very center of this were the salacious claims that Trump was caught doing things with hookers, and he was subject to blackmail as a result of this. Did that happen?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Right. So, this was - this was what made it so interesting and what made the journalists so excited when the dossier was first published, not just the tale of the - of the prostitutes at the Moscow hotel, but we were told that Russia had all sorts of compromising information on Donald Trump, and that he would be compromised and blackmailed by this.</p><p>Then you can look at his record over the last two years and see that if Russia has anything compromising on him they should have deployed it while he was going after them in such an aggressive fashion in foreign policy--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --and they haven't done anything of the kind. There is no evidence to support this. But a lot of people are, in fact, druthers (ph) on this.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Meanwhile, as Victor Davis Hanson just pointed out, the one thing they care about is energy, and America is now the world's largest oil producer, energy producer, so we haven't helped them too much.</p><p>The Trump Towers in Moscow, you hear that to this day.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: So, you need to have business interests in order to have this collusion theory make sense. The dossier said a bunch of actually kind of contradictory things that Trump was very interested in a business deal in Russia, and also that he'd been offered sweetheart deals.</p><p>Well if you've been offered sweetheart deals, I think we can reasonably assume he would have taken them. There's no evidence he has ever successfully accomplished any business relationship in Russia.</p><p>CARLSON: And finally, and this claim, again, persists to this day that Manafort manipulated WikiLeaks in order to hurt Hillary Clinton, and I think it's basically wrecked Roger Stone's life, this - this claim from the dossier. Is it true? Do we know that that's true?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: So, the dossier claimed that Manafort was really the one in charge of the entire collusion theory that, in fact, Carter Page was working on his orders. There's no evidence that they even met that he - we were told that Manafort was the one who came up with the whole WikiLeaks idea. There's no evidence.</p><p>And we have a lot of court filings where if there were any evidence of this, you know darn well that this would have been mentioned in any of these filings. Now the whole genius of this dossier is that it has a bunch of allegations that are improb - impossible to disprove.</p><p>And that's not the way that justice is supposed to be done in this country where you say, \"Well if you're innocent, you have to prove that these things never happened.\" These are a bunch of wild allegations without evidence to support them, and we are now years into this--</p><p>CARLSON: No, you're right.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --and it's--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean that's the--</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --it's a lie.</p><p>CARLSON: --standard we apply to Supreme Court justices, but not - not to anyone else. Mollie Hemingway, great to see you. Thank you for that.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Great to be here with you.</p><p>CARLSON: For your rigorous look at that.</p><p>Well anti-Russia panic has reignited the Cold War and driven us apart from Russia. But is that good for American interests? Why should we be Russia's enemy? That's next.</p><p>CARLSON: At the center of the Russia panic is an accusation that bears directly on a key foreign policy question that affects all of us, and it's this. By colluding with Russia, Donald Trump and his team agreed to sell out America's interests by aligning with Vladimir Putin's government.</p><p>That's what they're saying. In real life, of course, the opposite has happened. In the past two years, relations with Russia have deteriorated to historically bad levels, really the worst since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.</p><p>The question is has that helped America in some way? And what is wrong with improving relations with Russia? Donald Trump ran on improving relations with Russia and got elected, as you remember.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Wouldn't it actually be wonderful if we could get along with Russia?</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING YES)</p><p>TRUMP: Wouldn't that be nice?</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)</p><p>TRUMP: If we get along with Russia, we'd go out together with others and we'd knock the hell out of ISIS, wouldn't that be great?</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING YES)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Steve Cohen is a former NYU professor, one of the eminent Russia experts in America, Author of the new book, War with Russia: From Putin and Ukraine To Trump and Russiagate, and he joins us tonight. Professor, thanks very much for coming on. So--</p><p>STEPHEN COHEN, NYU PROFESSOR EMERITUS, THE NATION CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, WAR WITH RUSSIA AUTHOR: Well, you've got quite a lot - you've got a quite a lineup tonight, all the skeptics.</p><p>CARLSON: Well it's what's just so interesting you - at the heart of this is a real foreign policy question, which is why we're always so grateful to talk to you.</p><p>And that question is does the United States benefit in some way from demonizing Russia? Should we be enemies with Russia? Or, could we benefit more from some kind of loose alliance with Russia?</p><p>That's really the question that Trump's raised (ph) and I'm starting to suspect that that view was so unpopular that it's driving the Russia investigation, at least in part, do you think?</p><p>COHEN: It's a mystery of our time. And I promise you that your kids and my grandkids and the historians of their generation will look back on this terrible era, this Russiagate era, and ask who started it, why it got such traction, and why it's done the damage it's done?</p><p>Now, one explanation, but I'm not sure it's a complete explanation is that when Trump said during the campaign, it would be great to cooperate with Russia, the enemies of such cooperation saw in Trump an enemy, and they began this, literally unproven, allegation that he was somehow under the control of the Kremlin.</p><p>But the damage it's done to our national security and to our institutions, the you - you may be the only person who's - who's - who's asked the question. But I guarantee you historians will ask it, what have been the cost of these two years of Russiagate?</p><p>They've been grave. I mean Victor Hanson pointed out the corruption of our elites. But what about the corruption of our institutions? The presidency, elections, suspicions, doubts have been cast on these basic American institutions.</p><p>And then I come to the thing that concerns me the most that I worry about in this book, War with Russia? I mean it. I think it's a possibility that Trump is not free to do crisis negotiation with Russia, and there's going to be a crisis soon, for sure, the way every president since Eisenhower has been.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>COHEN: I've said that before on your show. It's virtually an existential constitutional duty of the American President in the nuclear age to be free and powered to deal with questions of war and peace with Russia the way John F. Kennedy was, Cuban Missile Crisis.</p><p>I can't imagine what's going to happen if we have such a crisis. Trump is shackled. Remember what happened in July. I think you and I might have talked about it on the air. Trump went to Helsinki for a perfectly ritualistic, normal summit meeting with Putin. Comes home--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, we were there.</p><p>COHEN: --and he's accused of treason.</p><p>CARLSON: I remember.</p><p>COHEN: Accused for treason. So, that's the--</p><p>CARLSON: So - so let me--</p><p>COHEN: --cost.</p><p>CARLSON: --can I ask you - we only have a minute left. But I'm so interested in this question and I don't know the answer. What was the - what's the motive? Apart from disliking Trump, their political motives, obviously, but there is - part of our foreign policy establishment really believes that we ought to be in some sort of adversarial posture against Russia. Why?</p><p>COHEN: I - I don't know. And when you don't know you got to say it. But here is a theory that some people would offer you if asked that question. When the Soviet Union ended in 1991, the Washington elites who controlled foreign policy saw a world dominated or governed by or run by the United States.</p><p>And that seemed to be a reality in the 1990s when Russia had a President who was ill, often drunk, and very compliant to Washington. And we got used to that. Russia is a kind of junior subservient partner in world affair (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>COHEN: And then came Putin, and it was a shock, and they've been reacting to the shock of Putin ever since. And I'll give you one quote.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>COHEN: Nicholas Kristof, a very influential New York Times Correspondent - Columnist, lamented in (ph) print, listen to this, that Putin did not turn out to be what he expected, namely, a sober Yeltsin, Yeltsin having been the President of Russia in the 1990s. So, part of this--</p><p>CARLSON: The - the arrogance and dumbness--</p><p>COHEN: --was done (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --of our - of the people who make our policy and influence our policy really will be the - the - the title of every history of this period. Professor, thank you. It's--</p><p>COHEN: I agree with that.</p><p>CARLSON: --great to see you and congrats on the new book.</p><p>COHEN: Thanks, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: First it was Rudolph and bullying, now the Left's war on Christmas, which is not real, but still continues unabated, is targeting gingerbread men, man, that's next.</p><p>CARLSON: Recently, we interviewed a New York State Senator, a Democrat called Kevin Parker.</p><p>Parker is sponsoring a law bill in New York that will require anybody who wants to buy a gun to give the state the passwords to their social media accounts, so politicians can make sure they didn't say anything naughty that they disagree with, because when you say violent things online, according to Kevin Parker, you shouldn't have a firearm.</p><p>Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN PARKER, NEW YORK STATE SENATOR, DEMOCRATIC MEMBER: This law simply says let's look at, you know, what people are putting out on social media as a, you know, the - you know, part of a - a set of criteria that we're using to determine who gets handguns.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>Do you think that people have a right to say outrageous things, maybe even things you disagree with, in public, do you think--</p><p>PARKER: They - they certainly--</p><p>CARLSON: --that that be good (ph)?</p><p>PARKER: --they certainly can say whatever they want to say. But we also have the right--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, but then you punish them--</p><p>PARKER: --we also have--</p><p>CARLSON: --for saying that.</p><p>PARKER: --but we also have a right to deny them a gun permit if, in fact, we believe that the things that they're saying may lead to them endangering the people of the State of New York.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. So, if you say something threatening online, he doesn't think you should have a gun. Well, as we've chronicled exhaustively on this show, there's something called projection, and that's what you accuse people you don't like of doing precisely the thing that you are doing. Freud wrote a book about that, I think.</p><p>Well this morning, Parker, the guy you just saw, tweeted this, Kill yourself!, at a GOP, I know I'm laughing because it's just hilarious, is it's so grotesque, at Spokeswoman - Republican Spokeswoman Candice Giove.</p><p>Parker, turns out, was mad at being accused of improperly parking on the streets of Manhattan. I'm sure that didn't happen. Well, the Spokeswoman was shocked, she tweeted this. \"Did a Senator just write this to me?\"</p><p>And the answer, of course, is yes. Kill yourself, he said. Unbelievable. That really does go into Hypocrisy Hall of Fame. We hope Mr. Parker will come back and explain it to us. I'm sure he will.</p><p>Well the war on Christmas is not real, they tell you that all the time. It's totally fake. And if you believe in it, you're dumb, you watch Fox News or something. But it's also, of course, going on. And it's being fought very fiercely here in America, but not just in America.</p><p>The war on Christmas is a global struggle. In the Parliament of Scotland, they have a National Parliament, the coffee shop has stopped selling gingerbread men. Why? Gender-specific. They're now called gingerbread people.</p><p>You don't want to give them a gender without their consent. You don't even want to know how many bathrooms there are in gingerbread houses now, a lot.</p><p>Tammy Bruce is a radio host and President of Independent Women's Voice, and she joins us tonight. Tammy, so I have this - have this sneaking suspicion that a lot of the people who are doing things like this are actually Right- wing plants there to discredit the progressives they live among.</p><p>Do you think that's possible?</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS ON-AIR CONTRIBUTOR, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE PRESIDENT: I don't. I think though that they're - it's--</p><p>CARLSON: You don't--</p><p>BRUCE: --I - I know. It's - it's very funny. And now I've been - starting to think about the complicated structure of gingerbread houses because of your comment. I'm just wondering, how many bathrooms can they get into one house? But look, here is the problem. And it just proves, of course, our point, in general.</p><p>The Left has worked now for a couple of generations to condition us to ahead of time worry about what we're going to say. Even your last segment, of course, is about that little bit of - of challenging people and threatening them and making sure that they know that there's danger in those thoughts.</p><p>And so, this baker, she said it was a whim that she just thought you just - like for no good reason that she should not call them gingerbread men and call them a gingerbread person, and I couldn't tell, obviously, because they're also not wearing clothes. So, it's hard to say what it is that there - they - they are, and what they're doing and what they're not doing.</p><p>But she said she was also shocked by the response. And that's the good news, Tucker, is that this is in - in, again, Scotland, the United Kingdom. And the backlash, she was apparently shocked that people were really upset about this.</p><p>And - and I contend after a series of, you know, living your entire life being kind of bullied into what you can and cannot say and presumptions that you're--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>BRUCE: --bad people that it can be the smallest thing that tips you over the edge that's a - that's the tipping point. And in this case, it's, you know, calling gingerbread men a gingerbread person when obviously they're men.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, so maybe the lesson is that the rest of us shouldn't participate in our own spiritual neutering and that we should--</p><p>BRUCE: That's correct.</p><p>CARLSON: --at every step along the way say, I'm not - I'm not complying with that. I'm sorry--</p><p>BRUCE: That is correct.</p><p>CARLSON: --call HR on me, I'm not doing it.</p><p>BRUCE: And - and look, this Kentucky radio station is a very good example of that. You know, Baby, It's Cold Outside, the famous song has come under fire for being inappropriate. And a station in Ohio cut it off of their - their list.</p><p>Well a - a Kentucky radio station decided to put it on a loop five different versions they - because it's been covered by everybody, and they played it continuously for two hours. Obviously, Kentucky for two hours on Sunday was - was nirvana.</p><p>And they just play and everybody loved it. And they said, \"Look, we've stand behind this. We're going to play it. We're not afraid.\" And that's a very good idea is that this is the one way to stop it is to do the thing that the bullies and the establishment tell you that you're not allowed to do in an effort to control you.</p><p>And as a statement, I think--</p><p>CARLSON: That's right.</p><p>BRUCE: --sometimes that's important.</p><p>CARLSON: I agree. And also being an independent thinker in a time of mandatory conformity pays off in the event (ph)--</p><p>BRUCE: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --we've got to hope. Tammy--</p><p>BRUCE: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --thank you very much.</p><p>BRUCE: Thank you. I'll get my gingerbread now. You too.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes (ph).</p><p>Well, Apple, the company that makes your phone and your tablet and your laptop is one of the most profitable companies in the world, have the biggest market cap in the world, may still. And yet, American taxpayers are still subsidizing Apple. Why is that? Our investigation into big tech continues.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for several years running, the tech giant Apple has been this country's most lucrative company. It regularly earns tens of billions in profits every year. Despite that, for reasons that aren't exactly clear, lawmakers are eager to give Apple tax breaks, tax breaks that you're not getting and could never get because sorry, you're not Apple.</p><p>For example, in return for expanding its campus in Austin, Texas, Williamson County, where Austin is, is prepared to give Apple a property tax break worth more than $20 million. Again, are you getting anything like that? Probably not. Why are they getting it?</p><p>Chip Roy is a Republican. He's the Congressman-elect for the 21st Congressional district of Texas, and he joins us tonight. Mr. Roy, thank you very much. Congrats, by the way, on winning, and thanks for coming on tonight. What - why in the world--</p><p>CHIP ROY, CONGRESSMAN-ELECT FOR THE 21ST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS, REPUBLICAN MEMBER: Good evening, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --would any County give Apple a tax break?</p><p>ROY: Well, you know, that's a great question. It's a question that I've been asking. And I know that there's a popular mode of doing business in this country now to try to pay businesses to move to your state.</p><p>But I don't think you need to pay people to move to Texas. Texas is a great state with low tax rates and--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ROY: --good reasons to move here. So, I don't understand why we would give upwards of $50 million to a company that has up close to $250 billion in cash in the bank and a trillion dollar market cap, which is bigger than the GDP of about a 180 countries.</p><p>It's just more of the same corporate cronyism that we see at the federal, state and local level that I think voters are getting tired of. I know that - well I heard on the campaign trail, people are getting sick of that.</p><p>CARLSON: Nobody says anything about it. I mean when Amazon did this in New York, one of the only people, and I'm ashamed to say this, was not a Republican, just the opposite. It was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>And everyone else on both sides were nodding, \"Oh, Amazon good, Amazon good.\" Why does nobody raise an alarm over this kind of behavior?</p><p>ROY: Well I think a lot of people, particularly, on the Republican side of the aisle, hide behind job creation, and they think that well, we just throw money around, it's going to create jobs. And the fact of the matter is I think we are chasing, you know, good money after bad, while we throw money at corporations that have tons of - of resources.</p><p>And frankly, they don't - they're not sharing our values. Corporations are attacking our core--</p><p>CARLSON: That's for sure.</p><p>ROY: --Texas values, our core American values. You got Tim Cook lecturing us about border security, and how we're somehow inhumane because we want to have border security. What is inhumane is having cheap labor in China prop up your profits and then tell us how we should live our lives in Texas.</p><p>And I'm frankly kind of sick of it. I think it's inhumane that little girls are getting sold into the sex trade because we don't have border security.</p><p>And yet, we're getting lectured by Tim Cook about what we need to do and being held ransom for $50 million in Texas when they've got $250 billion in cash in the bank, and I just don't think that's the way things ought to fly.</p><p>CARLSON: I've been really hoping so fervently the Republican Party would change, and the fact that you just got elected is evidence that it is. So, thank you very much. Chip Roy, congrats again. God bless.</p><p>ROY: Thanks, Tucker, look forward to it, take care.</p><p>CARLSON: Instead of giving big tech huge tax breaks, what should lawmakers be doing about their growing influence? One person who's been thinking about this for a long time and getting no credit for it, believe it or not, is Ralph Nader, of course, the long-time consumer advocate, Author of the new book, How the Rats Re-Formed the Congress, he joins us tonight.</p><p>Mr. Nader, thank you very much for coming on. The reason I want to talk to you is I don't think you've gotten the credit you deserve for being a lone voice on the Left raising concerns about the concentration of power in the tech sector. What happens when you say that out loud?</p><p>RALPH NADER, POLITICAL ACTIVIST, LECTURER, ATTORNEY, HOW THE RATS RE-FORMED THE CONGRESS AUTHOR: Well the Congress always bemused by the razzle-dazzle of Silicon Valley and - and, you know, supposedly clean industry has horrible pollution coming in from the supply chain and all the rock (ph) when they dismantle the stuff. And they have no tech capability to ask the right question.</p><p>So Newt Gingrich in 1995 got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in Congress, which is he not (ph) Professional Advisor. So, when they deal with things like, you know, ballistic missile defense or Facebook or Google, they would have the experts right there.</p><p>And so, there they are, they have these hearings and, you know, outrage and admiration came from the Members of the House--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --and the Senate that went nowhere. So, the question coming up in Congress is, are they going to regulate them like they, suppose, you know, they regulate cars or pharmaceuticals.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: Or are they going to just have Quasi-regulation like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation does for banks or are they going to create a trade association to regulate them with standards overseen by some agency? It doesn't look good.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission nailed Facebook in 2011, led by David Vladeck, the Consumer Protection Bureau, and haven't (ph) enforced at all. And Facebook has been violating or letting others, third-party, fourth-party, Cambridge Analytics violate that consent decree. And it's--</p><p>CARLSON: It's but - but wait (ph) - OK, so you became famous--</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: 1965-ish going after--</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --General Motors.</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And the Right didn't like you because you were attacking business. But the Left loved you. You became this huge hero. You're saying the same thing now about the big tech companies, why is no one joining your side?</p><p>NADER: We don't get onto mass media. The civic communities that are raising issues of crony capitalism, corporate welfare, these kind of tax breaks, you know, for--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --Apple. Apple is just burning a $100 billion in stock buybacks, they aren't (ph) giving it back to the shareholders or the workers or the environment cleanup or the pension funds.</p><p>They want to buyback all that stock to increase the metrics for the Executive Compensation packages for Tim Cook and others. And you can't get on national TV on that. You can't even get on - NB - NPR and - and PBS.</p><p>CARLSON: Why?</p><p>NADER: And I've been talking about corporate welfare and the Right, it talks about crony capitalism, so we're converging, right?</p><p>I think there are a lot of issues in this country, as I pointed out in my book, Unstoppable, where Conservatives and Liberals back home where they work, live, and raise their families, right, never mind the ideology--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>NADER: --red state, blue state. They bleed. They get ripped off the same way--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>NADER: --disinfected, disempowered. And there's no publicity given - given to it at all. And that - so I'm - I've resorted to a fable. How the Rats Re-Formed the Congress. It's big rat infestation, you know--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --in D.C.</p><p>CARLSON: Literally.</p><p>NADER: Yes, literally. And they come up from the catacombs in this book and they get into the toilet polls (ph) first with the Speaker. You can imagine the result.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: You try to suppress an increasing rat infestation, massive derision all over the country, it wakes people up. They look at 535 men and women in Congress, who are using their delegated power under the - we, the people, right?</p><p>Then they organize a mass movement and get control of Congress from the corporatists, from the Wall Streeters. You pointed out in your book, the ruling class should share power. Otherwise, they're going to lose in whatever Democratic institutions we have. So, Members of Congress have called this disgusting, outrageous, revolting, because of the opening pages. But you go back on this, this is a single most devastating document in--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --indictment (ph) of Congress on one page.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm going to read it. I don't know. I remember at one point disagreeing with you--</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --on stuff. But I can't remember what it was. I now think that on this stuff anyway, you're an important voice--</p><p>NADER: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: --and I'm grateful that you came on this show.</p><p>NADER: You go to ratsreformcongress.org--</p><p>CARLSON: Ratsreformcongress--</p><p>NADER: --and you'll get in a (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm going to. And I probably agree with a lot of it that you're saying (ph).</p><p>NADER: You - you'll get instruction on how to organize back home--</p><p>CARLSON: I love it.</p><p>NADER: --Congress Ratwatcher Groups.</p><p>CARLSON: Ralph Nader, it's great to see you. Thank you.</p><p>NADER: Thanks for the sunglass (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: We've got a Fox News Alert.</p><p>The Senate has passed Criminal Justice Reform. The bill passed 87 to 12, wow, big margin. The President strongly encouraged Congress to act on the bill before the end of the lame-duck session. That bill now goes to the House. Obviously, we'll continue to follow the story.</p><p>And we'll be right back with an important holiday message for you after the break.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: SHIP OF FOOLS.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well as the last hour has demonstrated, in fact, the last decade has demonstrated, America's ruling class has lost the ability to govern wisely. They're obsessed with trifles like the Russia investigation, or gender politics or whatever the nonsense fad (ph) of the day is.</p><p>Meanwhile, they ignore our dying middle class. They know nothing about falling life expectancy, they don't care. They're more interesting in the wellbeing of anyone other than their own citizens. They do nothing to counter the main threats to our wellbeing, big tech, or China.</p><p>Much of the time they directly enable these threats because they're getting rich from it. How'd we get to this place? Well, it's the subject of a new book called Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution. It tells the long, gory story. But it may be worth reading. We recommend it strongly.</p><p>That's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night 8:00 P.M, the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially, groupthink. Good night from Washington.</p><p>Sean Hannity is next. Sitting in though, the most famous judge in America, not Judge Judy, much better, Judge Jeanine. Hey, Judge.</p><p>JEANINE PIRRO- HOST: Thank you, Tucker. Great show.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

That would be for the crime of lying to FBI agents in his now-famous White  House interview at the very beginning of the Administration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a number of reasons, you've probably already heard about, none of them  very significant in the cosmic scheme of things, that sentencing has been  postponed until the New Year. And, of course, we'll bring you the details  when that happens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the meantime though, we thought we would seize this opportunity to take  stock of all that we have learned, Michael Flynn being, of course, the  first major target of the Mueller investigation. That was all the way back,  if you can believe it, at the beginning of last year, 2017.</p><p>So, it's been just about two years, almost, and the hunt for Russian spies  on our soil has not slowed down. It has metastasized into something vast  and remarkable. It's now practically its own agency of government. </p><p>There are now, we think this is right, there could be more, but what we  could find are a half a dozen separate Russia investigations now being  conducted by the Justice Department. </p><p>That does not even count the separate Congressional inquiries or - four,  five, maybe more, who knows, and then, of course, nearly a 100 percent of  the attention of every news organization in Washington, almost everyone. </p><p>So, what have we learned after all that time and all that money and all  that attention? Well, we know that the Russians spent a total of, let's  check the math, $4,700 on Google ads during the 2016 election. Try to buy a  car for that. </p><p>We also know that Jerome Corsi and George Papadopoulos, two people you  probably had never heard of before, likely did something bad, like  misremembering dates or emails, though apparently neither one of them spied  for anybody. That's what we've learned.</p><p>We've also learned that, and people are not noting this, but we thought  it'd be worth pointing out, virtually every issue that led voters  unexpectedly to support Donald Trump in 2016 remains as of now unresolved,  in some cases, not even addressed.</p><p>That would include the decline of the American middle class, the drop in  life expectancy, the opioid crisis, our unsecured Southern border, crushing  student loan debt, the global dominance of China, the quagmire in  Afghanistan, infrastructure, healthcare costs, we could go on, you know,  the little things.</p><p>You haven't heard a lot about any of that lately. The news anchors have not  had time to tell you about any of that because they're too busy shouting  self-righteously about Michael Flynn. \"He lied. He lied.\" They, by  contrast, never lie because they're good people, unlike Michael Flynn who  lied.</p><p>So, I guess the point is there's been a cost to our Russia fixation. Years  later, we may look back and wonder what happened during the last two years.  How did everybody in America with an Ivy League education simultaneously go  insane in the space of a single year? </p><p>Was there some kind of mass poisoning? Was it Ergotism? It happened in  medieval France maybe - maybe that's what happened.</p><p>We're going to let historians sort that out. We're not really sure. For  now, all we know for certain is that the people in charge have lost it,  they really have. And if you don't believe it, listen to them explain the  intricacies of the Russia conspiracy.  They're mesmerized by it. It's a tale so complex, so riddled with internal  contradictions, it sounds like an Eastern religion. Only they really  understand it, but they mean it and they do understand it. To them, Russia  is the touchstone. It's the comprehensive theory of everything.</p><p>Consider what happened, for example, last night in cable news, and it  really could have been any night on cable news. MSNBC, CNN, take your pick.  We just happened to be watching last night around 11:00 when this happened,  so we're bringing it to you tonight because it's interesting, and it tells  you a lot.</p><p>By the way, this is from the most serious news program that NBC offers on  cable. It's called The 11th Hour. There are two people in this segment  we're about to show you. The first is a man called Malcolm Nance. </p><p>Now, Nance identifies himself as a 35-year veteran of counterintelligence  work, whatever that means. His most recent book is called The Plot to Hack  America. It was a national bestseller, thanks to heavy promotion from  MSNBC.</p><p>The second man you're about to see is Brian Williams who, of course, needs  no introduction. He was the anchor of the NBC Nightly News, back when that  meant something. Williams is widely regarded as - as a good guy by people  who know him and he's absolutely in Washington anyway, is thought of as one  of the smartest people in the news business. </p><p>The point is these are not kooks on late-night radio. They are considered  highly impressive people. Keep that in mind as you watch this. </p><p>Williams opens the segment by explaining that Russian disinformation teams  have been working to divide America and convince the population, among  other totally implausible things, that Jim Comey and Robert Mueller might  have political agendas.</p><p>Ridiculous, right? Williams asked Malcolm Nance to comment on that  proposition and Nance says this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MALCOLM WRIGHTSON NANCE, AUTHOR, MEDIA COMMENTATOR, FORMER UNITED  STATES  NAVY SENIOR CHIEF PETTY OFFICER: What Russia has done here and where the  true brilliance of this intelligence operation comes from is way back in  the early 2000s, the Russian military conducted a strategic study and  started carrying out a disinformation plan, in which they said that instead  of carrying out kinetic warfare against your enemies, the best thing we can  do is create a disinformation and (ph) frame around that nation to the  point where over time as we are constantly tearing them apart and feeding  them with false information, they would actually welcome an invasion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLSON: Huh? Wait, wait a second here. This is what we in the news  business call news. </p><p>So, for nearly 20 years, the Russians have been building a disinformation  frame around the United States. What's a disinformation frame? And how does  it manage to brainwash an entire population so thoroughly that they welcome  a foreign invasion?</p><p>I mean that's got to be the most powerful mind control device in human  history. More detail please. This - really this is the part of the  interview where the anchor politely interrupts the guest and ask them to  explain what the hell he's talking about.</p><p>But Williams does not do that. He just lets Malcolm Nance keep talking, so  Malcolm Nance does keep talking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCE: So Russia has done that to the United States. And it began way  before 2016. As a matter of fact, the earliest references I have with  relation to Donald Trump shows that it started back in 2011 with Maria  Butina and the NRA contacts, contacts with the fundamentalist Christian  Right and the Alt-Right in the United States. Russia was pushing these  disinformation themes then. </p><p>Then in 2013, they stood up the Russian Federation Internet Research  Agency, which built all of these memes and tropes, which became the cruise  missiles of fake news and disinformation designed to do what it did today,  take one-third of the United States population and make them refuse to  believe what they see before their very eyes and may have elected a  president in the process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Holy smokes! This is a tsunami of news. </p><p>It turns out that Donald Trump's collusion with Russia began years before  any of us suspected, way back in 2011. Here's the confusing part. In 2011,  by all outward appearances, Trump was still a pretty conventional New York  Liberal.</p><p>He went to David Letterman to read the Top 10 list. He endorsed gun  control. It was all a cover, a sophisticated ruse. As Malcolm Nance  reveals, Trump was, in fact, busy plotting with the NRA, Christian  fundamentalists, and the Alt-Right.</p><p>Now keep in mind, this was years before there was such a thing as the Alt- Right, but that's just how stealthy this operation was. Even the Steele  dossier missed it, so did the rest of us.</p><p>Well, that's not surprising, since as Malcolm Nance has explained, thanks  to Russian brainwashing, one-third of the U.S. population can no longer  perceive reality. That's Malcolm Nance's position.</p><p>What would you do if somebody repeated those exact same words to you on a  city bus? You'd likely be worried. At the very least, you'd probably switch  seats. Not Brian Williams. He'd move closer. </p><p>Williams didn't seem to consider Nance's explanation strange in the  slightest. He was deeply impressed by it. Williams asked how the Russians  could have pulled off an operation this extensive without the willing help  of American accomplices.</p><p>Of course, Nance - Nance had an answer to that. Keep in mind, as you watch  this clip, that we have not edited the tape in any way. This aired verbatim  last night on MSNBC. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCE: They have played on the - the themes of far-Right conspiracy  theorists from the 1960. The John Birch Society, a - a sideline group, you  know, and the farthest extremes of the libertarian parties. </p><p>They have amplified racism to the point where the Alt-Right, Steve Bannon's  own creation of Gamers is now the wholly owned subsidiary of the Trump  campaign and are believers in David Duke, the Ku Klux Klan, Richard -  Richard Spencer, the neo-Nazi, and Robert Spencer, the Islamophobe, to the  point where they're mainstreamed. This is how effective this information  warfare campaign has been carried out. </p><p>And let me tell you, this report shows how they went after to suppress the  African-American vote. And there's no doubt in my mind or anybody else's in  the intelligence community that doesn't believe that it took American  citizens to assist them in really getting down to where these voters were  who needed to be suppressed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Wow! So, in case you weren't transcribing that as you watch, let's  bottom-line it for you.</p><p>The Russia conspiracy just expanded to include a bewildering array of new  figures. These would include the John Birch Society, the KKK, David Duke,  people who play online video games, Steve Bannon, a religion blogger named  Robert Spencer, and others.</p><p>Collectively, their goal was not simply to elect Donald Trump but to hurt  African-Americans. Why would Russian intelligence want to do that, you  might ask? Well if you have to ask, you're probably working for Vladimir  Putin too, so shut up.</p><p>It goes without saying that all of this is completely insane. There's no  evidence to support any of it. It is not true. Worse than that, it's  irresponsible. Keep in mind this aired on a division of NBC News, so some  large number of people are likely going to believe it. </p><p>They'll go to sleep worrying about the invisible disinformation frame that  surrounds their country and the resurgence of the John Birch Society. And  they'll wake up a little more convinced that anyone who disagrees with them  is a tool of a foreign power because that is the real message here, and of  this whole conspiracy.</p><p>There's no other side of the debate. There's only Russian propaganda. To a  certain sort of fragile Liberal, that's probably comforting to know, but  it's a lie. In fact, it's its own form of propaganda. No news organization  should traffic in garbage like this. News anchors exist to push back  against nutty claims like these.</p><p>Brian Williams bought them completely.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN DOUGLAS WILLIAMS, AMERICAN JOURNALIST AT NBC NEWS, MSNBC ANCHOR,  THE  11TH HOUR WITH BRIAN WILLIAMS HOST: Wow. Malcolm Nance, this is why we ask  you all the time to come on this broadcast. Scary stuff, but it needs to be  said, needs to be heard. Thank you, sir, so much for joining us once again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It needs to be said. It needs to be heard. This is why we ask you  to come on this broadcast. Save that video. Future generations won't  believe it. </p><p>And now to the actual monetary cost of all this Russia nonsense, what is it  costing taxpayers? Trace Gallagher has been tracking that for us and he  joins us tonight. Hey Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Hey, Tucker. If you back up the  clock to June, President Trump blasted Robert Mueller on Twitter saying,  quoting here, the Russian hoax investigation has now cost our government  over $17 million and going up fast. Turns out, the President was right. </p><p>Brand-new filings by the Department of Justice show that $17 million number  has now risen to $25 million and counting, and that does not include an  additional $5.5 million spent by the Department of Justice on other  expenses related to the Russia investigation. </p><p>Here's a quick rundown of how Mr. Mueller has spent your money over the  past six months. </p><p>$2.9 million went to the salaries and benefits of Special Counsel employees  and Department of Justice employees, 942-plus-thousand was spent on rent,  communication, and utilities, $60,000 for printing supplies and materials,  that's a lot of copies of something, $580,000 on transportation and travel,  and $310,000 for IT services.</p><p>Bottom line, trying to find collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia  is expensive, and working in IT for the Special Counsel is apparently  lucrative. Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, thanks for keeping track.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson is a historian. He's a Senior Fellow at the Hoover  Institution and, we're proud to say, a frequent guest on this show, he  joins us tonight. Professor, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>So, calculate--</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN CLASSICIST,  MILITARY HISTORIAN, COLUMNIST, FARMER: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --if you would in non-monetary terms what you think the costs of  these various Russia investigations have been to the country.</p><p>HANSON: Well I think there's a - they're sins (ph) of commission and  omission because why this is all going on, Tucker, we - we've cracked 3  percent GDP. We hadn't done that in 10 years. That's not an abstract  number. That means millions of people who were not working now have an  opportunity.</p><p>I really see it in where I live in Southwestern Fresno County, it's a human  story. We have peacetime unemployment of 3.7. Remember, just two years ago,  Larry Summers said you - this is - these were - this was the stuff of fairy  stories, and Barack Obama said you need a magic wand.</p><p>We're increasing oil production at 1.5 million barrels a year. We're the  largest oil producer in the world. Nothing hurts Russia more than that fact  alone that we - there's no such word in the English vocabulary for Peak Oil  anymore. So, there's just a human story going on.</p><p>This is not--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HANSON: --even talking about progress overseas. And we're just completely  uninterested in it. I don't know why because a lot of very poor people have  leverage over employers for higher wages that they never had before. </p><p>And the second is there's a really in - inequality of the law. I mean we  talk about the elites. But think of the - the array of people who have not  told the truth. </p><p>Andrew McCabe was fired for lying to federal investigators. We don't know  what's going to happen to him. So far, he hasn't faced criminal charges.  But the Inspector General said he was lying.</p><p>James Comey's statements about the FISA Court and the role of the dossier  are not true. James Clapper lied under oath to Congress. John Brennan lied  under oath to Congress. Susan Rice lied when she said she did not request  surveilled transcripts and have them unmask.</p><p>We know that Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills lied when they said they did not  have knowledge of the email server of Hillary - of their boss, Hillary  Clinton. That's not even getting into the deception of the FISA Court or  the way that the investigations went on the email scandal or putting  informants in a presidential campaign.</p><p>So, the second thing, it's really from a historical point of view, we've  had a lot of wrongdoing by elites. And nobody's - there's been no  consequences. So, the American--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HANSON: --people are not paranoid. They're saying, well the Mueller  investigation's going here but they're going after misdemeanors or nothing.  And here these felonies go completely unaddressed. Then finally, this  Mueller investigation's not in isolation. </p><p>We - we had, remember, from the day Trump was elected, we were told that  the voting machines were fraudulent. We're going to sue. And then there was  in a group, remember about the Electoral College, we had to overturn--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, very well.</p><p>HANSON: --get to the electors. And then we went to the 25th Amendment that  Trump was unbalanced, and then that didn't work. Then we went to the  Emoluments Clause. He profit - even though his businesses had lost a  billion dollars, and then we've gone to the Mueller.</p><p>And so, there's a slow motion, if you will. I don't want to be too  psychodramatic like MSNBC guest. </p><p>But there is sort of a slow-motion coup to overturn the elections when we  should just take a deep breath and say we have a chance to adjudicate this  in the next two - '20 election, and we do not want to destroy 2.5 - you  know, two - over two centuries of American constitutional jurisprudence,  because we know historically, Tucker, when you have whether it's successful  systems like ours or the Greek city-state of the Fourth Century or Rome in  the Fifth Century A.D. or the Byzantines in the 6 - 15th Century or the  ancient regime in Rome, why did they fall apart?</p><p>They fall apart because an elite no longer warrants the respect that they  think that they deserve--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>HANSON: --because they're out of touch with the people. And we have a whole  bunch of people on questions of global warming, as we see in Europe, or  immigration in Eastern Europe, or here at home, that feel that they can  unhide, dictate to people and they're never subject to the ramifications of  their own ideology and policy. </p><p>And it's like the emperor has no close (ph) and then they're - they're  surprised that Trump won or surprised that people are rioting in Paris.  What do they think was--</p><p>CARLSON: If--</p><p>HANSON: --going to happen?</p><p>CARLSON: --if they were wise and had perspective and made good decisions  and cared about their countries, it wouldn't bother me. But they're none of  those things, unfortunately, as you know. Professor, thank you very much.</p><p>HANSON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well for two years, the Fusion GPS dossier has dominated our  political conversation and has driven political events more than maybe any  other fact. What parts of the dossier have proved true over the past two  years?</p><p>Mollie Hemingway has been keeping track. Everybody should be keeping track.  But she's one of the rare few who is, and she'll join us after the break to  tell us what she's found.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well at the center of the two-year Russia investigation is the  Fusion GPS dossier. Hard to remember now, but it was originally compiled as  opposition research by the Hillary Clinton for President Campaign. It was  then passed around to journalists and lawmakers, and finally released on  BuzzFeed without its contents being verified.</p><p>Despite that, the dossier and its allegations have become more important  than America's entire middle class. So, the question is with two years of  thinking about it and poking around in the efforts of every news  organization in Washington to verify it or not, how much the dossier wound  up being true?</p><p>Mollie Hemingway has been following this. She's Senior Editor at The  Federalist. We're happy to have her tonight. So, Mollie, I just want to go  through a couple of the big claims in this, and you tell me if we - if this  happened or not.</p><p>So, the first was Michael Cohen's trip to Prague. Remember the famous trip  to Prague?</p><p>MOLLIE ZIEGLER HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST SENIOR EDITOR, FOX NEWS  CONTRIBUTOR: This is absolutely key. We're told that Michael Cohen, Donald  Trump's personal attorney, went to Prague, had a secret meeting with the  Duma's Konstantin Kosachev that they discussed the collusion arrangement  and that it - and that it went really, and that this was - this was a  really important thing.</p><p>In fact, not only had did that meeting not take place, there's no evidence  that the meeting took place. There's no evidence that Michael Cohen has  ever been to Prague.</p><p>CARLSON: But that was repeated as fact repeatedly.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Well, in fact, in just a few months ago, seven months ago, I  think there was a news report that falsely claimed that the Mueller - that  the Mueller team had evidence that that secret meeting had taken place. </p><p>It is just interesting to note, since we're actually in the sentencing  phase and we're dealing with all - with sort of some resolution here, it  wasn't even mentioned by Bob Mueller or anyone else--</p><p>CARLSON: And assuming they were not (ph)--</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --who's going after Cohen (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --one of the things that always struck me about the dossier was it  accused people of crimes, American citizens of crimes, and one of them was  Carter Page, who was described, in effect, as a - as a mastermind Russian  spy.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Carter Page, again, was all over the dossier. And it was so  important, the dossier was viewed so favorably by our federal government.  They used this to secure a wiretap against him. They portrayed him as a  mastermind spy who was setting up all sorts of important meetings and  arranging, again, collusion.</p><p>We were told that he had a - got a stake in - in a large Russian oil  company in exchange for the collusion. These meetings that we were told  took place in the dossier, there's no evidence that any of them happened. </p><p>And it's interesting to note that Carter Page was surveilled for an entire  year by our government, and has not been charged with any crime despite  being portrayed as this - as the central linchpin of the collusion theory  (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But I do think it destroyed his life, so there's that.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Now, at the very center of this were the salacious claims that  Trump was caught doing things with hookers, and he was subject to blackmail  as a result of this. Did that happen?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Right. So, this was - this was what made it so interesting and  what made the journalists so excited when the dossier was first published,  not just the tale of the - of the prostitutes at the Moscow hotel, but we  were told that Russia had all sorts of compromising information on Donald  Trump, and that he would be compromised and blackmailed by this.</p><p>Then you can look at his record over the last two years and see that if  Russia has anything compromising on him they should have deployed it while  he was going after them in such an aggressive fashion in foreign policy--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --and they haven't done anything of the kind. There is no  evidence to support this. But a lot of people are, in fact, druthers (ph)  on this.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Meanwhile, as Victor Davis Hanson just pointed out, the one  thing they care about is energy, and America is now the world's largest oil  producer, energy producer, so we haven't helped them too much. </p><p>The Trump Towers in Moscow, you hear that to this day.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: So, you need to have business interests in order to have this  collusion theory make sense. The dossier said a bunch of actually kind of  contradictory things that Trump was very interested in a business deal in  Russia, and also that he'd been offered sweetheart deals.</p><p>Well if you've been offered sweetheart deals, I think we can reasonably  assume he would have taken them. There's no evidence he has ever  successfully accomplished any business relationship in Russia.</p><p>CARLSON: And finally, and this claim, again, persists to this day that  Manafort manipulated WikiLeaks in order to hurt Hillary Clinton, and I  think it's basically wrecked Roger Stone's life, this - this claim from the  dossier. Is it true? Do we know that that's true?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: So, the dossier claimed that Manafort was really the one in  charge of the entire collusion theory that, in fact, Carter Page was  working on his orders. There's no evidence that they even met that he - we  were told that Manafort was the one who came up with the whole WikiLeaks  idea. There's no evidence.</p><p>And we have a lot of court filings where if there were any evidence of  this, you know darn well that this would have been mentioned in any of  these filings. Now the whole genius of this dossier is that it has a bunch  of allegations that are improb - impossible to disprove. </p><p>And that's not the way that justice is supposed to be done in this country  where you say, \"Well if you're innocent, you have to prove that these  things never happened.\" These are a bunch of wild allegations without  evidence to support them, and we are now years into this--</p><p>CARLSON: No, you're right.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --and it's--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean that's the--</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --it's a lie.</p><p>CARLSON: --standard we apply to Supreme Court justices, but not - not to  anyone else. Mollie Hemingway, great to see you. Thank you for that.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Great to be here with you.</p><p>CARLSON: For your rigorous look at that.</p><p>Well anti-Russia panic has reignited the Cold War and driven us apart from  Russia. But is that good for American interests? Why should we be Russia's  enemy? That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: At the center of the Russia panic is an accusation that bears  directly on a key foreign policy question that affects all of us, and it's  this. By colluding with Russia, Donald Trump and his team agreed to sell  out America's interests by aligning with Vladimir Putin's government. </p><p>That's what they're saying. In real life, of course, the opposite has  happened. In the past two years, relations with Russia have deteriorated to  historically bad levels, really the worst since the Cuban Missile Crisis of  1962. </p><p>The question is has that helped America in some way? And what is wrong with  improving relations with Russia? Donald Trump ran on improving relations  with Russia and got elected, as you remember.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Wouldn't it actually be  wonderful if we could get along with Russia?</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING YES)</p><p>TRUMP: Wouldn't that be nice?</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)</p><p>TRUMP: If we get along with Russia, we'd go out together with others and  we'd knock the hell out of ISIS, wouldn't that be great?</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING YES)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Steve Cohen is a former NYU professor, one of the eminent Russia  experts in America, Author of the new book, War with Russia: From Putin and  Ukraine To Trump and Russiagate, and he joins us tonight. Professor, thanks  very much for coming on. So--</p><p>STEPHEN COHEN, NYU PROFESSOR EMERITUS, THE NATION CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, WAR  WITH RUSSIA AUTHOR: Well, you've got quite a lot - you've got a quite a  lineup tonight, all the skeptics.</p><p>CARLSON: Well it's what's just so interesting you - at the heart of this is  a real foreign policy question, which is why we're always so grateful to  talk to you. </p><p>And that question is does the United States benefit in some way from  demonizing Russia? Should we be enemies with Russia? Or, could we benefit  more from some kind of loose alliance with Russia? </p><p>That's really the question that Trump's raised (ph) and I'm starting to  suspect that that view was so unpopular that it's driving the Russia  investigation, at least in part, do you think?</p><p>COHEN: It's a mystery of our time. And I promise you that your kids and my  grandkids and the historians of their generation will look back on this  terrible era, this Russiagate era, and ask who started it, why it got such  traction, and why it's done the damage it's done?</p><p>Now, one explanation, but I'm not sure it's a complete explanation is that  when Trump said during the campaign, it would be great to cooperate with  Russia, the enemies of such cooperation saw in Trump an enemy, and they  began this, literally unproven, allegation that he was somehow under the  control of the Kremlin.</p><p>But the damage it's done to our national security and to our institutions,  the you - you may be the only person who's - who's - who's asked the  question. But I guarantee you historians will ask it, what have been the  cost of these two years of Russiagate? </p><p>They've been grave. I mean Victor Hanson pointed out the corruption of our  elites. But what about the corruption of our institutions? The presidency,  elections, suspicions, doubts have been cast on these basic American  institutions. </p><p>And then I come to the thing that concerns me the most that I worry about  in this book, War with Russia? I mean it. I think it's a possibility that  Trump is not free to do crisis negotiation with Russia, and there's going  to be a crisis soon, for sure, the way every president since Eisenhower has  been.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>COHEN: I've said that before on your show. It's virtually an existential  constitutional duty of the American President in the nuclear age to be free  and powered to deal with questions of war and peace with Russia the way  John F. Kennedy was, Cuban Missile Crisis.</p><p>I can't imagine what's going to happen if we have such a crisis. Trump is  shackled. Remember what happened in July. I think you and I might have  talked about it on the air. Trump went to Helsinki for a perfectly  ritualistic, normal summit meeting with Putin. Comes home--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, we were there.</p><p>COHEN: --and he's accused of treason.</p><p>CARLSON: I remember.</p><p>COHEN: Accused for treason. So, that's the--</p><p>CARLSON: So - so let me--</p><p>COHEN: --cost.</p><p>CARLSON: --can I ask you - we only have a minute left. But I'm so  interested in this question and I don't know the answer. What was the -  what's the motive? Apart from disliking Trump, their political motives,  obviously, but there is - part of our foreign policy establishment really  believes that we ought to be in some sort of adversarial posture against  Russia. Why?</p><p>COHEN: I - I don't know. And when you don't know you got to say it. But  here is a theory that some people would offer you if asked that question.  When the Soviet Union ended in 1991, the Washington elites who controlled  foreign policy saw a world dominated or governed by or run by the United  States.</p><p>And that seemed to be a reality in the 1990s when Russia had a President  who was ill, often drunk, and very compliant to Washington. And we got used  to that. Russia is a kind of junior subservient partner in world affair  (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>COHEN: And then came Putin, and it was a shock, and they've been reacting  to the shock of Putin ever since. And I'll give you one quote.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>COHEN: Nicholas Kristof, a very influential New York Times Correspondent -  Columnist, lamented in (ph) print, listen to this, that Putin did not turn  out to be what he expected, namely, a sober Yeltsin, Yeltsin having been  the President of Russia in the 1990s. So, part of this--</p><p>CARLSON: The - the arrogance and dumbness--</p><p>COHEN: --was done (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --of our - of the people who make our policy and influence our  policy really will be the - the - the title of every history of this  period. Professor, thank you. It's--</p><p>COHEN: I agree with that.</p><p>CARLSON: --great to see you and congrats on the new book.</p><p>COHEN: Thanks, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: First it was Rudolph and bullying, now the Left's war on  Christmas, which is not real, but still continues unabated, is targeting  gingerbread men, man, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Recently, we interviewed a New York State Senator, a Democrat  called Kevin Parker. </p><p>Parker is sponsoring a law bill in New York that will require anybody who  wants to buy a gun to give the state the passwords to their social media  accounts, so politicians can make sure they didn't say anything naughty  that they disagree with, because when you say violent things online,  according to Kevin Parker, you shouldn't have a firearm. </p><p>Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN PARKER, NEW YORK STATE SENATOR, DEMOCRATIC MEMBER: This law simply  says let's look at, you know, what people are putting out on social media  as a, you know, the - you know, part of a - a set of criteria that we're  using to determine who gets handguns.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>Do you think that people have a right to say outrageous things, maybe even  things you disagree with, in public, do you think--</p><p>PARKER: They - they certainly--</p><p>CARLSON: --that that be good (ph)?</p><p>PARKER: --they certainly can say whatever they want to say. But we also  have the right--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, but then you punish them--</p><p>PARKER: --we also have--</p><p>CARLSON: --for saying that.</p><p>PARKER: --but we also have a right to deny them a gun permit if, in fact,  we believe that the things that they're saying may lead to them endangering  the people of the State of New York.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. So, if you say something threatening online, he doesn't think  you should have a gun. Well, as we've chronicled exhaustively on this show,  there's something called projection, and that's what you accuse people you  don't like of doing precisely the thing that you are doing. Freud wrote a  book about that, I think.</p><p>Well this morning, Parker, the guy you just saw, tweeted this, Kill  yourself!, at a GOP, I know I'm laughing because it's just hilarious, is  it's so grotesque, at Spokeswoman - Republican Spokeswoman Candice Giove. </p><p>Parker, turns out, was mad at being accused of improperly parking on the  streets of Manhattan. I'm sure that didn't happen. Well, the Spokeswoman  was shocked, she tweeted this. \"Did a Senator just write this to me?\" </p><p>And the answer, of course, is yes. Kill yourself, he said. Unbelievable.  That really does go into Hypocrisy Hall of Fame. We hope Mr. Parker will  come back and explain it to us. I'm sure he will.</p><p>Well the war on Christmas is not real, they tell you that all the time.  It's totally fake. And if you believe in it, you're dumb, you watch Fox  News or something. But it's also, of course, going on. And it's being  fought very fiercely here in America, but not just in America.</p><p>The war on Christmas is a global struggle. In the Parliament of Scotland,  they have a National Parliament, the coffee shop has stopped selling  gingerbread men. Why? Gender-specific. They're now called gingerbread  people. </p><p>You don't want to give them a gender without their consent. You don't even  want to know how many bathrooms there are in gingerbread houses now, a lot.</p><p>Tammy Bruce is a radio host and President of Independent Women's Voice, and  she joins us tonight. Tammy, so I have this - have this sneaking suspicion  that a lot of the people who are doing things like this are actually Right- wing plants there to discredit the progressives they live among. </p><p>Do you think that's possible?</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS ON-AIR CONTRIBUTOR, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE  PRESIDENT: I don't. I think though that they're - it's--</p><p>CARLSON: You don't--</p><p>BRUCE: --I - I know. It's - it's very funny. And now I've been - starting  to think about the complicated structure of gingerbread houses because of  your comment. I'm just wondering, how many bathrooms can they get into one  house? But look, here is the problem. And it just proves, of course, our  point, in general. </p><p>The Left has worked now for a couple of generations to condition us to  ahead of time worry about what we're going to say. Even your last segment,  of course, is about that little bit of - of challenging people and  threatening them and making sure that they know that there's danger in  those thoughts.</p><p>And so, this baker, she said it was a whim that she just thought you just -  like for no good reason that she should not call them gingerbread men and  call them a gingerbread person, and I couldn't tell, obviously, because  they're also not wearing clothes. So, it's hard to say what it is that  there - they - they are, and what they're doing and what they're not doing.</p><p>But she said she was also shocked by the response. And that's the good  news, Tucker, is that this is in - in, again, Scotland, the United Kingdom.  And the backlash, she was apparently shocked that people were really upset  about this. </p><p>And - and I contend after a series of, you know, living your entire life  being kind of bullied into what you can and cannot say and presumptions  that you're--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>BRUCE: --bad people that it can be the smallest thing that tips you over  the edge that's a - that's the tipping point. And in this case, it's, you  know, calling gingerbread men a gingerbread person when obviously they're  men. </p><p>CARLSON: Well, so maybe the lesson is that the rest of us shouldn't  participate in our own spiritual neutering and that we should--</p><p>BRUCE: That's correct.</p><p>CARLSON: --at every step along the way say, I'm not - I'm not complying  with that. I'm sorry--</p><p>BRUCE: That is correct.</p><p>CARLSON: --call HR on me, I'm not doing it.</p><p>BRUCE: And - and look, this Kentucky radio station is a very good example  of that. You know, Baby, It's Cold Outside, the famous song has come under  fire for being inappropriate. And a station in Ohio cut it off of their -  their list.</p><p>Well a - a Kentucky radio station decided to put it on a loop five  different versions they - because it's been covered by everybody, and they  played it continuously for two hours. Obviously, Kentucky for two hours on  Sunday was - was nirvana. </p><p>And they just play and everybody loved it. And they said, \"Look, we've  stand behind this. We're going to play it. We're not afraid.\" And that's a  very good idea is that this is the one way to stop it is to do the thing  that the bullies and the establishment tell you that you're not allowed to  do in an effort to control you. </p><p>And as a statement, I think--</p><p>CARLSON: That's right.</p><p>BRUCE: --sometimes that's important.</p><p>CARLSON: I agree. And also being an independent thinker in a time of  mandatory conformity pays off in the event (ph)--</p><p>BRUCE: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --we've got to hope. Tammy--</p><p>BRUCE: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --thank you very much.</p><p>BRUCE: Thank you. I'll get my gingerbread now. You too.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes (ph). </p><p>Well, Apple, the company that makes your phone and your tablet and your  laptop is one of the most profitable companies in the world, have the  biggest market cap in the world, may still. And yet, American taxpayers are  still subsidizing Apple. Why is that? Our investigation into big tech  continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for several years running, the tech giant Apple has been  this country's most lucrative company. It regularly earns tens of billions  in profits every year. Despite that, for reasons that aren't exactly clear,  lawmakers are eager to give Apple tax breaks, tax breaks that you're not  getting and could never get because sorry, you're not Apple.</p><p>For example, in return for expanding its campus in Austin, Texas,  Williamson County, where Austin is, is prepared to give Apple a property  tax break worth more than $20 million. Again, are you getting anything like  that? Probably not. Why are they getting it? </p><p>Chip Roy is a Republican. He's the Congressman-elect for the 21st  Congressional district of Texas, and he joins us tonight. Mr. Roy, thank  you very much. Congrats, by the way, on winning, and thanks for coming on  tonight. What - why in the world--</p><p>CHIP ROY, CONGRESSMAN-ELECT FOR THE 21ST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS,  REPUBLICAN MEMBER: Good evening, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --would any County give Apple a tax break?</p><p>ROY: Well, you know, that's a great question. It's a question that I've  been asking. And I know that there's a popular mode of doing business in  this country now to try to pay businesses to move to your state. </p><p>But I don't think you need to pay people to move to Texas. Texas is a great  state with low tax rates and--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ROY: --good reasons to move here. So, I don't understand why we would give  upwards of $50 million to a company that has up close to $250 billion in  cash in the bank and a trillion dollar market cap, which is bigger than the  GDP of about a 180 countries.</p><p>It's just more of the same corporate cronyism that we see at the federal,  state and local level that I think voters are getting tired of. I know that  - well I heard on the campaign trail, people are getting sick of that.</p><p>CARLSON: Nobody says anything about it. I mean when Amazon did this in New  York, one of the only people, and I'm ashamed to say this, was not a  Republican, just the opposite. It was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. </p><p>And everyone else on both sides were nodding, \"Oh, Amazon good, Amazon  good.\" Why does nobody raise an alarm over this kind of behavior?</p><p>ROY: Well I think a lot of people, particularly, on the Republican side of  the aisle, hide behind job creation, and they think that well, we just  throw money around, it's going to create jobs. And the fact of the matter  is I think we are chasing, you know, good money after bad, while we throw  money at corporations that have tons of - of resources.</p><p>And frankly, they don't - they're not sharing our values. Corporations are  attacking our core--</p><p>CARLSON: That's for sure.</p><p>ROY: --Texas values, our core American values. You got Tim Cook lecturing  us about border security, and how we're somehow inhumane because we want to  have border security. What is inhumane is having cheap labor in China prop  up your profits and then tell us how we should live our lives in Texas. </p><p>And I'm frankly kind of sick of it. I think it's inhumane that little girls  are getting sold into the sex trade because we don't have border security. </p><p>And yet, we're getting lectured by Tim Cook about what we need to do and  being held ransom for $50 million in Texas when they've got $250 billion in  cash in the bank, and I just don't think that's the way things ought to  fly.</p><p>CARLSON: I've been really hoping so fervently the Republican Party would  change, and the fact that you just got elected is evidence that it is. So,  thank you very much. Chip Roy, congrats again. God bless.</p><p>ROY: Thanks, Tucker, look forward to it, take care.</p><p>CARLSON: Instead of giving big tech huge tax breaks, what should lawmakers  be doing about their growing influence? One person who's been thinking  about this for a long time and getting no credit for it, believe it or not,  is Ralph Nader, of course, the long-time consumer advocate, Author of the  new book, How the Rats Re-Formed the Congress, he joins us tonight.</p><p>Mr. Nader, thank you very much for coming on. The reason I want to talk to  you is I don't think you've gotten the credit you deserve for being a lone  voice on the Left raising concerns about the concentration of power in the  tech sector. What happens when you say that out loud?</p><p>RALPH NADER, POLITICAL ACTIVIST, LECTURER, ATTORNEY, HOW THE RATS RE-FORMED  THE CONGRESS AUTHOR: Well the Congress always bemused by the razzle-dazzle  of Silicon Valley and - and, you know, supposedly clean industry has  horrible pollution coming in from the supply chain and all the rock (ph)  when they dismantle the stuff. And they have no tech capability to ask the  right question.</p><p>So Newt Gingrich in 1995 got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in  Congress, which is he not (ph) Professional Advisor. So, when they deal  with things like, you know, ballistic missile defense or Facebook or  Google, they would have the experts right there.</p><p>And so, there they are, they have these hearings and, you know, outrage and  admiration came from the Members of the House--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --and the Senate that went nowhere. So, the question coming up in  Congress is, are they going to regulate them like they, suppose, you know,  they regulate cars or pharmaceuticals.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: Or are they going to just have Quasi-regulation like the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation does for banks or are they going to create a  trade association to regulate them with standards overseen by some agency?  It doesn't look good.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission nailed Facebook in 2011, led by David Vladeck,  the Consumer Protection Bureau, and haven't (ph) enforced at all. And  Facebook has been violating or letting others, third-party, fourth-party,  Cambridge Analytics violate that consent decree. And it's--</p><p>CARLSON: It's but - but wait (ph) - OK, so you became famous--</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: 1965-ish going after--</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --General Motors.</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And the Right didn't like you because you were attacking business.  But the Left loved you. You became this huge hero. You're saying the same  thing now about the big tech companies, why is no one joining your side?</p><p>NADER: We don't get onto mass media. The civic communities that are raising  issues of crony capitalism, corporate welfare, these kind of tax breaks,  you know, for--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --Apple. Apple is just burning a $100 billion in stock buybacks,  they aren't (ph) giving it back to the shareholders or the workers or the  environment cleanup or the pension funds. </p><p>They want to buyback all that stock to increase the metrics for the  Executive Compensation packages for Tim Cook and others. And you can't get  on national TV on that. You can't even get on - NB - NPR and - and PBS.</p><p>CARLSON: Why?</p><p>NADER: And I've been talking about corporate welfare and the Right, it  talks about crony capitalism, so we're converging, right? </p><p>I think there are a lot of issues in this country, as I pointed out in my  book, Unstoppable, where Conservatives and Liberals back home where they  work, live, and raise their families, right, never mind the ideology--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>NADER: --red state, blue state. They bleed. They get ripped off the same  way--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>NADER: --disinfected, disempowered. And there's no publicity given - given  to it at all. And that - so I'm - I've resorted to a fable. How the Rats  Re-Formed the Congress. It's big rat infestation, you know--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --in D.C.</p><p>CARLSON: Literally.</p><p>NADER: Yes, literally. And they come up from the catacombs in this book and  they get into the toilet polls (ph) first with the Speaker. You can imagine  the result.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: You try to suppress an increasing rat infestation, massive derision  all over the country, it wakes people up. They look at 535 men and women in  Congress, who are using their delegated power under the - we, the people,  right?</p><p>Then they organize a mass movement and get control of Congress from the  corporatists, from the Wall Streeters. You pointed out in your book, the  ruling class should share power. Otherwise, they're going to lose in  whatever Democratic institutions we have.  So, Members of Congress have called this disgusting, outrageous, revolting,  because of the opening pages. But you go back on this, this is a single  most devastating document in--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --indictment (ph) of Congress on one page.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm going to read it. I don't know. I remember at one point  disagreeing with you--</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --on stuff. But I can't remember what it was. I now think that on  this stuff anyway, you're an important voice--</p><p>NADER: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: --and I'm grateful that you came on this show.</p><p>NADER: You go to ratsreformcongress.org--</p><p>CARLSON: Ratsreformcongress--</p><p>NADER: --and you'll get in a (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm going to. And I probably agree with a lot of it that you're  saying (ph).</p><p>NADER: You - you'll get instruction on how to organize back home--</p><p>CARLSON: I love it.</p><p>NADER: --Congress Ratwatcher Groups.</p><p>CARLSON: Ralph Nader, it's great to see you. Thank you.</p><p>NADER: Thanks for the sunglass (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: We've got a Fox News Alert. </p><p>The Senate has passed Criminal Justice Reform. The bill passed 87 to 12,  wow, big margin. The President strongly encouraged Congress to act on the  bill before the end of the lame-duck session. That bill now goes to the  House. Obviously, we'll continue to follow the story. </p><p>And we'll be right back with an important holiday message for you after the  break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: SHIP OF FOOLS.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well as the last hour has demonstrated, in fact, the last decade  has demonstrated, America's ruling class has lost the ability to govern  wisely. They're obsessed with trifles like the Russia investigation, or  gender politics or whatever the nonsense fad (ph) of the day is.</p><p>Meanwhile, they ignore our dying middle class. They know nothing about  falling life expectancy, they don't care. They're more interesting in the  wellbeing of anyone other than their own citizens. They do nothing to  counter the main threats to our wellbeing, big tech, or China.</p><p>Much of the time they directly enable these threats because they're getting  rich from it. How'd we get to this place? Well, it's the subject of a new  book called Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Bringing America  to the Brink of Revolution. It tells the long, gory story. But it may be  worth reading. We recommend it strongly.</p><p>That's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night 8:00 P.M, the show  that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially,  groupthink. Good night from Washington. </p><p>Sean Hannity is next. Sitting in though, the most famous judge in America,  not Judge Judy, much better, Judge Jeanine. Hey, Judge.</p><p>JEANINE PIRRO- HOST: Thank you, Tucker. Great show.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>END </p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

That would be for the crime of lying to FBI agents in his now-famous White  House interview at the very beginning of the Administration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a number of reasons, you've probably already heard about, none of them  very significant in the cosmic scheme of things, that sentencing has been  postponed until the New Year. And, of course, we'll bring you the details  when that happens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the meantime though, we thought we would seize this opportunity to take  stock of all that we have learned, Michael Flynn being, of course, the  first major target of the Mueller investigation. That was all the way back,  if you can believe it, at the beginning of last year, 2017.</p><p>So, it's been just about two years, almost, and the hunt for Russian spies  on our soil has not slowed down. It has metastasized into something vast  and remarkable. It's now practically its own agency of government. </p><p>There are now, we think this is right, there could be more, but what we  could find are a half a dozen separate Russia investigations now being  conducted by the Justice Department. </p><p>That does not even count the separate Congressional inquiries or - four,  five, maybe more, who knows, and then, of course, nearly a 100 percent of  the attention of every news organization in Washington, almost everyone. </p><p>So, what have we learned after all that time and all that money and all  that attention? Well, we know that the Russians spent a total of, let's  check the math, $4,700 on Google ads during the 2016 election. Try to buy a  car for that. </p><p>We also know that Jerome Corsi and George Papadopoulos, two people you  probably had never heard of before, likely did something bad, like  misremembering dates or emails, though apparently neither one of them spied  for anybody. That's what we've learned.</p><p>We've also learned that, and people are not noting this, but we thought  it'd be worth pointing out, virtually every issue that led voters  unexpectedly to support Donald Trump in 2016 remains as of now unresolved,  in some cases, not even addressed.</p><p>That would include the decline of the American middle class, the drop in  life expectancy, the opioid crisis, our unsecured Southern border, crushing  student loan debt, the global dominance of China, the quagmire in  Afghanistan, infrastructure, healthcare costs, we could go on, you know,  the little things.</p><p>You haven't heard a lot about any of that lately. The news anchors have not  had time to tell you about any of that because they're too busy shouting  self-righteously about Michael Flynn. \"He lied. He lied.\" They, by  contrast, never lie because they're good people, unlike Michael Flynn who  lied.</p><p>So, I guess the point is there's been a cost to our Russia fixation. Years  later, we may look back and wonder what happened during the last two years.  How did everybody in America with an Ivy League education simultaneously go  insane in the space of a single year? </p><p>Was there some kind of mass poisoning? Was it Ergotism? It happened in  medieval France maybe - maybe that's what happened.</p><p>We're going to let historians sort that out. We're not really sure. For  now, all we know for certain is that the people in charge have lost it,  they really have. And if you don't believe it, listen to them explain the  intricacies of the Russia conspiracy.  They're mesmerized by it. It's a tale so complex, so riddled with internal  contradictions, it sounds like an Eastern religion. Only they really  understand it, but they mean it and they do understand it. To them, Russia  is the touchstone. It's the comprehensive theory of everything.</p><p>Consider what happened, for example, last night in cable news, and it  really could have been any night on cable news. MSNBC, CNN, take your pick.  We just happened to be watching last night around 11:00 when this happened,  so we're bringing it to you tonight because it's interesting, and it tells  you a lot.</p><p>By the way, this is from the most serious news program that NBC offers on  cable. It's called The 11th Hour. There are two people in this segment  we're about to show you. The first is a man called Malcolm Nance. </p><p>Now, Nance identifies himself as a 35-year veteran of counterintelligence  work, whatever that means. His most recent book is called The Plot to Hack  America. It was a national bestseller, thanks to heavy promotion from  MSNBC.</p><p>The second man you're about to see is Brian Williams who, of course, needs  no introduction. He was the anchor of the NBC Nightly News, back when that  meant something. Williams is widely regarded as - as a good guy by people  who know him and he's absolutely in Washington anyway, is thought of as one  of the smartest people in the news business. </p><p>The point is these are not kooks on late-night radio. They are considered  highly impressive people. Keep that in mind as you watch this. </p><p>Williams opens the segment by explaining that Russian disinformation teams  have been working to divide America and convince the population, among  other totally implausible things, that Jim Comey and Robert Mueller might  have political agendas.</p><p>Ridiculous, right? Williams asked Malcolm Nance to comment on that  proposition and Nance says this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MALCOLM WRIGHTSON NANCE, AUTHOR, MEDIA COMMENTATOR, FORMER UNITED  STATES  NAVY SENIOR CHIEF PETTY OFFICER: What Russia has done here and where the  true brilliance of this intelligence operation comes from is way back in  the early 2000s, the Russian military conducted a strategic study and  started carrying out a disinformation plan, in which they said that instead  of carrying out kinetic warfare against your enemies, the best thing we can  do is create a disinformation and (ph) frame around that nation to the  point where over time as we are constantly tearing them apart and feeding  them with false information, they would actually welcome an invasion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLSON: Huh? Wait, wait a second here. This is what we in the news  business call news. </p><p>So, for nearly 20 years, the Russians have been building a disinformation  frame around the United States. What's a disinformation frame? And how does  it manage to brainwash an entire population so thoroughly that they welcome  a foreign invasion?</p><p>I mean that's got to be the most powerful mind control device in human  history. More detail please. This - really this is the part of the  interview where the anchor politely interrupts the guest and ask them to  explain what the hell he's talking about.</p><p>But Williams does not do that. He just lets Malcolm Nance keep talking, so  Malcolm Nance does keep talking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCE: So Russia has done that to the United States. And it began way  before 2016. As a matter of fact, the earliest references I have with  relation to Donald Trump shows that it started back in 2011 with Maria  Butina and the NRA contacts, contacts with the fundamentalist Christian  Right and the Alt-Right in the United States. Russia was pushing these  disinformation themes then. </p><p>Then in 2013, they stood up the Russian Federation Internet Research  Agency, which built all of these memes and tropes, which became the cruise  missiles of fake news and disinformation designed to do what it did today,  take one-third of the United States population and make them refuse to  believe what they see before their very eyes and may have elected a  president in the process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Holy smokes! This is a tsunami of news. </p><p>It turns out that Donald Trump's collusion with Russia began years before  any of us suspected, way back in 2011. Here's the confusing part. In 2011,  by all outward appearances, Trump was still a pretty conventional New York  Liberal.</p><p>He went to David Letterman to read the Top 10 list. He endorsed gun  control. It was all a cover, a sophisticated ruse. As Malcolm Nance  reveals, Trump was, in fact, busy plotting with the NRA, Christian  fundamentalists, and the Alt-Right.</p><p>Now keep in mind, this was years before there was such a thing as the Alt- Right, but that's just how stealthy this operation was. Even the Steele  dossier missed it, so did the rest of us.</p><p>Well, that's not surprising, since as Malcolm Nance has explained, thanks  to Russian brainwashing, one-third of the U.S. population can no longer  perceive reality. That's Malcolm Nance's position.</p><p>What would you do if somebody repeated those exact same words to you on a  city bus? You'd likely be worried. At the very least, you'd probably switch  seats. Not Brian Williams. He'd move closer. </p><p>Williams didn't seem to consider Nance's explanation strange in the  slightest. He was deeply impressed by it. Williams asked how the Russians  could have pulled off an operation this extensive without the willing help  of American accomplices.</p><p>Of course, Nance - Nance had an answer to that. Keep in mind, as you watch  this clip, that we have not edited the tape in any way. This aired verbatim  last night on MSNBC. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCE: They have played on the - the themes of far-Right conspiracy  theorists from the 1960. The John Birch Society, a - a sideline group, you  know, and the farthest extremes of the libertarian parties. </p><p>They have amplified racism to the point where the Alt-Right, Steve Bannon's  own creation of Gamers is now the wholly owned subsidiary of the Trump  campaign and are believers in David Duke, the Ku Klux Klan, Richard -  Richard Spencer, the neo-Nazi, and Robert Spencer, the Islamophobe, to the  point where they're mainstreamed. This is how effective this information  warfare campaign has been carried out. </p><p>And let me tell you, this report shows how they went after to suppress the  African-American vote. And there's no doubt in my mind or anybody else's in  the intelligence community that doesn't believe that it took American  citizens to assist them in really getting down to where these voters were  who needed to be suppressed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Wow! So, in case you weren't transcribing that as you watch, let's  bottom-line it for you.</p><p>The Russia conspiracy just expanded to include a bewildering array of new  figures. These would include the John Birch Society, the KKK, David Duke,  people who play online video games, Steve Bannon, a religion blogger named  Robert Spencer, and others.</p><p>Collectively, their goal was not simply to elect Donald Trump but to hurt  African-Americans. Why would Russian intelligence want to do that, you  might ask? Well if you have to ask, you're probably working for Vladimir  Putin too, so shut up.</p><p>It goes without saying that all of this is completely insane. There's no  evidence to support any of it. It is not true. Worse than that, it's  irresponsible. Keep in mind this aired on a division of NBC News, so some  large number of people are likely going to believe it. </p><p>They'll go to sleep worrying about the invisible disinformation frame that  surrounds their country and the resurgence of the John Birch Society. And  they'll wake up a little more convinced that anyone who disagrees with them  is a tool of a foreign power because that is the real message here, and of  this whole conspiracy.</p><p>There's no other side of the debate. There's only Russian propaganda. To a  certain sort of fragile Liberal, that's probably comforting to know, but  it's a lie. In fact, it's its own form of propaganda. No news organization  should traffic in garbage like this. News anchors exist to push back  against nutty claims like these.</p><p>Brian Williams bought them completely.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN DOUGLAS WILLIAMS, AMERICAN JOURNALIST AT NBC NEWS, MSNBC ANCHOR,  THE  11TH HOUR WITH BRIAN WILLIAMS HOST: Wow. Malcolm Nance, this is why we ask  you all the time to come on this broadcast. Scary stuff, but it needs to be  said, needs to be heard. Thank you, sir, so much for joining us once again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It needs to be said. It needs to be heard. This is why we ask you  to come on this broadcast. Save that video. Future generations won't  believe it. </p><p>And now to the actual monetary cost of all this Russia nonsense, what is it  costing taxpayers? Trace Gallagher has been tracking that for us and he  joins us tonight. Hey Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Hey, Tucker. If you back up the  clock to June, President Trump blasted Robert Mueller on Twitter saying,  quoting here, the Russian hoax investigation has now cost our government  over $17 million and going up fast. Turns out, the President was right. </p><p>Brand-new filings by the Department of Justice show that $17 million number  has now risen to $25 million and counting, and that does not include an  additional $5.5 million spent by the Department of Justice on other  expenses related to the Russia investigation. </p><p>Here's a quick rundown of how Mr. Mueller has spent your money over the  past six months. </p><p>$2.9 million went to the salaries and benefits of Special Counsel employees  and Department of Justice employees, 942-plus-thousand was spent on rent,  communication, and utilities, $60,000 for printing supplies and materials,  that's a lot of copies of something, $580,000 on transportation and travel,  and $310,000 for IT services.</p><p>Bottom line, trying to find collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia  is expensive, and working in IT for the Special Counsel is apparently  lucrative. Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, thanks for keeping track.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson is a historian. He's a Senior Fellow at the Hoover  Institution and, we're proud to say, a frequent guest on this show, he  joins us tonight. Professor, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>So, calculate--</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN CLASSICIST,  MILITARY HISTORIAN, COLUMNIST, FARMER: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --if you would in non-monetary terms what you think the costs of  these various Russia investigations have been to the country.</p><p>HANSON: Well I think there's a - they're sins (ph) of commission and  omission because why this is all going on, Tucker, we - we've cracked 3  percent GDP. We hadn't done that in 10 years. That's not an abstract  number. That means millions of people who were not working now have an  opportunity.</p><p>I really see it in where I live in Southwestern Fresno County, it's a human  story. We have peacetime unemployment of 3.7. Remember, just two years ago,  Larry Summers said you - this is - these were - this was the stuff of fairy  stories, and Barack Obama said you need a magic wand.</p><p>We're increasing oil production at 1.5 million barrels a year. We're the  largest oil producer in the world. Nothing hurts Russia more than that fact  alone that we - there's no such word in the English vocabulary for Peak Oil  anymore. So, there's just a human story going on.</p><p>This is not--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HANSON: --even talking about progress overseas. And we're just completely  uninterested in it. I don't know why because a lot of very poor people have  leverage over employers for higher wages that they never had before. </p><p>And the second is there's a really in - inequality of the law. I mean we  talk about the elites. But think of the - the array of people who have not  told the truth. </p><p>Andrew McCabe was fired for lying to federal investigators. We don't know  what's going to happen to him. So far, he hasn't faced criminal charges.  But the Inspector General said he was lying.</p><p>James Comey's statements about the FISA Court and the role of the dossier  are not true. James Clapper lied under oath to Congress. John Brennan lied  under oath to Congress. Susan Rice lied when she said she did not request  surveilled transcripts and have them unmask.</p><p>We know that Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills lied when they said they did not  have knowledge of the email server of Hillary - of their boss, Hillary  Clinton. That's not even getting into the deception of the FISA Court or  the way that the investigations went on the email scandal or putting  informants in a presidential campaign.</p><p>So, the second thing, it's really from a historical point of view, we've  had a lot of wrongdoing by elites. And nobody's - there's been no  consequences. So, the American--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HANSON: --people are not paranoid. They're saying, well the Mueller  investigation's going here but they're going after misdemeanors or nothing.  And here these felonies go completely unaddressed. Then finally, this  Mueller investigation's not in isolation. </p><p>We - we had, remember, from the day Trump was elected, we were told that  the voting machines were fraudulent. We're going to sue. And then there was  in a group, remember about the Electoral College, we had to overturn--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, very well.</p><p>HANSON: --get to the electors. And then we went to the 25th Amendment that  Trump was unbalanced, and then that didn't work. Then we went to the  Emoluments Clause. He profit - even though his businesses had lost a  billion dollars, and then we've gone to the Mueller.</p><p>And so, there's a slow motion, if you will. I don't want to be too  psychodramatic like MSNBC guest. </p><p>But there is sort of a slow-motion coup to overturn the elections when we  should just take a deep breath and say we have a chance to adjudicate this  in the next two - '20 election, and we do not want to destroy 2.5 - you  know, two - over two centuries of American constitutional jurisprudence,  because we know historically, Tucker, when you have whether it's successful  systems like ours or the Greek city-state of the Fourth Century or Rome in  the Fifth Century A.D. or the Byzantines in the 6 - 15th Century or the  ancient regime in Rome, why did they fall apart?</p><p>They fall apart because an elite no longer warrants the respect that they  think that they deserve--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>HANSON: --because they're out of touch with the people. And we have a whole  bunch of people on questions of global warming, as we see in Europe, or  immigration in Eastern Europe, or here at home, that feel that they can  unhide, dictate to people and they're never subject to the ramifications of  their own ideology and policy. </p><p>And it's like the emperor has no close (ph) and then they're - they're  surprised that Trump won or surprised that people are rioting in Paris.  What do they think was--</p><p>CARLSON: If--</p><p>HANSON: --going to happen?</p><p>CARLSON: --if they were wise and had perspective and made good decisions  and cared about their countries, it wouldn't bother me. But they're none of  those things, unfortunately, as you know. Professor, thank you very much.</p><p>HANSON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well for two years, the Fusion GPS dossier has dominated our  political conversation and has driven political events more than maybe any  other fact. What parts of the dossier have proved true over the past two  years?</p><p>Mollie Hemingway has been keeping track. Everybody should be keeping track.  But she's one of the rare few who is, and she'll join us after the break to  tell us what she's found.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well at the center of the two-year Russia investigation is the  Fusion GPS dossier. Hard to remember now, but it was originally compiled as  opposition research by the Hillary Clinton for President Campaign. It was  then passed around to journalists and lawmakers, and finally released on  BuzzFeed without its contents being verified.</p><p>Despite that, the dossier and its allegations have become more important  than America's entire middle class. So, the question is with two years of  thinking about it and poking around in the efforts of every news  organization in Washington to verify it or not, how much the dossier wound  up being true?</p><p>Mollie Hemingway has been following this. She's Senior Editor at The  Federalist. We're happy to have her tonight. So, Mollie, I just want to go  through a couple of the big claims in this, and you tell me if we - if this  happened or not.</p><p>So, the first was Michael Cohen's trip to Prague. Remember the famous trip  to Prague?</p><p>MOLLIE ZIEGLER HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST SENIOR EDITOR, FOX NEWS  CONTRIBUTOR: This is absolutely key. We're told that Michael Cohen, Donald  Trump's personal attorney, went to Prague, had a secret meeting with the  Duma's Konstantin Kosachev that they discussed the collusion arrangement  and that it - and that it went really, and that this was - this was a  really important thing.</p><p>In fact, not only had did that meeting not take place, there's no evidence  that the meeting took place. There's no evidence that Michael Cohen has  ever been to Prague.</p><p>CARLSON: But that was repeated as fact repeatedly.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Well, in fact, in just a few months ago, seven months ago, I  think there was a news report that falsely claimed that the Mueller - that  the Mueller team had evidence that that secret meeting had taken place. </p><p>It is just interesting to note, since we're actually in the sentencing  phase and we're dealing with all - with sort of some resolution here, it  wasn't even mentioned by Bob Mueller or anyone else--</p><p>CARLSON: And assuming they were not (ph)--</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --who's going after Cohen (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --one of the things that always struck me about the dossier was it  accused people of crimes, American citizens of crimes, and one of them was  Carter Page, who was described, in effect, as a - as a mastermind Russian  spy.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Carter Page, again, was all over the dossier. And it was so  important, the dossier was viewed so favorably by our federal government.  They used this to secure a wiretap against him. They portrayed him as a  mastermind spy who was setting up all sorts of important meetings and  arranging, again, collusion.</p><p>We were told that he had a - got a stake in - in a large Russian oil  company in exchange for the collusion. These meetings that we were told  took place in the dossier, there's no evidence that any of them happened. </p><p>And it's interesting to note that Carter Page was surveilled for an entire  year by our government, and has not been charged with any crime despite  being portrayed as this - as the central linchpin of the collusion theory  (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But I do think it destroyed his life, so there's that.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Now, at the very center of this were the salacious claims that  Trump was caught doing things with hookers, and he was subject to blackmail  as a result of this. Did that happen?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Right. So, this was - this was what made it so interesting and  what made the journalists so excited when the dossier was first published,  not just the tale of the - of the prostitutes at the Moscow hotel, but we  were told that Russia had all sorts of compromising information on Donald  Trump, and that he would be compromised and blackmailed by this.</p><p>Then you can look at his record over the last two years and see that if  Russia has anything compromising on him they should have deployed it while  he was going after them in such an aggressive fashion in foreign policy--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --and they haven't done anything of the kind. There is no  evidence to support this. But a lot of people are, in fact, druthers (ph)  on this.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Meanwhile, as Victor Davis Hanson just pointed out, the one  thing they care about is energy, and America is now the world's largest oil  producer, energy producer, so we haven't helped them too much. </p><p>The Trump Towers in Moscow, you hear that to this day.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: So, you need to have business interests in order to have this  collusion theory make sense. The dossier said a bunch of actually kind of  contradictory things that Trump was very interested in a business deal in  Russia, and also that he'd been offered sweetheart deals.</p><p>Well if you've been offered sweetheart deals, I think we can reasonably  assume he would have taken them. There's no evidence he has ever  successfully accomplished any business relationship in Russia.</p><p>CARLSON: And finally, and this claim, again, persists to this day that  Manafort manipulated WikiLeaks in order to hurt Hillary Clinton, and I  think it's basically wrecked Roger Stone's life, this - this claim from the  dossier. Is it true? Do we know that that's true?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: So, the dossier claimed that Manafort was really the one in  charge of the entire collusion theory that, in fact, Carter Page was  working on his orders. There's no evidence that they even met that he - we  were told that Manafort was the one who came up with the whole WikiLeaks  idea. There's no evidence.</p><p>And we have a lot of court filings where if there were any evidence of  this, you know darn well that this would have been mentioned in any of  these filings. Now the whole genius of this dossier is that it has a bunch  of allegations that are improb - impossible to disprove. </p><p>And that's not the way that justice is supposed to be done in this country  where you say, \"Well if you're innocent, you have to prove that these  things never happened.\" These are a bunch of wild allegations without  evidence to support them, and we are now years into this--</p><p>CARLSON: No, you're right.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --and it's--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean that's the--</p><p>HEMINGWAY: --it's a lie.</p><p>CARLSON: --standard we apply to Supreme Court justices, but not - not to  anyone else. Mollie Hemingway, great to see you. Thank you for that.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Great to be here with you.</p><p>CARLSON: For your rigorous look at that.</p><p>Well anti-Russia panic has reignited the Cold War and driven us apart from  Russia. But is that good for American interests? Why should we be Russia's  enemy? That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: At the center of the Russia panic is an accusation that bears  directly on a key foreign policy question that affects all of us, and it's  this. By colluding with Russia, Donald Trump and his team agreed to sell  out America's interests by aligning with Vladimir Putin's government. </p><p>That's what they're saying. In real life, of course, the opposite has  happened. In the past two years, relations with Russia have deteriorated to  historically bad levels, really the worst since the Cuban Missile Crisis of  1962. </p><p>The question is has that helped America in some way? And what is wrong with  improving relations with Russia? Donald Trump ran on improving relations  with Russia and got elected, as you remember.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Wouldn't it actually be  wonderful if we could get along with Russia?</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING YES)</p><p>TRUMP: Wouldn't that be nice?</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)</p><p>TRUMP: If we get along with Russia, we'd go out together with others and  we'd knock the hell out of ISIS, wouldn't that be great?</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING YES)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Steve Cohen is a former NYU professor, one of the eminent Russia  experts in America, Author of the new book, War with Russia: From Putin and  Ukraine To Trump and Russiagate, and he joins us tonight. Professor, thanks  very much for coming on. So--</p><p>STEPHEN COHEN, NYU PROFESSOR EMERITUS, THE NATION CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, WAR  WITH RUSSIA AUTHOR: Well, you've got quite a lot - you've got a quite a  lineup tonight, all the skeptics.</p><p>CARLSON: Well it's what's just so interesting you - at the heart of this is  a real foreign policy question, which is why we're always so grateful to  talk to you. </p><p>And that question is does the United States benefit in some way from  demonizing Russia? Should we be enemies with Russia? Or, could we benefit  more from some kind of loose alliance with Russia? </p><p>That's really the question that Trump's raised (ph) and I'm starting to  suspect that that view was so unpopular that it's driving the Russia  investigation, at least in part, do you think?</p><p>COHEN: It's a mystery of our time. And I promise you that your kids and my  grandkids and the historians of their generation will look back on this  terrible era, this Russiagate era, and ask who started it, why it got such  traction, and why it's done the damage it's done?</p><p>Now, one explanation, but I'm not sure it's a complete explanation is that  when Trump said during the campaign, it would be great to cooperate with  Russia, the enemies of such cooperation saw in Trump an enemy, and they  began this, literally unproven, allegation that he was somehow under the  control of the Kremlin.</p><p>But the damage it's done to our national security and to our institutions,  the you - you may be the only person who's - who's - who's asked the  question. But I guarantee you historians will ask it, what have been the  cost of these two years of Russiagate? </p><p>They've been grave. I mean Victor Hanson pointed out the corruption of our  elites. But what about the corruption of our institutions? The presidency,  elections, suspicions, doubts have been cast on these basic American  institutions. </p><p>And then I come to the thing that concerns me the most that I worry about  in this book, War with Russia? I mean it. I think it's a possibility that  Trump is not free to do crisis negotiation with Russia, and there's going  to be a crisis soon, for sure, the way every president since Eisenhower has  been.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>COHEN: I've said that before on your show. It's virtually an existential  constitutional duty of the American President in the nuclear age to be free  and powered to deal with questions of war and peace with Russia the way  John F. Kennedy was, Cuban Missile Crisis.</p><p>I can't imagine what's going to happen if we have such a crisis. Trump is  shackled. Remember what happened in July. I think you and I might have  talked about it on the air. Trump went to Helsinki for a perfectly  ritualistic, normal summit meeting with Putin. Comes home--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, we were there.</p><p>COHEN: --and he's accused of treason.</p><p>CARLSON: I remember.</p><p>COHEN: Accused for treason. So, that's the--</p><p>CARLSON: So - so let me--</p><p>COHEN: --cost.</p><p>CARLSON: --can I ask you - we only have a minute left. But I'm so  interested in this question and I don't know the answer. What was the -  what's the motive? Apart from disliking Trump, their political motives,  obviously, but there is - part of our foreign policy establishment really  believes that we ought to be in some sort of adversarial posture against  Russia. Why?</p><p>COHEN: I - I don't know. And when you don't know you got to say it. But  here is a theory that some people would offer you if asked that question.  When the Soviet Union ended in 1991, the Washington elites who controlled  foreign policy saw a world dominated or governed by or run by the United  States.</p><p>And that seemed to be a reality in the 1990s when Russia had a President  who was ill, often drunk, and very compliant to Washington. And we got used  to that. Russia is a kind of junior subservient partner in world affair  (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>COHEN: And then came Putin, and it was a shock, and they've been reacting  to the shock of Putin ever since. And I'll give you one quote.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>COHEN: Nicholas Kristof, a very influential New York Times Correspondent -  Columnist, lamented in (ph) print, listen to this, that Putin did not turn  out to be what he expected, namely, a sober Yeltsin, Yeltsin having been  the President of Russia in the 1990s. So, part of this--</p><p>CARLSON: The - the arrogance and dumbness--</p><p>COHEN: --was done (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --of our - of the people who make our policy and influence our  policy really will be the - the - the title of every history of this  period. Professor, thank you. It's--</p><p>COHEN: I agree with that.</p><p>CARLSON: --great to see you and congrats on the new book.</p><p>COHEN: Thanks, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: First it was Rudolph and bullying, now the Left's war on  Christmas, which is not real, but still continues unabated, is targeting  gingerbread men, man, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Recently, we interviewed a New York State Senator, a Democrat  called Kevin Parker. </p><p>Parker is sponsoring a law bill in New York that will require anybody who  wants to buy a gun to give the state the passwords to their social media  accounts, so politicians can make sure they didn't say anything naughty  that they disagree with, because when you say violent things online,  according to Kevin Parker, you shouldn't have a firearm. </p><p>Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN PARKER, NEW YORK STATE SENATOR, DEMOCRATIC MEMBER: This law simply  says let's look at, you know, what people are putting out on social media  as a, you know, the - you know, part of a - a set of criteria that we're  using to determine who gets handguns.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>Do you think that people have a right to say outrageous things, maybe even  things you disagree with, in public, do you think--</p><p>PARKER: They - they certainly--</p><p>CARLSON: --that that be good (ph)?</p><p>PARKER: --they certainly can say whatever they want to say. But we also  have the right--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, but then you punish them--</p><p>PARKER: --we also have--</p><p>CARLSON: --for saying that.</p><p>PARKER: --but we also have a right to deny them a gun permit if, in fact,  we believe that the things that they're saying may lead to them endangering  the people of the State of New York.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. So, if you say something threatening online, he doesn't think  you should have a gun. Well, as we've chronicled exhaustively on this show,  there's something called projection, and that's what you accuse people you  don't like of doing precisely the thing that you are doing. Freud wrote a  book about that, I think.</p><p>Well this morning, Parker, the guy you just saw, tweeted this, Kill  yourself!, at a GOP, I know I'm laughing because it's just hilarious, is  it's so grotesque, at Spokeswoman - Republican Spokeswoman Candice Giove. </p><p>Parker, turns out, was mad at being accused of improperly parking on the  streets of Manhattan. I'm sure that didn't happen. Well, the Spokeswoman  was shocked, she tweeted this. \"Did a Senator just write this to me?\" </p><p>And the answer, of course, is yes. Kill yourself, he said. Unbelievable.  That really does go into Hypocrisy Hall of Fame. We hope Mr. Parker will  come back and explain it to us. I'm sure he will.</p><p>Well the war on Christmas is not real, they tell you that all the time.  It's totally fake. And if you believe in it, you're dumb, you watch Fox  News or something. But it's also, of course, going on. And it's being  fought very fiercely here in America, but not just in America.</p><p>The war on Christmas is a global struggle. In the Parliament of Scotland,  they have a National Parliament, the coffee shop has stopped selling  gingerbread men. Why? Gender-specific. They're now called gingerbread  people. </p><p>You don't want to give them a gender without their consent. You don't even  want to know how many bathrooms there are in gingerbread houses now, a lot.</p><p>Tammy Bruce is a radio host and President of Independent Women's Voice, and  she joins us tonight. Tammy, so I have this - have this sneaking suspicion  that a lot of the people who are doing things like this are actually Right- wing plants there to discredit the progressives they live among. </p><p>Do you think that's possible?</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS ON-AIR CONTRIBUTOR, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE  PRESIDENT: I don't. I think though that they're - it's--</p><p>CARLSON: You don't--</p><p>BRUCE: --I - I know. It's - it's very funny. And now I've been - starting  to think about the complicated structure of gingerbread houses because of  your comment. I'm just wondering, how many bathrooms can they get into one  house? But look, here is the problem. And it just proves, of course, our  point, in general. </p><p>The Left has worked now for a couple of generations to condition us to  ahead of time worry about what we're going to say. Even your last segment,  of course, is about that little bit of - of challenging people and  threatening them and making sure that they know that there's danger in  those thoughts.</p><p>And so, this baker, she said it was a whim that she just thought you just -  like for no good reason that she should not call them gingerbread men and  call them a gingerbread person, and I couldn't tell, obviously, because  they're also not wearing clothes. So, it's hard to say what it is that  there - they - they are, and what they're doing and what they're not doing.</p><p>But she said she was also shocked by the response. And that's the good  news, Tucker, is that this is in - in, again, Scotland, the United Kingdom.  And the backlash, she was apparently shocked that people were really upset  about this. </p><p>And - and I contend after a series of, you know, living your entire life  being kind of bullied into what you can and cannot say and presumptions  that you're--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>BRUCE: --bad people that it can be the smallest thing that tips you over  the edge that's a - that's the tipping point. And in this case, it's, you  know, calling gingerbread men a gingerbread person when obviously they're  men. </p><p>CARLSON: Well, so maybe the lesson is that the rest of us shouldn't  participate in our own spiritual neutering and that we should--</p><p>BRUCE: That's correct.</p><p>CARLSON: --at every step along the way say, I'm not - I'm not complying  with that. I'm sorry--</p><p>BRUCE: That is correct.</p><p>CARLSON: --call HR on me, I'm not doing it.</p><p>BRUCE: And - and look, this Kentucky radio station is a very good example  of that. You know, Baby, It's Cold Outside, the famous song has come under  fire for being inappropriate. And a station in Ohio cut it off of their -  their list.</p><p>Well a - a Kentucky radio station decided to put it on a loop five  different versions they - because it's been covered by everybody, and they  played it continuously for two hours. Obviously, Kentucky for two hours on  Sunday was - was nirvana. </p><p>And they just play and everybody loved it. And they said, \"Look, we've  stand behind this. We're going to play it. We're not afraid.\" And that's a  very good idea is that this is the one way to stop it is to do the thing  that the bullies and the establishment tell you that you're not allowed to  do in an effort to control you. </p><p>And as a statement, I think--</p><p>CARLSON: That's right.</p><p>BRUCE: --sometimes that's important.</p><p>CARLSON: I agree. And also being an independent thinker in a time of  mandatory conformity pays off in the event (ph)--</p><p>BRUCE: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --we've got to hope. Tammy--</p><p>BRUCE: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --thank you very much.</p><p>BRUCE: Thank you. I'll get my gingerbread now. You too.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes (ph). </p><p>Well, Apple, the company that makes your phone and your tablet and your  laptop is one of the most profitable companies in the world, have the  biggest market cap in the world, may still. And yet, American taxpayers are  still subsidizing Apple. Why is that? Our investigation into big tech  continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for several years running, the tech giant Apple has been  this country's most lucrative company. It regularly earns tens of billions  in profits every year. Despite that, for reasons that aren't exactly clear,  lawmakers are eager to give Apple tax breaks, tax breaks that you're not  getting and could never get because sorry, you're not Apple.</p><p>For example, in return for expanding its campus in Austin, Texas,  Williamson County, where Austin is, is prepared to give Apple a property  tax break worth more than $20 million. Again, are you getting anything like  that? Probably not. Why are they getting it? </p><p>Chip Roy is a Republican. He's the Congressman-elect for the 21st  Congressional district of Texas, and he joins us tonight. Mr. Roy, thank  you very much. Congrats, by the way, on winning, and thanks for coming on  tonight. What - why in the world--</p><p>CHIP ROY, CONGRESSMAN-ELECT FOR THE 21ST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS,  REPUBLICAN MEMBER: Good evening, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --would any County give Apple a tax break?</p><p>ROY: Well, you know, that's a great question. It's a question that I've  been asking. And I know that there's a popular mode of doing business in  this country now to try to pay businesses to move to your state. </p><p>But I don't think you need to pay people to move to Texas. Texas is a great  state with low tax rates and--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ROY: --good reasons to move here. So, I don't understand why we would give  upwards of $50 million to a company that has up close to $250 billion in  cash in the bank and a trillion dollar market cap, which is bigger than the  GDP of about a 180 countries.</p><p>It's just more of the same corporate cronyism that we see at the federal,  state and local level that I think voters are getting tired of. I know that  - well I heard on the campaign trail, people are getting sick of that.</p><p>CARLSON: Nobody says anything about it. I mean when Amazon did this in New  York, one of the only people, and I'm ashamed to say this, was not a  Republican, just the opposite. It was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. </p><p>And everyone else on both sides were nodding, \"Oh, Amazon good, Amazon  good.\" Why does nobody raise an alarm over this kind of behavior?</p><p>ROY: Well I think a lot of people, particularly, on the Republican side of  the aisle, hide behind job creation, and they think that well, we just  throw money around, it's going to create jobs. And the fact of the matter  is I think we are chasing, you know, good money after bad, while we throw  money at corporations that have tons of - of resources.</p><p>And frankly, they don't - they're not sharing our values. Corporations are  attacking our core--</p><p>CARLSON: That's for sure.</p><p>ROY: --Texas values, our core American values. You got Tim Cook lecturing  us about border security, and how we're somehow inhumane because we want to  have border security. What is inhumane is having cheap labor in China prop  up your profits and then tell us how we should live our lives in Texas. </p><p>And I'm frankly kind of sick of it. I think it's inhumane that little girls  are getting sold into the sex trade because we don't have border security. </p><p>And yet, we're getting lectured by Tim Cook about what we need to do and  being held ransom for $50 million in Texas when they've got $250 billion in  cash in the bank, and I just don't think that's the way things ought to  fly.</p><p>CARLSON: I've been really hoping so fervently the Republican Party would  change, and the fact that you just got elected is evidence that it is. So,  thank you very much. Chip Roy, congrats again. God bless.</p><p>ROY: Thanks, Tucker, look forward to it, take care.</p><p>CARLSON: Instead of giving big tech huge tax breaks, what should lawmakers  be doing about their growing influence? One person who's been thinking  about this for a long time and getting no credit for it, believe it or not,  is Ralph Nader, of course, the long-time consumer advocate, Author of the  new book, How the Rats Re-Formed the Congress, he joins us tonight.</p><p>Mr. Nader, thank you very much for coming on. The reason I want to talk to  you is I don't think you've gotten the credit you deserve for being a lone  voice on the Left raising concerns about the concentration of power in the  tech sector. What happens when you say that out loud?</p><p>RALPH NADER, POLITICAL ACTIVIST, LECTURER, ATTORNEY, HOW THE RATS RE-FORMED  THE CONGRESS AUTHOR: Well the Congress always bemused by the razzle-dazzle  of Silicon Valley and - and, you know, supposedly clean industry has  horrible pollution coming in from the supply chain and all the rock (ph)  when they dismantle the stuff. And they have no tech capability to ask the  right question.</p><p>So Newt Gingrich in 1995 got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in  Congress, which is he not (ph) Professional Advisor. So, when they deal  with things like, you know, ballistic missile defense or Facebook or  Google, they would have the experts right there.</p><p>And so, there they are, they have these hearings and, you know, outrage and  admiration came from the Members of the House--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --and the Senate that went nowhere. So, the question coming up in  Congress is, are they going to regulate them like they, suppose, you know,  they regulate cars or pharmaceuticals.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: Or are they going to just have Quasi-regulation like the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation does for banks or are they going to create a  trade association to regulate them with standards overseen by some agency?  It doesn't look good.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission nailed Facebook in 2011, led by David Vladeck,  the Consumer Protection Bureau, and haven't (ph) enforced at all. And  Facebook has been violating or letting others, third-party, fourth-party,  Cambridge Analytics violate that consent decree. And it's--</p><p>CARLSON: It's but - but wait (ph) - OK, so you became famous--</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: 1965-ish going after--</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --General Motors.</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And the Right didn't like you because you were attacking business.  But the Left loved you. You became this huge hero. You're saying the same  thing now about the big tech companies, why is no one joining your side?</p><p>NADER: We don't get onto mass media. The civic communities that are raising  issues of crony capitalism, corporate welfare, these kind of tax breaks,  you know, for--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --Apple. Apple is just burning a $100 billion in stock buybacks,  they aren't (ph) giving it back to the shareholders or the workers or the  environment cleanup or the pension funds. </p><p>They want to buyback all that stock to increase the metrics for the  Executive Compensation packages for Tim Cook and others. And you can't get  on national TV on that. You can't even get on - NB - NPR and - and PBS.</p><p>CARLSON: Why?</p><p>NADER: And I've been talking about corporate welfare and the Right, it  talks about crony capitalism, so we're converging, right? </p><p>I think there are a lot of issues in this country, as I pointed out in my  book, Unstoppable, where Conservatives and Liberals back home where they  work, live, and raise their families, right, never mind the ideology--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>NADER: --red state, blue state. They bleed. They get ripped off the same  way--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>NADER: --disinfected, disempowered. And there's no publicity given - given  to it at all. And that - so I'm - I've resorted to a fable. How the Rats  Re-Formed the Congress. It's big rat infestation, you know--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --in D.C.</p><p>CARLSON: Literally.</p><p>NADER: Yes, literally. And they come up from the catacombs in this book and  they get into the toilet polls (ph) first with the Speaker. You can imagine  the result.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: You try to suppress an increasing rat infestation, massive derision  all over the country, it wakes people up. They look at 535 men and women in  Congress, who are using their delegated power under the - we, the people,  right?</p><p>Then they organize a mass movement and get control of Congress from the  corporatists, from the Wall Streeters. You pointed out in your book, the  ruling class should share power. Otherwise, they're going to lose in  whatever Democratic institutions we have.  So, Members of Congress have called this disgusting, outrageous, revolting,  because of the opening pages. But you go back on this, this is a single  most devastating document in--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NADER: --indictment (ph) of Congress on one page.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm going to read it. I don't know. I remember at one point  disagreeing with you--</p><p>NADER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --on stuff. But I can't remember what it was. I now think that on  this stuff anyway, you're an important voice--</p><p>NADER: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: --and I'm grateful that you came on this show.</p><p>NADER: You go to ratsreformcongress.org--</p><p>CARLSON: Ratsreformcongress--</p><p>NADER: --and you'll get in a (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm going to. And I probably agree with a lot of it that you're  saying (ph).</p><p>NADER: You - you'll get instruction on how to organize back home--</p><p>CARLSON: I love it.</p><p>NADER: --Congress Ratwatcher Groups.</p><p>CARLSON: Ralph Nader, it's great to see you. Thank you.</p><p>NADER: Thanks for the sunglass (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: We've got a Fox News Alert. </p><p>The Senate has passed Criminal Justice Reform. The bill passed 87 to 12,  wow, big margin. The President strongly encouraged Congress to act on the  bill before the end of the lame-duck session. That bill now goes to the  House. Obviously, we'll continue to follow the story. </p><p>And we'll be right back with an important holiday message for you after the  break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: SHIP OF FOOLS.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well as the last hour has demonstrated, in fact, the last decade  has demonstrated, America's ruling class has lost the ability to govern  wisely. They're obsessed with trifles like the Russia investigation, or  gender politics or whatever the nonsense fad (ph) of the day is.</p><p>Meanwhile, they ignore our dying middle class. They know nothing about  falling life expectancy, they don't care. They're more interesting in the  wellbeing of anyone other than their own citizens. They do nothing to  counter the main threats to our wellbeing, big tech, or China.</p><p>Much of the time they directly enable these threats because they're getting  rich from it. How'd we get to this place? Well, it's the subject of a new  book called Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Bringing America  to the Brink of Revolution. It tells the long, gory story. But it may be  worth reading. We recommend it strongly.</p><p>That's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night 8:00 P.M, the show  that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially,  groupthink. Good night from Washington. </p><p>Sean Hannity is next. Sitting in though, the most famous judge in America,  not Judge Judy, much better, Judge Jeanine. Hey, Judge.</p><p>JEANINE PIRRO- HOST: Thank you, Tucker. Great show.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>END </p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

My question is this: Are we seeing people and institutions for what they really are, their basic make-up, in this time of trial?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is a sweeping question, but consider the behaviour of organisations and individuals in the last couple of weeks. Are you surprised - really surprised - by the way the banks, or Liverpool, or Donald Trump, or second-home owners, have been conducting themselves?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(A quick aside on the sideshow involving professional soccer and the obligations of its players and clubs across the water: Saying you are being held to a different standard doesn't validate your basic meanness. I'll leave it there before we're completely sidetracked.)</p><p>The point about essential character is: a) it always reveals itself eventually and b) it helps us understand the changes coming our way. An example many readers might relate to is the sports broadcasting landscape that will greet them when the dust finally settles.</p><p>You're no doubt looking forward to hunkering down in front of your television to drink in the sweet ordinariness of a game being broadcast live, irrespective of your preferred code.</p><p>Which is completely understandable, though we should all keep an honest timeline tracking our gradual abandonment of relief at the return of sport in favour of general unhappiness with the quality of what's on show.</p><p>But how exactly will you consume sport when it returns?</p><p>No more than other traditional media outlets, broadcasters are now under huge pressure. But unlike other areas, there are big beasts lurking just out of picture who may now slide in to replace those outlets.</p><p>Big tech companies have the resources to challenge terrestrial and non-terrestrial broadcasters when sports rights come up for discussion, and that was true long before the economic downturn expected on the back of the pandemic and lockdown. Now the playing field has been tilted significantly in favour of the likes of Amazon and Facebook.</p><p>Amazon, for instance, has a clear interest in sports content as a way to drive subscribers to its various streaming platforms: One of those, Twitch, is still raking in millions of viewers because it specialises in e-sports, which are unaffected by the strictures on social distancing.</p><p>The attraction of e-sports goes far beyond the current circumstances. This is a sports outlet which is low-cost - there are no stadia which need to be built, no teams with stars, management, and support staff to be paid; no crowds to be accommodated and fed, no scheduling headaches or weather-related challenges.</p><p>Little wonder, then, that Facebook are now taking a closer look at e-sports. Only last week it announced a new upgraded platform, Tournaments, to facilitate the e-sports fans among its many devotees.</p><p>Be wary, however, because sport may be the quickest route to your data. I've raved here before about Shoshana Zuboff's book Surveillance Capitalism: That title sums up tech companies' thirst for your details and information and for monetising same.</p><p>Your login/mother's maiden name/postcode/phone digits are the precise items the tech companies want for their algorithms and advertisers, and signing in to follow your sport of choice expedites that process. If those tech behemoths choose to flex their muscles, then e-sports are just the beginning. The main field sports will be next.</p><p>Of course, you may be just fine with signing away your details. Just as you may be fine with what Wired magazine calls Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's \"14-year apology tour\" - his repeated promises to do better when his company is confronted with what Zuckerberg himself calls \"breaches of trust\".</p><p>If you think that's a little excessive, consider Zoom, the app many organisations - sports clubs included - are using to keep people connected. At the end of last month it was sued by a user for sharing data with Facebook without stating as much explicitly in its privacy policy.</p><p>You want sport to come back as soon as possible. But not at any cost, surely.</p><p>[h2]Impossible to disagree with McConville[/h2]</p><p>Ois\u00edn McConville wrote in these pages last week about the virtual Grand National being staged, with wagers being accepted by bookmakers on it.</p><p>He's a man with a deeper knowledge than me of the issues surrounding gambling and addiction, but the most compelling argument he made in his column wasn't based on inside knowledge.</p><p>\"The truth is that while everyone else toed the line,\" McConville wrote, \"The racing and bookmaking industry flew in the face of that.\"</p><p>Why is that, exactly?</p><p>Early in the lockdown there was a good deal of demonising young people - with their youth, their futures, their clear skin, their heedless disregard for us oldies - but there wasn't quite as much demonising the thousands who went to Cheltenham, who didn't appear to be moody, disaffected teenagers for the most part if the photographic record was a reliable one.</p><p>While it might be diverting to see someone twist themselves into rhetorical knots trying to prove horse racing fans just need to see their sport more than any other sector, that's just not going to fly.</p><p>Because of that it's impossible to counter McConville's thesis that bookmakers are happy to be part of a mockery like a virtual horse race in order to separate people from their money.</p><p>[h2]'And the attendance is...'[/h2]</p><p>A solution to the problem of empty stadia has appeared.</p><p>Robot fans.</p><p>I note that the Rakuten Monkeys have decided to fill their stadium with robots because social distancing rules preclude fans from attending their baseball games in Taiwan.</p><p>In what may be a sign for the near future of sport here, new government regulations in Taiwan only allow 200 people in the stadium at any time, and clearly the playing squads, game officials and necessary stadium staff would eat up a large proportion of that figure.</p><p>Don't fret if you're a fan keen to spend money on the team, however, because the Monkeys have also come up with a way to relieve the pressure on your wallet.</p><p>They're offering a new way for you to 'attend' a game - a cardboard cut-out with a photograph of your face on it will be put in a seat at a cost of approximately  180 for four pictures.</p><p>If this is adopted by Irish sporting bodies I demand a cut of the proceeds.</p><p>[h2]Treat yourself to the wonder of Winslow[/h2]</p><p>I've popped up here in the past with my enthusiasm for Don Winslow.</p><p>One of his more recent books, The Force, is an all-time great read if your taste runs to pacy New York cop thrillers (which is just a longer way of saying you have good taste).</p><p>He has a new book out, Broken, which is a little different to its predecessors in that it's a collection of six novellas.</p><p>This in itself is a recommendation, given the need for reading material in our current situation, but if you need further persuasion, consider this as an opening line to one of the novellas, The San Diego Zoo: \"No one knows how the chimp got the revolver.\"</p><p>That story's dedicated to Elmore Leonard.</p><p>He couldn't have begun it any better.</p><p>[readmore]993499[/readmore]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRKNEW-993713</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRKNEW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YN7-C911-F0BB-S2KK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315462</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1180\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

That\u2019s a pity. The higher and longer the boom, the more who get sucked up in it.   It had seemed September was bringing a smidgeon of sense to the momentum mania that propelled \u201ctech\u201d stocks here and elsewhere to record highs in August, prices so high that they dragged the overall  S&amp;P500 index with them.   And it still might be \u2013 dead cat bounces are to be expected as a bubble bursts \u2013 or the fever could continue.   It\u2019s not possible to predict irrational behaviour, other than to know at some stage it will unravel.   While the headlines have been full of the American tech sector\u2019s dizzying surge, it was a surprise for me to see that Australia\u2019s fledgling tech index was the world\u2019s best performed by a very long way since the March COVID bottom.     As the Ophir Asset Management co-founders Andrew Mitchell and Stephen Ng explained in their latest newsletter covering last month: \u201cMuch of this can be attributed to Afterpay rising a staggering +927% over this period; though Nearmap (+250%), Codan (+176%), EML Payments (155%), Megaport (+151%), Data#3 (+137%) and Wisetech (+135%), Appen (+99%) and NextDC (+75%) have shown the Australian IT market is not a one-trick pony during the market recovery.\u201d   Well, maybe not one trick, but heavily reliant on the Afterpay game.   At Thursday\u2019s close of $75.63 a share, it has dropped 21 per cent from its $95.97 August high \u2013 but still has a market capitalisation of $21.5 billion.   That\u2019s, um, pretty amazing for a company that lost $23 million in the past financial year and had EBITDA (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation) of just $44 million.  The share price is based on momentum \u2013 it\u2019s going up because it\u2019s going up \u2013 and the blue sky potential of the company rolling out its consumer finance product unimpeded.   The share price is based on momentum \u2013 it\u2019s going up because it\u2019s going up \u2013 and the blue sky potential of the company rolling out its consumer finance product unimpeded.   (Since I last mentioned Afterpay in these pages , NAB has launched a no-interest, no-fee credit card aimed squarely at Afterpay\u2019s target market, an indication of competition to come.   And ahead, when the Reserve Bank resumes normal work, is the likelihood of merchants being allowed to pass on the high fees Afterpay charges them. At present, in something rather like retail price maintenance, merchants are forbidden to do so.)     But Australia\u2019s little tech sector doesn\u2019t add up to a hill of beans in this crazy world, also known as the US market where Apple\u2019s market cap last month was greater than the entire value of the FTSE 100 \u2013 the largest 100 UK companies.   British market veteran and commentator Anthony Peters has been watching the tech show with all the scepticism of those who have seen these sorts of movies before, albeit always with acknowledgement of the John Maynard Keynes quote: \u201cMarkets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\u201d   Ahead of Wednesday night\u2019s bounce, Mr Peters observed: \u201cOn August 19th Apple broke through the $US2 trillion market cap. Since then it has handed back $US325 billion or, looked at a different way, the equivalent of the sum total of its projected 2021 revenues or one and a half times the market cap of the newly anointed Dow component Salesforce.  \u201cThis is a great time for playing with silly numbers. The Big Six were collectively worth around $US5 trillion at the beginning of the year. At their peak a week ago today that number had risen to $US8.2 trillion. As at close of business last night that figure had shrunk to $US7.1 trillion.   \u201cSo even after the great September swoon they are still worth over $US2 trillion more than they had been at New Year.   \u201cOptimists see an overdue correction and a probable buying opportunity. Pessimists smell blood and the beginning of the end for the great countercyclical stock bubble. One of them might be right.\u201d   And then there\u2019s Tesla, for which Mr Peters has what you might call a special regard: \u201cMeanwhile Tesla, the bedroom-bound, top-knot sporting geek\u2019s favourite toy, took a 21.06% \u2013 not joking \u2013 hit yesterday to close down $US88.11 at $U330.21. On Tuesday the stock had closed at $US502.49.   \u201cThat said, a year ago you could have bought it at just over $US43 so who\u2019s the fool?   \u201cAt the time of writing it had dropped further to $US324.15.\u2019\u2019  Entrepreneur Elon Musk used his SpaceX rocket to launch his Tesla on a course to Mars. Photo: AAP/SpaceX  Among the stunts pulled by Tesla founder Elon Musk has been sending one of his cars (minus the expensive heavy bits) into orbit around Mars.   Tesla\u2019s share price has departed further from the company\u2019s expected earnings than that car has from Earth.   It is simply not possible to imagine Tesla earning enough profit in a reasonable lifetime to repay the top prices for its shares.   That\u2019s the way capitalism was supposed to work \u2013 companies earned profits to reward shareholders for taking equity \u2013 but that goes out the window when the game is on. The game is called \u201cthe greater fool\u201d.   Tesla is not like the Big Six tech giants, the FAANGM made up of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google and Microsoft.   Unlike many of the Dot.Bomb stars, they are big companies with real businesses and big profits , albeit in the case of Netflix helped by some generous accounting.   (Tesla surprised the market by actually reporting profit in the latest quarter \u2013 $US104 million \u2013 when a loss was expected. But that profit was on sales of $US6 billion and thanks to regulatory credits. Its market cap is \u201conly\u201d $US341 billion. The price/earnings ratio is too ridiculous to bother calculating.)  Aside from momentum, the greater fool game and money being as good as free while central banks are running the printing presses hard, the justification for buying Big Tech is that it is supposed to be less subject to the economic damage caused by the pandemic.   As Gavekal Research summarised it: \u201cWith millions working from home, forced to seek their entertainment from the sofa and obliged to do their shopping over the internet, Big Tech has been the big winner from COVID-19.   \u201cIn a world where the biggest fear of investors is that policymakers will decide once again to lock down entire populations, the stocks of Big Tech (and health care) are the obvious anti-fragile assets of choice.\u201d   On the other hand, Big Tech is priced to perfection. Like our little Afterpay, it is possible to imagine regulatory hurdles down the track.   No, not like the Australian government\u2019s attempted heist, as Crikey\u2019s Bernard Keane has described the plan to steal money primarily for the benefit of News Corp and Nine Entertainment , but first by a co-ordinated international effort to tax them fairly and, secondly, by reinserting fangs into US anti-trust law and enforcement.   Both are a way off \u2013 they would require a responsible US government to start with \u2013 but they are closer than Mars.   In the meantime, there\u2019s the game.   A worry is that there are many rookies playing along at home \u2013 people with little or no market experience who think trading is easy, based on their experience since the March low. That hasn\u2019t been the real world.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Is legendary too much of a - </p><p>MICHAEL PRICE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MFP INVESTORS LLC: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: - should I not say legendary?</p><p>PRICE: So are you.</p><p>KEENE: Good to see you.</p><p>PRICE: Good to see you.</p><p>KEENE: Let's just start with the state of value investing. When you  wake up in the morning, is there a lot of value out there or was that so  2009?</p><p>PRICE: There are pockets. There are pockets. Yesterday we had a big  day, so, you know, it closed that gap. But, yes, we are finding some things  to do. When you see mergers announced at 40 percent premiums to where  stocks are trading like Del Monte, Baldor Electric, right?</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: It tells you there is still value out there.</p><p>KEENE: And the mergers it just seems to pick up. In talking to  Jonathan Keehner on our M&amp;A team, they are enthused about having fun in  2011. Does it just keep rolling here with an economic recovery?</p><p>PRICE: It keeps rolling until some investment bank puts up a bridge  loan and they cannot place it. Then all of a sudden it grinds to a halt. It  starts rolling until there is a problem in -</p><p>KEENE: Okay. Let's - </p><p>PRICE: So some of these are being announced with bridge loans.</p><p>KEENE: Yes, let's look at the \"dreaded first chart\" here. Michael  Price with us here. This is Jason Trennert's chart from Strategas. I'll  steal from anyone, Michael. This is a Jason chart. This is the Nasdaq 100  to the S&amp;P 500, growth back in vogue. Do you find value in what you and I  perceive is value? Or do you find value in growth?</p><p>PRICE: Both. You know, we are long some growthy kind of stocks.</p><p>KEENE: Give me some examples.</p><p>PRICE: We're long some e-Bay. And if you back out the cash, you back  out their value in Skype, and you look at the two parts of e-Bay, I mean  you can make an argument that it is pretty cheap and that is a growthy  stock.</p><p>KEENE: Casey, make up an e-Bay chart going back at least 15 years, 20  years, whatever. Just see what you can do with that.</p><p>Look at this chart. This is great. Emily, thanks for bringing this up.</p><p>PRICE: 3PAR, 3PAR up.</p><p>KEENE: Were you an owner?</p><p>PRICE: No, hold on. We own a comparable - </p><p>KEENE: Okay.</p><p>PRICE: - that is actually privately owned ConneXium. 3PAR is in the  storage business, and Compellent, Epsilon, and 3PAR were taken over at huge  numbers - Compellent not yet, but it probably will be - at seven times, ten  times revenues.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>PRICE: Fifty, 60 times earnings. Crazy numbers. By guys like EMC, Joe  Tucci, and others who really don't care. Another billion here or there  doesn't really matter to them.</p><p>KEENE: Yes, that's the way I am.</p><p>PRICE: But, you know, the valuations are crazy.</p><p>KEENE: And you look at 3PAR, and the reason I put this up, look at  this chart. I had to get my bow tie straight.</p><p>PRICE: Well, we're very well aware of it.</p><p>KEENE: I wore this red - this is a Red Sox bow tie.</p><p>PRICE: I wore my Yankee -</p><p>KEENE: You wore your Yankee - that's good. You wore - did you see  that? I have the dumb red bow tie. You've got - put that ring up again,  let's look at that. Get in here for a close up. I'm proud that you're  wearing that ring.</p><p>PRICE: (Inaudible) it's about to sign (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: What's Jeter doing?</p><p>PRICE: Derek Jeter.</p><p>KEENE: What's he going to do?</p><p>PRICE: Well, I understand that he has got a very fair offer on the  table.</p><p>KEENE: Okay.</p><p>PRICE: So it should be taken. But we'll see -</p><p>KEENE: Well, let's - back to 3PAR. Back to investment. Over on the  right side of this chart is the game theory here involved, where two  players, three players get involved. When you are a value owner, that is  your dream.</p><p>PRICE: That's the dream. You have a bid for a company. If someone else  came into Del Monte because of the pet food business, which is the key, you  know, off to the races. If someone comes in - Boone Pickens as a part Exco  with a group - </p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>PRICE: - if someone else shows up, it is off to the races.</p><p>KEENE: And what you do, you are known for careful analysis, not just  going in quickly, careful analysis.</p><p>PRICE: We do a little work.</p><p>KEENE: Do you look at the strategic -</p><p>PRICE: Sure.</p><p>KEENE: - selections down the road, the companies that would come in?</p><p>PRICE: Absolutely. Strategic is better than financial, right? You want  a strategic buyer. The ABB bid for Baldor, which owns Reliance Electric, is  strategic. They market together. They will promote together. They  manufacture together. That is strategic. That is a better buyer than a KKR.</p><p>KEENE: Let's look at a disaster - M&amp;A sale Alcatel-Lucent. This has  been a train wreck since time began. I'm going -</p><p>PRICE: It still is.</p><p>KEENE: - to be polite and not ask if you own this dog up there.</p><p>PRICE: No, we were never involved.</p><p>KEENE: But how does this happen?</p><p>PRICE: I cannot help you there. We were not involved.</p><p>KEENE: You were not involved, but when you look at dinosaurs mating as  some would say, but  in my language a lot of people have written about  this.</p><p>PRICE: Yes, but out of Alcatel-Lucent, we will get involved when they  spin something off that is going to be too cheap. So these companies  reinvent themselves numerous ways, and Wall Street stands in there to make  markets and new securities. </p><p>You know, we have spin offs every day. We had an IPO today of  something called FXCM that came out of the Refco bankruptcy. I mean that  was an interesting situation, a currency trading firm.</p><p>KEENE: Which sector is the most attractive right now? Everybody is  telling me technology, technology, technology. Where are you?</p><p>PRICE: Well, tech is interesting. We are not big tech players. I think  natural gas is pretty interesting. Between the shale plays and regular gas  producers, gas has lagged oil quite a bit.</p><p>KEENE: Where will the market in general go next year?</p><p>PRICE: Stocks? I have no idea.</p><p>KEENE: You don't really care, do you?</p><p>PRICE: I don't like the bond market.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: And gold is a bubble, and I don't like the ten year. But stocks  in general are reasonable here. I think there are a few pockets of  cheapness, but here and there they are where they should be.</p><p>KEENE: Michael Price with us, folks. We're going to come back and  continue our discussion with Mr. Price about M&amp;A into next year. </p><p>12:06</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>12:10</p><p>KEENE: Michael Price with me. He has been bragging about his New York  Yankees World Series Championship, King of the World ring. Thank you for  bringing that in.</p><p>Wheat - here's an exogenous event. Wheat surges on drought. Do you  just stay focused on 20 or 40 or 50 stocks, or do you care about the stuff  I babble about all day?</p><p>PRICE: No, we don't do the macro, but we look at hundreds of stocks. A  lot more than 20 or 40.</p><p>KEENE: Global macro seems to be the vogue now -</p><p>PRICE: Yes, but that's not what we do.</p><p>KEENE: - with hedge fund resisting.</p><p>PRICE: That's not what we do.</p><p>KEENE: Is it global macro is right, and then they get it wrong and  everybody goes back to playing (inaudible), classic long/short.</p><p>PRICE: Yes, I'm excited in that they are global. They are going away  from the U.S. market. Let them go into Brazil. That gives me more things to  do here, less competition I think. Let them get distracted.</p><p>KEENE: Talk about the American malaise, the idea that America is not  doing that well and that you see this wall of worry, recovery in equities.</p><p>PRICE: Right.</p><p>KEENE: And, you know -</p><p>PRICE: It is last spring and summer. I mean it was everybody was so  skeptical and yet you have this fantastic economy that is slowly churning  ahead. The car loadings at Berkshire Hathaway, Burlington Northern reported  were very impressive.</p><p>KEENE: Phenomenal, yes.</p><p>PRICE: The truck tons that they report are very impressive. The  economy is churning around.</p><p>KEENE: Emily, go the Goldman Sachs note, please, if you would. This is  the \"note of the day.\" And we're going to go to the note of the day here,  folks, we rip up the script. We do that all the time. Drives them nuts in  the control room. Goldman Sachs global research, this is Jim O'Neill's  former desk, room to grow. We expect the most significant shift to take  place in the U.S. Four percent 2012.</p><p>PRICE: But it is the valuations. You know, here you can buy at low  teens multiples terrific U.S. worldwide and U.S. companies participate in  it with better regulation I think here than around the world. So I think it  is not only better, but cheaper here.</p><p>KEENE: Let's keep Goldman Sachs up here just because we brought up the  note. Here is the stock. Is big Wall Street going to lead the way? Or do  you -</p><p>PRICE: I think it is so interesting.</p><p>KEENE: - believe the boutiques are going to do it?</p><p>PRICE: I am going to tell you I think some boutiques are set up very  well. The Greenhills of the world are terrific. They are focused. </p><p>Other boutiques have conflicts. You know, Cowen runs something called  Ramius. Cowen is trying to get investment banking business at the same time  Ramius is doing hostile 13Ds against some of the companies. It doesn't make  sense.</p><p>Goldman should split up into three parts. They should have money  management, trading, and investment banking. Investment banking requires  little or no equity. Money management little or no equity. They plow some  equity into the trading business -</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: - and spin off the big dividend.</p><p>KEENE: Okay, this is very explicit right here. This is important.  We're going to stay on this. Forget about the rest of the stuff. Goldman  Sachs, let's start again. </p><p>PRICE: We own the stock.</p><p>KEENE: Should they be - you own the stock.</p><p>PRICE: We own the stock. The stock -</p><p>KEENE: There's the chart up here, folks.</p><p>PRICE: The stock is reasonably priced. It is a terrific business,  okay? And I remember watching Fidelity, the big mutual fund company, back  when everything went well for them in the eighties and nineties, got too  big. And I said to them why don't you split up into three, four parts. A  bond fund, equity, this and that.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>PRICE: They never did and they kind of languished in the last ten  years.</p><p>KEENE: Did you go long the day of the testimony?</p><p>PRICE: We traded in the stock, yes.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: When you look at Goldman Sachs, the first step is should they  stay a bank or do they go - do they leave the banking number all over  government.</p><p>PRICE: I think they should become three entities which requires one  being a bank. You know, the trading - they have a trading business. They  have a banking business and a money management business. They do not have  to be together. They can free up capital. They can get higher valuations. I  think the stock would be $250 if they did that.</p><p>KEENE: Let's go back to the little banks. You mentioned Greenhill  before. I think of Evercore, what Altman is doing there.</p><p>PRICE: Another one.</p><p>KEENE: There is an independence there. Are they getting the smartest  people?</p><p>PRICE: Some of them are getting very good people, sure. Cowen has been  hiring good people. And buried inside of the biggest bank - Bank of America  - is Merrill. When they start hitting on all cylinders, getting past the  mortgage put back mess, Bank of America is a powerful franchise.</p><p>KEENE: Is Morgan -</p><p>PRICE: And people forget that they own Merrill -</p><p>KEENE: Is Morgan Stanley strapped because of all these broker deal  mortgages?</p><p>PRICE: Yes, Morgan Stanley has got other issues, sure they do.</p><p>KEENE: They've got other issues.</p><p>PRICE: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: Let's go back here. Could you bring up e-Bay, Emily? I know we  are throwing it around here with Michael Price, but let's bring up e-Bay. I  am surprised you mentioned this name. They're working on it back in the  control room. They've got to get the gerbil going to bring it up.</p><p>PRICE: Right.</p><p>KEENE: There it is. They fed the gerbil, good. </p><p>Okay, e-Bay back a decade, I'm going to be blunt. IPO up it goes.</p><p>PRICE: Right.</p><p>KEENE: Stupid price, and it has gone nowhere. Is that a safe summary?</p><p>PRICE: Well, it has gone from $12 to $29.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: And at $12 bucks where we kind of got involved - $12 and $15 I  think it was, I mean we were paying under ten times earnings for their  basic business, getting other stuff for free. They did not go sell a slug  of the Skype.</p><p>And their Paypal business is going to be probably one of the most  valuable businesses going forward. Everybody wants to get into electronic  trunk funds transfer -</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>PRICE: - secure electronic funds transfer. </p><p>KEENE: Well -</p><p>PRICE: VeriFone is doing it. VeriFone stock has been a rocket this  year. It will continue to go. e-Bay I think is really interesting.</p><p>KEENE: Sheila Dharmarajan was out here the other night - yesterday,  rather, talking up NetFlix. When you see the silliness of NetFlix, can you  distill that down? Is it a profit model you can stay with?</p><p>PRICE: I don't know.</p><p>KEENE: You have not looked at it?</p><p>PRICE: I don't know.</p><p>KEENE: When you looked at e-Bay I thought maybe you'd look at -</p><p>PRICE: That was -</p><p>KEENE: Give me another name. What else are you looking at besides e- Bay?</p><p>PRICE: Well, we own some big industrials. You know, we still own our  Ingersoll Rand, which I like a lot.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: We do some other parts today. It is getting pretty full, but if  you have some growth going forward, it is a cheap stock. The balance sheet  has gotten much better as they have paid down debt.</p><p>KEENE: I see Emerson Electric with 57 percent global. It is amazing  these industrials how they have gone global.</p><p>PRICE: And you can get a big currency benefit, too. </p><p>KEENE: Let's look at Colgate Palmolive here. I want to talk to Michael  Price about investing 101 here. We're going to bring up Colgate, which is  has just done great for ten and 12 years. </p><p>Not your kind of stock, but this goes back to the people that aren't  Michael Price. How do you know when to sell? Or do you just go with buy and  hold if you not as sophisticated?</p><p>PRICE: Selling is much tougher. You know, I think you buy things when  things are 30 or 40 percent below what you think the asset value is.  Selling it is very hard to tell. So we tend to dribble them out slowly as  they move up.</p><p>KEENE: As they move up -</p><p>PRICE: I don't know the valuation of Colgate so I cannot help you  there.</p><p>KEENE: No, I understand the valuation of Colgate. I just brought it up  with this, you know, buy and hold strategy. We are seeing so many  individual investors really looking at dividend reinvestment as an  important way to go.</p><p>PRICE: Right.</p><p>KEENE: I mean you don't care about that. It is much more strategic.</p><p>PRICE: There are some large cap - Microsoft is one, IBM is one,  Johnson &amp; Johnson - where good investors have made the arguments that these  are very cheap, 12, 13 times earnings, with a dividend yield of three or  four percent. And they are right. They are basically right. These stocks  are pretty cheap looking over a decade.</p><p>KEENE: When you look at this, what is your single message for 2011?</p><p>PRICE: I think you have to be constructive. I think you have to look  at - you know, that this economy is going to do better even in spite of  somewhat higher interest rates.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>PRICE: You are going to churn ahead and I think you will find  opportunities, so you have got to pay attention.</p><p>KEENE: I want to talk another sector. You mentioned the U.S. field,  you are not looking abroad.</p><p>PRICE: No.</p><p>KEENE: You are using the U.S. component -</p><p>PRICE: Sure.</p><p>KEENE: - placed abroad. When you look at the dollar filtering in  there, that has got to benefit some people here almost either way. I mean  the U.S. is doing better than Europe, aren't they?</p><p>PRICE: Yes, the U.S. is going to do better. I think the problems in  Europe are the PIIGS and they may be spreading a little bit. You know, we  have that further out, so I think the focus will be on them first hurting  the euro. And then unfortunately helping the dollar, which won't be that  good in the short term.</p><p>KEENE: Humility is a big part of this. What is the biggest mistake you  have made? I don't mean like the specific story, but philosophically in  investment what is the thing that got you into the most hot water?</p><p>PRICE: Oh, probably getting into large positions where you really  cannot exit. You know -</p><p>KEENE: Too big a position.</p><p>PRICE: - you are the lead guy and, yes, I mean -</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: - Sunbeam Oster comes to mind from way back.</p><p>KEENE: Show me that ring again. We've got to get one more look at  this, Victor. Get in. Move the coffee cup. Victor, bring it right in here.  Look - look at that. That is amazing.</p><p>PRICE: That's the 27th one the Yankees have given out to players.</p><p>KEENE: I've got my Mickey Mantle belt buckle on, but -</p><p>PRICE: There you go. Now we're talking.</p><p>KEENE: - I'm not going to show it right here. A Mickey Mantle belt  buckle, I saw him steal second base once at Fenway Park. That was great. </p><p>We've got to go. Michael Price, thank you so much. </p><p>12:18</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Is legendary too much of a -</p><p>MICHAEL PRICE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MFP INVESTORS LLC: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: - should I not say legendary?</p><p>PRICE: So are you.</p><p>KEENE: Good to see you.</p><p>PRICE: Good to see you.</p><p>KEENE: Let's just start with the state of value investing. When you wake up in the morning, is there a lot of value out there or was that so 2009?</p><p>PRICE: There are pockets. There are pockets. Yesterday we had a big day, so, you know, it closed that gap. But, yes, we are finding some things to do. When you see mergers announced at 40 percent premiums to where stocks are trading like Del Monte, Baldor Electric, right?</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: It tells you there is still value out there.</p><p>KEENE: And the mergers it just seems to pick up. In talking to Jonathan Keehner on our M&amp;A team, they are enthused about having fun in 2011. Does it just keep rolling here with an economic recovery?</p><p>PRICE: It keeps rolling until some investment bank puts up a bridge loan and they cannot place it. Then all of a sudden it grinds to a halt. It starts rolling until there is a problem in -</p><p>KEENE: Okay. Let's -</p><p>PRICE: So some of these are being announced with bridge loans.</p><p>KEENE: Yes, let's look at the \"dreaded first chart\" here. Michael Price with us here. This is Jason Trennert's chart from Strategas. I'll steal from anyone, Michael. This is a Jason chart. This is the Nasdaq 100 to the S&amp;P 500, growth back in vogue. Do you find value in what you and I perceive is value? Or do you find value in growth?</p><p>PRICE: Both. You know, we are long some growthy kind of stocks.</p><p>KEENE: Give me some examples.</p><p>PRICE: We're long some e-Bay. And if you back out the cash, you back out their value in Skype, and you look at the two parts of e-Bay, I mean you can make an argument that it is pretty cheap and that is a growthy stock.</p><p>KEENE: Casey, make up an e-Bay chart going back at least 15 years, 20 years, whatever. Just see what you can do with that.</p><p>Look at this chart. This is great. Emily, thanks for bringing this up.</p><p>PRICE: 3PAR, 3PAR up.</p><p>KEENE: Were you an owner?</p><p>PRICE: No, hold on. We own a comparable -</p><p>KEENE: Okay.</p><p>PRICE: - that is actually privately owned ConneXium. 3PAR is in the storage business, and Compellent, Epsilon, and 3PAR were taken over at huge numbers - Compellent not yet, but it probably will be - at seven times, ten times revenues.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>PRICE: Fifty, 60 times earnings. Crazy numbers. By guys like EMC, Joe Tucci, and others who really don't care. Another billion here or there doesn't really matter to them.</p><p>KEENE: Yes, that's the way I am.</p><p>PRICE: But, you know, the valuations are crazy.</p><p>KEENE: And you look at 3PAR, and the reason I put this up, look at this chart. I had to get my bow tie straight.</p><p>PRICE: Well, we're very well aware of it.</p><p>KEENE: I wore this red - this is a Red Sox bow tie.</p><p>PRICE: I wore my Yankee -</p><p>KEENE: You wore your Yankee - that's good. You wore - did you see that? I have the dumb red bow tie. You've got - put that ring up again, let's look at that. Get in here for a close up. I'm proud that you're wearing that ring.</p><p>PRICE: (Inaudible) it's about to sign (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: What's Jeter doing?</p><p>PRICE: Derek Jeter.</p><p>KEENE: What's he going to do?</p><p>PRICE: Well, I understand that he has got a very fair offer on the table.</p><p>KEENE: Okay.</p><p>PRICE: So it should be taken. But we'll see -</p><p>KEENE: Well, let's - back to 3PAR. Back to investment. Over on the right side of this chart is the game theory here involved, where two players, three players get involved. When you are a value owner, that is your dream.</p><p>PRICE: That's the dream. You have a bid for a company. If someone else came into Del Monte because of the pet food business, which is the key, you know, off to the races. If someone comes in - Boone Pickens as a part Exco with a group -</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>PRICE: - if someone else shows up, it is off to the races.</p><p>KEENE: And what you do, you are known for careful analysis, not just going in quickly, careful analysis.</p><p>PRICE: We do a little work.</p><p>KEENE: Do you look at the strategic -</p><p>PRICE: Sure.</p><p>KEENE: - selections down the road, the companies that would come in?</p><p>PRICE: Absolutely. Strategic is better than financial, right? You want a strategic buyer. The ABB bid for Baldor, which owns Reliance Electric, is strategic. They market together. They will promote together. They manufacture together. That is strategic. That is a better buyer than a KKR.</p><p>KEENE: Let's look at a disaster - M&amp;A sale Alcatel-Lucent. This has been a train wreck since time began. I'm going -</p><p>PRICE: It still is.</p><p>KEENE: - to be polite and not ask if you own this dog up there.</p><p>PRICE: No, we were never involved.</p><p>KEENE: But how does this happen?</p><p>PRICE: I cannot help you there. We were not involved.</p><p>KEENE: You were not involved, but when you look at dinosaurs mating as some would say, but in my language a lot of people have written about this.</p><p>PRICE: Yes, but out of Alcatel-Lucent, we will get involved when they spin something off that is going to be too cheap. So these companies reinvent themselves numerous ways, and Wall Street stands in there to make markets and new securities.</p><p>You know, we have spin offs every day. We had an IPO today of something called FXCM that came out of the Refco bankruptcy. I mean that was an interesting situation, a currency trading firm.</p><p>KEENE: Which sector is the most attractive right now? Everybody is telling me technology, technology, technology. Where are you?</p><p>PRICE: Well, tech is interesting. We are not big tech players. I think natural gas is pretty interesting. Between the shale plays and regular gas producers, gas has lagged oil quite a bit.</p><p>KEENE: Where will the market in general go next year?</p><p>PRICE: Stocks? I have no idea.</p><p>KEENE: You don't really care, do you?</p><p>PRICE: I don't like the bond market.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: And gold is a bubble, and I don't like the ten year. But stocks in general are reasonable here. I think there are a few pockets of cheapness, but here and there they are where they should be.</p><p>KEENE: Michael Price with us, folks. We're going to come back and continue our discussion with Mr. Price about M&amp;A into next year.</p><p>12:06</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>12:10</p><p>KEENE: Michael Price with me. He has been bragging about his New York Yankees World Series Championship, King of the World ring. Thank you for bringing that in.</p><p>Wheat - here's an exogenous event. Wheat surges on drought. Do you just stay focused on 20 or 40 or 50 stocks, or do you care about the stuff I babble about all day?</p><p>PRICE: No, we don't do the macro, but we look at hundreds of stocks. A lot more than 20 or 40.</p><p>KEENE: Global macro seems to be the vogue now -</p><p>PRICE: Yes, but that's not what we do.</p><p>KEENE: - with hedge fund resisting.</p><p>PRICE: That's not what we do.</p><p>KEENE: Is it global macro is right, and then they get it wrong and everybody goes back to playing (inaudible), classic long/short.</p><p>PRICE: Yes, I'm excited in that they are global. They are going away from the U.S. market. Let them go into Brazil. That gives me more things to do here, less competition I think. Let them get distracted.</p><p>KEENE: Talk about the American malaise, the idea that America is not doing that well and that you see this wall of worry, recovery in equities.</p><p>PRICE: Right.</p><p>KEENE: And, you know -</p><p>PRICE: It is last spring and summer. I mean it was everybody was so skeptical and yet you have this fantastic economy that is slowly churning ahead. The car loadings at Berkshire Hathaway, Burlington Northern reported were very impressive.</p><p>KEENE: Phenomenal, yes.</p><p>PRICE: The truck tons that they report are very impressive. The economy is churning around.</p><p>KEENE: Emily, go the Goldman Sachs note, please, if you would. This is the \"note of the day.\" And we're going to go to the note of the day here, folks, we rip up the script. We do that all the time. Drives them nuts in the control room. Goldman Sachs global research, this is Jim O'Neill's former desk, room to grow. We expect the most significant shift to take place in the U.S. Four percent 2012.</p><p>PRICE: But it is the valuations. You know, here you can buy at low teens multiples terrific U.S. worldwide and U.S. companies participate in it with better regulation I think here than around the world. So I think it is not only better, but cheaper here.</p><p>KEENE: Let's keep Goldman Sachs up here just because we brought up the note. Here is the stock. Is big Wall Street going to lead the way? Or do you -</p><p>PRICE: I think it is so interesting.</p><p>KEENE: - believe the boutiques are going to do it?</p><p>PRICE: I am going to tell you I think some boutiques are set up very well. The Greenhills of the world are terrific. They are focused.</p><p>Other boutiques have conflicts. You know, Cowen runs something called Ramius. Cowen is trying to get investment banking business at the same time Ramius is doing hostile 13Ds against some of the companies. It doesn't make sense.</p><p>Goldman should split up into three parts. They should have money management, trading, and investment banking. Investment banking requires little or no equity. Money management little or no equity. They plow some equity into the trading business -</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: - and spin off the big dividend.</p><p>KEENE: Okay, this is very explicit right here. This is important. We're going to stay on this. Forget about the rest of the stuff. Goldman Sachs, let's start again.</p><p>PRICE: We own the stock.</p><p>KEENE: Should they be - you own the stock.</p><p>PRICE: We own the stock. The stock -</p><p>KEENE: There's the chart up here, folks.</p><p>PRICE: The stock is reasonably priced. It is a terrific business, okay? And I remember watching Fidelity, the big mutual fund company, back when everything went well for them in the eighties and nineties, got too big. And I said to them why don't you split up into three, four parts. A bond fund, equity, this and that.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>PRICE: They never did and they kind of languished in the last ten years.</p><p>KEENE: Did you go long the day of the testimony?</p><p>PRICE: We traded in the stock, yes.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: When you look at Goldman Sachs, the first step is should they stay a bank or do they go - do they leave the banking number all over government.</p><p>PRICE: I think they should become three entities which requires one being a bank. You know, the trading - they have a trading business. They have a banking business and a money management business. They do not have to be together. They can free up capital. They can get higher valuations. I think the stock would be $250 if they did that.</p><p>KEENE: Let's go back to the little banks. You mentioned Greenhill before. I think of Evercore, what Altman is doing there.</p><p>PRICE: Another one.</p><p>KEENE: There is an independence there. Are they getting the smartest people?</p><p>PRICE: Some of them are getting very good people, sure. Cowen has been hiring good people. And buried inside of the biggest bank - Bank of America - is Merrill. When they start hitting on all cylinders, getting past the mortgage put back mess, Bank of America is a powerful franchise.</p><p>KEENE: Is Morgan -</p><p>PRICE: And people forget that they own Merrill -</p><p>KEENE: Is Morgan Stanley strapped because of all these broker deal mortgages?</p><p>PRICE: Yes, Morgan Stanley has got other issues, sure they do.</p><p>KEENE: They've got other issues.</p><p>PRICE: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: Let's go back here. Could you bring up e-Bay, Emily? I know we are throwing it around here with Michael Price, but let's bring up e-Bay. I am surprised you mentioned this name. They're working on it back in the control room. They've got to get the gerbil going to bring it up.</p><p>PRICE: Right.</p><p>KEENE: There it is. They fed the gerbil, good.</p><p>Okay, e-Bay back a decade, I'm going to be blunt. IPO up it goes.</p><p>PRICE: Right.</p><p>KEENE: Stupid price, and it has gone nowhere. Is that a safe summary?</p><p>PRICE: Well, it has gone from $12 to $29.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: And at $12 bucks where we kind of got involved - $12 and $15 I think it was, I mean we were paying under ten times earnings for their basic business, getting other stuff for free. They did not go sell a slug of the Skype.</p><p>And their Paypal business is going to be probably one of the most valuable businesses going forward. Everybody wants to get into electronic trunk funds transfer -</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>PRICE: - secure electronic funds transfer.</p><p>KEENE: Well -</p><p>PRICE: VeriFone is doing it. VeriFone stock has been a rocket this year. It will continue to go. e-Bay I think is really interesting.</p><p>KEENE: Sheila Dharmarajan was out here the other night - yesterday, rather, talking up NetFlix. When you see the silliness of NetFlix, can you distill that down? Is it a profit model you can stay with?</p><p>PRICE: I don't know.</p><p>KEENE: You have not looked at it?</p><p>PRICE: I don't know.</p><p>KEENE: When you looked at e-Bay I thought maybe you'd look at -</p><p>PRICE: That was -</p><p>KEENE: Give me another name. What else are you looking at besides e- Bay?</p><p>PRICE: Well, we own some big industrials. You know, we still own our Ingersoll Rand, which I like a lot.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: We do some other parts today. It is getting pretty full, but if you have some growth going forward, it is a cheap stock. The balance sheet has gotten much better as they have paid down debt.</p><p>KEENE: I see Emerson Electric with 57 percent global. It is amazing these industrials how they have gone global.</p><p>PRICE: And you can get a big currency benefit, too.</p><p>KEENE: Let's look at Colgate Palmolive here. I want to talk to Michael Price about investing 101 here. We're going to bring up Colgate, which is has just done great for ten and 12 years.</p><p>Not your kind of stock, but this goes back to the people that aren't Michael Price. How do you know when to sell? Or do you just go with buy and hold if you not as sophisticated?</p><p>PRICE: Selling is much tougher. You know, I think you buy things when things are 30 or 40 percent below what you think the asset value is. Selling it is very hard to tell. So we tend to dribble them out slowly as they move up.</p><p>KEENE: As they move up -</p><p>PRICE: I don't know the valuation of Colgate so I cannot help you there.</p><p>KEENE: No, I understand the valuation of Colgate. I just brought it up with this, you know, buy and hold strategy. We are seeing so many individual investors really looking at dividend reinvestment as an important way to go.</p><p>PRICE: Right.</p><p>KEENE: I mean you don't care about that. It is much more strategic.</p><p>PRICE: There are some large cap - Microsoft is one, IBM is one, Johnson &amp; Johnson - where good investors have made the arguments that these are very cheap, 12, 13 times earnings, with a dividend yield of three or four percent. And they are right. They are basically right. These stocks are pretty cheap looking over a decade.</p><p>KEENE: When you look at this, what is your single message for 2011?</p><p>PRICE: I think you have to be constructive. I think you have to look at - you know, that this economy is going to do better even in spite of somewhat higher interest rates.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>PRICE: You are going to churn ahead and I think you will find opportunities, so you have got to pay attention.</p><p>KEENE: I want to talk another sector. You mentioned the U.S. field, you are not looking abroad.</p><p>PRICE: No.</p><p>KEENE: You are using the U.S. component -</p><p>PRICE: Sure.</p><p>KEENE: - placed abroad. When you look at the dollar filtering in there, that has got to benefit some people here almost either way. I mean the U.S. is doing better than Europe, aren't they?</p><p>PRICE: Yes, the U.S. is going to do better. I think the problems in Europe are the PIIGS and they may be spreading a little bit. You know, we have that further out, so I think the focus will be on them first hurting the euro. And then unfortunately helping the dollar, which won't be that good in the short term.</p><p>KEENE: Humility is a big part of this. What is the biggest mistake you have made? I don't mean like the specific story, but philosophically in investment what is the thing that got you into the most hot water?</p><p>PRICE: Oh, probably getting into large positions where you really cannot exit. You know -</p><p>KEENE: Too big a position.</p><p>PRICE: - you are the lead guy and, yes, I mean -</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: - Sunbeam Oster comes to mind from way back.</p><p>KEENE: Show me that ring again. We've got to get one more look at this, Victor. Get in. Move the coffee cup. Victor, bring it right in here. Look - look at that. That is amazing.</p><p>PRICE: That's the 27th one the Yankees have given out to players.</p><p>KEENE: I've got my Mickey Mantle belt buckle on, but -</p><p>PRICE: There you go. Now we're talking.</p><p>KEENE: - I'm not going to show it right here. A Mickey Mantle belt buckle, I saw him steal second base once at Fenway Park. That was great.</p><p>We've got to go. Michael Price, thank you so much.</p><p>12:18</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Is legendary too much of a -</p><p>MICHAEL PRICE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MFP INVESTORS LLC: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: - should I not say legendary?</p><p>PRICE: So are you.</p><p>KEENE: Good to see you.</p><p>PRICE: Good to see you.</p><p>KEENE: Let's just start with the state of value investing. When you wake up in the morning, is there a lot of value out there or was that so 2009?</p><p>PRICE: There are pockets. There are pockets. Yesterday we had a big day, so, you know, it closed that gap. But, yes, we are finding some things to do. When you see mergers announced at 40 percent premiums to where stocks are trading like Del Monte, Baldor Electric, right?</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: It tells you there is still value out there.</p><p>KEENE: And the mergers it just seems to pick up. In talking to Jonathan Keehner on our M&amp;A team, they are enthused about having fun in 2011. Does it just keep rolling here with an economic recovery?</p><p>PRICE: It keeps rolling until some investment bank puts up a bridge loan and they cannot place it. Then all of a sudden it grinds to a halt. It starts rolling until there is a problem in -</p><p>KEENE: Okay. Let's -</p><p>PRICE: So some of these are being announced with bridge loans.</p><p>KEENE: Yes, let's look at the \"dreaded first chart\" here. Michael Price with us here. This is Jason Trennert's chart from Strategas. I'll steal from anyone, Michael. This is a Jason chart. This is the Nasdaq 100 to the S&amp;P 500, growth back in vogue. Do you find value in what you and I perceive is value? Or do you find value in growth?</p><p>PRICE: Both. You know, we are long some growthy kind of stocks.</p><p>KEENE: Give me some examples.</p><p>PRICE: We're long some e-Bay. And if you back out the cash, you back out their value in Skype, and you look at the two parts of e-Bay, I mean you can make an argument that it is pretty cheap and that is a growthy stock.</p><p>KEENE: Casey, make up an e-Bay chart going back at least 15 years, 20 years, whatever. Just see what you can do with that.</p><p>Look at this chart. This is great. Emily, thanks for bringing this up.</p><p>PRICE: 3PAR, 3PAR up.</p><p>KEENE: Were you an owner?</p><p>PRICE: No, hold on. We own a comparable -</p><p>KEENE: Okay.</p><p>PRICE: - that is actually privately owned ConneXium. 3PAR is in the storage business, and Compellent, Epsilon, and 3PAR were taken over at huge numbers - Compellent not yet, but it probably will be - at seven times, ten times revenues.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>PRICE: Fifty, 60 times earnings. Crazy numbers. By guys like EMC, Joe Tucci, and others who really don't care. Another billion here or there doesn't really matter to them.</p><p>KEENE: Yes, that's the way I am.</p><p>PRICE: But, you know, the valuations are crazy.</p><p>KEENE: And you look at 3PAR, and the reason I put this up, look at this chart. I had to get my bow tie straight.</p><p>PRICE: Well, we're very well aware of it.</p><p>KEENE: I wore this red - this is a Red Sox bow tie.</p><p>PRICE: I wore my Yankee -</p><p>KEENE: You wore your Yankee - that's good. You wore - did you see that? I have the dumb red bow tie. You've got - put that ring up again, let's look at that. Get in here for a close up. I'm proud that you're wearing that ring.</p><p>PRICE: (Inaudible) it's about to sign (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: What's Jeter doing?</p><p>PRICE: Derek Jeter.</p><p>KEENE: What's he going to do?</p><p>PRICE: Well, I understand that he has got a very fair offer on the table.</p><p>KEENE: Okay.</p><p>PRICE: So it should be taken. But we'll see -</p><p>KEENE: Well, let's - back to 3PAR. Back to investment. Over on the right side of this chart is the game theory here involved, where two players, three players get involved. When you are a value owner, that is your dream.</p><p>PRICE: That's the dream. You have a bid for a company. If someone else came into Del Monte because of the pet food business, which is the key, you know, off to the races. If someone comes in - Boone Pickens as a part Exco with a group -</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>PRICE: - if someone else shows up, it is off to the races.</p><p>KEENE: And what you do, you are known for careful analysis, not just going in quickly, careful analysis.</p><p>PRICE: We do a little work.</p><p>KEENE: Do you look at the strategic -</p><p>PRICE: Sure.</p><p>KEENE: - selections down the road, the companies that would come in?</p><p>PRICE: Absolutely. Strategic is better than financial, right? You want a strategic buyer. The ABB bid for Baldor, which owns Reliance Electric, is strategic. They market together. They will promote together. They manufacture together. That is strategic. That is a better buyer than a KKR.</p><p>KEENE: Let's look at a disaster - M&amp;A sale Alcatel-Lucent. This has been a train wreck since time began. I'm going -</p><p>PRICE: It still is.</p><p>KEENE: - to be polite and not ask if you own this dog up there.</p><p>PRICE: No, we were never involved.</p><p>KEENE: But how does this happen?</p><p>PRICE: I cannot help you there. We were not involved.</p><p>KEENE: You were not involved, but when you look at dinosaurs mating as some would say, but in my language a lot of people have written about this.</p><p>PRICE: Yes, but out of Alcatel-Lucent, we will get involved when they spin something off that is going to be too cheap. So these companies reinvent themselves numerous ways, and Wall Street stands in there to make markets and new securities.</p><p>You know, we have spin offs every day. We had an IPO today of something called FXCM that came out of the Refco bankruptcy. I mean that was an interesting situation, a currency trading firm.</p><p>KEENE: Which sector is the most attractive right now? Everybody is telling me technology, technology, technology. Where are you?</p><p>PRICE: Well, tech is interesting. We are not big tech players. I think natural gas is pretty interesting. Between the shale plays and regular gas producers, gas has lagged oil quite a bit.</p><p>KEENE: Where will the market in general go next year?</p><p>PRICE: Stocks? I have no idea.</p><p>KEENE: You don't really care, do you?</p><p>PRICE: I don't like the bond market.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: And gold is a bubble, and I don't like the ten year. But stocks in general are reasonable here. I think there are a few pockets of cheapness, but here and there they are where they should be.</p><p>KEENE: Michael Price with us, folks. We're going to come back and continue our discussion with Mr. Price about M&amp;A into next year.</p><p>12:06</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>12:10</p><p>KEENE: Michael Price with me. He has been bragging about his New York Yankees World Series Championship, King of the World ring. Thank you for bringing that in.</p><p>Wheat - here's an exogenous event. Wheat surges on drought. Do you just stay focused on 20 or 40 or 50 stocks, or do you care about the stuff I babble about all day?</p><p>PRICE: No, we don't do the macro, but we look at hundreds of stocks. A lot more than 20 or 40.</p><p>KEENE: Global macro seems to be the vogue now -</p><p>PRICE: Yes, but that's not what we do.</p><p>KEENE: - with hedge fund resisting.</p><p>PRICE: That's not what we do.</p><p>KEENE: Is it global macro is right, and then they get it wrong and everybody goes back to playing (inaudible), classic long/short.</p><p>PRICE: Yes, I'm excited in that they are global. They are going away from the U.S. market. Let them go into Brazil. That gives me more things to do here, less competition I think. Let them get distracted.</p><p>KEENE: Talk about the American malaise, the idea that America is not doing that well and that you see this wall of worry, recovery in equities.</p><p>PRICE: Right.</p><p>KEENE: And, you know -</p><p>PRICE: It is last spring and summer. I mean it was everybody was so skeptical and yet you have this fantastic economy that is slowly churning ahead. The car loadings at Berkshire Hathaway, Burlington Northern reported were very impressive.</p><p>KEENE: Phenomenal, yes.</p><p>PRICE: The truck tons that they report are very impressive. The economy is churning around.</p><p>KEENE: Emily, go the Goldman Sachs note, please, if you would. This is the \"note of the day.\" And we're going to go to the note of the day here, folks, we rip up the script. We do that all the time. Drives them nuts in the control room. Goldman Sachs global research, this is Jim O'Neill's former desk, room to grow. We expect the most significant shift to take place in the U.S. Four percent 2012.</p><p>PRICE: But it is the valuations. You know, here you can buy at low teens multiples terrific U.S. worldwide and U.S. companies participate in it with better regulation I think here than around the world. So I think it is not only better, but cheaper here.</p><p>KEENE: Let's keep Goldman Sachs up here just because we brought up the note. Here is the stock. Is big Wall Street going to lead the way? Or do you -</p><p>PRICE: I think it is so interesting.</p><p>KEENE: - believe the boutiques are going to do it?</p><p>PRICE: I am going to tell you I think some boutiques are set up very well. The Greenhills of the world are terrific. They are focused.</p><p>Other boutiques have conflicts. You know, Cowen runs something called Ramius. Cowen is trying to get investment banking business at the same time Ramius is doing hostile 13Ds against some of the companies. It doesn't make sense.</p><p>Goldman should split up into three parts. They should have money management, trading, and investment banking. Investment banking requires little or no equity. Money management little or no equity. They plow some equity into the trading business -</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: - and spin off the big dividend.</p><p>KEENE: Okay, this is very explicit right here. This is important. We're going to stay on this. Forget about the rest of the stuff. Goldman Sachs, let's start again.</p><p>PRICE: We own the stock.</p><p>KEENE: Should they be - you own the stock.</p><p>PRICE: We own the stock. The stock -</p><p>KEENE: There's the chart up here, folks.</p><p>PRICE: The stock is reasonably priced. It is a terrific business, okay? And I remember watching Fidelity, the big mutual fund company, back when everything went well for them in the eighties and nineties, got too big. And I said to them why don't you split up into three, four parts. A bond fund, equity, this and that.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>PRICE: They never did and they kind of languished in the last ten years.</p><p>KEENE: Did you go long the day of the testimony?</p><p>PRICE: We traded in the stock, yes.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: When you look at Goldman Sachs, the first step is should they stay a bank or do they go - do they leave the banking number all over government.</p><p>PRICE: I think they should become three entities which requires one being a bank. You know, the trading - they have a trading business. They have a banking business and a money management business. They do not have to be together. They can free up capital. They can get higher valuations. I think the stock would be $250 if they did that.</p><p>KEENE: Let's go back to the little banks. You mentioned Greenhill before. I think of Evercore, what Altman is doing there.</p><p>PRICE: Another one.</p><p>KEENE: There is an independence there. Are they getting the smartest people?</p><p>PRICE: Some of them are getting very good people, sure. Cowen has been hiring good people. And buried inside of the biggest bank - Bank of America - is Merrill. When they start hitting on all cylinders, getting past the mortgage put back mess, Bank of America is a powerful franchise.</p><p>KEENE: Is Morgan -</p><p>PRICE: And people forget that they own Merrill -</p><p>KEENE: Is Morgan Stanley strapped because of all these broker deal mortgages?</p><p>PRICE: Yes, Morgan Stanley has got other issues, sure they do.</p><p>KEENE: They've got other issues.</p><p>PRICE: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: Let's go back here. Could you bring up e-Bay, Emily? I know we are throwing it around here with Michael Price, but let's bring up e-Bay. I am surprised you mentioned this name. They're working on it back in the control room. They've got to get the gerbil going to bring it up.</p><p>PRICE: Right.</p><p>KEENE: There it is. They fed the gerbil, good.</p><p>Okay, e-Bay back a decade, I'm going to be blunt. IPO up it goes.</p><p>PRICE: Right.</p><p>KEENE: Stupid price, and it has gone nowhere. Is that a safe summary?</p><p>PRICE: Well, it has gone from $12 to $29.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: And at $12 bucks where we kind of got involved - $12 and $15 I think it was, I mean we were paying under ten times earnings for their basic business, getting other stuff for free. They did not go sell a slug of the Skype.</p><p>And their Paypal business is going to be probably one of the most valuable businesses going forward. Everybody wants to get into electronic trunk funds transfer -</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>PRICE: - secure electronic funds transfer.</p><p>KEENE: Well -</p><p>PRICE: VeriFone is doing it. VeriFone stock has been a rocket this year. It will continue to go. e-Bay I think is really interesting.</p><p>KEENE: Sheila Dharmarajan was out here the other night - yesterday, rather, talking up NetFlix. When you see the silliness of NetFlix, can you distill that down? Is it a profit model you can stay with?</p><p>PRICE: I don't know.</p><p>KEENE: You have not looked at it?</p><p>PRICE: I don't know.</p><p>KEENE: When you looked at e-Bay I thought maybe you'd look at -</p><p>PRICE: That was -</p><p>KEENE: Give me another name. What else are you looking at besides e- Bay?</p><p>PRICE: Well, we own some big industrials. You know, we still own our Ingersoll Rand, which I like a lot.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: We do some other parts today. It is getting pretty full, but if you have some growth going forward, it is a cheap stock. The balance sheet has gotten much better as they have paid down debt.</p><p>KEENE: I see Emerson Electric with 57 percent global. It is amazing these industrials how they have gone global.</p><p>PRICE: And you can get a big currency benefit, too.</p><p>KEENE: Let's look at Colgate Palmolive here. I want to talk to Michael Price about investing 101 here. We're going to bring up Colgate, which is has just done great for ten and 12 years.</p><p>Not your kind of stock, but this goes back to the people that aren't Michael Price. How do you know when to sell? Or do you just go with buy and hold if you not as sophisticated?</p><p>PRICE: Selling is much tougher. You know, I think you buy things when things are 30 or 40 percent below what you think the asset value is. Selling it is very hard to tell. So we tend to dribble them out slowly as they move up.</p><p>KEENE: As they move up -</p><p>PRICE: I don't know the valuation of Colgate so I cannot help you there.</p><p>KEENE: No, I understand the valuation of Colgate. I just brought it up with this, you know, buy and hold strategy. We are seeing so many individual investors really looking at dividend reinvestment as an important way to go.</p><p>PRICE: Right.</p><p>KEENE: I mean you don't care about that. It is much more strategic.</p><p>PRICE: There are some large cap - Microsoft is one, IBM is one, Johnson &amp; Johnson - where good investors have made the arguments that these are very cheap, 12, 13 times earnings, with a dividend yield of three or four percent. And they are right. They are basically right. These stocks are pretty cheap looking over a decade.</p><p>KEENE: When you look at this, what is your single message for 2011?</p><p>PRICE: I think you have to be constructive. I think you have to look at - you know, that this economy is going to do better even in spite of somewhat higher interest rates.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>PRICE: You are going to churn ahead and I think you will find opportunities, so you have got to pay attention.</p><p>KEENE: I want to talk another sector. You mentioned the U.S. field, you are not looking abroad.</p><p>PRICE: No.</p><p>KEENE: You are using the U.S. component -</p><p>PRICE: Sure.</p><p>KEENE: - placed abroad. When you look at the dollar filtering in there, that has got to benefit some people here almost either way. I mean the U.S. is doing better than Europe, aren't they?</p><p>PRICE: Yes, the U.S. is going to do better. I think the problems in Europe are the PIIGS and they may be spreading a little bit. You know, we have that further out, so I think the focus will be on them first hurting the euro. And then unfortunately helping the dollar, which won't be that good in the short term.</p><p>KEENE: Humility is a big part of this. What is the biggest mistake you have made? I don't mean like the specific story, but philosophically in investment what is the thing that got you into the most hot water?</p><p>PRICE: Oh, probably getting into large positions where you really cannot exit. You know -</p><p>KEENE: Too big a position.</p><p>PRICE: - you are the lead guy and, yes, I mean -</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>PRICE: - Sunbeam Oster comes to mind from way back.</p><p>KEENE: Show me that ring again. We've got to get one more look at this, Victor. Get in. Move the coffee cup. Victor, bring it right in here. Look - look at that. That is amazing.</p><p>PRICE: That's the 27th one the Yankees have given out to players.</p><p>KEENE: I've got my Mickey Mantle belt buckle on, but -</p><p>PRICE: There you go. Now we're talking.</p><p>KEENE: - I'm not going to show it right here. A Mickey Mantle belt buckle, I saw him steal second base once at Fenway Park. That was great.</p><p>We've got to go. Michael Price, thank you so much.</p><p>12:18</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Is legendary too much of a - </p><p>  MICHAEL PRICE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MFP INVESTORS LLC: Yes.</p><p>  KEENE: - should I not say legendary?</p><p>  PRICE: So are you.</p><p>  KEENE: Good to see you.</p><p>  PRICE: Good to see you.</p><p>  KEENE: Let's just start with the state of value investing. When you  wake up in the morning, is there a lot of value out there or was that so  2009?</p><p>  PRICE: There are pockets. There are pockets. Yesterday we had a big  day, so, you know, it closed that gap. But, yes, we are finding some things  to do. When you see mergers announced at 40 percent premiums to where  stocks are trading like Del Monte, Baldor Electric, right?</p><p>  KEENE: Yes.</p><p>  PRICE: It tells you there is still value out there.</p><p>  KEENE: And the mergers it just seems to pick up. In talking to  Jonathan Keehner on our M&amp;A team, they are enthused about having fun in  2011. Does it just keep rolling here with an economic recovery?</p><p>  PRICE: It keeps rolling until some investment bank puts up a bridge  loan and they cannot place it. Then all of a sudden it grinds to a halt. It  starts rolling until there is a problem in -</p><p>  KEENE: Okay. Let's - </p><p>  PRICE: So some of these are being announced with bridge loans.</p><p>  KEENE: Yes, let's look at the \"dreaded first chart\" here. Michael  Price with us here. This is Jason Trennert's chart from Strategas. I'll  steal from anyone, Michael. This is a Jason chart. This is the Nasdaq 100  to the S&amp;P 500, growth back in vogue. Do you find value in what you and I  perceive is value? Or do you find value in growth?</p><p>  PRICE: Both. You know, we are long some growthy kind of stocks.</p><p>  KEENE: Give me some examples.</p><p>  PRICE: We're long some e-Bay. And if you back out the cash, you back  out their value in Skype, and you look at the two parts of e-Bay, I mean  you can make an argument that it is pretty cheap and that is a growthy  stock.</p><p>  KEENE: Casey, make up an e-Bay chart going back at least 15 years, 20  years, whatever. Just see what you can do with that.</p><p>  Look at this chart. This is great. Emily, thanks for bringing this up.</p><p>  PRICE: 3PAR, 3PAR up.</p><p>  KEENE: Were you an owner?</p><p>  PRICE: No, hold on. We own a comparable - </p><p>  KEENE: Okay.</p><p>  PRICE: - that is actually privately owned ConneXium. 3PAR is in the  storage business, and Compellent, Epsilon, and 3PAR were taken over at huge  numbers - Compellent not yet, but it probably will be - at seven times, ten  times revenues.</p><p>  KEENE: Right.</p><p>  PRICE: Fifty, 60 times earnings. Crazy numbers. By guys like EMC, Joe  Tucci, and others who really don't care. Another billion here or there  doesn't really matter to them.</p><p>  KEENE: Yes, that's the way I am.</p><p>  PRICE: But, you know, the valuations are crazy.</p><p>  KEENE: And you look at 3PAR, and the reason I put this up, look at  this chart. I had to get my bow tie straight.</p><p>  PRICE: Well, we're very well aware of it.</p><p>  KEENE: I wore this red - this is a Red Sox bow tie.</p><p>  PRICE: I wore my Yankee -</p><p>  KEENE: You wore your Yankee - that's good. You wore - did you see  that? I have the dumb red bow tie. You've got - put that ring up again,  let's look at that. Get in here for a close up. I'm proud that you're  wearing that ring.</p><p>  PRICE: (Inaudible) it's about to sign (inaudible).</p><p>  KEENE: What's Jeter doing?</p><p>  PRICE: Derek Jeter.</p><p>  KEENE: What's he going to do?</p><p>  PRICE: Well, I understand that he has got a very fair offer on the  table.</p><p>  KEENE: Okay.</p><p>  PRICE: So it should be taken. But we'll see -</p><p>  KEENE: Well, let's - back to 3PAR. Back to investment. Over on the  right side of this chart is the game theory here involved, where two  players, three players get involved. When you are a value owner, that is  your dream.</p><p>  PRICE: That's the dream. You have a bid for a company. If someone else  came into Del Monte because of the pet food business, which is the key, you  know, off to the races. If someone comes in - Boone Pickens as a part Exco  with a group - </p><p>  KEENE: Right.</p><p>  PRICE: - if someone else shows up, it is off to the races.</p><p>  KEENE: And what you do, you are known for careful analysis, not just  going in quickly, careful analysis.</p><p>  PRICE: We do a little work.</p><p>  KEENE: Do you look at the strategic -</p><p>  PRICE: Sure.</p><p>  KEENE: - selections down the road, the companies that would come in?</p><p>  PRICE: Absolutely. Strategic is better than financial, right? You want  a strategic buyer. The ABB bid for Baldor, which owns Reliance Electric, is  strategic. They market together. They will promote together. They  manufacture together. That is strategic. That is a better buyer than a KKR.</p><p>  KEENE: Let's look at a disaster - M&amp;A sale Alcatel-Lucent. This has  been a train wreck since time began. I'm going -</p><p>  PRICE: It still is.</p><p>  KEENE: - to be polite and not ask if you own this dog up there.</p><p>  PRICE: No, we were never involved.</p><p>  KEENE: But how does this happen?</p><p>  PRICE: I cannot help you there. We were not involved.</p><p>  KEENE: You were not involved, but when you look at dinosaurs mating as  some would say, but  in my language a lot of people have written about  this.</p><p>  PRICE: Yes, but out of Alcatel-Lucent, we will get involved when they  spin something off that is going to be too cheap. So these companies  reinvent themselves numerous ways, and Wall Street stands in there to make  markets and new securities. </p><p>  You know, we have spin offs every day. We had an IPO today of  something called FXCM that came out of the Refco bankruptcy. I mean that  was an interesting situation, a currency trading firm.</p><p>  KEENE: Which sector is the most attractive right now? Everybody is  telling me technology, technology, technology. Where are you?</p><p>  PRICE: Well, tech is interesting. We are not big tech players. I think  natural gas is pretty interesting. Between the shale plays and regular gas  producers, gas has lagged oil quite a bit.</p><p>  KEENE: Where will the market in general go next year?</p><p>  PRICE: Stocks? I have no idea.</p><p>  KEENE: You don't really care, do you?</p><p>  PRICE: I don't like the bond market.</p><p>  KEENE: Yes.</p><p>  PRICE: And gold is a bubble, and I don't like the ten year. But stocks  in general are reasonable here. I think there are a few pockets of  cheapness, but here and there they are where they should be.</p><p>  KEENE: Michael Price with us, folks. We're going to come back and  continue our discussion with Mr. Price about M&amp;A into next year. </p><p> 12:06</p><p>  (BREAK)</p><p> 12:10</p><p>  KEENE: Michael Price with me. He has been bragging about his New York  Yankees World Series Championship, King of the World ring. Thank you for  bringing that in.</p><p>  Wheat - here's an exogenous event. Wheat surges on drought. Do you  just stay focused on 20 or 40 or 50 stocks, or do you care about the stuff  I babble about all day?</p><p>  PRICE: No, we don't do the macro, but we look at hundreds of stocks. A  lot more than 20 or 40.</p><p>  KEENE: Global macro seems to be the vogue now -</p><p>  PRICE: Yes, but that's not what we do.</p><p>  KEENE: - with hedge fund resisting.</p><p>  PRICE: That's not what we do.</p><p>  KEENE: Is it global macro is right, and then they get it wrong and  everybody goes back to playing (inaudible), classic long/short.</p><p>  PRICE: Yes, I'm excited in that they are global. They are going away  from the U.S. market. Let them go into Brazil. That gives me more things to  do here, less competition I think. Let them get distracted.</p><p>  KEENE: Talk about the American malaise, the idea that America is not  doing that well and that you see this wall of worry, recovery in equities.</p><p>  PRICE: Right.</p><p>  KEENE: And, you know -</p><p>  PRICE: It is last spring and summer. I mean it was everybody was so  skeptical and yet you have this fantastic economy that is slowly churning  ahead. The car loadings at Berkshire Hathaway, Burlington Northern reported  were very impressive.</p><p>  KEENE: Phenomenal, yes.</p><p>  PRICE: The truck tons that they report are very impressive. The  economy is churning around.</p><p>  KEENE: Emily, go the Goldman Sachs note, please, if you would. This is  the \"note of the day.\" And we're going to go to the note of the day here,  folks, we rip up the script. We do that all the time. Drives them nuts in  the control room. Goldman Sachs global research, this is Jim O'Neill's  former desk, room to grow. We expect the most significant shift to take  place in the U.S. Four percent 2012.</p><p>  PRICE: But it is the valuations. You know, here you can buy at low  teens multiples terrific U.S. worldwide and U.S. companies participate in  it with better regulation I think here than around the world. So I think it  is not only better, but cheaper here.</p><p>  KEENE: Let's keep Goldman Sachs up here just because we brought up the  note. Here is the stock. Is big Wall Street going to lead the way? Or do  you -</p><p>  PRICE: I think it is so interesting.</p><p>  KEENE: - believe the boutiques are going to do it?</p><p>  PRICE: I am going to tell you I think some boutiques are set up very  well. The Greenhills of the world are terrific. They are focused. </p><p>  Other boutiques have conflicts. You know, Cowen runs something called  Ramius. Cowen is trying to get investment banking business at the same time  Ramius is doing hostile 13Ds against some of the companies. It doesn't make  sense.</p><p>  Goldman should split up into three parts. They should have money  management, trading, and investment banking. Investment banking requires  little or no equity. Money management little or no equity. They plow some  equity into the trading business -</p><p>  KEENE: Yes.</p><p>  PRICE: - and spin off the big dividend.</p><p>  KEENE: Okay, this is very explicit right here. This is important.  We're going to stay on this. Forget about the rest of the stuff. Goldman  Sachs, let's start again. </p><p>  PRICE: We own the stock.</p><p>  KEENE: Should they be - you own the stock.</p><p>  PRICE: We own the stock. The stock -</p><p>  KEENE: There's the chart up here, folks.</p><p>  PRICE: The stock is reasonably priced. It is a terrific business,  okay? And I remember watching Fidelity, the big mutual fund company, back  when everything went well for them in the eighties and nineties, got too  big. And I said to them why don't you split up into three, four parts. A  bond fund, equity, this and that.</p><p>  KEENE: Right.</p><p>  PRICE: They never did and they kind of languished in the last ten  years.</p><p>  KEENE: Did you go long the day of the testimony?</p><p>  PRICE: We traded in the stock, yes.</p><p>  KEENE: Yes.</p><p>  PRICE: Yes.</p><p>  KEENE: When you look at Goldman Sachs, the first step is should they  stay a bank or do they go - do they leave the banking number all over  government.</p><p>  PRICE: I think they should become three entities which requires one  being a bank. You know, the trading - they have a trading business. They  have a banking business and a money management business. They do not have  to be together. They can free up capital. They can get higher valuations. I  think the stock would be $250 if they did that.</p><p>  KEENE: Let's go back to the little banks. You mentioned Greenhill  before. I think of Evercore, what Altman is doing there.</p><p>  PRICE: Another one.</p><p>  KEENE: There is an independence there. Are they getting the smartest  people?</p><p>  PRICE: Some of them are getting very good people, sure. Cowen has been  hiring good people. And buried inside of the biggest bank - Bank of America  - is Merrill. When they start hitting on all cylinders, getting past the  mortgage put back mess, Bank of America is a powerful franchise.</p><p>  KEENE: Is Morgan -</p><p>  PRICE: And people forget that they own Merrill -</p><p>  KEENE: Is Morgan Stanley strapped because of all these broker deal  mortgages?</p><p>  PRICE: Yes, Morgan Stanley has got other issues, sure they do.</p><p>  KEENE: They've got other issues.</p><p>  PRICE: Yes.</p><p>  KEENE: Let's go back here. Could you bring up e-Bay, Emily? I know we  are throwing it around here with Michael Price, but let's bring up e-Bay. I  am surprised you mentioned this name. They're working on it back in the  control room. They've got to get the gerbil going to bring it up.</p><p>  PRICE: Right.</p><p>  KEENE: There it is. They fed the gerbil, good. </p><p>  Okay, e-Bay back a decade, I'm going to be blunt. IPO up it goes.</p><p>  PRICE: Right.</p><p>  KEENE: Stupid price, and it has gone nowhere. Is that a safe summary?</p><p>  PRICE: Well, it has gone from $12 to $29.</p><p>  KEENE: Yes.</p><p>  PRICE: And at $12 bucks where we kind of got involved - $12 and $15 I  think it was, I mean we were paying under ten times earnings for their  basic business, getting other stuff for free. They did not go sell a slug  of the Skype.</p><p>  And their Paypal business is going to be probably one of the most  valuable businesses going forward. Everybody wants to get into electronic  trunk funds transfer -</p><p>  KEENE: Right.</p><p>  PRICE: - secure electronic funds transfer. </p><p>  KEENE: Well -</p><p>  PRICE: VeriFone is doing it. VeriFone stock has been a rocket this  year. It will continue to go. e-Bay I think is really interesting.</p><p>  KEENE: Sheila Dharmarajan was out here the other night - yesterday,  rather, talking up NetFlix. When you see the silliness of NetFlix, can you  distill that down? Is it a profit model you can stay with?</p><p>  PRICE: I don't know.</p><p>  KEENE: You have not looked at it?</p><p>  PRICE: I don't know.</p><p>  KEENE: When you looked at e-Bay I thought maybe you'd look at -</p><p>  PRICE: That was -</p><p>  KEENE: Give me another name. What else are you looking at besides e- Bay?</p><p>  PRICE: Well, we own some big industrials. You know, we still own our  Ingersoll Rand, which I like a lot.</p><p>  KEENE: Yes.</p><p>  PRICE: We do some other parts today. It is getting pretty full, but if  you have some growth going forward, it is a cheap stock. The balance sheet  has gotten much better as they have paid down debt.</p><p>  KEENE: I see Emerson Electric with 57 percent global. It is amazing  these industrials how they have gone global.</p><p>  PRICE: And you can get a big currency benefit, too. </p><p>  KEENE: Let's look at Colgate Palmolive here. I want to talk to Michael  Price about investing 101 here. We're going to bring up Colgate, which is  has just done great for ten and 12 years. </p><p>  Not your kind of stock, but this goes back to the people that aren't  Michael Price. How do you know when to sell? Or do you just go with buy and  hold if you not as sophisticated?</p><p>  PRICE: Selling is much tougher. You know, I think you buy things when  things are 30 or 40 percent below what you think the asset value is.  Selling it is very hard to tell. So we tend to dribble them out slowly as  they move up.</p><p>  KEENE: As they move up -</p><p>  PRICE: I don't know the valuation of Colgate so I cannot help you  there.</p><p>  KEENE: No, I understand the valuation of Colgate. I just brought it up  with this, you know, buy and hold strategy. We are seeing so many  individual investors really looking at dividend reinvestment as an  important way to go.</p><p>  PRICE: Right.</p><p>  KEENE: I mean you don't care about that. It is much more strategic.</p><p>  PRICE: There are some large cap - Microsoft is one, IBM is one,  Johnson &amp; Johnson - where good investors have made the arguments that these  are very cheap, 12, 13 times earnings, with a dividend yield of three or  four percent. And they are right. They are basically right. These stocks  are pretty cheap looking over a decade.</p><p>  KEENE: When you look at this, what is your single message for 2011?</p><p>  PRICE: I think you have to be constructive. I think you have to look  at - you know, that this economy is going to do better even in spite of  somewhat higher interest rates.</p><p>  KEENE: Right.</p><p>  PRICE: You are going to churn ahead and I think you will find  opportunities, so you have got to pay attention.</p><p>  KEENE: I want to talk another sector. You mentioned the U.S. field,  you are not looking abroad.</p><p>  PRICE: No.</p><p>  KEENE: You are using the U.S. component -</p><p>  PRICE: Sure.</p><p>  KEENE: - placed abroad. When you look at the dollar filtering in  there, that has got to benefit some people here almost either way. I mean  the U.S. is doing better than Europe, aren't they?</p><p>  PRICE: Yes, the U.S. is going to do better. I think the problems in  Europe are the PIIGS and they may be spreading a little bit. You know, we  have that further out, so I think the focus will be on them first hurting  the euro. And then unfortunately helping the dollar, which won't be that  good in the short term.</p><p>  KEENE: Humility is a big part of this. What is the biggest mistake you  have made? I don't mean like the specific story, but philosophically in  investment what is the thing that got you into the most hot water?</p><p>  PRICE: Oh, probably getting into large positions where you really  cannot exit. You know -</p><p>  KEENE: Too big a position.</p><p>  PRICE: - you are the lead guy and, yes, I mean -</p><p>  KEENE: Yes.</p><p>  PRICE: - Sunbeam Oster comes to mind from way back.</p><p>  KEENE: Show me that ring again. We've got to get one more look at  this, Victor. Get in. Move the coffee cup. Victor, bring it right in here.  Look - look at that. That is amazing.</p><p>  PRICE: That's the 27th one the Yankees have given out to players.</p><p>  KEENE: I've got my Mickey Mantle belt buckle on, but -</p><p>  PRICE: There you go. Now we're talking.</p><p>  KEENE: - I'm not going to show it right here. A Mickey Mantle belt  buckle, I saw him steal second base once at Fenway Park. That was great. </p><p>  We've got to go. Michael Price, thank you so much. </p><p> 12:18</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Is legendary too much of a - </p><p>  MICHAEL PRICE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MFP INVESTORS LLC: Yes.</p><p>  KEENE: - should I not say legendary?</p><p>  PRICE: So are you.</p><p>  KEENE: Good to see you.</p><p>  PRICE: Good to see you.</p><p>  KEENE: Let's just start with the state of value investing. When you  wake up in the morning, is there a lot of value out there or was that so  2009?</p><p>  PRICE: There are pockets. There are pockets. Yesterday we had a big  day, so, you know, it closed that gap. But, yes, we are finding some things  to do. When you see mergers announced at 40 percent premiums to where  stocks are trading like Del Monte, Baldor Electric, right?</p><p>  KEENE: Yes.</p><p>  PRICE: It tells you there is still value out there.</p><p>  KEENE: And the mergers it just seems to pick up. In talking to  Jonathan Keehner on our M&amp;A team, they are enthused about having fun in  2011. Does it just keep rolling here with an economic recovery?</p><p>  PRICE: It keeps rolling until some investment bank puts up a bridge  loan and they cannot place it. Then all of a sudden it grinds to a halt. It  starts rolling until there is a problem in -</p><p>  KEENE: Okay. Let's - </p><p>  PRICE: So some of these are being announced with bridge loans.</p><p>  KEENE: Yes, let's look at the \"dreaded first chart\" here. Michael  Price with us here. This is Jason Trennert's chart from Strategas. I'll  steal from anyone, Michael. This is a Jason chart. This is the Nasdaq 100  to the S&amp;P 500, growth back in vogue. Do you find value in what you and I  perceive is value? Or do you find value in growth?</p><p>  PRICE: Both. You know, we are long some growthy kind of stocks.</p><p>  KEENE: Give me some examples.</p><p>  PRICE: We're long some e-Bay. And if you back out the cash, you back  out their value in Skype, and you look at the two parts of e-Bay, I mean  you can make an argument that it is pretty cheap and that is a growthy  stock.</p><p>  KEENE: Casey, make up an e-Bay chart going back at least 15 years, 20  years, whatever. Just see what you can do with that.</p><p>  Look at this chart. This is great. Emily, thanks for bringing this up.</p><p>  PRICE: 3PAR, 3PAR up.</p><p>  KEENE: Were you an owner?</p><p>  PRICE: No, hold on. We own a comparable - </p><p>  KEENE: Okay.</p><p>  PRICE: - that is actually privately owned ConneXium. 3PAR is in the  storage business, and Compellent, Epsilon, and 3PAR were taken over at huge  numbers - Compellent not yet, but it probably will be - at seven times, ten  times revenues.</p><p>  KEENE: Right.</p><p>  PRICE: Fifty, 60 times earnings. Crazy numbers. By guys like EMC, Joe  Tucci, and others who really don't care. Another billion here or there  doesn't really matter to them.</p><p>  KEENE: Yes, that's the way I am.</p><p>  PRICE: But, you know, the valuations are crazy.</p><p>  KEENE: And you look at 3PAR, and the reason I put this up, look at  this chart. I had to get my bow tie straight.</p><p>  PRICE: Well, we're very well aware of it.</p><p>  KEENE: I wore this red - this is a Red Sox bow tie.</p><p>  PRICE: I wore my Yankee -</p><p>  KEENE: You wore your Yankee - that's good. You wore - did you see  that? I have the dumb red bow tie. You've got - put that ring up again,  let's look at that. Get in here for a close up. I'm proud that you're  wearing that ring.</p><p>  PRICE: (Inaudible) it's about to sign (inaudible).</p><p>  KEENE: What's Jeter doing?</p><p>  PRICE: Derek Jeter.</p><p>  KEENE: What's he going to do?</p><p>  PRICE: Well, I understand that he has got a very fair offer on the  table.</p><p>  KEENE: Okay.</p><p>  PRICE: So it should be taken. But we'll see -</p><p>  KEENE: Well, let's - back to 3PAR. Back to investment. Over on the  right side of this chart is the game theory here involved, where two  players, three players get involved. When you are a value owner, that is  your dream.</p><p>  PRICE: That's the dream. You have a bid for a company. If someone else  came into Del Monte because of the pet food business, which is the key, you  know, off to the races. If someone comes in - Boone Pickens as a part Exco  with a group - </p><p>  KEENE: Right.</p><p>  PRICE: - if someone else shows up, it is off to the races.</p><p>  KEENE: And what you do, you are known for careful analysis, not just  going in quickly, careful analysis.</p><p>  PRICE: We do a little work.</p><p>  KEENE: Do you look at the strategic -</p><p>  PRICE: Sure.</p><p>  KEENE: - selections down the road, the companies that would come in?</p><p>  PRICE: Absolutely. Strategic is better than financial, right? You want  a strategic buyer. The ABB bid for Baldor, which owns Reliance Electric, is  strategic. They market together. They will promote together. They  manufacture together. That is strategic. That is a better buyer than a KKR.</p><p>  KEENE: Let's look at a disaster - M&amp;A sale Alcatel-Lucent. This has  been a train wreck since time began. I'm going -</p><p>  PRICE: It still is.</p><p>  KEENE: - to be polite and not ask if you own this dog up there.</p><p>  PRICE: No, we were never involved.</p><p>  KEENE: But how does this happen?</p><p>  PRICE: I cannot help you there. We were not involved.</p><p>  KEENE: You were not involved, but when you look at dinosaurs mating as  some would say, but  in my language a lot of people have written about  this.</p><p>  PRICE: Yes, but out of Alcatel-Lucent, we will get involved when they  spin something off that is going to be too cheap. So these companies  reinvent themselves numerous ways, and Wall Street stands in there to make  markets and new securities. </p><p>  You know, we have spin offs every day. We had an IPO today of  something called FXCM that came out of the Refco bankruptcy. I mean that  was an interesting situation, a currency trading firm.</p><p>  KEENE: Which sector is the most attractive right now? Everybody is  telling me technology, technology, technology. Where are you?</p><p>  PRICE: Well, tech is interesting. We are not big tech players. I think  natural gas is pretty interesting. Between the shale plays and regular gas  producers, gas has lagged oil quite a bit.</p><p>  KEENE: Where will the market in general go next year?</p><p>  PRICE: Stocks? I have no idea.</p><p>  KEENE: You don't really care, do you?</p><p>  PRICE: I don't like the bond market.</p><p>  KEENE: Yes.</p><p>  PRICE: And gold is a bubble, and I don't like the ten year. But stocks  in general are reasonable here. I think there are a few pockets of  cheapness, but here and there they are where they should be.</p><p>  KEENE: Michael Price with us, folks. We're going to come back and  continue our discussion with Mr. Price about M&amp;A into next year. </p><p> 12:06</p><p>  (BREAK)</p><p> 12:10</p><p>  KEENE: Michael Price with me. He has been bragging about his New York  Yankees World Series Championship, King of the World ring. Thank you for  bringing that in.</p><p>  Wheat - here's an exogenous event. Wheat surges on drought. Do you  just stay focused on 20 or 40 or 50 stocks, or do you care about the stuff  I babble about all day?</p><p>  PRICE: No, we don't do the macro, but we look at hundreds of stocks. A  lot more than 20 or 40.</p><p>  KEENE: Global macro seems to be the vogue now -</p><p>  PRICE: Yes, but that's not what we do.</p><p>  KEENE: - with hedge fund resisting.</p><p>  PRICE: That's not what we do.</p><p>  KEENE: Is it global macro is right, and then they get it wrong and  everybody goes back to playing (inaudible), classic long/short.</p><p>  PRICE: Yes, I'm excited in that they are global. They are going away  from the U.S. market. Let them go into Brazil. That gives me more things to  do here, less competition I think. Let them get distracted.</p><p>  KEENE: Talk about the American malaise, the idea that America is not  doing that well and that you see this wall of worry, recovery in equities.</p><p>  PRICE: Right.</p><p>  KEENE: And, you know -</p><p>  PRICE: It is last spring and summer. I mean it was everybody was so  skeptical and yet you have this fantastic economy that is slowly churning  ahead. The car loadings at Berkshire Hathaway, Burlington Northern reported  were very impressive.</p><p>  KEENE: Phenomenal, yes.</p><p>  PRICE: The truck tons that they report are very impressive. The  economy is churning around.</p><p>  KEENE: Emily, go the Goldman Sachs note, please, if you would. This is  the \"note of the day.\" And we're going to go to the note of the day here,  folks, we rip up the script. We do that all the time. Drives them nuts in  the control room. Goldman Sachs global research, this is Jim O'Neill's  former desk, room to grow. We expect the most significant shift to take  place in the U.S. Four percent 2012.</p><p>  PRICE: But it is the valuations. You know, here you can buy at low  teens multiples terrific U.S. worldwide and U.S. companies participate in  it with better regulation I think here than around the world. So I think it  is not only better, but cheaper here.</p><p>  KEENE: Let's keep Goldman Sachs up here just because we brought up the  note. Here is the stock. Is big Wall Street going to lead the way? Or do  you -</p><p>  PRICE: I think it is so interesting.</p><p>  KEENE: - believe the boutiques are going to do it?</p><p>  PRICE: I am going to tell you I think some boutiques are set up very  well. The Greenhills of the world are terrific. They are focused. </p><p>  Other boutiques have conflicts. You know, Cowen runs something called  Ramius. Cowen is trying to get investment banking business at the same time  Ramius is doing hostile 13Ds against some of the companies. It doesn't make  sense.</p><p>  Goldman should split up into three parts. They should have money  management, trading, and investment banking. Investment banking requires  little or no equity. Money management little or no equity. They plow some  equity into the trading business -</p><p>  KEENE: Yes.</p><p>  PRICE: - and spin off the big dividend.</p><p>  KEENE: Okay, this is very explicit right here. This is important.  We're going to stay on this. Forget about the rest of the stuff. Goldman  Sachs, let's start again. </p><p>  PRICE: We own the stock.</p><p>  KEENE: Should they be - you own the stock.</p><p>  PRICE: We own the stock. The stock -</p><p>  KEENE: There's the chart up here, folks.</p><p>  PRICE: The stock is reasonably priced. It is a terrific business,  okay? And I remember watching Fidelity, the big mutual fund company, back  when everything went well for them in the eighties and nineties, got too  big. And I said to them why don't you split up into three, four parts. A  bond fund, equity, this and that.</p><p>  KEENE: Right.</p><p>  PRICE: They never did and they kind of languished in the last ten  years.</p><p>  KEENE: Did you go long the day of the testimony?</p><p>  PRICE: We traded in the stock, yes.</p><p>  KEENE: Yes.</p><p>  PRICE: Yes.</p><p>  KEENE: When you look at Goldman Sachs, the first step is should they  stay a bank or do they go - do they leave the banking number all over  government.</p><p>  PRICE: I think they should become three entities which requires one  being a bank. You know, the trading - they have a trading business. They  have a banking business and a money management business. They do not have  to be together. They can free up capital. They can get higher valuations. I  think the stock would be $250 if they did that.</p><p>  KEENE: Let's go back to the little banks. You mentioned Greenhill  before. I think of Evercore, what Altman is doing there.</p><p>  PRICE: Another one.</p><p>  KEENE: There is an independence there. Are they getting the smartest  people?</p><p>  PRICE: Some of them are getting very good people, sure. Cowen has been  hiring good people. And buried inside of the biggest bank - Bank of America  - is Merrill. When they start hitting on all cylinders, getting past the  mortgage put back mess, Bank of America is a powerful franchise.</p><p>  KEENE: Is Morgan -</p><p>  PRICE: And people forget that they own Merrill -</p><p>  KEENE: Is Morgan Stanley strapped because of all these broker deal  mortgages?</p><p>  PRICE: Yes, Morgan Stanley has got other issues, sure they do.</p><p>  KEENE: They've got other issues.</p><p>  PRICE: Yes.</p><p>  KEENE: Let's go back here. Could you bring up e-Bay, Emily? I know we  are throwing it around here with Michael Price, but let's bring up e-Bay. I  am surprised you mentioned this name. They're working on it back in the  control room. They've got to get the gerbil going to bring it up.</p><p>  PRICE: Right.</p><p>  KEENE: There it is. They fed the gerbil, good. </p><p>  Okay, e-Bay back a decade, I'm going to be blunt. IPO up it goes.</p><p>  PRICE: Right.</p><p>  KEENE: Stupid price, and it has gone nowhere. Is that a safe summary?</p><p>  PRICE: Well, it has gone from $12 to $29.</p><p>  KEENE: Yes.</p><p>  PRICE: And at $12 bucks where we kind of got involved - $12 and $15 I  think it was, I mean we were paying under ten times earnings for their  basic business, getting other stuff for free. They did not go sell a slug  of the Skype.</p><p>  And their Paypal business is going to be probably one of the most  valuable businesses going forward. Everybody wants to get into electronic  trunk funds transfer -</p><p>  KEENE: Right.</p><p>  PRICE: - secure electronic funds transfer. </p><p>  KEENE: Well -</p><p>  PRICE: VeriFone is doing it. VeriFone stock has been a rocket this  year. It will continue to go. e-Bay I think is really interesting.</p><p>  KEENE: Sheila Dharmarajan was out here the other night - yesterday,  rather, talking up NetFlix. When you see the silliness of NetFlix, can you  distill that down? Is it a profit model you can stay with?</p><p>  PRICE: I don't know.</p><p>  KEENE: You have not looked at it?</p><p>  PRICE: I don't know.</p><p>  KEENE: When you looked at e-Bay I thought maybe you'd look at -</p><p>  PRICE: That was -</p><p>  KEENE: Give me another name. What else are you looking at besides e- Bay?</p><p>  PRICE: Well, we own some big industrials. You know, we still own our  Ingersoll Rand, which I like a lot.</p><p>  KEENE: Yes.</p><p>  PRICE: We do some other parts today. It is getting pretty full, but if  you have some growth going forward, it is a cheap stock. The balance sheet  has gotten much better as they have paid down debt.</p><p>  KEENE: I see Emerson Electric with 57 percent global. It is amazing  these industrials how they have gone global.</p><p>  PRICE: And you can get a big currency benefit, too. </p><p>  KEENE: Let's look at Colgate Palmolive here. I want to talk to Michael  Price about investing 101 here. We're going to bring up Colgate, which is  has just done great for ten and 12 years. </p><p>  Not your kind of stock, but this goes back to the people that aren't  Michael Price. How do you know when to sell? Or do you just go with buy and  hold if you not as sophisticated?</p><p>  PRICE: Selling is much tougher. You know, I think you buy things when  things are 30 or 40 percent below what you think the asset value is.  Selling it is very hard to tell. So we tend to dribble them out slowly as  they move up.</p><p>  KEENE: As they move up -</p><p>  PRICE: I don't know the valuation of Colgate so I cannot help you  there.</p><p>  KEENE: No, I understand the valuation of Colgate. I just brought it up  with this, you know, buy and hold strategy. We are seeing so many  individual investors really looking at dividend reinvestment as an  important way to go.</p><p>  PRICE: Right.</p><p>  KEENE: I mean you don't care about that. It is much more strategic.</p><p>  PRICE: There are some large cap - Microsoft is one, IBM is one,  Johnson &amp; Johnson - where good investors have made the arguments that these  are very cheap, 12, 13 times earnings, with a dividend yield of three or  four percent. And they are right. They are basically right. These stocks  are pretty cheap looking over a decade.</p><p>  KEENE: When you look at this, what is your single message for 2011?</p><p>  PRICE: I think you have to be constructive. I think you have to look  at - you know, that this economy is going to do better even in spite of  somewhat higher interest rates.</p><p>  KEENE: Right.</p><p>  PRICE: You are going to churn ahead and I think you will find  opportunities, so you have got to pay attention.</p><p>  KEENE: I want to talk another sector. You mentioned the U.S. field,  you are not looking abroad.</p><p>  PRICE: No.</p><p>  KEENE: You are using the U.S. component -</p><p>  PRICE: Sure.</p><p>  KEENE: - placed abroad. When you look at the dollar filtering in  there, that has got to benefit some people here almost either way. I mean  the U.S. is doing better than Europe, aren't they?</p><p>  PRICE: Yes, the U.S. is going to do better. I think the problems in  Europe are the PIIGS and they may be spreading a little bit. You know, we  have that further out, so I think the focus will be on them first hurting  the euro. And then unfortunately helping the dollar, which won't be that  good in the short term.</p><p>  KEENE: Humility is a big part of this. What is the biggest mistake you  have made? I don't mean like the specific story, but philosophically in  investment what is the thing that got you into the most hot water?</p><p>  PRICE: Oh, probably getting into large positions where you really  cannot exit. You know -</p><p>  KEENE: Too big a position.</p><p>  PRICE: - you are the lead guy and, yes, I mean -</p><p>  KEENE: Yes.</p><p>  PRICE: - Sunbeam Oster comes to mind from way back.</p><p>  KEENE: Show me that ring again. We've got to get one more look at  this, Victor. Get in. Move the coffee cup. Victor, bring it right in here.  Look - look at that. That is amazing.</p><p>  PRICE: That's the 27th one the Yankees have given out to players.</p><p>  KEENE: I've got my Mickey Mantle belt buckle on, but -</p><p>  PRICE: There you go. Now we're talking.</p><p>  KEENE: - I'm not going to show it right here. A Mickey Mantle belt  buckle, I saw him steal second base once at Fenway Park. That was great. </p><p>  We've got to go. Michael Price, thank you so much. </p><p> 12:18</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Is legendary too much of a -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MICHAEL PRICE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MFP INVESTORS LLC</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: - should I not say legendary?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: So are you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Good to see you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Good to see you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Let's just start with the state of value investing. When you wake up in the morning, is there a lot of value out there or was that so 2009?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: There are pockets. There are pockets. Yesterday we had a big day, so, you know, it closed that gap. But, yes, we are finding some things to do. When you see mergers announced at 40 percent premiums to where stocks are trading like Del Monte, Baldor Electric, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: It tells you there is still value out there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: And the mergers it just seems to pick up. In talking to Jonathan Keehner on our M&amp;A team, they are enthused about having fun in 2011. Does it just keep rolling here with an economic recovery?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: It keeps rolling until some investment bank puts up a bridge loan and they cannot place it. Then all of a sudden it grinds to a halt. It starts rolling until there is a problem in -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Okay. Let's -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: So some of these are being announced with bridge loans.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yes, let's look at the \"dreaded first chart\" here. Michael Price with us here. This is Jason Trennert's chart from Strategas. I'll steal from anyone, Michael. This is a Jason chart. This is the Nasdaq 100 to the S&amp;P 500, growth back in vogue. Do you find value in what you and I perceive is value? Or do you find value in growth?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Both. You know, we are long some growthy kind of stocks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Give me some examples.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: We're long some e-Bay. And if you back out the cash, you back out their value in Skype, and you look at the two parts of e-Bay, I mean you can make an argument that it is pretty cheap and that is a growthy stock.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Casey, make up an e-Bay chart going back at least 15 years, 20 years, whatever. Just see what you can do with that.  </p><p>      Look at this chart. This is great. Emily, thanks for bringing this up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: 3PAR, 3PAR up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Were you an owner?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: No, hold on. We own a comparable -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Okay.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: - that is actually privately owned ConneXium. 3PAR is in the storage business, and Compellent, Epsilon, and 3PAR were taken over at huge numbers - Compellent not yet, but it probably will be - at seven times, ten times revenues.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Fifty, 60 times earnings. Crazy numbers. By guys like EMC, Joe Tucci, and others who really don't care. Another billion here or there doesn't really matter to them.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yes, that's the way I am.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: But, you know, the valuations are crazy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: And you look at 3PAR, and the reason I put this up, look at this chart. I had to get my bow tie straight.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Well, we're very well aware of it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: I wore this red - this is a Red Sox bow tie.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: I wore my Yankee -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: You wore your Yankee - that's good. You wore - did you see that? I have the dumb red bow tie. You've got - put that ring up again, let's look at that. Get in here for a close up. I'm proud that you're wearing that ring.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: (Inaudible) it's about to sign (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: What's Jeter doing?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Derek Jeter.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: What's he going to do?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Well, I understand that he has got a very fair offer on the table.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Okay.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: So it should be taken. But we'll see -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Well, let's - back to 3PAR. Back to investment. Over on the right side of this chart is the game theory here involved, where two players, three players get involved. When you are a value owner, that is your dream.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: That's the dream. You have a bid for a company. If someone else came into Del Monte because of the pet food business, which is the key, you know, off to the races. If someone comes in - Boone Pickens as a part Exco with a group -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: - if someone else shows up, it is off to the races.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: And what you do, you are known for careful analysis, not just going in quickly, careful analysis.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: We do a little work.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Do you look at the strategic -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: - selections down the road, the companies that would come in?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Absolutely. Strategic is better than financial, right? You want a strategic buyer. The ABB bid for Baldor, which owns Reliance Electric, is strategic. They market together. They will promote together. They manufacture together. That is strategic. That is a better buyer than a KKR.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Let's look at a disaster - M&amp;A sale Alcatel-Lucent. This has been a train wreck since time began. I'm going -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: It still is.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: - to be polite and not ask if you own this dog up there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: No, we were never involved.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: But how does this happen?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: I cannot help you there. We were not involved.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: You were not involved, but when you look at dinosaurs mating as some would say, but  in my language a lot of people have written about this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Yes, but out of Alcatel-Lucent, we will get involved when they spin something off that is going to be too cheap. So these companies reinvent themselves numerous ways, and Wall Street stands in there to make markets and new securities.   </p><p>      You know, we have spin offs every day. We had an IPO today of something called FXCM that came out of the Refco bankruptcy. I mean that was an interesting situation, a currency trading firm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Which sector is the most attractive right now? Everybody is telling me technology, technology, technology. Where are you? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Well, tech is interesting. We are not big tech players. I think natural gas is pretty interesting. Between the shale plays and regular gas producers, gas has lagged oil quite a bit.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Where will the market in general go next year?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Stocks? I have no idea.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: You don't really care, do you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: I don't like the bond market.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: And gold is a bubble, and I don't like the ten year. But stocks in general are reasonable here. I think there are a few pockets of cheapness, but here and there they are where they should be.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Michael Price with us, folks. We're going to come back and continue our discussion with Mr. Price about M&amp;A into next year.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">12</emphasis>:06  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">12</emphasis>:10  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Michael Price with me. He has been bragging about his New York Yankees World Series Championship, King of the World ring. Thank you for bringing that in.  </p><p>      Wheat - here's an exogenous event. Wheat surges on drought. Do you just stay focused on 20 or 40 or 50 stocks, or do you care about the stuff I babble about all day?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: No, we don't do the macro, but we look at hundreds of stocks. A lot more than 20 or 40.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Global macro seems to be the vogue now -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Yes, but that's not what we do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: - with hedge fund resisting.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: That's not what we do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Is it global macro is right, and then they get it wrong and everybody goes back to playing (inaudible), classic long/short.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Yes, I'm excited in that they are global. They are going away from the U.S. market. Let them go into Brazil. That gives me more things to do here, less competition I think. Let them get distracted.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Talk about the American malaise, the idea that America is not doing that well and that you see this wall of worry, recovery in equities. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: And, you know -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: It is last spring and summer. I mean it was everybody was so skeptical and yet you have this fantastic economy that is slowly churning ahead. The car loadings at Berkshire Hathaway, Burlington Northern reported were very impressive.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Phenomenal, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: The truck tons that they report are very impressive. The economy is churning around.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Emily, go the Goldman Sachs note, please, if you would. This is the \"note of the day.\" And we're going to go to the note of the day here, folks, we rip up the script. We do that all the time. Drives them nuts in the control room. Goldman Sachs global research, this is Jim O'Neill's former desk, room to grow. We expect the most significant shift to take place in the U.S. Four percent 2012.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: But it is the valuations. You know, here you can buy at low teens multiples terrific U.S. worldwide and U.S. companies participate in it with better regulation I think here than around the world. So I think it is not only better, but cheaper here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Let's keep Goldman Sachs up here just because we brought up the note. Here is the stock. Is big Wall Street going to lead the way? Or do you -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: I think it is so interesting.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: - believe the boutiques are going to do it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: I am going to tell you I think some boutiques are set up very well. The Greenhills of the world are terrific. They are focused.   </p><p>      Other boutiques have conflicts. You know, Cowen runs something called Ramius. Cowen is trying to get investment banking business at the same time Ramius is doing hostile 13Ds against some of the companies. It doesn't make sense.  </p><p>Goldman should split up into three parts. They should have money management, trading, and investment banking. Investment banking requires little or no equity. Money management little or no equity. They plow some equity into the trading business -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: - and spin off the big dividend.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Okay, this is very explicit right here. This is important. We're going to stay on this. Forget about the rest of the stuff. Goldman Sachs, let's start again.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: We own the stock. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Should they be - you own the stock.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: We own the stock. The stock -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: There's the chart up here, folks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: The stock is reasonably priced. It is a terrific business, okay? And I remember watching Fidelity, the big mutual fund company, back when everything went well for them in the eighties and nineties, got too big. And I said to them why don't you split up into three, four parts. A bond fund, equity, this and that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: They never did and they kind of languished in the last ten years.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Did you go long the day of the testimony?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: We traded in the stock, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: When you look at Goldman Sachs, the first step is should they stay a bank or do they go - do they leave the banking number all over government.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: I think they should become three entities which requires one being a bank. You know, the trading - they have a trading business. They have a banking business and a money management business. They do not have to be together. They can free up capital. They can get higher valuations. I think the stock would be $250 if they did that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Let's go back to the little banks. You mentioned Greenhill before. I think of Evercore, what Altman is doing there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Another one.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: There is an independence there. Are they getting the smartest people?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Some of them are getting very good people, sure. Cowen has been hiring good people. And buried inside of the biggest bank - Bank of America - is Merrill. When they start hitting on all cylinders, getting past the mortgage put back mess, Bank of America is a powerful franchise.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Is Morgan -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: And people forget that they own Merrill -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Is Morgan Stanley strapped because of all these broker deal mortgages? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Yes, Morgan Stanley has got other issues, sure they do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: They've got other issues.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Let's go back here. Could you bring up e-Bay, Emily? I know we are throwing it around here with Michael Price, but let's bring up e-Bay. I am surprised you mentioned this name. They're working on it back in the control room. They've got to get the gerbil going to bring it up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: There it is. They fed the gerbil, good.   </p><p>      Okay, e-Bay back a decade, I'm going to be blunt. IPO up it goes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Stupid price, and it has gone nowhere. Is that a safe summary?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Well, it has gone from $12 to $29.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: And at $12 bucks where we kind of got involved - $12 and $15 I think it was, I mean we were paying under ten times earnings for their basic business, getting other stuff for free. They did not go sell a slug of the Skype.  </p><p>      And their Paypal business is going to be probably one of the most valuable businesses going forward. Everybody wants to get into electronic trunk funds transfer -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: - secure electronic funds transfer.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Well -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: VeriFone is doing it. VeriFone stock has been a rocket this year. It will continue to go. e-Bay I think is really interesting.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Sheila Dharmarajan was out here the other night - yesterday, rather, talking up NetFlix. When you see the silliness of NetFlix, can you distill that down? Is it a profit model you can stay with?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: I don't know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: You have not looked at it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: I don't know. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: When you looked at e-Bay I thought maybe you'd look at -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: That was -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Give me another name. What else are you looking at besides e-Bay?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Well, we own some big industrials. You know, we still own our Ingersoll Rand, which I like a lot.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: We do some other parts today. It is getting pretty full, but if you have some growth going forward, it is a cheap stock. The balance sheet has gotten much better as they have paid down debt.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: I see Emerson Electric with 57 percent global. It is amazing these industrials how they have gone global.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: And you can get a big currency benefit, too.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Let's look at Colgate Palmolive here. I want to talk to Michael Price about investing 101 here. We're going to bring up Colgate, which is has just done great for ten and 12 years.   </p><p>      Not your kind of stock, but this goes back to the people that aren't Michael Price. How do you know when to sell? Or do you just go with buy and hold if you not as sophisticated?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Selling is much tougher. You know, I think you buy things when things are 30 or 40 percent below what you think the asset value is. Selling it is very hard to tell. So we tend to dribble them out slowly as they move up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: As they move up -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: I don't know the valuation of Colgate so I cannot help you there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: No, I understand the valuation of Colgate. I just brought it up with this, you know, buy and hold strategy. We are seeing so many individual investors really looking at dividend reinvestment as an important way to go.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: I mean you don't care about that. It is much more strategic.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: There are some large cap - Microsoft is one, IBM is one, Johnson &amp; Johnson - where good investors have made the arguments that these are very cheap, 12, 13 times earnings, with a dividend yield of three or four percent. And they are right. They are basically right. These stocks are pretty cheap looking over a decade.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: When you look at this, what is your single message for 2011?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: I think you have to be constructive. I think you have to look at - you know, that this economy is going to do better even in spite of somewhat higher interest rates.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: You are going to churn ahead and I think you will find opportunities, so you have got to pay attention.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: I want to talk another sector. You mentioned the U.S. field, you are not looking abroad.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: No.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: You are using the U.S. component -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: - placed abroad. When you look at the dollar filtering in there, that has got to benefit some people here almost either way. I mean the U.S. is doing better than Europe, aren't they?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Yes, the U.S. is going to do better. I think the problems in Europe are the PIIGS and they may be spreading a little bit. You know, we have that further out, so I think the focus will be on them first hurting the euro. And then unfortunately helping the dollar, which won't be that good in the short term.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Humility is a big part of this. What is the biggest mistake you have made? I don't mean like the specific story, but philosophically in investment what is the thing that got you into the most hot water?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: Oh, probably getting into large positions where you really cannot exit. You know -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Too big a position.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: - you are the lead guy and, yes, I mean -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: - Sunbeam Oster comes to mind from way back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Show me that ring again. We've got to get one more look at this, Victor. Get in. Move the coffee cup. Victor, bring it right in here. Look - look at that. That is amazing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: That's the 27th one the Yankees have given out to players.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: I've got my Mickey Mantle belt buckle on, but -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>: There you go. Now we're talking.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: - I'm not going to show it right here. A Mickey Mantle belt buckle, I saw him steal second base once at Fenway Park. That was great.   </p><p>      We've got to go. Michael Price, thank you so much.   </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS: We see today conflicts, displacement, migrations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- the catastrophic threat of the climate crisis. The U.N.'s Human Rights Chief Michelle Bachelet says it's also a threat to our right to life in a sustainable world. Plus, Microsoft's President Brad Smith on why governments need to get real about regulating big tech.</p><p>Welcome to the program everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.</p><p>Coming up, my interview with Brad Pitt on his new space film. But, first, from the galaxy, the horrifying images here on earth that clearly visible. Fires raging in the Amazon, forests reduced to ashes, glaciers shrinking. But the climate crisis is not only having a devastating impact on the places we live in, but also on our human rights.</p><p>As the existential issue of our time, it will take center stage at this year's U.N. General Assembly, which kicks off next week. Friday, we'll see the next mass protest and youth climate strikes pioneered by the teenage activist and now icon, Greta Thunberg. Greta and other campaigners are facing increasing hostility and abuse.</p><p>And Michelle Bachelet, the U.N.'s Human Rights Chief, is calling it out. Of the climate emergency, she says, the world has never seen a threat to human rights of this scope. And I asked her what world leaders should do at next week's big U.N. climate summit that will kick off the annual general assembly meeting in New York.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Michelle Bachelet, welcome to the program.</p><p>BACHELET: Thank you, Christiane. I'm very happy to be here with you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Your entire opening statement in letter to the session of the U.N. is about climate. And you have written that everybody has the right to a healthy and sustainable climate. It's a human rights issue. Tell me how you come to that definition.</p><p>BACHELET: Well, the first thing I have to say that I've been involved with climate change many years ago in different capacities and in my last term as president, we did a lot in terms of marine protected areas, in terms of renewable energy, in terms of big national parks and banning plastic bags. So, for me it was clear.</p><p>It probably since (ph) I was in New York in the -- as U.N. Women, we had this vision that -- and when I heard first time the star report that climate change was a threat, that what we have been seeing right now is not for the future, it's already here, is that you see today conflicts, displacements, migrations linked to droughts, to floodings, to all kinds of disasters that are linked with climate change.</p><p>On the other hand, we know that if the temperature is higher than what we would like, we will have a scarcity of water. We will have other potential threats that will mean that the rights of the people, in terms of the right to health, in terms of the right to food security, and so on, will be really damaged.</p><p>And what happened, Christiane, is that unfortunately, usually the most vulnerable ones, the most poor ones, the most marginalized one are the ones who are really more affected because they have less tools, less possibilities to tackle the issues.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You've also, in your letter, talked about needing to defend the defenders, in other words, the environmental defenders. And there's been an unprecedented spike in the assault, the injury, the deaths of environmental activists and, indeed, journalists who cover the environment. What can the U.N. do? What can your office do and how bad is that situation?</p><p>BACHELET: Well, on human right defenders, it's one of our priorities. We work to the societies. We speak out when it's needed so that they know that they're not alone and that that we are -- the office is behind them. We talk to governments on the shrinking of civic space and democratic spaces.</p><p>For example, in Mexico there is this mechanism where they can support people with police action when it's needed in terms of protection. But also -- UNESCO are in charge of working on the protection of journalists.</p><p>[13:05:00] So, we identify risk where sometimes in countries we see early warning signs that we can inform governments and so they can take the measures needed not to have so much killings. Because unfortunately, as you said Christiane, the number of human right defenders, particularly environmentalists, women on property -- land property, (INAUDIBLE), and indigenous people are among the human right defenders most affected with this casualties of harassment, and of course journalists as we have seen in many parts of the world.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So let's talk about that. I mean, you know, the great Greta Thunberg, I say great but she's only 16 years old but she's made a great, great impact, she has said that we take these attacks as a badge of honor. But, you know, that's putting a brave face on it.</p><p>And you just mentioned indigenous people and, of course, Brazil has been in the spotlight recently with the burning of the Amazon and with the very defiant response from President Bolsonaro and his foreign minister. You have also alluded in your letter to how worried you are by the climate crisis magnified by the burning of trees and deforestation.</p><p>BACHELET: Well, yes. I mean, we see deforestation. We see the disappearance of our land. We see these fires raging across the Amazonian- - in three countries, Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia. On the other hand, we see in Ireland the ice melting. So we do see the changes that the planet is having. And my concern is that I have the impression that people are not taking seriously enough.</p><p>So one of the thing that I will expect is that, next week when in New York, you know, the general assembly meets a high level general assembly meeting with the three summits, the one on climate change, the one in universal health coverage and the one on agenda 2030 and to leave no one behind, I hope member states go there not with speeches, and that's what the secretary general asked us, but concrete commitment. What will be the concrete plan of action?</p><p>AMANPOUR: Tell me what action and who would you call out if you will be at these meetings?</p><p>BACHELET: Well, I would say -- one of the things that I already -- and I think I said it also in my open statement in the Human Rights Council, is a small island are really leading because they are already leaving the consequences. So it's not -- and many of them already have national action plans in terms of mitigation, in terms of adaptation, and, of course, in terms of prevention.</p><p>So what I think it needs to be done on one hand is to do a lot of education, civic education with the children, with the people because we need a cultural change, a behavioral change. I mean, people needs to change the way they leave, the way they consume, the way we produce, because otherwise this won't work.</p><p>We need also the governments to be -- to have the courage, because it needs to make difficult decisions. For example, sometimes you want the economy to go well, of course, I did, as well, because you need to provide people with other things and a country has to develop. But on the other hand, sometimes you have to make difficult decisions in terms of environment.</p><p>The third thing is we need business onboard, as well, because green economy and blue economy can't provide a lot of opportunities. It's not that the economy is going to end, it's just that we need to learn that we cannot continue doing business as usual. And we do have very important companies who are doing a lot on this regard. So we need everyone onboard.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I want to stick with Brazil, actually, and on the issue of human rights, not just the environment but other human rights, because you have called out Brazil for all sorts of violations recently and the president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is a bit of a populist and who has a certain way of speaking in public, he then turned around and sort of attacked you for what happened to your father, who was tortured under the regime of Augusto Pinochet in Chile. Let me play the sound bite from the Brazilian president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAIR BOLSONARO, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): He is defending the human rights of a vagabonds (ph). She says more still. She criticized that Brazil is losing its democratic arena. Mrs. Michelle Bachelet, if the people led by Pinochet have not defeated the left of 1973, including your father, today, Chile would be like Cuba.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Michelle Bachelet, that's an extraordinary attack. I mean, that's from one president against you, a former president of a neighboring country, Chile. How do you take that when he said that?</p><p>BACHELET: Well, I mean, I don't take it personal because what I totally feel that it's wrong is that any leader could excuse torture and violation of human rights. They're so many. You listen to them every time saying that, you know, they're fighting extremism so that's why they cannot follow the international standards of human right, the humanitarian laws.</p><p>[13:10:10] And that, I mean, very few, just to be honest, very few excuse torture. I haven't heard it many times. But I don't take it personal because that's not the point. I know and I'm honored to have my father and what happened to him in terms of that he was a Democrat who really supported democracy in my country, so I'm very proud of him.</p><p>But the thing that I really care or I'm concern about is when you see leaders either with a hate speech, either with sort of incentivating xenophobia, racism or trying to rewrite the history of Latin America. I mean, in Latin America we did have dictatorship, we did have torture, we did have extrajudicial killing, we did have people whose human rights were violated. And I think many of us really learned from those lessons. And I think that there was a lot of people who rejected this kind of arguments.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes. I mean, again it was really, it was really extraordinary. And as you say, I mean, it seems to, I don't know, it seems to whitewash what happened in the regime and to your family.</p><p>Just remind us, for people who are not so familiar, you also were tortured. Obviously, your parents were arrested and tortured. Your father died in prison. But you also were arrested and tortured. Just remind us what happened and how that informs your leadership of the human rights counsel.</p><p>BACHELET: Probably younger people believe that the 9/11 is only linked to the U.S., but in Chile's history the 9/11 on 1973 there was a coup d'etat and -- military coup d'etat and many people were detained, among others my father. And he was arrested -- because he was a Democrat. He really believed that the way to change a government, if people don't like it, is through elections.</p><p>So he did not support their coup d'etat, of course, and he was put into prison. A lot of different accusations were thrown at him and he was tortured and he died under the torture of a heart attack.</p><p>My mother and me stayed for some time over there, but then I was studying medicine, I'm getting my medical doctor, and that -- and then afterwards, they took us to prison and so we left for Australia where my brother was living.</p><p>And then, of course, I came back to Chile in 1979 to continue my life there, work, also, like a human right defender as well. I worked in an NGO who was -- I was a doctor for -- because I did -- I finished the school, but then I did pediatric so I was the pediatrician of young children who were either the daughter or sons of people in prison or killed or disappeared.</p><p>So I did -- I was a person whose human rights were being violated, but I also worked with people whose human rights were violated trying to give them some comfort and some remedy.</p><p>So afterwards, of course, I work in the public sector as a doctor and then I studied defense issues and then I became -- under President Lagos government, I became minister of health, afterwards minister of defense, and afterwards president of the republic, the first time. Then I was the director of U.N. Women. And then I was -- again, run again and won again the presidency.</p><p>So that's when you're telling me this, I am telling you, I ran to this position, I tried to bring to this position because I do believe that states are the responsible for promoting, protecting human rights.</p><p>I bring to this, on one hand, my own experience as an NGO, my own experience of a family victim of human rights violation, but also my own experience being a minister, being a president who understand, which has the logics to takes this issues and try to think on which can be the best proposals, the best narrative, how it convince government to do the right thing, how it convince parliaments, how it work with national commission of human rights. So I try to bring all those experience to this post and I hope it works.</p><p>AMANPOUR: We just mentioned Bolsonaro of Brazil who has a big, you know, following there. And we also know that President Maduro, Nicolas Maduro, has said nasty things about you, as well. And he has, well, certainly the Bolivarian Revolution had quite a lot of-- and the Chavistas had quite a lot of populist support. But this is what Maduro has said about you and your efforts on behalf of human rights.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLAS MADURO, VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT (through translation): What does Michelle Bachelet have against the Bolivarian Revolution? What does she have against us? Why you're envy?</p><p>[13:15:00] Why you're meanness? Why you're negative attitude? She lies, Michelle Bachelet. Repent yourself, Michelle Bachelet. Enough lies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: How do you, not just really respond, but how do you actually do what you have to do as a human rights commissioner to try to engage even those countries in terms of respecting human rights.</p><p>BACHELET: Well, in particular in the case of Venezuela, if you remember Christiane, I went there. I send first technical mission in March and then I went there in June. And to everyone I speak in a very transparent way. I give recommendations. Countries can follow it or not, that's their own issue. But to be honest, I do speak what the truth.</p><p>I mean, what I believe is the truth that I had received from all kinds of people. And we also sit to governments before we leave a country. Look, this is what is going to come. Our report will include that and that and that. And we use the same methodology for all countries of the world.</p><p>So I would say it's very common, to be honest, that countries don't like to be criticized, government particularly don't like to be criticized, and they always make comments or sometimes they try to convince the office not to release a report and so on. But that's part of their job.</p><p>AMANPOUR: That's part of their job. So you have also said that you're alarmed by the U.S. government, the Trump administration's treatment, for instance, of migrants and particularly the detention of child migrants at the border. What will you say to the U.S. government, if you run into, I don't know, President Trump at a meeting or in the hallway at this U.N. General Assembly?</p><p>BACHELET: Well, I'm not sure that's going to happen, really. But anyway, what I could say -- this year is the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Children. And in the international human rights law on children, it is completely prohibited to detain children being at in the situation that they are. So I would say we cannot punish children by the decision of their parents.</p><p>We have heard histories of child whose parents were deported and the child is now in New York, 5 years old, and he doesn't know anything about his family, desperate. And so we listen to many dramatic situations that even the Supreme Court of the U.S. commented to the government that this was a violation of children's rights and that this thing should be stopped.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Michelle Bachelet, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, thank you very much for joining me.</p><p>BACHELET: Thank you, Christiane. We'll see you in another time. Bye-bye.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: So my next guest tonight is one of the most famous actors in the world. Yet the real life Brad Pitt remains something of an enigma. His career spanning three decades has earned him a reputation as one of the best in the business. He's currently starring as a stunt man in Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time\" in Hollywood.</p><p>But his latest movie is an entirely new venture for Pitt, sci-fi film \"Ad Astra.\" (INAUDIBLE) tackle a space odyssey for the first time. Pitt stars as an astronaut send to the outer edges of the solar system to find his long lost father, a hero space commander who now poses a threat to humanity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PITT: This is Major Roy McBride. I'm attempting to reach Dr. Clifford McBride. This is Dr. McBride's son. Dad, I would like to see you again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Now, \"Ad Astra\" means to the stars in Latin. And the film comes out here in the U.K. today and will hit theaters in the United States on Friday. And this movie isn't just a space adventure, but it's a story about masculinity and vulnerability, a subject that Pitt has been keen to tackle.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Brad Pitt, welcome to the program.</p><p>PITT: Thank you. Thanks for being here out there.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Out here. I mean, you know, it's kind of relevant because what you've done is a big space epic, \"Ad Astra,\" which is all about being here and there and in the outer space. What in the first place made you want to do this?</p><p>PITT: Well, there were several factors, certainly a love for the sci-fi genre. I didn't want to do it until I figured we could do something that would add to a really successful genre, something different. And I think James Gray had a really interesting take that we hadn't seen before. James Gray is our writer/director. He's an old, old friend of mine.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>PITT: And we certainly have a shorthand as friends.</p><p>[13:20:02] And it just seemed the subject matter of, I guess, finding oneself at this age of my life, it seemed interesting.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, there there's so much to talk about, because it is very different as a sci-fi film, as a space odyssey. And we're going to get into that. But in general, what do you see as the big difference in terms of this one versus others that have been out there?</p><p>PITT: Well, in this one, for one, you know, usually in sci-fi we're dealing with aliens that are either out to destroy us or impart some benevolent wisdom upon us and we're going to evolve either way.</p><p>And this one started with a quote that's attributed to Arthur Clarke, which is either we're not alone in the universe or we're completely alone. And either outcome is equally terrifying. And the idea that, what if it was just us, then what? And that this idea could be terrifying to us, maybe something I worry even actually running from. It was an interesting jumping off point.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So I'm going to play the first of a couple of clips we have. And this one is about you being told about the Lima Project and you're being talked to by space command because they're looking for your dad in an even. Let's just play this and we'll talk about it on the other side.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Major, what can you tell us about the Lima Project?</p><p>PITT: First manned expedition to the outer solar system, sir, some 29 years ago.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And that commander was?</p><p>PITT: It was my father, sir. The ship disappeared approximately 16 years into the mission. I know data isn't going to be (ph) covered. Deep-space missions were halted after that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right. We have something that might come as quite a shock to you. We believe your father is still alive near Neptune.</p><p>PITT: My father is alive, sir?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: So that's the beginning of the mystery. Your father, you discovered, they think is alive. I'm not sure that you think it yet in the film. And they tell you that he's in charge of this thing, which could have a chain reaction that could destroy all known living beings and unbeings in the solar system. Just tell us a little bit about what they then ask you to do.</p><p>PITT: It's actually to make contact. They're asserting that he's gone rogue and has become a danger to our solar system. So, yes, the universe is in peril.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And you've said that this is the most difficult film that you've ever worked on. Why?</p><p>PITT: It is the most delicate film because it's just so delicate to my surprise. When we were -- as we were putting this together, you know, we set out to make a very sincere film. I mean, a real bare bones, bare raw kind of honesty. And the danger in that is that in sincerity it can become too earnest and tip the scales of the film.</p><p>And it was very interesting to see how one piece of voiceover or holding on a take for too long can suddenly make it just too earnest and then if we worked conversely the other way. And we're talking about seconds. And if we got out too early, it would be flat and the emotion wasn't there. I've never quite wrestled with a film in that way.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, in a way, that clip showed a little bit of that because, you know, my father is alive, sir. I mean, you say this in a very, very restrained manner. I mean, he's been gone 29 years and now they're telling you, his son, his presumably grief-stricken son, that he's alive. And this is a repetitive theme of the way you perform here. It's incredibly restrained.</p><p>We showed in the introduction where you sending a message to your father. You're saying, dad, I'd like to see you again. This is part of the expedition. And, you know, it's, again, restrained and you have to clear your throat afterwards and contain yourself and regain your composure. You've never done anything like that before, have you?</p><p>PITT: Probably not to this degree. I'm usually more physical. But, you know, I think of the great Anthony Hopkins and I've always been mesmerized by what he did in \"Remains of the Day.\" And that it was -- he was able in stillness to still be -- to invoke incredible emotion. And I think looking back I've certainly taken a page from him in this.</p><p>[13:25:01] AMANPOUR: And then the other thing, which you cannot escape, and you sort of alluded to it, it is also about loneliness. It's also about father and son, their relationship. It's also about masculinity and vulnerability.</p><p>Before I get down to the nitty-gritty of each of those, how do you process all of that? I mean, you said it's, you know, it's come at a time in your life where it's interesting for you to grapple in such a public way with those emotions</p><p>PITT: Well, I mean, on one hand, you know, you get older and you just get tired of protecting yourself or having any secrets, you know. You just want to get on with it. And we wanted to get on with it in this film in a way -- I mean, we all carry, I think, great pains, great regrets. We've all experienced loss. We've all experienced great loneliness at times.</p><p>And we're good at packing that away, not dealing with -- some are really good at getting through it and coming out the other side in a more well rounded, I think, more confident and loving human being. So we just wanted to, like, no holds barred. Let's just go. Let's get it out there.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, look, here is a lovely clip that -- I mean, we have it because it's available, but it's still a really important clip in this regard. So we're just going play -- this is, again, part of what you say to your dad.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PITT (voice-over): I recall how we used to watch black and white movies together. Musicals were you favorite. I remember you tutoring me in math. You instilled in me a strong work ethic. You should know I've chosen a career that you would approve of. I've dedicated my life to the exploration of space, and I thank you for that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, that was a voice-over and you're telling your dad those things. But, how did it sort of reflect your own life, your own relationship? You have sons and daughters and you are a son. How did it sort of bond with the real Brad Pitt?</p><p>PITT: My individual experience is somewhat universal in the fact that our, you know, our parents are our universe, our God, our first imprint on how to behave, react, feel in the world. And with that to different degrees, some of us more than others carry pain and confusion from that. I think it almost takes a lifetime to understand what was yours and what was theirs.</p><p>As a child, I think most kids usually take fault or something of that nature on ourselves. So, I think it was just a real investigation of parsing through that and to really be able to understand yourself.</p><p>As a dad -- I mean, my dad always said he wanted to give me a better life than he had coming from extreme poverty. And he did it. And it makes me think, as a dad, what do I have to offer that's better than I had to my kids?</p><p>AMANPOUR: What about women? It's interesting that the two female characters are pretty minor characters, pretty minimal appearances on, you know, onscreen. And some people have remarked on that. Tell me the reason for that and the thinking behind that.</p><p>PITT: I'm not sure what the remarks are. I mean, this is -- you know, it is an investigation of masculinity in our definitions of a more of romance type never show weakness versus, I guess, vulnerability.</p><p>And so, you know, like Liv Tyler's character represents his regrets, whether you got wrong. What do you feel she mishandled or missed? And that she is an example of -- in the feminine, an example that maybe in the masculine we need to take better note of, we could take better note off.</p><p>And then Ruth Negga's character is more this voice of wisdom that sent us off in the direction, the fated direction that will be the ultimate, I guess, death, rebirth, if I can speak poetically.</p><p>[13:30:00]</p><p>AMANPOUR: You've been through some fairly public, you know, sad things recently. You've been divorced and publicly you then spoke about what it was like to go through one of these things that not many men talk about and many men don't think it's OK to get help for certain things like alcohol and other kinds of substance.</p><p>And you spoke without revealing the obvious confidential nature of alcoholics anonymous about what it did and what it gave to you. Can you tell me, so that other people, you know, who are in that kind of situation, might get a little bit of a, you know, a boost from somebody like you, if they need that kind of help.</p><p>PITT: I don't know. I mean, certainly for me, you know, what I realized was I was running to things to avoid tough feelings, painful feelings. I just didn't know how to deal with them and looking for anything I found that I used for escape to escape.</p><p>Those kinds of, I guess, difficult feelings. I don't know how better to describe it. I mean, it can be anything. It can be drugs, booze, Netflix, snacks, anything.</p><p>I don't want to be -- I don't want at this point to be running from anything. I want to be -- I want to sit in it, I want to feel it, I want to get through the rough night.</p><p>And I found in doing so, you just -- you come out the other side with a more profound understanding of yourself and a greater gratefulness for those in your life, and the birds and the trees, and everything else.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Can I ask you about the other film that has been a summer hit that you starred in which is \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" And it's obviously much more of a buddy film, much more of an ensemble.</p><p>You are the stunt man to Leonardo DiCaprio's lead actor, and it is an extraordinary performance. It's extraordinary sort of dynamic between the two of you.</p><p>Some have said, and I think even James Gray have said, and I'm going to get it all mangled. But he said, you know, I've been struck as to how Brad Pitt hasn't necessarily been a leading man up until now.</p><p>You know, not so much of a character actor. And now you're doing much more of that. Can you reflect on that?</p><p>PITT: I don't -- I don't know. I mean, I don't have a lot to say about \"Once Upon a Time\" because Quentin and Leo are pretty magical in their own rights and there's some really good alchemy there.</p><p>But no, I'm doing like I've always done it. I was winged on '70s films. And then when I got started, there were people like Penn who was doing \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" and this really interesting characters, Mickey Rourke in Pope.</p><p>And that really struck me as you can do all the things. And it just felt more interesting because we are all those things.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Your breakout film I think, correct me if I'm wrong, was \"Thelma and Louise\", right? that made you a massive star presence on the horizon. I don't know whether it's just me or whether you heard from other people that some, certainly, women who watched the film maybe couldn't separate you from the character and found what you did to Thelma just, oh, my goodness.</p><p>PITT: Because I robbed her?</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>PITT: Because my character robbed her?</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>PITT: Yes. Yes. Well, it's back to the '70s characters, isn't it? You know, we're all a bit flawed.</p><p>AMANPOUR: What did you like about that film? And this is leading me to somewhere.</p><p>PITT: Well, first it was, you know, I mean they let me in the game. That was the first big game. And it's Ridley Scott who made \"Blade Runner\" and \"Alien\", a couple of my favorites, still, and it's Geena.</p><p>And I was just, you know, it was just one of those things I was in. Now, what am I going to do with it?</p><p>AMANPOUR: I was just interviewing Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey who have written \"She Said\" and it's the inside story of Harvey Weinstein and how they reported and broke the news that launched the #MeTooMovement.</p><p>And they have a lot of great things to say about Gwyneth Paltrow and how instrumental she was in helping them when they needed to sort of connect the dots and try to, you know, try to find a way to confirm some of the things that he did.</p><p>[13:35:00]</p><p>And as you know, this has been a huge and important story that's rocked Hollywood. But this is what they said about Gwyneth's role, and in relation to that, about your role, as well. So I just want to play you a little sound bite and get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JODI KANTOR, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, NEW YORK TIMES: The essence of the Gwyneth story is not just about the fact that she says he ended a business meeting at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills by placing hands on her and saying let's finish this in the bedroom. The point is, she had been cast in the movie \"Emma\" which was a star-making role. It was a great part but it hadn't been filmed yet.</p><p>And after Brad Pitt, her boyfriend at the time, confronted Weinstein, Weinstein called Gwyneth, according to her, and said you're going to ruin everything. You're going to screw up your whole career and she thought she was going to be fired.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, Brad Pitt, it's obviously Gwyneth's story to tell and the reporter's story to tell. But I wonder if you feel, you know, you can add anything to that. Because you do come out as, you know, one of the heroes of this story. You confronted a guy that very few people were willing to confront, apparently.</p><p>PITT: Oh, well, I think that's a -- I mean a bit much. I have a couple of things to say.</p><p>I mean at that moment, you know, I was a boyfriend in the Ozarks on the playground and that's -- I mean that was -- that's how we confronted with things and wanted to make sure nothing happened further because she was going to do two films.</p><p>You know, I think that the interesting thing is that we, Hollywood specifically, but the workplace, men and women's dynamics is being recalibrated in a very good way and it's long overdue. And I do think that's an important story to tell.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, I'm glad. And it took a boy from the Ozarks to do that, anyway, on that particularly difficult playground. And, again, it's all part of the issue of masculinity and that's what your new film \"Ad Astra\" is about. So, Brad Pitt, thank you so much indeed for joining us.</p><p>PITT: Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. I'm a big fan.</p><p>AMANPOUR: It's a true epic with an amazing message.</p><p>And now, we separate the fact from the science fiction with our next guest, Brad Smith. As president of Microsoft, he leads one of the world's most valuable companies.</p><p>His new book pulls back the curtain on Microsoft as the company grapples with the ethical questions that come with technology like artificial intelligence. Coauthored with Carol-Ann Brown, it's called \"Tools and Weapons.\"</p><p>And he sat down with our Hari Sreenivasan to talk about the promise and the peril of the digital age and why he's one of the few tech leaders today calling for more, not less, privacy regulation.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN, CONTRIBUTOR: Early on in your book, I'm just going to read a quick paragraph. When you're describing a data center that you walk into, you say somewhere in one of these rooms, in one of these buildings, there are data files that belong to you. They have the e-mail you wrote this morning, the document you worked on last night, and the photo you took yesterday afternoon.</p><p>They also, likely contain personal information from your bank, doctor, and employer. And you lead with that information belongs to me, but I don't feel like I really have control over it. I mean, how do I find it, delete it once and for all, if it's copied in all these different rooms that I have no access where they are.</p><p>BRAD SMITH, PRESIDENT, MICROSOFT: I think that is one of the great questions of our time. These huge data center campuses have become, in many ways, the most important piece of infrastructure of the 21st Century. Yet no one ever gets to go inside.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Like Digital Fort Knox.</p><p>SMITH: Yes. And that's why we start the book by taking people on a tour of a data center to see this. Because I think until you sort of grasp that physical reality, you can't quite then get your mind around the security issues, the privacy issues, the broader technical issues that are just being unleashed.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: You know, there's this old phrase that I remember from when I covered the tech industry, if you can't see the product, you are the product, right? That they're basically -- the data about you and how you use these services is being bought and sold.</p><p>So I'm wondering if I use Bing Search and if I have a Hot Mail account and if I use an Edge Browser, isn't the default that advertisers have access to how I navigate the world and aren't they figuring out all sorts of little bits of information about me?</p><p>SMITH: I don't think every company is approaching this in the same way. I think the challenge is it's hard to know, you know, what the different companies are doing.</p><p>You know, in Microsoft, we focus more on, you know, really saying, hey, our business is not fundamentally advertising, it's on protecting your data rather than trying to monetize it in that way. But I also think that this really turns on the protection of privacy more broadly.</p><p>[13:40:00]</p><p>One reason we devoted a chapter on the development of consumer privacy issues is because we think this has been, you know, going through waves of evolution, starting in the 1990s. But we think we're now approaching a third wave where we're going to see more government rules in place because I think what the marketplace is telling us is that people do care about privacy but they don't feel they can pull away from these services and instead they, in fact, want more government rules to protect them.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Most tech companies have been, for a while, saying I don't want any government interference in this. And they've really had that run up the place. And here you are saying I think there's a happy medium here and we should go in that direction.</p><p>SMITH: I think we at Microsoft sometimes approach these issues from a somewhat different perspective in part because of our own historical experience. We went through this episode in the late 1990s when the U.S. government and states obtained a court order to break the company up.</p><p>You know, we successfully defended against it but we learned we had to change. That we needed to connect with the world. We needed to assume more responsibility.</p><p>And I think what that taught us, in part, is that when you think about a long-term vision, stability, success is served best by sustaining the publics' trust. And you can't expect the public to trust companies if that's the only thing they're allowed to trust.</p><p>The public does depend on laws and controls and a fabric that supports the community as a whole. And so we do think that a broader perspective, if you will, is a more enlightened one.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: So as a software and services company, how does Microsoft's operation differ from Google or Facebook who make their money from advertisers?</p><p>SMITH: If you look at where most of Microsoft's revenue comes from, it is basically persuading you to pay us to use our software or devices, you know, in our software as a service. And then, yes, I would say part of our value proposition is you're paying us to keep you secure, to honor the fact that the data is your own.</p><p>Obviously, there are advertising business based models. And, you know, in that case, you don't pay the company with your money. You do still pay the company, I believe, because you pay by providing the company with access to your data and the company gets paid but the company gets paid by advertisers.</p><p>And so there is this interesting economic tension, if you will, between honoring the needs of the people who use your service and working with the advertisers who pay you for the data that you were getting.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: I feel like right now where information is headed that there could be a future where privacy is the ultimate luxury. That the more powerful you are, the more you're going to be able to employ resources, to pick up your digital crumbs whether it's in the cloud or other places. Because there's so many pieces of my information that are being transacted today that I don't have any control over, that I'm certainly not being paid for.</p><p>SMITH: One of the things that I think is so interesting is the United States has been slow to adopt privacy laws. Europe has really been the birthplace of modern privacy protection, especially since the 1990s.</p><p>But there's a really important lesson from the last year. California adopted a sweeping privacy law. You might ask but why California?</p><p>The answer is very clear. It's because they have a ballot opportunity. You can put an initiative on the ballot and once people look at the polling, they saw that more than 80 percent of the California voters were likely to support this.</p><p>That shows you where the public voice and interest is. And I think that is a voice that we need to listen to regardless whether we create technology or we're just like, all of us, we use it. We rely on it every day.</p><p>I think ultimately we need a national privacy law. I gave a speech in 2005 saying this and most people in the tech sector just yawned.</p><p>But I think now people are awake and ultimately national law would serve us best. It there's not a national law, the California law will be the de facto national law of the United States.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: In the book, you write about a few moments in the past few years that increased our awareness of data. 2013, Edward Snowden's revolutions, also, another big moment. 2018, Cambridge Analytica. So what does Microsoft do to, I guess, maybe police either your clients or access to any of our information?</p><p>SMITH: Well, the first thing I would say is this decade has had these two critical inflection points. 2013 with the Snowden disclosures was the awakening of where data was being used in the U.S. government. 2018 with Cambridge Analytica was a political awakening, especially, with concerns about what companies were doing.</p><p>[13:45:00]</p><p>And so to really answer your question, I think it starts with exercising more self-restraint, having clear principles on how we think about data, how we use data. But it actually, also, really requires creating the technology tools so that every business, every government, every nonprofit can manage its data in a way that protects privacy, both privacy as required by laws that are changing, privacy with changing expectations among people.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: One of the big revelations also in 2018, or 2016 I should say, was the integrity of our elections. I mean the U.S. Intelligence agencies said there's been multiple incursions by other state actors, Russia and others.</p><p>Also, around the election, there was this reckoning that technology companies certainly were ones that owned the platforms are enabling the spread of misinformation and disinformation in an unparalleled way. I mean to what extent are platforms or should platforms be responsible for the information that is trafficked across them? I mean, the United States has a rule basically that indemnifies the tech companies but other countries don't.</p><p>SMITH: When we see these kinds of threats to our democracy, we all have a responsibility to take action. That means if you're a tech company, first thing I would say is, regardless whether you have a legal duty, I think we have a civic responsibility to step up.</p><p>And I would be the first to say companies are. We have more to do and we always will, I think.</p><p>But then the second thing is governments need to do more, as well. It's good for governments to put more pressure on companies to do more. But there's no other area where you would say, oh, we're going to defend the country from foreign threats by just asking a bunch of businesses to do more.</p><p>That is almost a quintessential responsibility of the government. And it needs a collaboration, new forms of collaboration, if you will.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: You've been responsible for leading the Paris call for trust and security in cyberspace. The U.S. is not a party. Neither are Russia, Iran, China, Israel. These are major actors.</p><p>So even if you have a coalition of the willing, when you don't have these major actors in the game agreeing to the set of rules --</p><p>SMITH: Well, with the Paris call on cybersecurity, we have a clear goal. It's to bring together the democracies of the world with nonprofit groups and businesses of the democratic nations to protect the internet, our fundamental infrastructure from attacks. Attacks, that in some cases, are obviously coming from nondemocratic nations.</p><p>You know, in the world today, there are roughly 75 democratic countries and they have roughly half the world's population. We are disappointed that the United States hasn't signed the Paris call, but 67 nations have.</p><p>Most of the democratic societies of the world are working together. All 28 members of the European Union, 25 of the 27 members of NATO. To me, it's a great example of a coalition of the willing. Keep working, keep building, the day will come when the U.S. thinks.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: You're an optimist?</p><p>SMITH: Absolutely.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Right now, at least on the political campaign trail, on the Democrat side, there's definitely a push to break up tech companies that -- and the platforms and essentially these near monopolies are stifling competition.</p><p>You've heard all these arguments before. You've lived through them. What is the piece of advice that you'd give to the companies that are now under the, you know, watchful gaze of the attorney generals around the United States?</p><p>SMITH: I think the most important thing that we learn when we had our years on the hot seat was that you have to look at yourself, you have to see what other people see in you. And unfortunately, that's never as positive as what you think you see when you look in the mirror.</p><p>Understand their concerns and start to address them. Be prepared to comprise.</p><p>Our fundamental message is, if you create the technology that changes the world, you have a responsibility to help address the world that you have changed.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Recently, some of your employees protested your decision to go forward with the $10 billion contract at the Pentagon. You wrote on Microsoft Blog that, listen, you've been working with the Department of Defense for 40 years. You're going to stay engaged. You're going to be proactive. This is a way that you can influence the policy from the inside.</p><p>But can you give me an example of how you have used your position inside different government agencies to advocate for something that perhaps they didn't think of in a way that is respectful of privacy?</p><p>SMITH: Sure. Well, one of them is what is what's happening with facial recognition. Because facial recognition is important for privacy, it's important for people's broader rights.</p><p>[13:50:00]</p><p>You know, and we've turned down deals in nondemocratic countries where we would see human rights put at risk through broad based facial recognition, but even in the United States. We've shared there was a law enforcement agency in California that came to us, they wanted to put cameras in every police car, use facial recognition to identify whether the people being pulled over for any purpose at all were a match for their data base.</p><p>We said no. We said, look, this technology is not ready or suitable for that purpose. It is likely to be biased and lead to falsely identifying people, especially people of color and women for whom the data sets are just not as strong.</p><p>And we then work with that law enforcement agency. We're advocating for legislation across the country to, among other things, address that risk of discrimination.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: How concerned should people be about facial recognition and the data that's being gathered by companies and countries as I walk through the streets in my life right now?</p><p>SMITH: One of the reasons we devoted a chapter in our book to facial recognition is because, perhaps, it's becoming almost a quintessential tool and potential weapon. It's one reason we advocate strongly both for governments moving faster, if there is any single area where I just feel we need urgent action by governments, it's to start adopting laws in the field of facial recognition.</p><p>But at the same time, we shouldn't just give companies a pass. You know, that's why we have said we're taking the principles that we are encouraging governments to adopt the law and we're applying them to ourselves immediately. I think people should be asking everybody in the tech sector to do more of that.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: You know it seems that China right now is going to use facial recognition and artificial intelligence in a totally different way. They want an ordered world and they want this technology to help them control dissident, et cetera.</p><p>Russia, on the other hand, might be using it to start a different cold war and use all these technologies to spy on and maybe even disrupt elections and so forth. The United States doesn't seem to have some sort of coherent strategy on how we want to harness the power that is inside A.I.</p><p>SMITH: You raise, I think, a fundamentally important point. In our book, it's, in part, a call to action.</p><p>In the United States, in the democratic societies of the world, if we want to protect values that we think are timeless, like democratic freedoms, human rights, we do need a more coherent approach in the United States across the democracies of the world.</p><p>And, you know, we need to get after it. We can't just study this and debate this and watch gridlock continue to unfold in Washington, D.C., or elsewhere.</p><p>That's why we, frankly, are appealing to everybody trying to make these issues more assessable to all of us who are affected by them so the public voice can be heard.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Look, I totally hear what you're saying about democratic values and human rights. And somebody is going to watch this interview and say but what about all the data centers they have in China right now? And at the same time, you've got possibly a million, million and a half Uighurs in the western part of the country that are in reeducation camps in 2019.</p><p>SMITH: Well, actually, you know, one reason we devote -- it was the hardest chapter in the book to write about, China, is because the complexity of these issues. There are certain services that we're comfortable putting there. You know, services for businesses and the like.</p><p>But, you know, consumer data, consumer e-mail service, we don't have that in China. We don't have that in certain other countries. We don't put that kind of data in certain countries because whenever you put data about somebody in a country, you put that person's most precious information potentially at risk.</p><p>You have to think long and hard. We need people to be thoughtful before we just build these data centers everywhere and put all the data in the world in them.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: You know you are the longest serving executive now at Microsoft in 26 years. What is the biggest argument that you lost where you wish you could say to everyone see, I told you so, we should have done this?</p><p>SMITH: Well, you don't become the longest serving anything by being the one who walks around saying I told you so. That's usually not a recipe for success.</p><p>We have learned so much over the year. And, you know, not surprisingly, you know, as somebody who was in the middle of the anti-trust issues, at least to some degree in the '90s, you know, I was very happy when we all had the opportunity to learn some lessons that were so important about what it takes to, you know, just sort of step up and connect with people, companies, competitors, governments, the public.</p><p>[13:55:00]</p><p>And, to me, a lot of life is about variations on that theme. Think about the long-term. Listen to what other people have to say. Be curious about their point of view. But perhaps most importantly, think about the public interest.</p><p>You know, there was the old story of, you know, the CEO of General Motors who long ago said that what was good for General Motors was good for America. I have the opposite view. I believe that what is good for America will be good for Microsoft.</p><p>We are the product of the values of this kind of democracy. And if we need to adapt to serve democracy, we should. And when we do, we'll do well.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: All right. The book is called \"Tools and Weapons.\" Brad Smith of Microsoft along with Carol-Ann Brown, the coauthor, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>SMITH: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And these tech issues are not going away any time soon.</p><p>That's it for our program.
