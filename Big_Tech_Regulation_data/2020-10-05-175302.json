Few Democrats have raised similar concerns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Big tech companies like Google are getting increasing scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators around the world for a wide variety of issues, including their influence on political debate, their handling of consumer data, and the aggressive way they compete with smaller companies.</p><p>  A day before the Gabbard lawsuit was filed, Facebook said the Federal Trade Commission had opened a formal antitrust investigation into its business practices. Earlier in the day, the F.T.C. announced that Facebook was fined a record $5 billion for deceiving users about their ability to control the privacy of their personal data.</p><p>  Tulsi Now Inc., the campaign committee for Ms. Gabbard, said Google suspended the campaign's advertising account for six hours on June 27 and June 28, obstructing its ability to raise money and spread her message to potential voters.</p><p>  After the first Democratic debate, Ms. Gabbard was briefly the most searched-for candidate on Google. Her campaign wanted to capitalize on the attention she was receiving by buying ads that would have placed its website at the top of search results for her name.</p><p>  The lawsuit also said the Gabbard campaign believed its emails were being placed in spam folders on Gmail at ''a disproportionately high rate'' when compared with emails from other Democratic candidates.</p><p>  ''Google's arbitrary and capricious treatment of Gabbard's campaign should raise concerns for policymakers everywhere about the company's ability to use its dominance to impact political discourse, in a way that interferes with the upcoming 2020 presidential election,'' the lawsuit said.</p><p>  Ms. Gabbard and her campaign are seeking an injunction against Google from further meddling in the election and damages of at least $50 million.</p><p>Google has automated systems that flag unusual activity on advertiser accounts -- including large spending changes -- to prevent fraud, said Jose Castaneda, a spokesman for the company.</p><p>  ''In this case, our system triggered a suspension and the account was reinstated shortly thereafter,'' he said. ''We are proud to offer ad products that help campaigns connect directly with voters, and we do so without bias toward any party or political ideology.''</p><p>  No other campaigns have publicly claimed that Google has suspended their advertising accounts.</p><p>  Interest in Ms. Gabbard, who has served four terms in the House and is an Army National Guard veteran, spiked after the debate. She entered the presidential race as a relative unknown and is still polling at less than 1 percent, according to New York Times polling averages.</p><p>  But her appeal has crossed traditional party lines. She has drawn support from both the right and the left because of a staunch antiwar message. She has also received favorable coverage from influential conservative news media like Drudge Report, Fox News and Breitbart.</p><p>  Ms. Gabbard's campaign is historic even in a race with many potential firsts. She was elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives when she was 21, becoming the youngest woman to join a United States state legislature. When she was elected as representative for Hawaii in 2012, she was the first Samoan-American and first Hindu member of Congress.</p><p>  Her political views are unusual among Democratic candidates. She has a history of making anti-gay statements and worked for an anti-gay advocacy group run by her father. (She has since apologized and said her past views were wrong.)</p><p>  And she has tapped into increasingly bipartisan passion: wariness of big tech. The lawsuit filed Thursday said Ms. Gabbard had joined Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is also vying to be the Democratic Party nominee, in calling for large tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon to be broken up.</p><p>  ''Google's discriminatory actions against my campaign are reflective of how dangerous their complete dominance over internet search is, and how the increasing dominance of big tech companies over our public discourse threatens our core American values,'' Ms. Gabbard said in a statement. ''This is a threat to free speech, fair elections, and to our democracy, and I intend to fight back on behalf of all Americans.''</p><p>  While assertions of tech firms tipping the scales against political opponents are largely unproven, the lawsuit taps into concern that tech companies aren't transparent about how decisions are made and they aren't held accountable when things go wrong.</p><p>  Last week, senators homed in on Google in a subcommittee hearing about censorship in search. The hearing aired many largely unproven claims that Google tilts search results against conservative viewpoints.</p><p>  ''Google's control over what people hear, read, watch and see is unprecedented,'' said Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican from Texas who led the subcommittee. ''With that market power, Google can and often does control our discourse.''</p><p>  Gabbard campaign workers sent an email to a Google representative on June 27 at 9:30 p.m. once they realized the account had been suspended. In emails reviewed by The New York Times, the campaign sent Google a screenshot of a notice of suspension for ''problems with billing information or violations of our advertising policies.''</p><p>  The account was reactivated at 3:30 a.m. on June 28. In the email announcing that it had reinstated the account, Google wrote that the company temporarily suspended the campaign's account to verify billing information and policy compliance, but offered no other explanation for what had happened.</p><p>  The campaign said it had opened the Google advertising account in February and had bought ads on Google search before the suspension. It said there was no problem with its billing information and that it had not violated Google's terms of service.</p><p>  ''To this day, Google has not provided a straight answer -- let alone a credible one -- as to why Tulsi's political speech was silenced when millions of people wanted to hear from her,'' the lawsuit said.</p><p>  Without the ads, the Tulsi 2020 website, which has links for donations and information about the goals of her candidacy, appears in the first page of search results for ''Tulsi Gabbard.'' But it is below stories and videos about her -- selected by a Google algorithm -- and after her Wikipedia page, her Twitter profile and her congressional website.</p><p>  Roughly half of the candidates who participated in the first Democratic debates have bought ads to appear at the top of search results for their names.</p><p>  With the exception of Senator Bernie Sanders, who is one of the leaders in fund-raising among the Democrats, the candidates buying Google search ads are polling in the low single digits, suggesting that the ads are more important to candidates with less name recognition.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: The presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard said Google violated her free speech rights when it suspended her ad account after the Democratic debate in June.

Indeed, one of the reasons why we're so concerned about efforts to \"regulate\" content moderation practices on social media is that focusing on the manner in which those big, centralized platforms work could serve to stifle newer, more innovative platforms, whose very set up may inherently deal with the \"problems\" in the first place (see my protocols, not platforms[1] discussion for one example). There are a few interesting platforms out there trying to take a different approach to nearly everything -- and one of the more well known is Mastodon, an open source \"federated\" system that is sort of somewhat like Twitter. If you somehow have missed the Mastodon boat, I'd recommend the long piece Sarah Jeong wrote about it two years ago, which is a pretty good intro[2] to the topic. The really short version, though, is that anyone can set up their own Mastodon community and, if others so choose, they may \"federate\" with other Mastodon communities. </p><p>You could build a Mastodon instance that is totally isolated from others, or you could build one that connects to others and allows \"toots\" to go from one instance of Mastodon to others. And, of course, the federating can change over time. It's kind of neat in that it allows for multiple communities, who can set different rules, norms and standards, and thus you get much more widespread experimentation. And, unlike a fully centralized system, like Twitter, the ability for different instances to just \"go there own way\" if they disagree, allows for much greater flexibility, without a centralized content moderation impossibility. I'm still more interested in much more fully decentralized protocol-based systems, but a federated system like Mastodon, that allows for a distributed set of mini-centralized instances that can join together or separate as needed, is still pretty fascinating. However, it got more fascinating and interesting earlier this month when the social network Gab moved to Mastodon. If you haven't followed this space at all, Gab likes to call itself the \"free speech alternative\" to Twitter, but in practice that has meant that it's the place that many trolls, racists and other general assholes have gathered after being kicked off of Twitter. Gab announced, back in May, that it was planning to shift its platform to Mastodon[3], setting up its own instance. In theory, this solved some \"problems\" that Gab had been facing -- starting with the fact that Apple and Google had removed Gab's mobile app from their app stores (something Gab sued over[4], in a strategy that was not very successful[5]). Since there are a bunch of Mastodon apps that allow users to log into any particular Mastodon instance, Gab itself made it clear that this was a key reason for the move:<url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/1BoQp5BOf\">https://imgur.com/1BoQp5BOf</url> course, building on top of someone else's better tested open source code probably also helps Gab with the long list of technical issues[6] the site was having. And then there's the pure troll factor. Besides harboring social media trolls, Gab, as a company has always sort of gleefully taken on a trollish roll in the way it works as a company as well. And, considering that part of the very reason that Mastodon's creator, Eugen \"Gargron\" Rochko, set up Mastodon in the first place was to build an alternative to Twitter that was free of Nazis, assholes and trolls... it was a truly trollish move to jump onto that platform and at least imply to many a plan to \"invade\" (or, perhaps we should say brigading[7]) the wider \"fediverse\" of Mastodon. The switch over happened earlier this month[8] and it's been fascinating to watch how it's all played out. The shortest summary might be that the federated model has shown to be somewhat resilient so far. Mastodon itself put out a statement[9] urging various Mastodon instances not to federate with Gab and also suggesting that the various Mastdodon app developers choose to blacklist Gab's domains from their apps (meaning that Gab's plan to use this to get back into the app store might not work as well as planned). The Verge has a long, in-depth article about how all of this is playing out[10], and it seems like, as a federated system is designed to do, different parts of the system are experimenting and figuring out what makes sense. Most of the other instances have decided they don't want to federate with Gab.If you join a major Mastodon instance right now, chances are you won't be connected to Gab. 'All the admins that I know, that I interact with myself, have already blocked Gab,' says Rochko \u2014 including Mastodon.Social. 'Essentially, they're isolated.'As for the various app makers, they're figuring out what they want to do:This has turned app access into a battlefield. Developers can lock Gab out by disabling login options to the instance or completely blocking content from its servers. And several have done just that. Mastodon lists six major mobile apps on its homepage. Four of them \u2014 the Android client Tusky and the iOS apps Toot!, Mast, and Amaroq \u2014 block Gab in some fashion. Amaroq developer John Gabelmann banned Gab to avoid potential problems with the App Store. 'My core objective is to keep Amaroq publicly available and to abide by all Apple policies, which keep unmoderated extremist/hateful content off the store,' he tells The Verge. 'If your network is large enough and unmoderated enough to get the negative attention of Apple, Amaroq will follow Apple's policies.' Mast's creator Shihab Mehboob, by contrast, blocked Gab after users requested it. He's gotten one-star reviews from angry Gab users, but 'if hate speech is masquerading as free speech on an app I've built, it's upon myself to somehow moderate that and reduce it where possible,' he says. 'I understand that the Fediverse is intended to be open and entirely at the user's discretion as to what they want to see/use/partake in, but that shouldn't cover Nazi-based ideologies. There has to be a line drawn somewhere.' Other app developers maintain that this blocking doesn't fit Mastodon's mission. The Android-based Fedilab app's free version initially blocked Gab because of Play Store content policy fears. But the ban has since been lifted. 'I will simply not block instances with the app,' wrote[11] Fedilab's developer[12]. 'I clearly think that's not my role If you want a strong block, it's in the hands of social network developers or your admins.' And the developer of Subway Tooter, who goes by Tateisu, is skeptical that stores will censure apps for supporting Gab. 'They can run their web app on a web browser,' Tateisu points out. 'If Google wants to ban it, they should start from their Chrome web browser.'This is all quite interesting. It's also the kind of experimentation and more distributed decision-making we'd like to see more of online. This is not a truly distributed system where the power is moved all the way out to the ends, but it is a federated system where the power is moved to various nodes -- leading to more competition and variety. The fact that most of the major Mastodon instances have said they don't want to federate or deal with Gab is an expression of preferences, and in many ways a better overall system than one in which a single company is making the decisions. And it's much better than politicians telling companies what they need to do. Of course, in a world without Section 230 -- or one with a nonsensical requirement for \"neutrality\" in platform moderation -- would these options even be available?Permalink[13] | Comments[14] |

What new artificial intelligence service will blossom to become the next Amazon Alexa or Google Home? Can self-driving car technology take a meaningful step forward?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CES, the sprawling consumer electronics trade show that opened Tuesday and runs through Friday in Las Vegas, may provide a clue when it serves up a first look at the hot technology trends for the year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Will the rise of video streaming services accelerate following the successful launch of Disney Plus late in 2019? Are high resolution 8K TVs ready for prime time? What does the future hold for e-sports and smart cities?</p><p>Companies will launch products or demonstrate technologies in all of these categories and more at CES.</p><p>\"The technology trends that are driving a lot of what is happening at the show is the rollout of 5G as well as artificial intelligence - be it in transportation, health care and a variety of other industries,\" said Karen Chupka, executive vice president of CES for the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on the show. \"Those two trends are showing up in almost all categories across the show.\"</p><p>CES is expected to bring 170,000 attendees to the Las Vegas Convention Center and nearby venues - 60,000 of whom come from outside the U.S. Some 4,500 exhibitors will take over 2.9 million square feet for the show.</p><p>It is the world's biggest circus tent for consumer electronics, where all kinds of interesting technologies and cool gadgets vie for attention. About 40 San Diego area companies will exhibit, including cellular technology giant Qualcomm, Rancho Bernardo's Sony Electronics, gaming/e-sports outfit Turtle Beach Corp., mobile hotspot maker Inseego, and mobile health records provider Humetrix.</p><p>Over the course of the show, CES spotlights hot button issues in tech. This year it's privacy. Apple, which hasn't directly participated in CES for more than 20 years, has made privacy a focal point of its marketing. On Tuesday, Apple's Senior Director of Global Privacy, Jane Horvath, is scheduled to join Facebook Chief Privacy Officer Erin Eagan, U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter and others in a roundtable discussion on what consumers can expect in terms of privacy with their electronics.</p><p>Here's a look at some additional trends expected to be showcased at the show.</p><p>8K, streaming and OLED</p><p>TVs are among the most eye-catching products at CES. This year, a top story line will be whether manufacturers try to push super high resolution 8K televisions into the mainstream market.</p><p>8K TVs are available today from Samsung, Sony and others. These ultra-vivid screens are expensive, however, and they typically come in large screen sizes of 55 inches and above. That makes them a niche product.</p><p>\"What I am curious to see is whether manufacturers expand on 8K and make big announcements around full lineups of 8K TVs that are much more affordably priced than they are now,\" said Paul Gagnon, executive director for Consumer Electronics Research and Analysis for IHS-Markit.</p><p>For now, there is very little that can be viewed in 8K, so TV makers would be trying to convince consumers to upgrade based on 8K content coming sometime down the road, said Gagnon.</p><p>Another thing to watch is how the popularity of streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu and Disney-Plus plays out for TV makers.</p><p>\"Streaming services are one of the most important reasons why people buy new TVs,\" said Gagnon. \"If you have a six- or seven-year-old smart TV, it might not necessarily work with the new streaming services. So a lot of people are upgrading to get access.\"</p><p>In addition, 2020 could be a pivotal year for OLED TVs, which serve up very crisp picture quality on ultra-thin screens.</p><p>OLED TVs remain expensive, especially when compared with LCD TVs that sometimes are one-third the price for the same screen size. For instance, where an OLED TV can currently be purchased in the range of $1,500 to $2,000, an LCD set in an equivalent size can be had for $500.</p><p>\"There has been a slowdown in OLED sales worldwide because of how fast LCD prices have fallen in 2019,\" said Gagnon. \"It is not unreasonable to say that for the OLED TV category, it is a make or break year in 2020. There has to be some significant movement on pricing.\"</p><p>5G momentum</p><p>Mobile network operators worldwide, including Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T and Sprint in the U.S., began rolling out faster, more reliable 5G cellular networks in 2019, and coverage is expected to expand dramatically this year.</p><p>While smartphones will lead the way for 5G, these new networks have been designed to enable wireless connectivity to a much broader array of devices, from cars to stoplights to health gadgets to environmental sensors.</p><p>\"5G is rolling out,\" said Gagnon. \"There are 5G products in the marketplace, so I think we'll see a lot of that at CES, and not just phones, but in other products, too.</p><p>\"We'll see some announcements from the big personal computer makers about 5G modems being embedded in laptops, for example,\" he continued. \"And certainly in automotive we are going to see some things around 5G.\"</p><p>Connected vehicles</p><p>Top automakers have been coming to CES for years to show off the latest driver assist, navigation and infotainment systems. This year is no different, with the march toward autonomous vehicles underpinning a lot of what car makers are doing.</p><p>Qualcomm is expected to make news at CES on the autonomy front. The San Diego company has established itself as a key supplier of connectivity, telematics, and infotainment systems to the auto industry. Now Qualcomm is making the leap into autonomous driving, offering up a technology system to power self-driving vehicles.</p><p>Details will be released at the show. But the move isn't a surprise. The company received regulatory permission in 2017 to test self-driving cars in San Diego County. It has conducted experiments on streets near its headquarters and on local highways. One of the most recent tests occurred in October when a portion of Highway 905 was closed while three Qualcomm self-driving cars maneuvered along the roadway.</p><p>\"I think we have a fantastic starting point,\" said Nakul Duggal, senior vice president and head of automotive product management for Qualcomm. \"Autonomous driving is just going to be transformative to the auto industry because it is going to bring the right technologies: machine learning, sensors and really advanced capabilities to the next generations of cars.\"</p><p>Qualcomm is also touting CV2X, or Cellular Vehicle to Everything, at the show. This peer-to-peer technology lets vehicles communicate directly with other nearby vehicles and smart cities infrastructure at distances beyond line of sight. The technology is in its early stages of deployment, but Ford and several other car makers are backing it.</p><p>\"CV2X is going to be a game changer for the industry,\" said Duggal. \"It is going to be directly responsible for avoiding accidents and saving lives.\"</p><p>Artificial intelligence</p><p>Digital devices throw off a lot of data. Making sense of it so it's useful often relies on what's known as artificial intelligence.</p><p>These algorithms hunt for patterns. Probably the most common AI experience for many people is having targeted digital ads pop up based on an Internet search.</p><p>But AI powers a lot more than that. Voice assistants, language translation, biometrics, facial detection and recognition all rely on AI. Those cool smartphone camera filters come from AI. So does the processing that creates focused, centered photos even in low light.</p><p>Much of the heavy lifting for AI occurs in data centers. But powerful processors on devices these days are bringing AI closer to users.</p><p>Device-based AI chips will likely find their way into a number of consumer devices this year, ranging from smartphones and smart speakers to wearables, according to consulting firm Deloitte's Technology, Media and Telecommunications Forecast for 2020.</p><p>Deloitte predicts that on-device AI will be popular with businesses too. Robotics, smart cities sensors, security cameras, environmental sensors and other Internet of Things gadgets could tap the technology to deliver insights from data closer to the source.</p><p>\"John Deere is back this year with how AI is transforming the farming world,\" said Chupka, the executive vice president for CES. \"Companies realize they need to develop a technology strategy for their own growth, and CES is the place where people showcase that.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NAPDNW-ndn-2089480319</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NAPDNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXT-54Y1-JC3H-046V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">317179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1424\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Naples Daily News (Naples, Florida) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Naples Daily News (Florida)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 8, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC000D52L</classCode><className>TURTLE BEACH CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002BHJ</classCode><className>SONY ELECTRONICS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Puisque le droit de la concurrence n'y arrive pas, que les r\u00e9glementations sont contourn\u00e9es ou d\u00e9tourn\u00e9es \u00e0 leur profit, et que les Gafa imposent leurs propres r\u00e8gles aux march\u00e9s, faisons dispara\u00eetre le probl\u00e8me en organisant leur d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement ! Ou m\u00eame, encore mieux, les Am\u00e9ricains vont le faire pour nous.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIRE AUSSI &gt;&gt; Rapha\u00ebl Grably : L'antitrust, seule limite aux Gafa ?</emphasis></p><p>N'y comptons pas. Il n'y a aucune chance, \u00e0 un horizon raisonnable, qu'un tel sc\u00e9nario se produise aux Etats-Unis. \u00c0 la fois parce qu'il n'y a pas consensus - ni \u00e9conomique ni politique -, que le sujet est techniquement compliqu\u00e9, et que les cons\u00e9quences anticip\u00e9es sont contest\u00e9es.  </p><h>D\u00e9couper Facebook ?</h><p>Le d\u00e9coupage de Facebook est probablement le seul o\u00f9 un consensus pourrait \u00eatre envisageable. Il existe un sch\u00e9ma relativement simple, celui de la transformation des trois applications Facebook, WhatsApp et Instagram en entit\u00e9s concurrentes. Ce pourrait \u00eatre acceptable politiquement, relever de d\u00e9cisions strictement juridiques remettant en cause les acquisitions de WhatsApp et Instagram, sans rencontrer d'opposition majeure des utilisateurs.  </p><p>En revanche, les sc\u00e9narios de d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement des autres <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Big Tech</emphasis> sont juridiquement bien plus d\u00e9licats, et leurs cons\u00e9quences encore moins \u00e9videntes. Par exemple pour Amazon : d\u00e9couper son activit\u00e9 en s\u00e9parant les offres de son activit\u00e9 de \"place de march\u00e9\" -  o\u00f9 plus de 2 millions de commer\u00e7ants vendent leurs produits - de celle de vendeur en direct ne produirait tr\u00e8s probablement pas le d\u00e9verrouillage du march\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire, alors que perdureraient bien d'autres pratiques au moins aussi pr\u00e9judiciables. </p><h>Contr\u00f4ler, oui, d\u00e9manteler, non</h><p>De fait, la prudence est de mise. Quand on imagine un sc\u00e9nario de d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement, deux proc\u00e9dures sont imaginables. La premi\u00e8re, judiciaire, serait longue et incertaine - la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence fr\u00e9quente au d\u00e9sossage d'ATT oublie souvent qu'entre le d\u00e9but de la proc\u00e9dure et la proposition d'autodissolution par ATT, qui anticipait l'\u00e9chec de sa d\u00e9fense, huit ann\u00e9es se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9es. La seconde, l\u00e9gislative, n\u00e9cessiterait, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 l'importance des enjeux, un accord bipartite au minimum. Hypoth\u00e8se largement improbable.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIRE AUSSI &gt;&gt; Faire payer les Gafa, mission quasi impossible</emphasis></p><p>Des mesures pourraient certes \u00eatre prises par le Congr\u00e8s pour contr\u00f4ler les exc\u00e8s des g\u00e9ants du num\u00e9rique. Surtout si Joe Biden est \u00e9lu \u00e0 la Maison-Blanche : il pourrait s'appuyer sur les propositions que devrait faire  tr\u00e8s prochainement le parlementaire d\u00e9mocrate David Cicilline, qui a pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 une commission bipartite dont les conclusions pourraient \u00eatre consensuelles. Mais pronostiquer un accord politique de plus grande ampleur n'est pas vraisemblable : les Gafa sont les champions nationaux des Am\u00e9ricains ! Entraver ces entreprises qui investissent et innovent le plus est impensable dans l'Am\u00e9rique post-Covid en guerre technologique avec les Chinois. Mark Zuckerberg ou l'ancien patron de Google Eric Schmidt ne se privent pas de le r\u00e9p\u00e9ter. </p><h>L'impuissance europ\u00e9enne</h><p>Rien \u00e9manant des Etats-Unis n'entravera donc  les actions des Gafa en Europe. Une initiative europ\u00e9enne est une menace peu cr\u00e9dible, en tout cas dans un avenir proche. Les Am\u00e9ricains ne l'accepteraient pas. En 2015, le pr\u00e9sident Obama qualifiait de \"protectionnistes\" les proc\u00e9dures engag\u00e9es par les Europ\u00e9ens pour s'attaquer au contournement fiscal ou aux pratiques anticoncurrentielles de ces groupes. Aujourd'hui, Donald Trump prend des mesures de r\u00e9torsion face \u00e0 la taxe fran\u00e7aise sur les services num\u00e9riques et bloque les travaux de l'OCDE destin\u00e9s \u00e0 mettre en place une fiscalit\u00e9 plus \u00e9quitable. Une menace europ\u00e9enne de d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement, autrement plus grave, sonnerait comme une d\u00e9claration de guerre.  </p><p>* Gafa.

C'est l'une des rares certitudes du moment : alors que tant d'entreprises sont \u00e0 la peine, que des pans entiers de l'\u00e9conomie mondiale sont \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat, les grands noms de la Tech, et plus particuli\u00e8rement les g\u00e9ants am\u00e9ricains, sortiront renforc\u00e9s de la crise. Plus puissants, plus riches, plus conqu\u00e9rants. Depuis six mois, les fameux Gafa (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) encha\u00eenent les records \u00e0 Wall Street, comme s'ils \u00e9voluaient dans un monde parall\u00e8le. Un exemple parmi d'autres ? Depuis le printemps, le fabricant de l'iPhone a vu sa capitalisation boursi\u00e8re s'envoler de plus de 1 000 milliards de dollars. A elle seule, la firme \u00e0 la pomme croqu\u00e9e vaut plus que l'ensemble des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s fran\u00e7aises composant le CAC 40, l'indice phare de la Bourse de Paris. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIRE AUSSI &gt;&gt; Gafa, le mirage du d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement</emphasis></p><p>Parce que la p\u00e9riode du confinement et l'essor du t\u00e9l\u00e9travail ont d\u00e9multipli\u00e9 les usages num\u00e9riques, parce que les infrastructures Internet ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 leur robustesse et parce qu'enfin, le tra\u00e7age de l'\u00e9pid\u00e9mie a rendu leurs outils indispensables, les stars de la Silicon Valley se sont immisc\u00e9es un peu plus profond\u00e9ment dans nos vies. Formidable acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateur de la transformation num\u00e9rique, le Covid-19 a tout bonnement rendu les Gafa intouchables, ou presque. Un nouveau statut qui trouve sa traduction dans leur impressionnant parcours boursier, mais qui transpara\u00eet aussi \u00e0 travers les montagnes de cash accumul\u00e9es par les uns et les autres.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIRE AUSSI &gt;&gt; Faire payer les Gafa, mission quasi impossible</emphasis></p><h>Parenth\u00e8se enchant\u00e9e</h><p>De quoi nourrir le d\u00e9bat sur les profits ind\u00e9cents engrang\u00e9s par ces acteurs et relancer les initiatives visant \u00e0 mieux les r\u00e9guler.

Les angles d'attaques ne manquent pas, et l'audition tr\u00e8s m\u00e9diatis\u00e9e, cet \u00e9t\u00e9, des quatre grands patrons de la Tech am\u00e9ricaine devant une commission du Congr\u00e8s pourrait laisser penser que cette parenth\u00e8se enchant\u00e9e est sur le point de se terminer pour ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s. </p><p>Rien n'est moins s\u00fbr en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, car le contexte n'est plus le m\u00eame qu'avant la pand\u00e9mie. Mobilis\u00e9s sur les fronts sanitaire et \u00e9conomique, les Etats les plus offensifs sur ces questions ont d'autres priorit\u00e9s \u00e0 traiter que le dossier des Gafa. Surtout, politiquement, la donne a chang\u00e9 aux Etats-Unis : si Donald Trump continue de s'en prendre r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement aux \"Big Tech\", il le fait principalement \u00e0 des fins \u00e9lectoralistes, parce qu'il per\u00e7oit ces groupes comme des alli\u00e9s objectifs du camp d\u00e9mocrate. Mais en pleine crise \u00e9conomique et sur fond de tensions croissantes avec le rival chinois, jamais le pr\u00e9sident am\u00e9ricain ne prendra le risque d'affaiblir ces nouveaux fleurons nationaux. Comme les compagnies p\u00e9troli\u00e8res ou le complexe militaro-industriel hier, les Gafa sont devenus des pi\u00e8ces ma\u00eetresses, au service de la puissance am\u00e9ricaine, ce qui explique l'opposition de Washington \u00e0 tout projet multilat\u00e9ral de taxation des g\u00e9ants du num\u00e9rique, et la frilosit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures engag\u00e9es outre-Atlantique : en dehors d'enqu\u00eates cibl\u00e9es sur le champ concurrentiel, les menaces de d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement semblent aujourd'hui bel et bien \u00e9cart\u00e9es pour les titans californiens. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">LIRE AUSSI &gt;&gt; Apple, un ami qui vous veut du bien</emphasis></p><h>Des \"utilities\" num\u00e9riques</h><p>Dans ce contexte, l'Europe n'a pas dit son dernier mot et continuera de faire ce qu'elle peut sur le terrain fiscal ou sur celui de la concurrence. Mais on sent bien que ses moyens d'action ont touch\u00e9 leurs limites. Pour r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrer le rapport de force avec les superpuissances de la Tech, de nouveaux leviers doivent \u00eatre actionn\u00e9s, de nouvelles pistes doivent \u00eatre explor\u00e9es. La pand\u00e9mie a rouvert le jeu de ce point de vue, en changeant le statut des Gafa, devenus le temps du confinement des fournisseurs de services essentiels (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">utilities</emphasis> en anglais). Au m\u00eame titre que les op\u00e9rateurs t\u00e9l\u00e9coms, les compagnies de gaz ou d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, les g\u00e9ants am\u00e9ricains ont \u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7us pendant cette p\u00e9riode in\u00e9dite comme des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de services aux collectivit\u00e9s, des \"utilities\" num\u00e9riques, contribuant soudain au \"bien commun\". Un virage plus important qu'il n'en a l'air, car il ouvre des perspectives int\u00e9ressantes : par nature, le champ d'action de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s est en effet balis\u00e9 par une forme de r\u00e9gulation, sur le plan tarifaire notamment. Il l\u00e9gitime un certain droit de regard de la puissance publique, et favorise sur le papier un dialogue plus constructif avec les autorit\u00e9s. Ne nous enflammons pas...

Mais l\u2019industrie du num\u00e9rique n\u2019est plus en odeur de saintet\u00e9.

Les r\u00e9publicains, Donald Trump en t\u00eate, accusent les sites de censurer les voix conservatrices. Les d\u00e9mocrates, eux, d\u00e9noncent l\u2019exploitation des donn\u00e9es personnelles et la d\u00e9sinformation qui, estiment-ils, ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9faite de Hillary Clinton en 2016. Leur fureur est mont\u00e9e d\u2019un cran lorsque Facebook a refus\u00e9, au nom de la sacro-sainte libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression, de censurer une pub totalement mensong\u00e8re contre le candidat Joe Biden concoct\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00e9quipe de Trump. Elizabeth Warren s\u2019est amus\u00e9e \u00e0 lancer \u00e0 son tour un spot annon\u00e7ant \u2013\u00a0faussement\u00a0\u2013 que Mark Zuckerberg soutenait la r\u00e9\u00e9lection de Donald Trump. Facebook l\u2019a diffus\u00e9\u00a0!

Pour l\u2019occasion, il avait troqu\u00e9 son sempiternel tee-shirt pour un costume-cravate et s\u2019est point\u00e9 avec une armada de lobbyistes et de conseillers en communication. Ce qui n\u2019a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 le jeu de massacre. Pendant six\u00a0heures, les \u00e9lus l\u2019ont bombard\u00e9 de questions souvent hostiles sur son projet de cryptomonnaie, la protection des donn\u00e9es et le degr\u00e9 d\u2019infox qu\u2019il tol\u00e9rait. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab\u00a0Pourrais-je, par exemple, diffuser des pubs sur Facebook contre des r\u00e9publicains disant qu\u2019ils ont vot\u00e9 en faveur du Green New Deal [son projet de lutte contre le r\u00e9chauffement climatique]\u00a0?\u00a0\u00bb</emphasis>a demand\u00e9 la d\u00e9mocrate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab\u00a0Je ne sais pas la r\u00e9ponse de t\u00eate\u00a0\u00bb,</emphasis>a r\u00e9pondu le patron de Facebook avant de l\u00e2cher\u00a0: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab\u00a0Je pense que oui, probablement.\u00a0\u00bb \u00ab\u00a0Le manque total de v\u00e9rification des pubs politiques est-il, \u00e0 votre avis, un probl\u00e8me potentiel\u00a0?\u00a0\u00bb</emphasis>a poursuivi la jeune femme. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab\u00a0Je pense qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas bien de mentir et de placer des pubs mensong\u00e8res,</emphasis>a-t-il r\u00e9torqu\u00e9, visiblement mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dans une d\u00e9mocratie, je crois que les gens devraient \u00eatre capables de voir par eux-m\u00eames ce que disent les hommes politiques et juger de leur caract\u00e8re.\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lepoint.fr#\">Cliquez ici pour Image, Audio ou Vid\u00e9o</url>Provocation. Elizabeth Warren, favorite de la campagne d\u00e9mocrate, appelle, sur cette affiche \u00e0 destination des employ\u00e9s de la Silicon Valley, \u00e0 briser les monopoles des g\u00e9ants technologiques.                                                             Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, les autorit\u00e9s de r\u00e9glementation am\u00e9ricaines avaient fait preuve de beaucoup d\u2019indulgence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des Gafam. Mais, \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019ils s\u2019emparent de pans entiers de l\u2019\u00e9conomie, les plaintes se multiplient. Amazon, qui contr\u00f4le 50\u00a0% du commerce sur Internet, est accus\u00e9 de privil\u00e9gier les produits de sa marque sur sa plateforme au d\u00e9triment de ceux vendus par des tiers. Google, responsable de 92\u00a0% des recherches en ligne, favoriserait, lui aussi, ses services et abuserait, avec Facebook, de sa position dominante sur le march\u00e9 publicitaire. Quant \u00e0 Apple, on lui reproche de faire la pluie et le beau temps sur la s\u00e9lection des applications de sa boutique. Bien s\u00fbr, les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s rejettent ces accusations. Leurs services offrent de nombreux avantages aux utilisateurs et sont loin d\u2019\u00eatre monopolistiques. La preuve\u00a0? Par exemple, Amazon n\u2019occupe qu\u2019une faible portion du secteur de la distribution.\u00a0   5\u00a0  milliards de dollars\u00a0C\u2019est l\u2019amende que la Federal Trade Commission a approuv\u00e9 en juillet. En septembre, c\u2019est Google qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 170\u00a0millions de dollars d\u2019amende pour avoir recueilli, via YouTube, des informations priv\u00e9es sur des enfants destin\u00e9es \u00e0 les cibler avec des publicit\u00e9s.\u00a0   Plaintes.\u00a0Le 9\u00a0septembre, un groupe de procureurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux s\u2019est donc retrouv\u00e9 devant la Cour supr\u00eame \u00e0 Washington. Un cadre th\u00e9\u00e2tral pour une d\u00e9claration fracassante. Les procureurs de cinquante Etats ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019ouvrir une enqu\u00eate sur Google. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab\u00a0Il y a des indices montrant, selon nous, que ses pratiques commerciales ont pu r\u00e9duire le choix du consommateur, \u00e9touffer l\u2019innovation, violer la confidentialit\u00e9\u00a0\u00bb,</emphasis>a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Ken Paxton, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Texas. Ils ont \u00e9galement Facebook dans le collimateur. Et ils ne sont pas les seuls. Ces derniers mois, le minist\u00e8re de la Justice, la Federal Trade Commission (FTC, l\u2019\u00e9quivalent de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la concurrence, de la consommation et de la r\u00e9pression des fraudes) et la Chambre des repr\u00e9sentants ont lanc\u00e9 une avalanche d\u2019enqu\u00eates contre les Big Tech pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il fallait restreindre leur influence et moderniser les lois antimonopole \u00e9crites \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque des arri\u00e8re-arri\u00e8re-grands-parents de Zuckerberg.\u00a0   Vont-elles aboutir\u00a0? Sur quoi\u00a0? Il est trop t\u00f4t pour le dire. Les Etats-Unis n\u2019ont pas une Margrethe Vestager, la commissaire europ\u00e9enne \u00e0 la Concurrence. La FTC et le minist\u00e8re de la Justice sont \u00e0 couteaux tir\u00e9s, le Congr\u00e8s est paralys\u00e9 par les divisions. Une chose est s\u00fbre\u00a0: on s\u2019achemine vers des batailles juridiques \u00e9piques, longues et co\u00fbteuses. L\u2019un des obstacles majeurs auxquels se heurtent les r\u00e9gulateurs, c\u2019est l\u2019ombre de Robert Bork. Ce juge conservateur, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en 2012, a \u00e9crit en 1978\u00a0\u00ab\u00a0Le paradoxe de l\u2019antitrust\u00a0\u00bb, dans lequel il reproche \u00e0 la justice d\u2019avoir fait preuve d\u2019un interventionnisme excessif dans la lutte contre les monopoles, ce qui a nui \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9conomie. Les juges, \u00e9crit ce chantre du laisser-faire, devraient se poser une seule question quand ils examinent un dossier antitrust\u00a0: le consommateur est-il l\u00e9s\u00e9, en clair, son porte-monnaie souffre-t-il d\u2019une hausse des prix\u00a0?\u00a0   Cette interpr\u00e9tation tr\u00e8s \u00e9troite de la loi, devenue la doctrine des tribunaux, a limit\u00e9 le nombre de proc\u00e8s (entre 1970\u00a0et 1999, il y en avait en moyenne 15\u00a0par an, mais ce chiffre est tomb\u00e9 \u00e0 trois entre 2000\u00a0et 2014\u00a0et a favoris\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9normes fusions). La philosophie de Bork a notamment prot\u00e9g\u00e9 les Big Tech. Il est en effet difficile de prouver que le client est l\u00e9s\u00e9 lorsque Google et Facebook offrent des services gratuits et Amazon des produits bon march\u00e9. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab\u00a0Le seul fait qu\u2019une entreprise grandit et innove plus que ses rivales ne conduit pas \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019elle a viol\u00e9 les lois antimonopole\u00a0\u00bb,</emphasis>analyse Mark McCareins, professeur \u00e0 l\u2019universit\u00e9 Northwestern.\u00a0  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lepoint.fr#\">Cliquez ici pour Image, Audio ou Vid\u00e9o</url>Tentaculaire.

En juin, lors de la remise des dipl\u00f4mes \u00e0 l\u2019ultralib\u00e9rale universit\u00e9 de Chicago, le professeur Luigi Zingales a exhort\u00e9 les \u00e9tudiants \u00e0 s\u2019attaquer aux g\u00e9ants du num\u00e9rique comme les colons s\u2019\u00e9taient battus contre la Compagnie britannique des Indes orientales lors de la Tea Party \u00e0 Boston. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab\u00a0Nos lois antitrust ne peuvent rien faire contre ce type de monopoles.

Plus facile \u00e0 dire qu\u2019\u00e0 faire. Outre l\u2019hostilit\u00e9 des juges, les r\u00e9gulateurs sont confront\u00e9s \u00e0 de formidables adversaires. Ces cinq derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, les Gafam ont d\u00e9bours\u00e9 des sommes record en lobbying \u2013\u00a0plus de 55\u00a0millions de dollars en 2018. Cette ann\u00e9e, Amazon et Facebook arrivent en t\u00eate des entreprises am\u00e9ricaines qui ont d\u00e9pens\u00e9 le plus pour la d\u00e9fense de leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats, selon le Center for Responsive Politics. Elles arrosent les hommes politiques, financent les think tanks, organisent des conf\u00e9rences et font tout pour museler leurs critiques. Google aurait ainsi eu la peau d\u2019un chercheur du New America\u00a0: dans un article, il s\u2019\u00e9tait f\u00e9licit\u00e9 des sanctions financi\u00e8res impos\u00e9es au groupe par les Europ\u00e9ens.\u00a0   En d\u00e9cembre 2018, le PDG de Google, Sundar Pichai, a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner au Congr\u00e8s sur ses pratiques lors d\u2019une audition houleuse. Puis, dans la soir\u00e9e, il s\u2019est rendu \u00e0 une grande r\u00e9ception de No\u00ebl organis\u00e9e par Google dans un restaurant du Wharf, un quartier branch\u00e9 de Washington. Il y avait l\u00e0 des centaines de membres de l\u2019administration et tout le gotha politique, dont Darrell Issa, un parlementaire r\u00e9publicain qui, quelques heures plus t\u00f4t, l\u2019avait questionn\u00e9 lors de l\u2019audition.\u00a0   63\u00a0%\u00a0   des Am\u00e9ricains qui se d\u00e9clarent d\u00e9mocrates et 60\u00a0% de ceux qui se d\u00e9clarent r\u00e9publicains approuvent un peu ou fortement le d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement des Big Tech par l\u2019annulation de r\u00e9centes fusions, telle l\u2019acquisition d\u2019Instagram par Facebook, selon un sondage YouGov/Data For Progress de septembre 2019.

Dans l\u2019Histoire, les tentatives de scission sont pourtant rares et n\u2019ont pas toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 couronn\u00e9es de succ\u00e8s. Le premier grand exemple, c\u2019est la Standard Oil en 1911.

En 1982, AT&amp;T, qui d\u00e9tenait un monopole sur le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, a \u00e9t\u00e9 divis\u00e9 \u00e0 son tour en 7\u00a0groupes. Cette d\u00e9cision au terme de huit ans de proc\u00e9dure a donn\u00e9 un coup de fouet \u00e0 la concurrence et \u00e0 l\u2019apparition, et a permis l\u2019\u00e9mergence, disent certains, de la t\u00e9l\u00e9phonie mobile.

He reflected on his decision, saying, \"The demands on sellers are too extreme.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon's system of returns was particularly unacceptable to him. When books are returned to the seller, shipping is paid upon delivery by the seller. The seller cannot refuse to receive the returned books, even though he has to bear the cost of the return and thus makes a loss on the transaction.</p><p>\"Changes to the regulations and fee increases would also happen suddenly,\" the man, who lives in Kyoto, lamented.</p><p>A Tokyo-based app development company has been selling an iPhone game app through Apple Inc., but this year was suddenly confronted with changes to the contract via an email. The contents of the email were to the effect that the fee paid to Apple would increase to 30% of app sales. The company had been paying only a few percent of its app sales as service fees for credit card payments.</p><p>It was a unilateral decision. Apple gave no explanation in response to email inquiries made by the app company. Their service fees swelled by several hundred million yen a year and the business, which had been performing well, was instantly at risk of a deficit. \"Apps get noticed when they become popular,\" the company's president, who is in his 40s, lamented. \"But we cannot defy Apple,\" he added.</p><p>The big technology companies hold significant market share in their fields of expertise. Are they applying pressure on companies that trade with them to ensure the profitability of their own businesses, supported by the power of their oligopoly? Antitrust authorities in various countries have commenced full-scale investigations.</p><p>Japanese regulators powerless</p><p>Giant technology companies such as Google LLC, Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., and Amazon.com Inc., which are collectively known as GAFA, expand their opportunities for online shops and app businesses on a global-scale through their own platforms, holding a huge market share and a large number of users. They cannot be avoided when doing business online. One app developer described them as \"godlike beings.\"</p><p>The Fair Trade Commission conducted a survey on the actual conditions of companies that do business with the GAFA firms. The survey, which was released in October, revealed that the companies are forced to unilaterally comply with the giants because of their oligopoly.</p><p>The FTC has warned the big tech companies that forcing sellers to accept returned goods or raising fees in a unilateral manner may represent an \"abuse of their superior position,\" which is prohibited by the Antimonopoly Law.</p><p>Kobe University Prof. Fumio Sensui pointed out that GAFA may be treating Japanese competition authorities with contempt.</p><p>\"The effectiveness of Japan's Antimonopoly Law is low in comparison with those of the European Union, and surcharges are also lower,\" he added. He argued that Japan needs a new law that serves as a \"weapon\" for authorities so that they can legally enforce demands for the disclosure of information from companies.</p><p>Demolition on the table</p><p>In the United States, the behavior of GAFA has become a point of concern for Congress.</p><p>\"If Amazon stops us from listing on its online shop site, we will go bankrupt.\"</p><p>A man testified at a public hearing in November at the U.S. House of Representatives. He runs a toy sales company in Texas with four full-time employees, and he explained how he was dependent on Amazon's site.</p><p>He testified that the company relies on sales through Amazon for 98% of its revenue. And he indicated his distress about his dependent position, saying that if Amazon told them to \"jump,\" they had to ask \"how high?\"</p><p>In the United States, investigations have started at each state level as well as in Congress and the Justice Department.</p><p>While the GAFA firms continue swelling, discussions about dismantling them has arisen in the United States.</p><p>Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren made an appeal at a rally in Iowa on Nov. 25, insisting that the big tech companies are causing problems for the U.S. economy. She said that Americans needed a president with the courage to break them up. Warren is a representative of the radical left in the party's candidacy struggles for the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Her statement was met with big cheers from the audience.</p><p>She has continued to criticize three GAFA companies -- Google, Facebook and Amazon -- saying that they have too much power. She said that they have used people's personal information to make profits while small-scale businesses were trampled underfoot.</p><p>She has received strong support from people who feel this disparity, such as the younger generation.</p><p>Meanwhile, it has become clear that the GAFA side is investing a lot of money in hiring lobbyists and engaging in political maneuvers.</p><p>The companies have taken steps to approach the U.S. administration.</p><p>For example, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had dinner with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in October, and Apple invited Trump to visit its computer factory in Texas on Nov. 20.</p><p>Bargaining between GAFA and regulatory agencies is also gaining intensity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YOMIUR-701339217</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YOMIUR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XP0-N751-DYX5-X4YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145202</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Yomiuri Shimbun All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Japan News</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 24822</issueNumber><edition>S Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 8, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

He reflected on his decision, saying, \u201cThe demands on sellers are too extreme.\u201d<br/> \u00a0Amazon\u2019s system of returns was particularly unacceptable to him. When books are returned to the seller, shipping is paid upon delivery by the seller. The seller cannot refuse to receive the returned books, even though he has to bear the cost of the return and thus makes a loss on the transaction.</p><p><br/> \u00a0\u201cChanges to the regulations and fee increases would also happen suddenly,\u201d the man, who lives in Kyoto, lamented.<br/> \u00a0A Tokyo-based app development company has been selling an iPhone game app through Apple Inc., but this year was suddenly confronted with changes to the contract via an email. The contents of the email were to the effect that the fee paid to Apple would increase to 30% of app sales. The company had been paying only a few percent of its app sales as service fees for credit card payments.<br/> \u00a0It was a unilateral decision. Apple gave no explanation in response to email inquiries made by the app company. Their service fees swelled by several hundred million yen a year and the business, which had been performing well, was instantly at risk of a deficit. \u201cApps get noticed when they become popular,\u201d the company\u2019s president, who is in his 40s, lamented. \u201cBut we cannot defy Apple,\u201d he added.<br/> \u00a0The big technology companies hold significant market share in their fields of expertise. Are they applying pressure on companies that trade with them to ensure the profitability of their own businesses, supported by the power of their oligopoly? Antitrust authorities in various countries have commenced full-scale investigations.</p><p>Japanese regulators powerless<br/> \u00a0Giant technology companies such as Google LLC, Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., and Amazon.com Inc., which are collectively known as GAFA, expand their opportunities for online shops and app businesses on a global-scale through their own platforms, holding a huge market share and a large number of users. They cannot be avoided when doing business online. One app developer described them as \u201cgodlike beings.\u201d<br/> \u00a0The Fair Trade Commission conducted a survey on the actual conditions of companies that do business with the GAFA firms. The survey, which was released in October, revealed that the companies are forced to unilaterally comply with the giants because of their oligopoly.<br/> \u00a0The FTC has warned the big tech companies that forcing sellers to accept returned goods or raising fees in a unilateral manner may represent an \u201cabuse of their superior position,\u201d which is prohibited by the Antimonopoly Law.<br/> \u00a0Kobe University Prof. Fumio Sensui pointed out that GAFA may be treating Japanese competition authorities with contempt.<br/> \u00a0\u201cThe effectiveness of Japan\u2019s Antimonopoly Law is low in comparison with those of the European Union, and surcharges are also lower,\u201d he added. He argued that Japan needs a new law that serves as a \u201cweapon\u201d for authorities so that they can legally enforce demands for the disclosure of information from companies.</p><p>Demolition on the table<br/> \u00a0In the United States, the behavior of GAFA has become a point of concern for Congress.\u00a0<br/> \u00a0\u201cIf Amazon stops us from listing on its online shop site, we will go bankrupt.\u201d<br/> \u00a0A man testified at a public hearing in November at the U.S. House of Representatives. He runs a toy sales company in Texas with four full-time employees, and he explained how he was dependent on Amazon\u2019s site.<br/> \u00a0He testified that the company relies on sales through Amazon for 98% of its revenue. And he indicated his distress about his dependent position, saying that if Amazon told them to \u201cjump,\u201d they had to ask \u201chow high?\u201d<br/> \u00a0In the United States, investigations have started at each state level as well as in Congress and the Justice Department.<br/> \u00a0While the GAFA firms continue swelling, discussions about dismantling them has arisen in the United States.<br/> \u00a0Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren made an appeal at a rally in Iowa on Nov. 25, insisting that the big tech companies are causing problems for the U.S. economy. She said that Americans needed a president with the courage to break them up. Warren is a representative of the radical left in the party\u2019s candidacy struggles for the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Her statement was met with big cheers from the audience.\u00a0<br/> \u00a0She has continued to criticize three GAFA companies \u2014 Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 saying that they have too much power. She said that they have used people\u2019s personal information to make profits while small-scale businesses were trampled underfoot.<br/> \u00a0She has received strong support from people who feel this disparity, such as the younger generation.<br/> \u00a0Meanwhile, it has become clear that the GAFA side is investing a lot of money in hiring lobbyists and engaging in political maneuvers.<br/> \u00a0The companies have taken steps to approach the U.S. administration.<br/> \u00a0For example, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had dinner with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in October, and Apple invited Trump to visit its computer factory in Texas on Nov. 20.<br/> \u00a0Bargaining between GAFA and regulatory agencies is also gaining intensity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>The Japan News (Japan)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANN-109848</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XP6-PK81-JDSH-246M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460173</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Asia News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Network</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62982\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 8, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

Of course, I didn't mean a brick and mortar type of bank but a digital bank of some kind. Seven years later this has obviously not come to pass but tech behemoths like Facebook are showing more interest in financial services. GAFA is an acronym for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, the largest tech companies in the world. </p><p>Historically, these companies had stayed out of finance for the most part but in recent years that has changed. Google[2] and Apple[3] both have payments products that have gained some traction in this country. Google and Amazon[4] have small business lending arms that are providing financing to their existing small business clients. Facebook has their popular Messenger program that is starting to attract new initiatives from both fintech startups[5] and big banks[6]. I would add PayPal into the mix here as well. They are on a fantastic run lately and their core payments business continues to expand. They also have a successful small business lending operation[7] but like Amazon and Google this is focused on extending credit to their existing customers. What would happen if these companies decided to expand their focus beyond their own customers and take on banks directly?McKinsey Report on BankingLast week McKinsey released their annual banking report[8] and it has created quite a stir[9] in banking circles. McKinsey argued that platform companies like Amazon are well positioned to challenge big banks: By creating a customer-centric, unified value proposition that extends beyond what users could previously obtain, digital pioneers are bridging the value chains of various industries to create 'ecosystems' that reduce customers' costs, increase convenience, provide them with new experiences, and whet their appetites for more. Not only do they have exceptional data that they exploit with remarkable effectiveness but also, more worrisome for banks, they are often\u00a0more central in the customer journeys\u00a0that include big financial decisions. Amazon has always had an almost maniacal dedication to customer experience. And CEO Jeff Bezos has shown a willingness to enter big new industries to disrupt them and quickly become a leading player. Finance is one of the biggest industries of all and one where customers are most dissatisfied with the status quo. Does this mean we will see Amazon Bank in the near future? Not necessarily. It was in the mid-90s when Bill Gates famously said that in the future banking services will be necessary but not banks. I think this quote applies very directly to the next 10 years. While there has been some talk about companies like Amazon obtaining a banking license[10] they may be able to offer many consumer banking services without one.The New Fintech Partners of TomorrowNow, Amazon clearly does not have all the financial capabilities to offer a full suite of banking services today. But lucky for them there is an established fintech ecosystem with startups and some more mature companies tackling every single niche in finance. While we have not seen much in the way of partnerships yet, in many ways companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook or Apple make a more natural partner for fintech companies than established banks. These tech behemoths know what it is like to move quickly, to test and adapt and they have a culture and mindset that is more aligned with fintech companies. By partnering with (or acquiring) fintech companies GAFA could very quickly become a force to be reckoned with in any finance niche.Lessons from ChinaIn China we have seen the tech giants move into financial services in a big way. Alibaba spun off Ant Financial in 2014 and it is now the largest fintech company in the world[11]. It is the creator of the ubiquitous Alipay payments app with a user base of almost 500 million people. They also run the world's largest money market fund,\u00a0Yu'e Bao, with over $200 billion in assets[12]. And for good measure they recently started a digital bank call MYBank[13]. Alibaba's archrival is Tencent. Their first major product was a messaging app called WeChat that has an astounding 750 million daily active users today. They are also entrenched in financial services with a payments service called Tenpay and like Ant Financial they recently launched a digital bank[14], called WeBank. My point is that if the tech giants in the US want to see a path to domination in financial services they can look to their counterparts in China. Having said that, the two countries are very different and what worked in China will not necessarily work the same way in the US, but some people think that China is leaving the US tech giants behind[15]. So, clearly lessons can be learned here.The Tech Financial Lobbying GroupFinancial Innovation Now[16]\u00a0(FIN) was founded in 2015 in Washington DC and this is how they describe themselves: Financial Innovation Now\u00a0is an alliance of technology leaders working to modernize the way consumers and businesses manage money and conduct commerce. We believe that technological transformation will make financial services more accessible, safe and affordable for everyone, and we promote policies that enable these innovations. Its members include Google, Amazon, Apple, PayPal and Intuit. The one tech behemoth missing is Facebook and I wouldn't be surprised if they joined this group at some point. Today, FIN is active on Capitol Hill educating lawmakers and regulators and supporting new legislation that 'encourage the growth and adoption of new financial services technologies and products.' It is another indicator that these companies intend to make a bigger push in finance.Where We Go From HereBanks are still some of the largest and most profitable institutions on the planet and their embedded position in finance is formidable. But I also think that consumer preferences are changing fast and banks are struggling to keep up. In 10 years time I still expect large banks to have mostly maintained their entrenched position as the leaders in finance. But I think we will see the likes of GAFA taking market share by offering banking services that people love. I think the banks will find it far more difficult to grow than ever before and their return on equity will have declined considerably from today's levels. We are entering a fascinating new phase in fintech. In many ways the options are limitless but the competition is also fierce. Banks and fintech companies alike should be paying close attention to the movements of the big tech companies. I expect we will see some more activity here in the coming year with regards to fintech/tech partnerships and possibly an acquisition or two. I also think we will see more initiatives between big banks and big tech. We live in interesting times. The pace of change is increasing and I am very confident there will be some truly fantastic innovations in finance in the coming decade. And in the end the consumers will be the real beneficiaries of these changes. The post GAFA Will Have a Profound Impact on the Future of Finance[17] appeared first on Lend Academy[18].

On the other hand, 40% believe government regulation of these firms shouldn't change and 10% think they should face less government regulation.</p><p>To view the table, click here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/265799/americans-split-regulation-big-tech.aspx\">https://news.gallup.com/poll/265799/americans-split-regulation-big-tech.aspx</url></p><p>Large technology companies maintain that they do not engage in anti-competitive practices. Nevertheless, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal earlier this week, a number of state attorneys general -- believed to be a bipartisan group -- are preparing a joint antitrust investigation into possible anti-competitive practices by Big Tech. This is on top of similar inquiries already underway by the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>More View Technology Firms Positively Than Negatively</p><p>The 50% of U.S. adults who favor no additional regulation of technology firms aligns with the 46% of Americans in the same poll who have a generally positive opinion of the sector. That's significantly more than the 33% viewing technology companies negatively. Meanwhile, 22% say they have a neutral view of these firms.

Roughly six in 10 self-identified liberals, union members, college graduates and Democrats say that government should increase its regulation of firms like Amazon, Google and Facebook.</p><p>Additionally, young adults are slightly less likely than seniors to favor more regulation of Big Tech. But rather than want to see regulation of the technology sector weaken, young adults are more likely to say the regulatory environment should not change.</p><p>To view the table, click here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/265799/americans-split-regulation-big-tech.aspx\">https://news.gallup.com/poll/265799/americans-split-regulation-big-tech.aspx</url></p><p>The gap between Republicans' and Democrats' views on regulating Big Tech is still relatively mild as far as partisan differences go. That could reflect the various cross-pressures created by a Republican presidential administration pushing for tighter regulation of an industry that's viewed more positively than negatively by Americans. But this bears watching as the investigations play out and consumers become more familiar with the issues at hand.</p><p>To view the table, click here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/265799/americans-split-regulation-big-tech.aspx\">https://news.gallup.com/poll/265799/americans-split-regulation-big-tech.aspx</url></p><p>* * *</p><p>- Liberals more likely than conservatives to favor tighter controls</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6829610 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6829610</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWS-TCR1-JC11-128J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"579\"/><timeReceived>1:18 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 20, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Oracle of Omaha insisted, as he always has, that the best place for retail investors to be is in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/04/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-annual-shareholder-meeting-highlights.html\"> S&amp;P500 index fund</url>. But he also told shareholders that his company had sold       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/warren-buffett-coronavirus-berkshire-hathaway-sales-981f15e3-4a26-4683-96ce-2636b6809cf7.html\"> 16 times</url> as much stock as it had purchased in the last month, including dumping the entire airline asset class. And he admitted that while you could still \u201c       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/202005041006/buffett-says-economy-will-regain-its-footing-wsj\"> bet on America</url>, you are going to have to be careful how you bet\u201d. </p><p>When you look closely at his actions, he is still following the same strategy that he has employed throughout his career. It is an approach built on two things: first, value investing, which basically involves the forensic examination of corporate balance sheets; and, second, a belief not so much in America as in American companies and their ability to export their particular brand of capitalism abroad. Both of those pillars still hold much wisdom for investors who want to understand where markets \u2014 and the real economy \u2014 are heading.</p><p>Mr Buffett learnt the skill of value investing from his former Columbia Business School professors David Dodd and Benjamin Graham, whose book, <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intelligent_Investor\"> The Intelligent Investor</url>, he memorised. They argued that investors should buy companies that have steady profits, low price-to-earnings ratios and very little debt. Following that logic, it is no wonder that Mr Buffett isn\u2019t buying much stock. Corporate debt doubled between Mr Buffett\u2019s bullish buying spree after the 2008 financial crisis and the end of 2019.</p><p>Meanwhile, P/E ratios are not providing a true market signal when asset prices are being driven mainly by US Federal Reserve interventions. Many companies have stopped giving earnings guidance amid this historic downturn. Some people might respond that the Fed\u2019s actions are the market signal. By that they mean that share prices will from now on be driven by the supply of money that central banks pump into the economy, rather than by the relationship of stock prices to corporate earnings. But as Gavekal Research co-founder Charles Gave wrote last week, everyone in Japan in the 1980s thought the correlation between the Topix and the country\u2019s supply of cash and cash equivalents would last forever, too. But the value of equities there stopped tracking the money supply in 1990.</p><p>We will continue to see plenty of companies and stocks flourish in the post-Covid-19 era, even after the Fed turns off the spigots of its recent interventions. But investors will need to conduct a new kind of forensic study to discover who the winners will be. </p><p>Mr Buffett\u2019s second pillar of betting on US blue-chips, as a way to wager on global growth, no longer works as well in an era of localisation. The US, China and parts of Europe are all developing national champions in sectors such as technology, which holds a disproportionate weight within the S&amp;P 500. It is impossible to know yet how deglobalisation will play out in the long term. But in the short term, the increased competition will surely dampen US share prices.</p><p>Some industries will be safer investments than others. Travel \u2014 and anything related to it \u2014 is unlikely to rebound soon. As bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach <url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-dumping-airline-stocks-big-deal-jeff-gundlach-says-2020-5-1029159381\"> noted last week</url>, Mr Buffett bailing out of airlines was the negative equivalent of his doubling down on banking stocks in the wake of 2008. He was making a bet that the long-term fortunes of an entire sector will change. In retail, it is hard to imagine that many big brands won\u2019t follow J Crew into bankruptcy. Banking faces increased risk as corporate insolvencies rise, so the sector\u2019s share prices will probably stay depressed. So, too, for small and midsized companies that don\u2019t have teams of lawyers to push them to the front of the bailout queue. Many will surely be gobbled up by larger competitors as they flounder.</p><p>Even within seemingly Teflon-like sectors, such as technology, there will be divergence by company. Microsoft is booming amid coronavirus, while Apple chief executive Tim Cook says the company is in \u201c <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.imore.com/apple-earnings-q2-2020\"> the most challenging environment</url>\u201d it has ever seen. </p><p>All US companies will have to live with a new level of political risk that will make it difficult to predict returns \u2014 or their regulatory future. Not only is there growing tech nationalism among both Republicans and Democrats. There is also rising concern about corporate concentration, which Democrat Joe Biden is making <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-criticizes-corporate-america-greedy-as-hell-2020-4\"> a central issue </url>of his presidential campaign. </p><p>Amazon is the perfect case in point here. The company has become totally essential during the lockdown. Yet it is under more attack than ever from labour and antitrust activists. It is possible that Big Tech behemoths will come out of the current crisis stronger, only to have their wings clipped in the end via regulation and higher taxes. They could be very much in the crosshairs as the politics of unequal wealth distribution and nationalism play out.</p><p>In this environment, buying the S&amp;P 500 as a whole only makes sense if investors believe that the Fed can continue to lift all boats indefinitely. </p><p>I believe the US is moving from a consumer liquidity crisis to a corporate solvency crisis. When that happens, it is unclear whether the central bank can continue to save everyone. For a generation brought up to buy and hold US blue-chips, betting on America has become a lot trickier.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/></p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow Rana Foroohar with\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/rana-foroohar\"> myFT</url> and on\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/RanaForoohar\"> Twitter</url></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-5fed983c906b11ea9207ace009a12028</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YW2-MFB1-JB77-K4F7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"929\"/><timeReceived>1:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 10, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001NW4</classCode><className>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS524210 INSURANCE AGENCIES &amp;

This could result in a more polarised market, split between niche offerings and financial services platforms, and between those who embrace agile transformation and those that are more reactive and slower to adapt.\"</p><p>He added: \"There are considerable challenges for existing players and new entrants - from complying with regulatory technical standards to identifying market opportunities and potential partnerships and making sure that customer data is adequately protected.</p><p>\"Customer confidence and trust must be a major area of focus in order to realise the potential benefits that Open Banking can deliver. Would-be Open Banking champions need to consider their position, their partners and their strategy carefully, but make sure they can act and react quickly enough to take full advantage, before someone else does.\"</p><p>New digital skills academy sets up in Manchester - and it's free</p><p>Open banking is the practice of sharing financial information electronically, securely, and only under conditions that customers approve of.</p><p>Application programming interfaces (APIs) allow third-parties to access financial information efficiently, which promotes the development of new apps and services. Ideally, open banking should result in a better experience for consumers.</p><p>Your bank account holds your money, and you probably use your checking account for most payments. But technology increasingly creates options to maximize the value you get from your bank. With open banking, third-parties can help you save money, borrow easily, and pay painlessly.</p><p>It could help you budget, find the best deals, and shop for the products and services that suit you.</p><p>Ultimately, it could allow you to manage all of your financial accounts and household bills through a single digital platform, with the option of allowing apps to 'plug in' and offer more personalised and intuitive services.</p><p>For example, an app might help you avoid charges or boost your savings by automatically moving money between various accounts.</p><p>Open banking could also spur action in other markets, by encouraging you to look at your energy or phone bills.</p><p>There are already a number of Open banking products.</p><p>HSBC was the first UK bank to launch a standalone open banking app 'Connected Money', which lets users see all of their financial accounts on one screen no matter who they bank with.</p><p>Consumers can add their accounts, including loans and mortgages, from up to 21 different banks.</p><p>ING Bank's Yolt app allows consumers compare all nine banks signed up to Open Banking.</p><p>Users can view their accounts, set budgets and monitor subscriptions, among other services.</p><p>Credit Kudos is a free online service which uses Open Banking to work out whether customers are eligible for financial services.</p><p>Other examples of Open banking include DueDil, which aims to make private companies' financial data acesible and clear to understand; and Coconut, which is designed to provide current accounts for the self-employed that enable them to manage their expenses and invoices, administer their taxes, and ensure that providers pay on time.</p><p>Experian has also launched a new set of advanced Open Banking services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MANONL-49553751</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MANONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TTT-HT91-F021-64W5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">418998</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1044\"/><timeReceived>2:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Trinity Mirror, Plc.

U.S. law and the Constitution protect American citizens and legal residents from warrantless surveillance. That means we have a very strong legal case to challenge mass surveillance conducted domestically or that sweeps in Americans' communications.</p><p>Similarly, the United States Congress is elected by American voters. That means Congressional representatives are beholden to the American people for their jobs, so public pressure from constituents can help influence future laws that might check some of the NSA's most egregious practices.</p><p>But what about everyone else? What about the 96% of the world's population who are citizens of other countries, living outside U.S. borders. They don't get a vote in Congress. And current American legal protections generally only protect citizens, legal residents, or those physically located within the United States. So what can EFF do to protect the billions of people outside the United States who are victims of the NSA's spying?</p><p>For years, we've been working on a strategy to end mass surveillance of digital communications of innocent people worldwide. Today we're laying out the plan, so you can understand how all the pieces fit together - that is, how U.S. advocacy and policy efforts connect to the international fight and vice versa. Decide for yourself where you can get involved to make the biggest difference.</p><p>This plan isn't for the next two weeks or three months. It's a multi-year battle that may need to be revised many times as we better understand the tools and authorities of entities engaged in mass surveillance and as more disclosures by whistleblowers help shine light on surveillance abuses.</p><p>If you'd like an overview of how U.S. surveillance law works, check out our addendum.</p><p>Intro: Mass Surveillance by NSA, GCHQ and Others</p><p>The National Security Agency is working to collect as much as possible about the digital lives of people worldwide. As the Washington Post reported, a former senior U.S. intelligence official characterized former NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander's approach to surveillance as \"Collect it all, tag it, store it\u2026 And whatever it is you want, you go searching for it.\"</p><p>The NSA can't do this alone. It relies on a network of international partners who help collect information worldwide, especially the intelligence agencies of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom (collectively known, along with the United States, as the \"Five Eyes.\") In addition, the United States has relationships (including various levels of intelligence data sharing and assistance) with Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, and potentially a number of other countries worldwide. There are also other countries - like Russia, China, and others - engaging in surveillance of digital communications without sharing that data with the NSA. Some of those governments, including the U.S. government, are spending billions of dollars to develop spying capabilities that they use aggressively against innocent people around the world. Some of them may do so with even less oversight and even fewer legal restrictions.</p><p>Although whistleblowers and journalists have focused attention on the staggering powers and ambitions of the likes of the NSA and GCHQ, we should never assume that other governments lack the desire to join them. Agencies everywhere are hungry for our data and working to expand their reach. Read about international surveillance law reform and fighting back through user-side encryption.</p><p>We focus here on the NSA because we know the most about its activities and we have the most legal and political tools for holding it to account. Of course, we need to know much more about surveillance practices of other agencies in the U.S. and abroad and expand our work together with our partners around the world to confront surveillance as a worldwide epidemic.</p><p>Mass surveillance is facilitated by technology companies, especially large ones. These companies often have insufficient or even sloppy security practices that make mass surveillance easier, and in some cases may be actively assisting the NSA in sweeping up data on hundreds of millions of people (for example, AT&amp;T). In other cases, tech companies may be legally compelled to provide access to their servers to the NSA (or they may choose to fight that access). Read more about how tech companies can harden their systems against surveillance.</p><p>The NSA relies on several laws as well as a presidential order to justify its continued mass surveillance. Laws passed by Congress as well as orders from the U.S. President can curtail surveillance by the NSA, and the Supreme Court of the United States also has authority to put the brakes on surveillance.</p><p>The Game Plan</p><p>Given that the American legal system doesn't adequately protect the rights of people overseas, what can we do in the immediate future to protect Internet users who may not be Americans?</p><p>Here's the game plan for right now. Note that these are not consecutive steps; we're working on them concurrently.</p><p>1. Pressure technology companies to harden their systems against NSA surveillance</p><p>To date, there are unanswered questions about the degree to which U.S. technology companies are actively assisting the NSA.</p><p>In some cases, we know that tech companies are doing a lot to help the NSA get access to data. AT&amp;T is a clear example of this. Thanks to whistleblower evidence, we know AT&amp;T has a secret room at its Folsom Street facility in San Francisco where a fiber optic splitter creates a copy of the Internet traffic that passes through AT&amp;T's networks. That splitter routes data directly to the NSA.</p><p>Some companies have taken things a step further and deliberately weakened or sabotaged their own products to \"enable\" NSA spying. We don't know who's done this or what they've done, but the NSA documents make clear that it's happening. It's the height of betrayal of the public, and it could conceivably be taking place with the help even of some companies that are loudly complaining about government spying.</p><p>So what do we know about major tech companies, like Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and Microsoft? Here we have mixed reports. Documents provided by Edward Snowden and published in the Guardian and the Washington Post name nine U.S. companies - Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, and Apple - as participants in the NSA's PRISM program. The documents indicate that the NSA has access to servers at each of these companies, and implies that these companies are complicit in the surveillance of their users.</p><p>The companies, in turn, have strongly denied these allegations, and have even formed a lobby group calling on governments to \"limit surveillance to specific, known users for lawful purposes, and should not undertake bulk data collection of Internet communications.\"</p><p>While a start, that's a far cry from the role companies could be playing. Tech companies also have the ability to harden their systems to make mass surveillance more difficult, and to roll out features that allow users to easily encrypt their communications so that they are so completely secure that even their service providers can't read them. Perhaps most importantly, technology companies must categorically resist attempts to insert backdoors into their hardware or software.</p><p>There's also an important legal issue that can't be ignored. Tech companies are in a unique position to know about surveillance requests that are kept secret from the press and the public. These companies may have the best chance to fight back on behalf of their users in court (as Yahoo has done).</p><p>What's more, tech companies literally spend millions of dollars to lobby for laws in Washington and enjoy incredible access to and influence over U.S. lawmakers. Often, companies spend that money trying to derail potential regulation. Instead, these companies could be heavily prioritizing positive surveillance reform bills.</p><p>So how do we get tech companies to start fighting surveillance in court, hardening their systems against surveillance, pushing back against the administration, and lobbying for real reform? We're focused on transparency - uncovering everything we can about the degree to which big tech companies are actively helping the government - and public pressure. That means highlighting ways that companies are fighting surveillance and calling out companies that fail to stand up for user privacy.</p><p>It's why we're proud to support the Reset the Net campaign, designed to get companies big and small to take steps to protect user data. It's also why we're working to make what companies do and don't do in this area more visible. Campaigns like HTTPS Everywhere and our work on email transport encryption, as well as scorecards like Who Has Your Back are designed to poke and prod these companies to do more to protect all their users, and get them to publicly commit to steps that the public can objectively check.</p><p>We also need to cultivate a sense of responsibility on the part of all those who are building products to which the public entrusts its most sensitive and private data. The people who create our computing devices, network equipment, software environments, and so on, need to be very clear about their responsibility to the users who have chosen to trust them. They need to refuse to create backdoors and they need to fix any existing backdoors they become aware of. And they need to understand that they themselves, unfortunately, are going to be targets for governments that will try to penetrate, subvert, and coerce the technology world in order to expand their spying capabilities. They have a grave responsibility to users worldwide and we must use public pressure to ensure they live up to that responsibility.</p><p>2. Create a global movement that encourages user-side encryption</p><p>Getting tech giants to safeguard our digital lives and changing laws and policies might be slow going, but anybody could start using encryption in a matter of minutes. From encrypted chat to encrypted email, from secure web browsing to secure document transfers, encryption is a powerful way to make mass surveillance significantly more difficult.</p><p>However, encryption can be tricky, especially if you don't have a team of engineers to walk you through it the way we do at EFF.

U.S. law and the Constitution protect American citizens and legal residents from warrantless surveillance. That means we have a very strong legal case to challenge mass surveillance conducted domestically or that sweeps in Americans' communications.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Similarly, the United States Congress is elected by American voters. That means Congressional representatives are beholden to the American people for their jobs, so public pressure from constituents can help influence future laws that might check some of the NSA's most egregious practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But what about everyone else? What about the 96% of the world's population who are citizens of other countries, living outside U.S. borders. They don't get a vote in Congress. And current American legal protections generally only protect citizens, legal residents, or those physically located within the United States. So what can EFF do to protect the billions of people outside the United States who are victims of the NSA's spying?</p><p>For years, we've been working on a strategy to end mass surveillance of digital communications of innocent people worldwide. Today we're laying out the plan, so you can understand how all the pieces fit together - that is, how U.S. advocacy and policy efforts connect to the international fight and vice versa. Decide for yourself where you can get involved to make the biggest difference.</p><p>This plan isn't for the next two weeks or three months. It's a multi-year battle that may need to be revised many times as we better understand the tools and authorities of entities engaged in mass surveillance and as more disclosures by whistleblowers help shine light on surveillance abuses.</p><p>If you'd like an overview of how U.S. surveillance law works, check out our addendum.</p><p>Intro: Mass Surveillance by NSA, GCHQ and Others</p><p>The National Security Agency is working to collect as much as possible about the digital lives of people worldwide. As the Washington Post reported, a former senior U.S. intelligence official characterized former NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander's approach to surveillance as \"Collect it all, tag it, store it\u2026 And whatever it is you want, you go searching for it.\"</p><p>The NSA can't do this alone. It relies on a network of international partners who help collect information worldwide, especially the intelligence agencies of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom (collectively known, along with the United States, as the \"Five Eyes.\") In addition, the United States has relationships (including various levels of intelligence data sharing and assistance) with Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, and potentially a number of other countries worldwide. There are also other countries - like Russia, China, and others - engaging in surveillance of digital communications without sharing that data with the NSA. Some of those governments, including the U.S. government, are spending billions of dollars to develop spying capabilities that they use aggressively against innocent people around the world. Some of them may do so with even less oversight and even fewer legal restrictions.</p><p>Although whistleblowers and journalists have focused attention on the staggering powers and ambitions of the likes of the NSA and GCHQ, we should never assume that other governments lack the desire to join them. Agencies everywhere are hungry for our data and working to expand their reach. Read about international surveillance law reform and fighting back through user-side encryption.</p><p>We focus here on the NSA because we know the most about its activities and we have the most legal and political tools for holding it to account. Of course, we need to know much more about surveillance practices of other agencies in the U.S. and abroad and expand our work together with our partners around the world to confront surveillance as a worldwide epidemic.</p><p>Mass surveillance is facilitated by technology companies, especially large ones. These companies often have insufficient or even sloppy security practices that make mass surveillance easier, and in some cases may be actively assisting the NSA in sweeping up data on hundreds of millions of people (for example, AT&amp;T). In other cases, tech companies may be legally compelled to provide access to their servers to the NSA (or they may choose to fight that access). Read more about how tech companies can harden their systems against surveillance.</p><p>The NSA relies on several laws as well as a presidential order to justify its continued mass surveillance. Laws passed by Congress as well as orders from the U.S. President can curtail surveillance by the NSA, and the Supreme Court of the United States also has authority to put the brakes on surveillance.</p><p>The Game Plan</p><p>Given that the American legal system doesn't adequately protect the rights of people overseas, what can we do in the immediate future to protect Internet users who may not be Americans?</p><p>Here's the game plan for right now. Note that these are not consecutive steps; we're working on them concurrently.</p><p>1. Pressure technology companies to harden their systems against NSA surveillance</p><p>To date, there are unanswered questions about the degree to which U.S. technology companies are actively assisting the NSA.</p><p>In some cases, we know that tech companies are doing a lot to help the NSA get access to data. AT&amp;T is a clear example of this. Thanks to whistleblower evidence, we know AT&amp;T has a secret room at its Folsom Street facility in San Francisco where a fiber optic splitter creates a copy of the Internet traffic that passes through AT&amp;T's networks. That splitter routes data directly to the NSA.</p><p>Some companies have taken things a step further and deliberately weakened or sabotaged their own products to \"enable\" NSA spying. We don't know who's done this or what they've done, but the NSA documents make clear that it's happening. It's the height of betrayal of the public, and it could conceivably be taking place with the help even of some companies that are loudly complaining about government spying.</p><p>So what do we know about major tech companies, like Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and Microsoft? Here we have mixed reports. Documents provided by Edward Snowden and published in the Guardian and the Washington Post name nine U.S. companies - Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, and Apple - as participants in the NSA's PRISM program. The documents indicate that the NSA has access to servers at each of these companies, and implies that these companies are complicit in the surveillance of their users.</p><p>The companies, in turn, have strongly denied these allegations, and have even formed a lobby group calling on governments to \"limit surveillance to specific, known users for lawful purposes, and should not undertake bulk data collection of Internet communications.\"</p><p>While a start, that's a far cry from the role companies could be playing. Tech companies also have the ability to harden their systems to make mass surveillance more difficult, and to roll out features that allow users to easily encrypt their communications so that they are so completely secure that even their service providers can't read them. Perhaps most importantly, technology companies must categorically resist attempts to insert backdoors into their hardware or software.</p><p>There's also an important legal issue that can't be ignored. Tech companies are in a unique position to know about surveillance requests that are kept secret from the press and the public. These companies may have the best chance to fight back on behalf of their users in court (as Yahoo has done).</p><p>What's more, tech companies literally spend millions of dollars to lobby for laws in Washington and enjoy incredible access to and influence over U.S. lawmakers. Often, companies spend that money trying to derail potential regulation. Instead, these companies could be heavily prioritizing positive surveillance reform bills.</p><p>So how do we get tech companies to start fighting surveillance in court, hardening their systems against surveillance, pushing back against the administration, and lobbying for real reform? We're focused on transparency - uncovering everything we can about the degree to which big tech companies are actively helping the government - and public pressure. That means highlighting ways that companies are fighting surveillance and calling out companies that fail to stand up for user privacy.</p><p>It's why we're proud to support the Reset the Net campaign, designed to get companies big and small to take steps to protect user data. It's also why we're working to make what companies do and don't do in this area more visible. Campaigns like HTTPS Everywhere and our work on email transport encryption, as well as scorecards like Who Has Your Back are designed to poke and prod these companies to do more to protect all their users, and get them to publicly commit to steps that the public can objectively check.</p><p>We also need to cultivate a sense of responsibility on the part of all those who are building products to which the public entrusts its most sensitive and private data. The people who create our computing devices, network equipment, software environments, and so on, need to be very clear about their responsibility to the users who have chosen to trust them. They need to refuse to create backdoors and they need to fix any existing backdoors they become aware of. And they need to understand that they themselves, unfortunately, are going to be targets for governments that will try to penetrate, subvert, and coerce the technology world in order to expand their spying capabilities. They have a grave responsibility to users worldwide and we must use public pressure to ensure they live up to that responsibility.</p><p>2. Create a global movement that encourages user-side encryption</p><p>Getting tech giants to safeguard our digital lives and changing laws and policies might be slow going, but anybody could start using encryption in a matter of minutes. From encrypted chat to encrypted email, from secure web browsing to secure document transfers, encryption is a powerful way to make mass surveillance significantly more difficult.</p><p>However, encryption can be tricky, especially if you don't have a team of engineers to walk you through it the way we do at EFF. With that in mind, we've created Surveillance Self Defense, an in-depth resource that explains encryption to folks who may want to safeguard their data but have little or no idea how to do it. </p><p>In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PROFFN-PON324170</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PROFFN2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5F6X-W1J1-DXCW-D43F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1825\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Premium Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"511\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"02\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>February 2, 2015 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>National</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Campaigners say this is possible because tech companies do not enforce age restrictions. About 600,000 British children under Facebook's \"minimum age\" of 12 are on the social network, according to the research company Emarketer, and apps available from Google and Apple's app stores have been criticised for enabling grooming.</p><p>One ten-year-old girl told the survey: \"A complete stranger asked me to take my clothes off and send him a picture ... When I deleted the game, I went on another site and the same person asked me to have sex with him. I told him to 'back off' and then deleted that game. I have seen this person on many sites that I play and I decided to block him.\" At secondary school even more children reported that adults had sent them nude or semi-nude images, with one in twenty aged 12 to 16 saying they had received such a picture.</p><p>Children said the problem was not limited to strangers and some had been sent images by adults they knew.

Coincidiendo con la testificaci\u00f3n de sus consjeros delegados ante la instituci\u00f3n, el congresista dem\u00f3crata asegur\u00f3 que \u201cantes de la pandemia, [estas empresas] ya eran titanes de nuestra econom\u00eda, pero es probable que con el Covid-19 emerjan m\u00e1s fuertes y poderosas\u201d. Y as\u00ed ha sido. Este jueves era la primera vez que las cuatro<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> big tech</emphasis>, que representan en torno a una quinta parte del valor total del S&amp;P, publicaban sus cuentas el mismo d\u00eda, y sus resultados trimestrales no dejaron lugar a duda: son capaces de seguir creciendo en medio de una gran desaceleraci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica mundial. </p><p> Mientras el PIB de EE UU se desplom\u00f3 un 9,5% en el segundo trimestre, las ventas de Amazon crecieron un 40%, su mayor impulso interanual en a\u00f1os; Apple elev\u00f3 sus ingresos un 11% pese a que la previsi\u00f3n era que cayeran un 3% debido al cierre de muchas de sus tiendas, y Facebook aument\u00f3 en un 15% los usuarios de sus plataformas, que incluyen WhatsApp e Instagram, elevando sus ingresos y disparando sus beneficios.  La facturaci\u00f3n agregada de los cuatro gigantes de Silicon Valley fue de 205.581 millones de d\u00f3lares (173.702 millones de euros), un 18,8% m\u00e1s que los  contabilizados en el mismo periodo de 2019. Asimismo, las ganancias netas de las cuatro empresas subieron un 13,5%, hasta 28.633 millones de d\u00f3lares. Los crecimientos reportados han sido extraordinarios, salvo Alphabet que se mostr\u00f3 algo m\u00e1s d\u00e9bil. Algunas incluso marcaron r\u00e9cords. Amazon obtuvo 5.200 millones de d\u00f3lares de ganancias, las mayores trimestrales desde que se cre\u00f3 la compa\u00f1\u00eda en 1994, seg\u00fan dijo Jeff Bezos, su fundador y consejero delegado. Y eso, pese a que como reconoci\u00f3 el directivo este segundo trimestre fue \u201cinusual\u201d y la empresa se vio obligada a incurrir en un gasto extra de  4.000 millones de d\u00f3lares para equipos de protecci\u00f3n para sus empleados y en mejoras log\u00edsticas. Tambi\u00e9n Apple, que impuls\u00f3 sus ingresos un 11%, marc\u00f3 un nuevo r\u00e9cord para el trimestre de junio en los beneficios por acci\u00f3n, que subieron un 18%, hasta 2,58 d\u00f3lares. \u201cNuestro rendimiento es una fuerte evidencia de nuestra capacidad para innovar y ejecutar en tiempos dif\u00edciles\u201d, dijo el director financiero de la compa\u00f1\u00eda, Luca Maestri. El ejecutivo a\u00f1adi\u00f3 que los resultados r\u00e9cord comerciales de Apple llevaron su base activa de dispositivos instalados \u201ca un m\u00e1ximo hist\u00f3rico\u201d. La firma creci\u00f3 en todas las geograf\u00edas y en todas sus principales categor\u00edas de productos. Hasta el iPhone impuls\u00f3 sus ventas un 2%, a 26.400 millones, en gran parte gracias a la introducci\u00f3n del modelo de entrada iPhone SE en abril. La previsi\u00f3n era que caer\u00edan un 14%. De los cinco mayores fabricantes de<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> smartphone </emphasis>del mundo, solo Apple subi\u00f3 en ventas, seg\u00fan Canalys. Avalancha de compras La avalancha de compras online, el teletrabajo, y el entretenimiento y la educaci\u00f3n virtual, que animaron tambi\u00e9n las compras de los Mac y los iPads y el negocio de computaci\u00f3n en la nube de Amazon, impulsaron el crecimiento de estas dos empresas. El director financiero del gigante del<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> ecommerce</emphasis>, Brian Olsavsky, lleg\u00f3 a decir en la llamada posterior con analistas que Amazon se ha quedado sin espacio de almac\u00e9n en previsi\u00f3n de un crecimiento continuo de las compras online y que est\u00e1n trabajando para ampliar sus infraestructuras log\u00edsticas.       El negocio de Facebook tambi\u00e9n se mostr\u00f3 inmune a la crisis. Sus ingresos subieron un 11%, una cifra menor a otros trimestres, pero por encima de las expectativas de los analistas. Los inversores que quer\u00edan comprobar qu\u00e9 impacto estaba teniendo el boicot de numerosas grandes empresas a la plataforma social por los discursos de odio, comprobaron que las pymes siguen recurriendo a la firma de Mark Zuckerberg para anunciarse.        Seg\u00fan indic\u00f3 a la BBC Sophie Lund-Yates, analista de Hargreaves Lansdwon, el aumento de usuarios de Facebook hace que sea atractiva para los anunciantes. Y la red social apunt\u00f3 este jueves que hab\u00eda contabilizado un promedio de 2.400 millones de usuarios activos diarios en sus plataformas en junio. Solo en Facebook, casi 1.790 millones, un 12% m\u00e1s.  Alphabet, matriz de Google, no arroj\u00f3 tan buenas cifras. Sus ingresos fueron de 38.300 millones, un 2% menos, como consecuencia de un menor gasto publicitario, y su beneficio cay\u00f3 un 30% hasta los 6.959 millones. La firma sufri\u00f3 la primera ca\u00edda trimestral de beneficios e ingresos de su historia. Sin embargo, los analistas creen que el gran bache lo sufri\u00f3 en abril y que la recuperaci\u00f3n habr\u00eda  sido mayor de lo esperado en mayo y junio. Roger McNamee, inversor de Silicon Valley, asegur\u00f3 al FT tras conocer los resultados que \u201cen ausencia de alg\u00fan tipo de intervenci\u00f3n regulatoria, [estas compa\u00f1\u00edas] seguir\u00e1n acaparando una parte cada vez mayor de la econom\u00eda\u201d. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CINCOD-1223528</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CINCOD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GJ-NXS1-F12V-S00K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222705</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Estructura, Grupo De Estudios Economicos, S.A.

In a speech before the American Bar Association, Holder will also push for early release of seniors and ill inmates who no longer pose a danger to society. \"While the aggressive enforcement of federal criminal statutes remains necessary, we cannot simply prosecute or incarcerate our way to becoming a safer nation,\" Holder will say, according to excerpts of his prepared remarks. \"We must never stop being tough on crime. But we must also be smarter on crime.\" (\"HOLDER-SENTENCING@)</p><p>\"AL JAZEERAAMERICA: @After Mike Viqueira was hired as White House correspondent for Al Jazeera's new American television venture, the former NBC Newsveteran braced for a barrage of negative reaction on Twitter. \"I expected some comments from people unfamiliar with Al Jazeera,\" he says. \"Out of 300 comments I had on Twitter, there were maybe two that hinted at that.\" \"That,\" of course, refers to the lingering perception that Middle East-based Al Jazeera is anti-U.S. and a mouthpiece for terrorists, sentiments that took hold when it aired numerous Osama bin Laden videos in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and stories that were critical of the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq War. Indeed, for many Americans, the only encounter with the Al Jazeera brand came during those years. FOX SPORTSrefer.

It cost them $10 million in lost revenue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">David Barnett started the company that makes collapsible phone grips and stands in 2014 while still a college philosophy professor. Now, he thinks powerful tech companies, like Amazon, limit growth options for smaller businesses and that means trouble.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We didn't feel like it was a true partnership, and there was this asymmetry with much of the communication where it was as if an adult was talking to a child,\" Barnett said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The experience of PopSockets, which employs about 150 people in Colorado, illustrates the bipartisan push in Congress to regulate technology giants and informs the high-profile congressional hearing in July into workplace conditions and antitrust laws.</p><p>But it's not an issue that the two major candidates in the Colorado's U.S. Senate race will talk much about. Neither Republican incumbent Cory Gardner nor Democratic challenger John Hickenlooper addresses tech conglomeration on his campaign website and neither campaign answered questions posed by The Colorado Sun about where they stand on related policy issues.</p><p>The silence highlights both candidates' ties to Big Tech.</p><p>In 2019, Gardner toured an Amazon facility in Thornton, which was part of the company's lobbying outreach, and he has also accepted substantial campaign contributions from the company.</p><p>Hickenlooper, who as governor courted tech jobs and oversaw an expansion of the tech economy in Colorado, initially challenged the industry in his unsuccessful presidential bid but has not done the same in his current bid. The family foundation of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, also donated money to the governor's office under Hickenlooper for a childhood literacy initiative.</p><p>The question about tech giants hits home in Colorado</p><p>The central questions in the national debate are particularly relevant in Colorado, where the technology industry has established a major presence. The Denver and Boulder areas are now home to regional offices of Google, Facebook, Twitter, Salesforce and Amazon, the latter of which recently expanded its tech hub in Denver by another 100 workers.</p><p>Approximately 584 tech companies occupy 11.5% of the available office space in the Front Range according to CBRE Group, a commercial real estate firm that tracks office leasing nationwide. That has translated into 39,000 additional tech jobs in the Front Range, a growth of 26% in tech employment between 2009 and 2019.</p><p>And earlier this year, the congressional debate about the role of Big Tech came to Boulder for a hearing where representatives from smaller tech companies, including PopSockets, told members of Congress how they experience the weight of the tech giants.</p><p>PopSockets survived the hit from spurning Amazon and is back to doing business with the retailer in a smaller capacity, Barnett told The Sun. But Colorado has many other start-ups, and large technology companies' continued power could be \"a death blow to small businesses over the longer term,\" said Sarah Miller, president of the American Economic Liberties Project, an anti-monopoly advocacy organization.</p><p>A bevy of political issues inform the debate about America's big tech firms - from anticompetitiveness, political biases, data privacy, workers rights and more - but most center on a core concern that America's tech companies have grown too powerful.</p><p>Nationwide, concern among voters is growing, as an August poll from Morning Consult and Politico shows that 45% of adults want presidential candidates to be more critical of the technology industry, up 5 percentage points from 2019.</p><p>Two members of Colorado's congressional delegation are part of the current conversation. U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, a Democrat from Lafayette, is the vice chairman of the House Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law Subcommittee and has been vocal about the impact of Big Tech in his district. And U.S. Rep. Ken Buck, R-Windsor, is another member of the subcommittee who has questioned tech leaders.</p><p>Some observers believe Congress is poised to take action to regulate the tech giants - making the viewpoints of the candidates in the 2020 election all the more important. \"People both on the left and the right are saying, 'enough,'\" Miller said.</p><p>Where Gardner and Hickenlooper stand on tech issues</p><p>In the U.S. Senate, Gardner is a lead co-sponsor on bipartisan legislation to increase government coordination of the development of the Internet of Things. The DIGIT Act, which won approval in the Senate and now sits in the House, would create a working group to bridge between the federal government and private tech companies as they work on developing increasingly interconnected technology in everyday items.</p><p>His role in the bill is one reason why Amazon, a supporter of the legislation, has courted Gardner.</p><p>Bezos, Amazon's founder - and his then-wife Mackenzie Scott and some top executives - each donated the legal maximum to Gardner's reelection campaign in 2018, an infusion of at least $54,000 into his campaign, according to CNBC. The cash influx was unique because Gardner was not up for reelection that year, and federal campaign finance records show Bezos has rarely donated to senators who don't represent his home state of Washington.</p><p>The donation came after Amazon opened a distribution facility in Aurora and was considering Colorado as a location for its second headquarters. Amazon supported a number of bills co-sponsored by Gardner and spent $3 million lobbying for the DIGIT Act. Amazon as a whole donated more to Gardner than it did to nearly any other senator in 2018, according to CNBC.</p><p>Though Gardner's campaign website doesn't address issues surrounding the tech giants, his official U.S. Senate page says he supports a \"regulatory environment and policy approach that encourages innovation and growth\" and \"reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens on companies looking to expand and hire more employees.\"</p><p>Gardner backed Colorado's bid for Amazon's second corporate headquarters. So did Hickenlooper, though he did say at one point there would be a \"sense of relief\" if the company didn't come to Denver.</p><p>In his presidential run, Hickenlooper's first major economic policy proposal centered on putting a check on the influence of Big Tech. The candidate said the tech behemoths were extinguishing opportunities for new startups and called for stricter enforcement of antitrust laws.</p><p>He also told The Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos, he supported cracking down on monopolies and mergers. \"There was a period 40 or 50 years ago when large companies would try to merge together, and there was a strong feeling that the public was better served by having more competitors,\" Hickenlooper told the newspaper.</p><p>On his campaign website, Hickenlooper doesn't specifically address the issue, despite the increased attention from progressives in his own party.</p><p>Diana Moss, President of the American Antitrust Institute, said the tech companies' influence could be effectively buffeted with existing laws, and she encouraged voters to consider the issue at the ballot box. \"They should be looking for candidates who put a priority on strong enforcement of the antitrust laws,\" she said.</p><p>The two candidates also don't address other issues tied to technology jobs. The one related issue both highlight is expanded high-speed internet access.</p><p>As governor, Hickenlooper signed a bipartisan bill into law that provided $115 million to expand broadband internet in rural communities. Gardner introduced bills to equip school buses with internet and increase funding for rural broadband infrastructure, both of which passed and are now laws.</p><p>Staff writer Tamara Chuang contributed to this report.

Continue reading Garry Tan and Alexis Ohanian on how to survive these crazy days (and what to learn from them)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Garry Tan  and Alexis Ohanian founded Initialized Capital roughly nine years ago and they ve closed four funds since, including most recently in late 2018.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That $225 million vehicle is roughly twice the size of their previous fund, but because of the coronavirus, the firm, and its portfolio companies   some of which include Opendoor, Instacart  and Coinbase   could be facing a tougher road in 2020. Certainly, that s true of nearly ever other venture firm and startup right now.</p><p>To get a sense of where the team is currently, what it s telling its founders, whether it thinks the abrupt downturn might change founders  behavior, as well as whether either thinks big tech should be broken up, we talked with the two last night via Zoom about these issues and more. It was a fun conversation that you can check out here, beginning around the 23 minute mark. In the meantime, you can find highlights from our conversation right here. Among the many things we covered:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">We first talked about how much runway startups need right now that the U.S. is largely closed for business.</emphasis></p><p>Tan offered that because returning to normalcy could  well be six to nine months,  partly because the U.S. isn t informally containing the virus and there s not yet a vaccine for it. To  make sure you have the cash to last to the other side,  he said, founders need to think in terms of 18 months.  It s a lot,  said Tan,  but that s sort of what s necessary, and that s what we ve been advising our portfolio companies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The duo also talked about how to actually squeeze 18 months of runway out of startup that hasn t freshly raised a round.</emphasis></p><p>Ohanian said to  renegotiate everything,  from office space to venture debt agreements. He also noted there are  obvious things that you get cut early, around like non-essential marketing,  saying,  I m as bummed as the next person to not be able to go to Cannes Lions this year, but I think we all agree like these are very reasonable things to be cutting at times like this. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Because Ohanian is fairly vocal on Twitter about U.S. efforts to contain the coronavirus and to help healthcare workers, we spent some time on this, too.</emphasis></p><p>Ohanian said that  like a lot of Americans, I m pretty frustrated by the situation right now. I mean, I live in Florida, which I think is going to see some really staggering numbers [of sickened residents] here in the next couple of weeks [because of its] elderly population and . . .a governor that s that s taking too long to do the things we need to do to keep them safe. </p><p>He added that he remains inspire by the  ingenuity and the resilience  of its citizens, including founders who ve begun adapting to these new situations, including the Initialized portfolio companies Flexport,  the logistics startup, and Ro, the tele-health startup that originally focused on men s wellness.</p><p>Through a new initiative announced earlier this week, Flexport is  literally raising millions of dollars in donations to bring medical supplies to the Bay Area and to those healthcare workers,  noted Ohanian.</p><p>Ro  is meanwhile offering a free Covid-19 assessment to anyone who wants to take it and if he or she is deemed at enough risk, Ro will connect that individual with a physician or RN. That medical professional can t administer an FDA-approved test, Ohanian acknowledged, but it s better than nothing, he suggested.  This is not a salve. This is not a magic wand at all. What hopefully this can do is give people more information quicker about the decisions they should be making about their own safety and the safety of people they might come in contact with. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Naturally, we had to ask how a founder lands a check from Initialized, and whether the firm needs to see a product or momentum first.</emphasis></p><p>On this front, Tan was clear that  no traction is fine,  explaining that the firm funded Around,  a two-year-old, Redwood City, Ca.-based videoconferencing startup that this month announced $5.2 million in seed funding, with  a demo that kind of honestly barely worked  but whose approach to solving a particular problem really resonated with the team.</p><p>Tan also pointed to Instacart, the grocery delivery company that s  doing insanely well right now,  as housebound Americans steer clear of grocery stores.</p><p> When I met [founder and CEO Apoorva Mehta,  said Tan,  it was the early days of the iPhone app platform  and  everyone else was pitching that idea  at the same time. But where most  demoware  is  jerky  or  not properly threaded,  Mehta s  scrolled really smoothly and the images were properly threaded and I could see that he was a craftsman,  says Tan. As important to him,  Apoorva is not a person who accepts  no.  He takes a no and turns it into a yes.  (Both Tan and Ohanian emphasized here that good salesmanship, meaning solid storytelling, can accomplish a lot.)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">As for what s happening day to day, we asked both if they re spending time in board meetings, poring over financials and trying to figure out how keep the startups in their portfolio going during this downturn. They suggested they d already done this before Covid-19 took hold in the U.S.</emphasis></p><p>Said Tan,  Not to put other VCs on blast, but often they don t actually keep track of the runway of their companies quite so closely. For us, we have quarterly reviews, [so] the day all this stuff happened, we immediately knew who we needed to spend time with. We d started talking about this in February. I wore my first N95 mask to our retreat in Cabo San Lucas [early last month] and and people at the airport thought I was a little bit nuts, but it was already in our mind that [the virus] might come over here. So when we did our last portfolio review in February, we were already mindful of anyone who has short runway [because we wanted] to make sure we had that conversation. </p><p>Added Tan,  There are some boards that I m on where I was telling them this was going to happen, and they just didn t believe me. But for a few teams, they were able to put the right things into place and start their fundraise a little bit earlier. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Before we let them go, we asked if they had thoughts about the tech giants   on which we re suddenly more reliant on ever   being broken up, and whether they should be.</emphasis></p><p>Ohanian, who famously cofounded the social media giant Reddit, declined to say much on this front, other than that Initialized has backed  companies that thrive in part because they re giving everyone else a chance to compete with Amazon. So I don t know if that doesn t tell you something, I don t know what else would. </p><p>For his part, Tan said he  probably  doesn t want the government to intervene with big tech, but he s concerned about their rise (and rise).  Said Tan,  What I want is our startups to be successful, and when they become successful, that they arm thousands of small businesses, medium-size businesses, and the retailers that could not possibly to hire an engineer to actually survive. . . because otherwise, Amazon s going to run the table.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">We also asked if they worry big tech companies are more hesitant to shop, given the regulatory scrutiny they have been under.</emphasis></p><p>Tan suggested that Initialized hasn t counted on M&amp;A activity for its exits for some time.   What s weird about startups [[is that back] in 2008 when we came up, M&amp;A was a much bigger part of what people talked about. These days, everything we fund, we want to fund it for the IPO. </p><p>The reality, he continued is that none of the tech giants are acquisitive because they  sort of don t know what to do with the cash. [There s] definitely a Peter Thiel-ism that I totally believe, which is that Google is sitting on a cash hoard, and when you sit on a cash hoard, it means,  I don t know what else to do. There are not projects that have a positive net IRR that I can put that money into. I could not hire people to go work on a thing that could make more money. </p><p>Said Tan,  If anything, these companies have sort of become giant babysitting places for very, very smart tech people. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Not last, we talked about their hopes for what comes next.</emphasis></p><p>Ohanian is choosing to remain optimistic on a lot of fronts right now, he suggested, and that s unsurprisingly true of his work. As he told us,  One of the fortunate parts about doing early-stage investing is also that this [frightening moment] is a time when founders are going to come solving real problems. I actually expect the next two years to be opportunities for some really great and hopefully impactful companies to get formed.  In the wake of all this,  [founders] can not just solve really important business leads; they can also do some good in the process. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Before we parted ways, we also talked about founders and whether some had blown it by not taking their companies public while the window was still open.</emphasis></p><p>Both Tan and Ohanian seemed to defend founders who ve chosen to stay private longer in recent years while ceding that staying private isn t good for employees or investors or the founders themselves. Indeed,  a lot of it comes back to governance,  said Ohanian, with both he and Tan expressing equal parts dismay over activist investors and the perpetual shareholder rights that founders have been demanding to protect themselves from said activist investors.

Certainly, that's true of nearly ever other venture firm and startup right now.</p><p><br/>To get a sense of where the team is currently, what it's telling its founders, whether it thinks the abrupt downturn might change founders' behavior, as well as whether either thinks big tech should be broken up, we talked with the two last night via Zoom about these issues and more. It was a fun conversation that you can check out here, beginning around the 23 minute mark. In the meantime, you can find highlights from our conversation below.<br/>We first talked about how much runway startups need right now that the U.S. is largely closed for business.<br/>Tan offered that returning to normalcy could \"well be six to nine months,\" partly because the U.S. isn't informally containing the virus and there's not yet a vaccine for it. To \"make sure you have the cash to last to the other side,\" he said, founders need to think in terms of 18 months. \"It's a lot,\" said Tan, \"but that's sort of what's necessary, and that's what we've been advising our portfolio companies.\"<br/>The duo also talked about\u00a0 how to actually squeeze 18 months of runway out of startup that hasn't freshly raised a round.<br/>Ohanian said to \"renegotiate everything\" from office space to venture debt agreements. He also noted there are \"obvious things that you get cut early, around like non-essential marketing,\" saying, \"I'm as bummed as the next person to not be able to go to Cannes Lions this year, but I think we all agree like these are very reasonable things to be cutting at times like this.\"<br/>Because Ohanian is fairly vocal on Twitter about U.S. efforts to contain the coronavirus and to help healthcare workers, we spent some time on this, too.\u00a0<br/>Ohanian said that \"like a lot of Americans, I'm pretty frustrated by the situation right now. I mean, I live in Florida, which I think is going to see some really staggering numbers [of sickened residents] here in the next couple of weeks [because of its] elderly population and... a governor that's taking too long to do the things we need to do to keep them safe.\"<br/>He added that he remains inspire by the \"ingenuity and the resilience\" of its citizens, including founders who've begun adapting to these new situations, including the Initialized portfolio companies Flexport, the logistics startup, and Ro, the telehealth startup that originally focused on men's wellness.<br/>Through a new initiative announced earlier this week, Flexport is \"literally raising millions of dollars in donations to bring medical supplies to the Bay Area and to those healthcare workers,\" noted Ohanian.<br/>Ro is meanwhile offering a free Covid-19 assessment to anyone who wants to take it, and if he or she is deemed at enough risk, Ro will connect that individual with a physician or RN. That medical professional can't administer an FDA-approved test, Ohanian acknowledged, but it's better than nothing, he suggested. \"This is not a salve. This is not a magic wand at all. What hopefully this can do is give people more information quicker about the decisions they should be making about their own safety and the safety of people they might come in contact with.\"<br/>Naturally, we had to ask how a founder lands a check from Initialized, and whether the firm needs to see a product or momentum first.<br/>On this front, Tan was clear that \"no traction is fine,\" explaining that the firm funded Around, a two-year-old, Redwood City, Ca.-based videoconferencing startup that this month announced $5.2 million in seed funding, with \"a demo that kind of honestly barely worked\" but whose approach to solving a particular problem resonated with the team.<br/>Tan also pointed to Instacart, the grocery delivery company that's \"doing insanely well right now\" as housebound Americans steer clear of grocery stores.<br/>\"When I met [founder and CEO] Apoorva Mehta,\" said Tan, \"it was the early days of the iPhone app platform\" and \"everyone else was pitching that idea\" at the same time. But where most demoware is \"jerky\" or \"not properly threaded,\" Mehta's \"scrolled really smoothly and the images were properly threaded, and I could see that he was a craftsman,\" says Tan. As important to him, \"Apoorva is not a person who accepts 'no.' He takes a no and turns it into a yes.\" (Both Tan and Ohanian emphasized here that good salesmanship, meaning solid storytelling, can accomplish a lot.)<br/>As for what's happening day to day, we asked both if they're spending time in board meetings, poring over financials and trying to figure out how keep the startups in their portfolio going during this downturn. They suggested they'd already done this before COVID-19 took hold in the U.S.<br/>Said Tan, \"Not to put other VCs on blast, but often they don't actually keep track of the runway of their companies quite so closely. For us, we have quarterly reviews, [so] the day all this stuff happened, we immediately knew who we needed to spend time with. We'd started talking about this in February. I wore my first N95 mask to our retreat in Cabo San Lucas [early last month] and and people at the airport thought I was a little bit nuts, but it was already in our mind that [the virus] might come over here. So when we did our last portfolio review in February, we were already mindful of anyone who has short runway [because we wanted] to make sure we had that conversation.\"<br/>Added Tan, \"There are some boards that I'm on where I was telling them this was going to happen, and they just didn't believe me. But for a few teams, they were able to put the right things into place and start their fundraise a little bit earlier.\"<br/>Before we let them go, we asked if they had thoughts about the tech giants - on which we're suddenly more reliant on ever\u00a0 - being broken up, and whether they should be.<br/>Ohanian, who famously cofounded the social media giant Reddit, declined to say much on this front, other than that Initialized has backed \"companies that thrive in part because they're giving everyone else a chance to compete with Amazon. So I don't know - if that doesn't tell you something, I don't know what else would.\"<br/>For his part, Tan said he \"probably\" doesn't want the government to intervene with big tech, but he's concerned about its rise (and rise).\u00a0 \"What I want is our startups to be successful, and when they become successful, that they arm thousands of small businesses, medium-size businesses, and the retailers that could not possibly hire an engineer to actually survive. . . because otherwise, Amazon's going to run the table.\"<br/>We also asked if they worry big tech companies are more hesitant to shop, given the regulatory scrutiny they have been under.\u00a0<br/>Tan suggested that Initialized hasn't counted on M&amp;A activity for its exits for some time.\u00a0\"What's weird about startups [is that back] in 2008 when we came up, M&amp;A was a much bigger part of what people talked about. These days, everything we fund, we want to fund it for the IPO.\"<br/>The reality, he continued, is that none of the tech giants are acquisitive because they \"sort of don't know what to do with the cash. [There's] definitely a Peter Thiel-ism that I totally believe, which is that when you sit on a cash hoard, it means, 'I don't know what else to do. There are not projects that have a positive net IRR that I can put that money into. I could not hire people to go work on a thing that could make more money.'\"<br/>\"If anything, these companies have sort of become giant babysitting places for very, very smart tech people,\" said Tan.<br/>We talked about hopes for what comes next.<br/>Ohanian is choosing to remain optimistic on a lot of fronts right now, he suggested, and that's unsurprisingly true of his work. As he told us, \"One of the fortunate parts about doing early-stage investing is also that this [frightening moment] is a time when founders are going to come solving real problems. I actually expect the next two years to be opportunities for some really great and hopefully impactful companies to get formed.\"<br/>Before we parted ways, we also talked about founders and whether some had blown it by not taking their companies public while the window was still open.<br/>Both Tan and Ohanian seemed to defend founders who've chosen to stay private longer in recent years while stressing that staying private isn't good for employees or investors or the founders themselves. Indeed, \"a lot of it comes back to governance,\" said Ohanian, with both he and Tan expressing equal parts dismay over activist investors and the perpetual shareholder rights that founders have been demanding to protect themselves from said activist investors. (Ohanian called such voting rights an \"ugly hack.\")<br/>Both sang the praises of Long Term Stock Exchange - the stock exchange created by entrepreneur Eric Ries - and what it hopes to accomplish, which is to make it safer to go public without worrying about activist investors by rewarding longer-term shareholders who believe in a company.<br/>Worth noting: LTSE, as it's known, is an Initialized portfolio company.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M-766942</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJP-RHR1-JBYT-H4R1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1559\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 1, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N523910MM</classCode><className>VENTURE CAPITAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DPHO</classCode><className>VIRTUAL EVENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000D43B</classCode><className>BUSINESS CLOSINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DPKP</classCode><className>BIG TECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N523910MM</classCode><className>VENTURE CAPITAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX142</classCode><className>NEW DELHI, INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS125</classCode><className>FLORIDA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

'These changes in the ad tech market will cause some existing digital advertising sectors and established supply chains to wither and vanish.'<br/><br/>Increased regulatory scrutiny, continued media supply chain disruption and volatile consumer spending are three emerging trends that will have the greatest impact on marketers' ability to implement effective and scalable advertising capabilities.<br/><br/>Figure 1. Hype Cycle for Digital Advertising, 2020<br/><br/>Source: Gartner (July 2020)<br/><br/>Advanced Supply-Side Bidding (ASSB)<br/><br/>Demand for ASSB - techniques that allow publishers to solicit bids from multiple sources to fill an available ad spot - is a clear signal that removing barriers to open competition in media markets can yield major economic benefits for buyers and sellers. Marketers should expect continued innovation and pressure to be directed at similar attempts to level the playing field by addressing impediments to a less concentrated market.<br/><br/>However, the impact of regulatory developments on ASSB remains unpredictable, especially in regard to curtailing of trade in targeting data for advertising. As programmatic ad markets take the brunt of a pandemic-induced recession's impact on media budgets, it will likely take ASSB at least three more years to reach the Plateau of Productivity.<br/><br/>Ad Blocking<br/><br/>Over the last few years, ad blocking - the use of software to remove or filter the delivery of content identified as advertising from material published on the internet - has gained significant traction. However, attention and hysteria surrounding ad blocking have been recently eclipsed by concerns about the demise of third-party cookies and the chilling impact of COVID-19 on the digital ad market.<br/><br/>Underlying issues with ad blocking are still very much unresolved and unlikely to stabilize within the next two years. In the meantime, marketers must look to better balance customer choice and engagement with increasing demands for transparency.<br/><br/>Identity Resolution (IDR)<br/><br/>IDR holds great promise for marketers as they shift their sights to customer retention goals, do more with a stagnant or cut budget and apply first-party data to marketing programs. However, the technology is among the most active battlegrounds in a volatile power struggle between business interests, privacy regulators, and the largest digital platform providers - with consumers caught somewhere in the middle. Privacy obstacles put tremendous pressure on IDR practices, leading to its position on this year's Hype Cycle - the Trough of Disillusionment.<br/><br/>The future of IDR depends heavily on standardization - or supporting a universal user token compliant with consent requirements - which has been a rocky road. Marketers that altogether abandon efforts at using IDR to understand and communicate with customers, and those that rely on weak enforcement or sketchy privacy workarounds to obtain personal data, all risk negative impact.<br/><br/>Brand Safety<br/><br/>Brand safety has a renewed focus as of late, as marketers pay more attention to the context in which their ads appear. Previously included in the profile for ad verification, brand safety has been separated based on its unique requirements and trajectory, as it is measured and managed separately from fraud and viewability.<br/><br/>As publishers evolve their ability to filter content, marketers will have a more reliable and direct way to manage their ad buys. However, as influencer marketing gains more investments, marketers will need to more closely scrutinize the process of influencer selection and look to technology to provide an efficient and reliable way to manage campaigns.<br/><br/>Ad Verification and Viewability<br/><br/>Ad verification and viewability - a fraud-prevention technology that verifies humans, not bots are the source of impressions and clicks - has emerged from the Trough of Disillusionment into the Slope of Enlightenment due to the recent trend of provider acquisitions by strategic buyers.<br/><br/>Marketers investing in digital advertising have a great deal to lose from ad fraud and viewability violations. Verification will be a necessary part of the settlement systems of buyers and sellers as the category moves toward maturity. Marketers will need to institute an approach to ad verification and viewability to ensure they can take full advantage of it and have confidence in the investment.<br/><br/>The full report is available to Gartner for Marketers clients here: Hype Cycle for Digital Advertising, 2020.

He spoke about the company's investments in the technology industry, regulation of the financial industry and the outlook for oil prices and Federal Reserve policy&lt;nl/&gt; When asked whether we will see a rate increase this year, Cohen said: 'The Fed is in a very tough position\u2026They're going to be constrained by circumstances, going to be concerned about the strength of the dollar, and other countries are going to continue to devalue.'&lt;nl/&gt; On last week's better-than-expected employment numbers,Gary Cohn said: 'I am not convinced that one good jobs report last Friday has changed the whole world.'&lt;nl/&gt;When asked about Goldman Sachs being ranked among the most hated companies in America[2], Gary Cohn said: 'Of course it bothers me.'&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; Gary Cohn cideo for viewing       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://bloom.bg/16QBgBK\">http://bloom.bg/16QBgBK</url>[3]&lt;nl/&gt;</p><p>Gary Cohn transcript below&lt;nl/&gt;\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; BRAD STONE: Thank you, Gary, for being a host today and for doing such a great job interviewing <person><nameText>Apple CEO, </nameText></person><person><nameText>Tim Cook. </nameText></person>How did that feel to be the interviewer instead of the interviewee?&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; GARY COHN: Oh it's always fun to interview a great CEO like Tim.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; STONE: That's right. Well one of the things he said that stood out for me was about data privacy. Apple is not collecting health care data or purchasing data with things like Apple Pay. He framed that as a statement of values, but is it also good business, seeing as how its primary competitor, Google, is collecting that data?&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; COHN: First of all, let me thank you for being at our technology and internet conference. I think Tim stated his corporate objective pretty well. Apple is in the business of selling components. They want to sell iPad's. They want to sell iPhones. They want to sell Macs. They are not in the business of collecting data on their clients. And that's the business decision that Tim has made. And I thought he explained himself very well up there.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; STONE: Now Trish just mentioned that Apple has crossed a $700 billion in market cap threshold for the first time. Is that significant? I mean what does it mean for business, for global business that any company is reaching such highs, and maybe even a one trillion market cap is in reach at some point?&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; COHN: It's not significant. It's just a representation. It's a number, it's a size. Apple is an iconic company in America. It's a brand that is known not only in America. It's known worldwide. If you listen to Tim they're talking about their sales growing all over the world. He talked about revenue over the last few years growing from $1 billion dollars to $38 billion in China alone.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; STONE: Will you be buying an Apple Watch in March?&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; COHN: I don't know. It was pretty enticing. He was picking on my old watch in there.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; STONE: He was. He was. So we are in the middle of an incredible cycle here in Silicon Valley. We're minting these companies like Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Square. You have been in tech for a while in investment banking. How does this cycle compare to say the last cycle with the social networks and the online communities like Facebook and Twitter? What is different about these companies now?&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; COHN: I think it's hard to compare this cycle to the last cycle. The last cycle was a long time ago, and more importantly, the companies you just mentioned, the Airbnbs, the Dropboxes, the Ubers, they are creating real products that you and I are using every day. When we go on that phone, and we hit that Uber button and that car shows up, we are using it and we are paying for those services. These are not companies designing products, hoping that we will someday use them and they'll create profit. Uber is servicing their customers every day, and creating revenue by doing it, and getting more and more acceptance and creating a bigger worldwide network literally every day.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; STONE: Right. Now Goldman Sachs has been active in this round of innovation as an investor.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; COHN: Yes.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; STONE: You were in Facebook and Mobileye, Uber's latest round.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; COHN: Yes.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; STONE: Is the investment business now as important as the traditional investment banking business?&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; COHN: Well we are in the business of raising capital. And we are in the business of matching people with capital with people that need capital, which enables the economy to grow, which enables us to create jobs. And that's our business. So we have been involved with these companies at various stages of their career and evolution, and we just continuously be \u2014 are involved with them. And so, yes, we have been involved lately in these new rounds. And we'll continue to be involved with the next round and the next round. Eventually, we believe all of these companies will become public companies.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; STONE: And so let's talk about that then. Is it \u2014 is 2015 the year when we think about these unicorns, Xiaomi, the Chinese mobile phone company, Uber, maybe Airbnb? Everyone sort of wants to know when. Is it sooner rather than later that we might see some of these companies go public?&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; COHN: I don't know. I don't know. Right now there is an enormous amount of capital available in the system. And so these companies to the extent they need working capital, and not all of them need working capital, have an enormous availability of capital to them. So to the extent they want to stay private longer, capital is not the constraining item right now.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; STONE: Right. Is \u2014 is tech the biggest sector for investment banking right now? I mean this has become really a cornerstone of the Silicon Valley calendar.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; COHN: It's not necessarily the biggest, but I don't know how you measure size. Our tech franchise is a very important franchise to us. We've got other equally as important franchises.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; STONE: So explain this to me. Some of the big tech companies, Amazon, Apple are raising money in the bond market now, and sometimes over in Europe. Given that in some cases these are very profitable companies, why is the bond market so appealing right now?&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; COHN: Rates are low. Rates are very low. Rates are extremely low in Europe. They're lower than dollar rates. To the extent you can use money in Europe, you are borrowing money. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow money in Swiss franc. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow money in euros. The all-in borrowing costs in those places is substantially lower than it is in dollars right now.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; STONE: Is there anything worrying about that that there's so much fundraising now happening in the bond market?&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; COHN: No. These companies are sound, fundamental companies. They are going to raise debt. They are raising it in the cheapest place they can raise it, and they are taking advantage of the opportunities presented to them in what is going on in the European economy.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; STONE: So at Davos last month you talked about currency wars, basically countries using currency to fuel growth. And you said that was concerning to you. Is that \u2014 do you see, still see that happening and why?&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; COHN: It is concerning to me. It's concerning to me because it's a never-ending cycle. If you're out there devaluating your currency and you're forcing me to devalue my currency, how do you stop this game? And the flip side of it, we in the United States are having to learn to live with a stronger and stronger dollar, not necessarily because we have got a stronger and stronger economy. And although our economy is strong, we are having a stronger and stronger dollar because you have got to devalue against something.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; STONE: I see. And you also said that you forecasted the price of oil perhaps going down as low $30 a barrel. Of course it has rebounded somewhat. What do you see happening in the oil markets right now and what does that mean for American business?&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; COHN: Well I answered the question. It could go to $200 and it could go to $30. I said, yes, could be true to both of them. So the oil market right now is in a very fluid situation. We have seen five, ten percent moves over days and weeks in the last few weeks, but I think the oil market is trying to figure out an equilibrium price.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt; The danger here as we try and find an equilibrium price at some point we may end up in a situation where storage capacity gets very, very limited. We may have too much physical oil for the available storage in certain locations, and it might be a locational issue. And you may just see gluts of oil in certain locations around the world where oil will have to price to such a cheap discount vis-a-vis the forward price that you make second tier, and third tier and fourth&lt;nl/&gt;<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/02/gary-cohn-goldman-sachs-coo/?format=pdf\">http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/02/gary-cohn-goldman-sachs-coo/?format=pdf</url> The post Gary Cohn Bothered By Goldman's Popularity Ranking[4] appeared first on ValueWalk[5].&lt;nl/&gt;

Take it away, Brad.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRAD STONE, BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK</emphasis>: Thank you, Trish. And thank you, Gary, for being a host today and for doing such a great job interviewing Apple CEO, Tim Cook. How did that feel to be the interviewer instead of the interviewee?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GARY COHN, PRESIDENT AND COO, GOLDMAN SACHS</emphasis>: Oh it's always fun to interview a great CEO like Tim.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: That's right. Well one of the things he said that stood out for me was about data privacy. Apple is not collecting health care data or purchasing data with things like Apple Pay. He framed that as a statement of values, but is it also good business, seeing as how its primary competitor, Google, is collecting that data?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: First of all, let me thank you for being at our technology and internet conference. I think Tim stated his corporate objective pretty well. Apple is in the business of selling components. They want to sell iPad's. They want to sell iPhones. They want to sell Macs. They are not in the business of collecting data on their clients. And that's the business decision that Tim has made. And I thought he explained himself very well up there.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: Now Trish just mentioned that Apple has crossed a $700 billion in market cap threshold for the first time. Is that significant? I mean what does it mean for business, for global business that any company is reaching such highs, and maybe even a one trillion market cap is in reach at some point?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: It's not significant. It's just a representation. It's a number, it's a size. Apple is an iconic company in America. It's a brand that is known not only in America. It's known worldwide. If you listen to Tim they're talking about their sales growing all over the world. He talked about revenue over the last few years growing from $1 billion dollars to $38 billion in China alone.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: Will you be buying an Apple Watch in March?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: I don't know. It was pretty enticing. He was picking on my old watch in there.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: He was. He was. So we are in the middle of an incredible cycle here in Silicon Valley. We're minting these companies like Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Square. You have been in tech for a while in investment banking. How does this cycle compare to say the last cycle with the social networks and the online communities like Facebook and Twitter? What is different about these companies now?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: I think it's hard to compare this cycle to the last cycle. The last cycle was a long time ago, and more importantly, the companies you just mentioned, the Airbnbs, the Dropboxes, the Ubers, they are creating real products that you and I are using every day. When we go on that phone, and we hit that Uber button and that car shows up, we are using it and we are paying for those services. These are not companies designing products, hoping that we will someday use them and they'll create profit. Uber is servicing their customers every day, and creating revenue by doing it, and getting more and more acceptance and creating a bigger worldwide network literally every day.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: Right. Now Goldman Sachs has been active in this round of innovation as an investor.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: You were in Facebook and Mobileye, Uber's latest round.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: Is the investment business now as important as the traditional investment banking business?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: Well we are in the business of raising capital. And we are in the business of matching people with capital with people that need capital, which enables the economy to grow, which enables us to create jobs. And that's our business. So we have been involved with these companies at various stages of their career and evolution, and we just continuously be -- are involved with them. And so, yes, we have been involved lately in these new rounds. And we'll continue to be involved with the next round and the next round. Eventually, we believe all of these companies will become public companies.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: And so let's talk about that then. Is it -- is 2015 the year when we think about these unicorns, Xiaomi, the Chinese mobile phone company, Uber, maybe Airbnb? Everyone sort of wants to know when. Is it sooner rather than later that we might see some of these companies go public?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: I don't know. I don't know. Right now there is an enormous amount of capital available in the system. And so these companies to the extent they need working capital, and not all of them need working capital, have an enormous availability of capital to them. So to the extent they want to stay private longer, capital is not the constraining item right now.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: Right. Is -- is tech the biggest sector for investment banking right now? I mean this has become really a cornerstone of the Silicon Valley calendar.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: It's not necessarily the biggest, but I don't know how you measure size. Our tech franchise is a very important franchise to us. We've got other equally as important franchises.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: So explain this to me. Some of the big tech companies, Amazon, Apple are raising money in the bond market now, and sometimes over in Europe. Given that in some cases these are very profitable companies, why is the bond market so appealing right now?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: Rates are low. Rates are very low. Rates are extremely low in Europe. They're lower than dollar rates. To the extent you can use money in Europe, you are borrowing money. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow money in Swiss franc. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow money in euros. The all-in borrowing costs in those places is substantially lower than it is in dollars right now.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: Is there anything worrying about that that there's so much fundraising now happening in the bond market?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: No. These companies are sound, fundamental companies. They are going to raise debt. They are raising it in the cheapest place they can raise it, and they are taking advantage of the opportunities presented to them in what is going on in the European economy.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: So at Davos last month you talked about currency wars, basically countries using currency to fuel growth. And you said that was concerning to you. Is that -- do you see, still see that happening and why?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: It is concerning to me. It's concerning to me because it's a never-ending cycle. If you're out there devaluating your currency and you're forcing me to devalue my currency, how do you stop this game? And the flip side of it, we in the United States are having to learn to live with a stronger and stronger dollar, not necessarily because we have got a stronger and stronger economy. And although our economy is strong, we are having a stronger and stronger dollar because you have got to devalue against something.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: I see. And you also said that you forecasted the price of oil perhaps going down as low $30 a barrel. Of course it has rebounded somewhat. What do you see happening in the oil markets right now and what does that mean for American business?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: Well I answered the question. It could go to $200 and it could go to $30. I said, yes, could be true to both of them. So the oil market right now is in a very fluid situation. We have seen five, ten percent moves over days and weeks in the last few weeks, but I think the oil market is trying to figure out an equilibrium price.   </p><p>      The danger here as we try and find an equilibrium price at some point we may end up in a situation where storage capacity gets very, very limited. We may have too much physical oil for the available storage in certain locations, and it might be a locational issue. And you may just see gluts of oil in certain locations around the world where oil will have to price to such a cheap discount vis-a-vis the forward price that you make second tier, and third tier and fourth tier storage available. So in one of those scenarios, which could happen relatively quickly as we saw oil move relatively quickly $10, --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: We could see the price still and go down.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: You could see the price fall relatively quickly to make that storage work in the market.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: Okay, continuing on the theme of addressing past statements, you have expressed concern over the Fed's ability to raise interest rates. Of course we had a good jobs report recently. Has that equation changed?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: We had one good job report last Friday, and the whole world seems to have changed.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: But you're not convinced.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: I am not convinced that one good jobs report last Friday has changed the whole world. You did see in that good jobs report the dollar again rally, gain strength, euro declined. So again if you look at what happened last week, you had interest rates go higher in the United States, you had oil go higher in the United States. And basically the dollar get weaker.   </p><p>      All those by themselves are making financial conditions in the United States tighter and tighter. So I actually think the Fed is going to continuously be in this tough dilemma where they are going to want to raise interest rates, and I fundamentally understand why they want to raise interest rates.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: But they're constrained by the circumstances.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: They're going to be constrained by circumstances and they will be concerned about the strengthening of the dollar. And other countries around the world are going to continue to devalue. Remember, devaluation is another way to export your disinflation that is coming into the United States. So I do think they're going to be in a tough position, and central bankers tend to need to see the real inflation before they move.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: So prediction time, will we see a rate increase this year?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: I don't really make predictions. I think the Fed is in a very tough position.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: Okay. Let me ask you about the future of Goldman Sachs. The regulatory environment over the past few years since the financial crisis seems to have changed the equation for a lot of investment banks, maybe less so at Goldman Sachs. Do you see that changing going forward?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: The regulatory environment is what it is. We've talked about the regulatory environment nonstop for five years. In some respects we're happy to be getting a lot of the regulatory environment behind us, understanding how to run our business, what we need to do to run our business, the amount of capital we need to run our business. Those are all very helpful for us. And we're operating our business the best we can in the regulatory environment we have. We're trying to be as effective as we can with our capital, capital allocation, doing that while making sure we're being there for our clients, serving our clients and being able to accommodate what our clients need on a daily basis.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: But does it bother you that Goldman Sachs is ranked among the most hated companies in America? Do you feel like that's something that you need to change?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHN</emphasis>: Of course. Of course it bothers me.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STONE</emphasis>: Yes, understand. Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs, thank you very much.   </p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

As the president and CEO of the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), he presides over CES, commonly known as the Consumer Electronics Show. CES 2018[1] is just around the corner, running from early press events starting on January 7 through January 12. The big tech trade show drew 184,498 people[2] earlier this year, and Shapiro is planning for another record-breaking event in January. The show will likely have more than 4,000 exhibitors across 2.6 million square feet of exhibit space, though final numbers will be out later. </p><p>I talked to Shapiro in our annual ritual, getting a preview of the event that sets the tone for the tech industry for the coming year. More startups will be coming this year to the Eureka Park section of the event, which will have 800 companies compared to 600 a year ago. At least 118 government leaders will be there, and many of them will be engaging on the topic of net neutrality[3], which the FCC is in the midst of dismantling. I'll be among the 7,000-plus media at the event. Some facts about the show: The drone section of the show floor will have 47 exhibitors, up 15 percent from last year, across 38,550 square feet, down 1 percent. The robotics section will have 35 exhibitors, up 30 percent, across 21,500 square feet, up 68 percent. Augmented reality will have 24 exhibitors, up 20 percent, across 10,900 square feet, up 30.5 percent. Gaming and virtual reality will have 46 exhibitors, down 36 percent from 72 last year, across 37,500 square feet, up 26 percent. Here's an edited transcript of our interview. And here's my take on last year's show[4] and my recommendations for newcomers[5]. Above: <person><nameText>Gary Shapiro, </nameText></person>president and CEO of the Consumer Technology Association. Image Credit: CTAVB: What's your take on the show and what it's going to be like? <person><nameText>Gary Shapiro</nameText></person>: Well, I don't want to sound repetitive from prior years, but the truth is CES will be a record setter. It's clearly become a global stage for innovation. Last week, we determined that our footprint for 2018 is now larger than the footprint for 2017. We do estimates in terms of the number of attendees and things like that, but we really don't know until after the show's over, and we have an audit done independently. But in terms of footprint, we'll be bigger. Last year, we were about 2.6 million net square feet. This year, we just surpassed 2.6 million net square feet. It will be bigger. The official stat is more than 2.6 million. We're projecting 4,000 exhibitors, and we were just about 4,000 last year, but because there's aggregators and a lot of last-minute things, we don't really have good final numbers. It'll be comparable to last year. But in terms of size \u2014 we're different from Europe, where they count up everything. We just count up actual sold space. Europe counts vertically while even if you have a three-story exhibit, we just count your footprint. So, we're bigger. We don't know if we'll have more international people or not because we're keeping an eye on the fact that \u2014 the first six months of the year, international visits to the U.S. have gone down pretty significantly, especially business visitors, which are down about 10 percent. One-third of all the people came from outside last year. We'll have more than 100 foreign delegations. We're expecting ministers from France, the Netherlands, Mexico. We have major brands attending the show, 76 percent of the Fortune 100 and 93 percent of the Interbrand 100. Above: Nissan's autonomous concept car featured at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show. Image Credit: Ken Yeung/VentureBeatVB: How about the startups? Shapiro:\u00a0Eureka Park, one of my favorite parts of the show, we're expecting it to grow from 600 startups in 2017 to 800 in 2018. It's a buzz area. There's a lot of countries now participating, 37 countries. Those countries sometimes come with some pretty cool people. France, where we had 5,000 people come from last year, we've had a lot of ministers, including Emmanuel Macron in prior years. This year, we're expecting a lot of very senior government officials from France. We'll have the prince of the Netherlands, and the Netherlands will have a significant presence in Eureka Park and elsewhere. We'll have a lot of government officials, talking about who's coming. Last year, we had about 55 government officials at this time that we could talk about. Right now, we have 118, including members of Congress, the entire FCC, the FTC, the chairmen and all the commissioners. We have top elected officials from a number of states. We have international officials from several countries \u2014 Colombia, Nigeria, Taiwan, Togo, France, and others. People from the White House, the Senate, the House, about every government agency you could name. There's increasing focus on life-changing and life-saving innovations. A lot of disruptive technology. A lot of empowerment of elderly people and people with disabilities. A lot of good things. We have a sports zone that's focused on sports technology, including stadium technology. VB: What are new categories? Shapiro: We have a huge focus for the first time on smart cities at CES. If you talk to a number of major companies, they're very excited about this. We have more than 40 exhibitors and 12,000 square feet showing smart-city stuff. There'll be conferences, parts of other exhibits talking about this. This is tied to 5G and what we all know is coming. This is an area that's a first at CES, and when you talk to me a year from now, it'll be even bigger. Artificial intelligence is very hot throughout the show. We have a discrete area focused on it with 15 companies, including IBM, Baidu, and Yamaha. For the first time, we've tried to make the show so that anyone with an idea can implement the idea through the services and the companies at the show. If you have an idea for a product or an app or anything, we have an area called the Design and Source Marketplace, which will have more than 700 exhibitors. Most of them were exhibitors from other countries where they were offering manufacturing. They're not pushing brand names. They have the fact that they can make stuff. There's also designers, product creators, and others. That'll be in a temporary structure, a very big one. We have a special high-tech retailing summit. We have a digital money forum. In terms of noteworthy growth, the one that sticks out to me is the vehicle technology. That's had 23 percent growth in footprint, 19 percent growth in exhibitors, 401 exhibitors there as of today. I was asking our research department if we were a car show, where would we be? We'd be in the top five, I believe, right after the Detroit Auto Show, in terms of size. But that's not a precise number. And the car shows are public shows. They're almost exclusively finished product, and we're the entire ecosystem of products. We have C Space, which we started a few years ago, and now, it's become the CMO stopping point. We have content and new platforms and technology meetings. We have 41 exhibitors in 137,000 square feet of space there, with a number of companies doubling their investment. Amazon and eBay are advertising. Google, Hulu, and Spotify are increasing their participation there. Above: Amazon Echo. Image Credit: George W. Bailey / ShutterstockVB: What are the top trends in tech? Shapiro:\u00a0In terms of trends, a lot of the talk last year was obviously about Amazon's Alexa. Now, it's gone way beyond that to other platforms. Voice and speech recognition is pushing into the mainstream. It's getting into cars and elsewhere. The accuracy of speech recognition used to be maybe 80 or 75 percent in the last few years, and now, it's over 97 percent. It's going across all devices. This Thanksgiving season, it's become the fourth sales channel. We have digital assistants like Alexa and Google, that's how things are changing. I mentioned 5G. It's still early, but companies will still be talking about it and showing stuff about what they could do when you have a network that's five times faster and five times more responsive. VB: Did anyone try to do a 5G demo at CES? I know they're doing some for the Olympics. Shapiro: For this event, I do not know. They'll be talking about it. Whether they'll be showing \u2014 I'd expressed some skepticism at one of our member meetings in October about whether there would be anything in 5G, and debate broke out between my members. But I just don't know. I do know that in 2019, there will be a lot, but in terms of what we have in 5G right now, if there is stuff, it'll be more prototypes, more talking about it and planning for it. I guarantee it'll be much further advanced in 2019. I mentioned smart cities. We released research in Europe recently showing that a lot of European cities are ahead of the U.S. in that area. There's a huge shift in the world where the city is getting bigger. People are moving into the city. Today, more than half the world lives in cities, and soon, that will increase to two-thirds. Fifty years ago, only one-third of the world lived in cities. There's a lot of changes happening there. That's where you have 5G, self-driving, and AI meeting. Voice-assisted smart speakers, a lot of companies there \u2014 Panasonic, Sony, Amazon, Google. We expect to see 360-degree room-filling sound, single deployment stereo products, all sorts of stuff. And then, there's AR and VR. You've written a lot about it. It's growing. Biometrics, there's a lot there for security and authentication. VB: Do you have any figures on the AR/VR section and how that's changed over the years? Shapiro: We are up. We have 23 exhibitors, 11,000 square feet, up five percent. That's all just AR, not VR. I can follow up with specific numbers for VR. We're also up in the smart-home marketplace, up 30 percent, with 189 exhibitors and 123,000 square feet. We're up in the robotics marketplace, which I think is going to keep growing and growing, up six percent there. There's huge growth, obviously, in gaming, all the accessories connected to it. The one that was interesting this year at our board meeting, with board members giving their personal experiences with major retailers around the country, was AR and VR and all the accessories that go with it, and the high-end computers that are being sold. That was pretty big. That's a huge trend, obviously. Above: Supporters of net neutrality protest the FCC's recent decision to repeal the program in Los Angeles, California, November 28, 2017. Image Credit: REUTERS/ Kyle GrillotVB: What are some of the issues you see this year at the forefront? Shapiro: We have a whole policy track. Last year, it was standing-room only. When we had our debriefing after the show, I said, 'Wow. I remember I used to do that, and we'd have more members of Congress than we had people in the room.' Maybe it's because of the election last year, but people were really focused on it. We have a huge number of people coming that want to speak and a lot of issues. Cybersecurity we'll have a focus on. Some of it is category specific \u2014 like self-driving cars, where we have a lot of senior people coming from the Department of Transportation. We have Lyft speaking, Ford speaking in visible positions. We'll have panel sessions. There's legislation before Congress right now on self-driving. It's bipartisan, which is why you don't hear a lot about it. But it's moving. Net neutrality will be a big issue. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai was a speaker at an event I was at last week, and there was a huge amount of security. It's a very emotional issue. It's an issue that the CTA \u2014 I wouldn't say we have not engaged on it, but we've made the argument that competition in broadband would be really important. The other area which is important, we'll be releasing, as the CTA, the Innovation Scorecard on a global basis. We're ranking different countries. Not all countries, but the countries for which we have data available. VB: Going back to net neutrality, I guess it's safe to say it's a much more emotional topic this year than a year ago. Shapiro: It's emotional because a lot's going to happen in the next couple of weeks. Last year, it was a done deal and people were just \u2014 I don't know if we had a panel on it. The year before, when the Obama administration changed the voluntary adherence to net neutrality principles, it became a big deal. Now, obviously, the Republicans are going the other way. It's an interesting dynamic because on the one hand, it's a Republican position, but it's changed since the last debate. It used to be that people would say the tech industry thinks net neutrality is critical, and now \u2014 we had a meeting of our carmakers last week, and they think the use of Title II for net neutrality is of great concern because it does say no prioritization. It regulates anything that hooks up to the internet. A car hooks up to the internet now. That's what's changed in a few years. If you have the task of regulating that, how can you say there shouldn't be prioritization when it comes to safety? That's a compelling argument, if that's the basis of your self-driving car, its access to the internet. Some of the arguments have changed, and some of the players have shifted. It's become more of a populist issue. I don't think the tech industry is that pure. From our point of view at the CTA, I can say that Title II is definitely not our preferred course for net neutrality. I worked on the principles 15 or 20 years ago, walked in the FCC, and was so happy that everyone accepted these as voluntary principles. I think we've been phenomenally successful since then. I begged the chairman of the FCC not to go forward. We have embraced what we call 'regulatory humility.' The person who coined that phrase will be at CES, the acting head of the FTC, Maureen Ohlhausen. Don't mess it up by trying to anticipate the flow of innovation and technology. Let's show some humility. Government has an important role to regulate, but let's make sure there's actual harm. 1 2[6] View All[7] [ 1]: https://www.ces.tech/ [ 2]: https://www.ces.tech/CES/media/pdfs/CES-Audit.pdf [ 3]: <url

Last week, EU finance ministers urged an end to fossil fuel lending, and on Monday, Werner Hoyer, the EIB\u2019s president, insisted that the majority of member states are on board with this agenda.</p><p>The reality, however, is some of his most important board members are still dragging their feet.</p><p>The board of the EIB, which is owned by EU member states, failed to reach a consensus in October after some big countries including Germany and Poland resisted attempts to rapidly step away from new natural gas lending.</p><p>The EIB hopes to reach a compromise this week, but its board has yet to break its stalemate: any attempt to water down the pledge to ditch fossil fuels would immediately alienate member states pushing a green agenda, among them the Scandinavian states and the UK, which will lose its voice at the EIB following Brexit.</p><p>The EIB is determined to stop financing construction of mainstream gas-fired power plants, not least because it sees these as potentially unprofitable. It has, however, been willing to continue financing some state-of-the-art, lower emission facilities \u2014 in particular combined heat and power plants.</p><p>The commission has also been pushing the EIB to continue financing some strategically significant infrastructure projects such as selected gas pipelines, and in a new compromise the EIB\u2019s latest draft proposal would allow these to continue receiving finance until the end of 2021 \u2014 a year later than previously mooted.</p><p>This, however, may still not be good enough for countries that insist they need more gas infrastructure to bridge the transition away from coal and towards greener power. They argue that even this extended deadline would not give them enough time to push through critical infrastructure projects and they want a longer grace period.</p><p>A further extension would, however, irritate states that are pushing for a more aggressive timetable to make the EIB a greener bank. So would any decision by the EIB simply to delay the fossil fuel decision once again. The stakes were underscored this week by a report from the International Energy Agency, which <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2019/november/world-energy-outlook-2019-highlights-deep-disparities-in-the-global-energy-system.html\"> found</url> the global expansion of renewables is not keeping pace with rising energy demand.</p><p>Brussels is also under fire from MEPs who think the commission is in cahoots with Germany and others in blocking the gas phase-out next year. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6547635-Green-Letter.html\"> The Brussels Briefing has seen a letter</url> from Green MEPs Bas Eickhout and David Cormand to Ms von der Leyen which denounces the commission for its \u201cappalling\u201d stance. \u201cThe European Commission has been one of the key actors behind the weakening of the EIB\u2019s first ambitious draft energy lending policy\u201d, says the letter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> ; </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/sam1fleming\"> @sam1fleming</url></p><p>Chart du jour: making Brexit work</p><p>The number of EU nationals working in the UK shrunk in the third quarter of this year, with 5.5 per cent fewer workers from the union compared to the second quarter.

The combined parties will hold 146 seats \u2014 still 20 short of a majority \u2014 making them reliant on the support of regional parties in an investiture vote.

Mr Breton\u2019s declaration was approved by 12 votes in favour and 11 against, meaning he will sit his confirmation hearing in front of MEPs on Thursday.</p><p>But as the FT reports, divisions among political groups \u2014 with resistance to Mr Breton led by the left \u2014 mean he could struggle to win the two-third majority needed to get the green light. Parliament officials expect he will be hauled back for a second hearing at the very least.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The real green banks</emphasis><br/>Former IMF official Isabelle Mateos y Lago wants global central banks to adapt to the brave new world where their mandates should be geared to fighting climate change:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cMany central banks now own substantial amounts of corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and equities, for which climate risk can be substantial.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The techlash goes stateside</emphasis><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/business/europe-technology-antitrust-regulation.html\"> The New York Times</url> on why US antitrust regulators are being told to learn from the EU\u2019s mistakes on regulating Big Tech.

Genau: In Ersterer kann man meistens nichts anfassen. Das liegt daran, dass die Finanzwirtschaft st\u00e4rker als andere Wirtschaftszweige vom Daten- und Informationsaustausch lebt. Im Prinzip lie\u00dfe sich das alles digitalisieren. Werden Deutschlands Banken also bald wegdigitalisiert?</p><p>Seit der Finanzkrise hat sich der Wettbewerb sp\u00fcrbar beschleunigt. Denn \"Fin\" gekoppelt mit \"Tech\", also \"Fintech\", erleichtert der Konkurrenz den Markteintritt bei niedrigen Kosten. Gleichzeitig kann ein erfolgreiches Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell extrem schnell skaliert werden. Das er\u00f6ffnet Marktchancen f\u00fcr kluge Gr\u00fcnder, schnelle ausl\u00e4ndische Wettbewerber und nat\u00fcrlich auch gro\u00dfe Technologiefirmen.</p><p>Die gute Nachricht: Die deutschen Banken sind endlich aufgewacht. Langsam begreifen sie, wie viel sie durch die Digitalisierung gewinnen, aber auch verlieren k\u00f6nnen. Schlechte Nachrichten kommen aus dem Maschinenraum: Selbst bei Topadressen ist die IT-Landschaft bestenfalls ein riesiges Puzzle. Je gr\u00f6\u00dfer das Haus, desto mehr Teile. Beim Versuch, alles zu vereinheitlichen, wurden schon Milliardenbetr\u00e4ge versenkt.</p><p>Noch schlimmer ist, dass man in manchen IT-Abteilungen die Hausmacht verloren hat. Software, Hardware und IT-Personal geh\u00f6ren manchmal zu drei verschiedenen Anbietern. An deren Steuerung verzweifeln die wenigen In-House-Consultants. Die Digitalisierung der deutschen Finanzwirtschaft bleibt auch deshalb hinter den Erwartungen zur\u00fcck, weil sich nur wenige Manager trauen, in einen ihnen unbekannten, dunklen Raum zu gehen und unbequeme Entscheidungen zu treffen.</p><p>Die Investitionsl\u00fccke der deutschen Banken soll - je nach Analyse - zwischen zehn und sogar 30 Milliarden Euro liegen. Allerdings versprechen automatisierte, standardisierte und beschleunigte Prozesse ein Vielfaches an Einsparungen. Einer der Hauptgr\u00fcnde, warum deutsche Banken mit ihrem vergleichsweise niedrigen Digitalisierungsgrad \u00fcberhaupt noch durchkommen, ist die strenge Regulierung. Die sch\u00fctzt nicht nur die Kunden, sondern auch die Institute vor Konkurrenz.</p><p>Genau deshalb z\u00e4hlen aktuell vor allem einige direkte Wettbewerber aus anderen EU-L\u00e4ndern zu den st\u00e4rksten Herausforderern. Dort ist Digitalisierung Chefsache. Sie wird erfolgreich und konsequent umgesetzt. Diese Banken kennen - im Gegensatz zu \"Big Tech\" - die EU-Regulatorik aus dem Effeff und verf\u00fcgen - im Gegensatz zu Start-ups - \u00fcber ausreichende Marktmacht und Finanzmittel. Es w\u00fcrde mich deshalb nicht \u00fcberraschen, wenn immer mehr fortschrittliche Auslandsbanken auf den attraktiven deutschen Markt dr\u00e4ngten.</p><p>Der Autor ist CEO der Fintech Group.

During clashes with police, tear gas was used against the demonstrators, who blocked the streets in Paris and set vehicles on fire. Meanwhile, hundreds of pro-Brexit Yellow Vests protested in London and other British cities. Four people were arrested after clashes with police. </p><p>One of those arrested was a 13-year-old girl. A Twitter correspondent reportedly says the girl, whose name is Emily, was 'dragged by her hair' by police, and that her mother is now in the police station.

Police said they were called to the Gable House Bowl in Torrance shortly before midnight. A witness said that gunshots rang out after a fight inside the building. 'Bowlers were diving under the benches,' the witness, Dana Scott, told RMG News. 'The people that were still bowling on the lanes were on the floors, underneath the seats, behind the benches.' 'People were looking for their parents, because this is a family league. You've got mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, everybody's friends in that league,' she said. No arrests were immediately reported[50]  Berkeley Researchers Offer Social Media Platforms Easier Way to Censor[51] Researchers at the University of California-Berkeley are in the process of developing an 'Online Hate Index,' which could be used to weed out 'hate speech' from social media platforms. UC-Berkeley's social science D-Lab is taking the initiative to create the hate index, which could be picked up by social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook and be used as a tool to identify and remove 'hate speech' from their platforms, all using artificial intelligence.[52]  California Woman Arrested After Biting Jogger Who Pepper-Sprayed Her Dog: Police[53] A California woman was arrested after she allegedly bit a jogger who pepper-sprayed the suspect's dog to fend off the animal at a San Francisco Bay area park Thursday, authorities said. Alma Cadwalader, 19, of Oakland, was arrested Friday by police with the East Bay Regional Park District. The incident began on a trail in Anthony Chabot Regional Park in Castro Valley, when the jogger used pepper spray to defend herself after Cadwalader's dog tried to attack her.[54]  Era of the Trumper Tantrum[55] Mothers and fathers drag their six and seven-year-old children 2,000 miles to the border of another country and scream, 'Let me in!' And when those children die \u2014 one after the father refuses medical care \u2014 the media stand up, stamp their feet, and angrily scream the question, 'How could you?' But their ire is directed at America, not at the criminally negligent parents, because it's our country's responsibility to honor and obey whatever a tantrum thrower insists is his right. Who can blame them? It worked in Europe, where hundreds of thousands of fighting-age young men escaping the internecine brutality endemic to the Religion of Peace have forced themselves upon what used to be independent nations (and in particular, their infidel women) with seemingly nothing but joy expressed by the political elite who applaud the entire 'shebang' (pun intended). The forever angry and outraged Democrats, historically anti-illegal immigration when they thought aliens would provide cheap labor benefitting industry (can't have profits unless they get to give the money to friends and family), are now pro-illegal alien who come here for benefits and are willing to vote illegally. They are merely disappointed in voters who allowed the Orange Man to steal Hillary's presidency, and damn it, they are going to import a new electorate.[56]  'Gun-Toting Hippies' Greet Boulder 'Assault Weapons' Ban With Mass Noncompliance[57] BOULDER, Colorado \u2014 Boulder's newly enacted 'assault weapons' ban is meeting with stiff resistance from its 'gun-toting hippies,' staunch liberals who also happen to be devoted firearms owners. Only 342 'assault weapons,' or semiautomatic rifles, were certified by Boulder police before the Dec. 31 deadline, meaning there could be thousands of residents in the scenic university town of 107,000 in violation of the sweeping gun-control ordinance.[58]  Microsoft Board Member Funded Manipulation of Roy Moore Senate Race[59] A prominent internet billionaire and Microsoft board member spent $100,000 funding a campaign to manipulate the 2017 Alabama Senate special election. That race pitted candidate Republican Roy Moore and Democrat Doug Jones against one another. Moore eventually lost. Microsoft board member Reid Hoffman apologized for his involvement in the disinformation campaign on Dec. 26. Microsoft has refused to respond to a request for comment and a spokesperson said merely the company has 'nothing to share at this time.' However, Hoffman's involvement may have violated Microsoft's own 'Standards of Business Conduct.' One of the standards listed includes a mandate to 'Communicate Accurately to the Public.' Statements should be 'honest and not misleading.' However, he continues to fund propaganda projects, such as News for Democracy, which created Facebook pages that buy ads criticizing Republican congressional candidates, according to the Washington Post In a statement to the Media Research Center, Microsoft refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing by its board member. A spokesperson said that Microsoft 'had nothing to share at this time.'[60]  No Freedom of Speech for You![61] Video highlights the liberal celebration of internet censorship Liberal Hollywood actor Michael Rapaport celebrates Alex Jones' removal from the internet as censorship of conservatives spreads worldwide.[62]  Third Accusation of Sex Abuse Surfaces Against Ex-Cardinal McCarrick[63] The Vatican is now investigating three separate charges of homosexual abuse against former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the latest of which was reported less than three months ago and has just become public. Though details surrounding the case remain scarce since the alleged victim has chosen to remain anonymous, the man is reportedly in his forties, and the alleged abuse would have taken place when he was a minor.[64]  Tucker Carlson: In Big Tech Policy, Laissez-Faire Ain't Fair to Conservatives[65] How should conservatives respond to attempts by social media platforms and search engines to stifle and censor them? In a clarifying debate last weekend, Tucker Carlson argued that laissez-faire doesn't guarantee fair As he sparred with Kirk over traditional conservative distrust of government regulation and the changing nature of politics, Carlson asserted that many conservatives are following the letter of old laws while ignoring the actual principles they were trying to defend. 'You've been brainwashed by a small number of dumb idealogues in DC,' he said, 'into believing what matters is the theory, above all, whether it screws you or not. And what you need to retrain your brain to understand is that what matters is your life, and the life of your family.' This applies to the debate over whether tech companies should face some sort of legislation by government in order to protect America's defining value of free speech.[66]  European Court of Human Rights Promotes Human Wrongs[67] October 26 marked a historic day for Ireland, where citizens, in a national referendum, overwhelmingly voted to repeal the country's blasphemy law. Blasphemy remains a serious offence in many parts of the world, in some Muslim countries even requiring the death penalty. More astonishing is that even some European countries are criminalizing 'defamation of religion'.[68]  France: Pictures: Yellow Vests Return to Paris to Protest Macron's Globalist Government[69] Several hundred anti-Macron Yellow Vest protesters returned to Paris and other French cities Saturday to continue their now two-month-long demonstration against the French government. Update 2000 \u2014 Yellow Vests March Sees Fires, Teargas[70]  Free Choice? British Muslim YouTube Star Receives Massive Amount of Abuse After She Stops Wearing a Hijab[71] YouTube star and fashion blogger Dina Torkia has received a wave of abusive and offensive comments on social media since she stopped wearing a hijab, the Daily Mailreports. Dina, who has more than a million followers on Instagram, said she had made a 'personal decision to wear it when I want to'.[72]  German Mainstream Politicians Suffer Major Data Hack[73] Online hackers have released a massive collection of data that includes personal information, such as phone numbers, addresses and more of German mainstream politicians as well as others in the German political scene. The data was released on Friday and reveals sensitive personal data from private messages to Facebook login information, to the personal email address of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The hack has affected nearly every party in Germany including national MPs, members of the European Parliament and local MPs Die Welt reports. Leaked information seen by Breitbart London revealed mostly personal email addresses and phone numbers of politicians, although the leak was much more detailed in several cases that included scans of drivers licenses and ID cards.[74]  German Populist Party Office Targeted by Bombing[75] A party office belonging to the populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the city of D\u00f6beln was bombed with the State Criminal Police Office (LKA) stating they believe the attack to be politically motivated. The attack occurred on Thursday night according to a police spokesman who said that the nature of the explosion was initially unclear but that no one had been hurt Die Welt reports.[76]  London Yellow Vests Picking Up Strength[77] Like their sister protesters in France, London Yellow vests have brought parts of central London to a standstill. Smoke bombs and blocked roads outside Parliament today caused major disruption, with at least 100 people wearing the high visibility 'Yellow Vests' gathered at Westminster, setting off smoke bombs as they marched along Whitehall on the way to Trafalgar Square.[78]  Poland Slams EU Leadership and Urges Changes in May Elections[79] Poland accused the European Union of conducting hostile policies toward its largest post-communist member and urged changes to the bloc's functioning following its parliamentary elections in May. It's the latest salvo in a long-lasting battle between the EU and Poland over what Brussels considers an erosion of democratic standards and threats to the rule of law. The standoff centers around political appointments to Poland's independent judiciary and the conflict could result in cuts to subsidies the country receives from the bloc's budget.[80]  Sweden: No Ebola Virus Detected in Hospital Patient[81] HELSINKI \u2014 Swedish health officials say a suspected Ebola case reported by a hospital has turned out to be a false alarm with tests carried out on the unidentified patient showing no signs of the deadly virus.[82]  UK Govt to Perform No Deal Brexit Dress Rehearsal With 150 Trucks[83] The British government is going to wargame the impact of leaving the European Union on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules on Monday, chartering dozens of articulated lorries to simulate the impact of traffic near the port of Dover.[84]  UK Labour Local Government Boss Ordered Police to Arrest Blogger[85] West Midlands Police have told the leader of a Labour-controlled town council to stop wasting police time after he repeatedly instructed them to arrest a political blogger and threatened to escalate the matter to the Home Secretary if they didn't comply with his wishes. Labour councillor and Sandwell council leader Steve Eling demanded the 'immediate arrest' of blogger Julian Saunders, who runs the Sandwell Skidder blog, in an email to the local police force.[86]  UK Mosque Cancels Event Honouring Muslims Who Saved Jews Amid Backlash[87] A key point of contention was the collaboration between the mosque and Yad Vashem, a Jewish organisation that focuses on preserving the memory of the holocaust. The exhibition at the London mosque, which was devoted to Muslims who helped save Jewish lives during the Holocaust, has been cancelled without an official explanation, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) reported. The cancellation of the event, held by the Centre for Islamic Understanding in Golders Green, was preceded by Muslim protests that were largely fuelled by statements of Roshan Salih, the editor of a Muslim media outlet called '5 Pillars'.[88]  UK: Exclusive: Met Police Confirm Brexit Betrayal Rally Was Five Times the Size of Remoaner Protest[89] The Metropolitan Police have confirmed that the Brexit Betrayal rally last month turned out around five times more protestors than the remoaner counter-protest. The Brexit Betrayal rally, organised by freedom activist Tommy Robinson and UKIP, is estimated to have turned out around 5,000 protestors on the 9th December last year, as opposed to around a mere 1,000 for Owen Jones' and Momentum's counter-protest.[90]  Remains of 34 Christians Slaughtered by Islamic State Found in Mass Grave in Libya[91] Libyan authorities have announced the discovery of a mass grave containing the remains of 34 Ethiopian Christians killed in 2015 by jihadists of the Islamic State. The Department of Criminal Investigation of the Ministry of the Interior said this week that the mass grave was found not far from the coastal town of Sirte, in an area that in 2015 was under the control of the armed jihadist group.[92]  Netflix Caves to Saudis, Censors Muslim Comedian Over Khashoggi Jokes[93] As I've reported before, comedy is dying, and this time it's not just random outraged individuals getting angry on social media. The New York Post reports: 'Netflix has blocked an episode of Hasan Minhaj's 'Patriot Act' show from airing in Saudi Arabia after government officials complained. 'The episode featured Minhaj lampooning the Saudi government's shifting explanations for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October.'[94]  Laos Cracks Down on Christianity as 'Religion of the Europeans and Americans'[95] Laos has been tightening restrictions on Christian practice as an unwelcome Western influence, mirroring the situation of other Asian communist nations. During the Christmas holidays, incidents of arrests, harassment, and censure of expressions of the Christian feast were reported around the country.[96]  Neo-Nazi Extremists Leave Swastika Stickers on a Jewish Nursing Home Which Houses Holocaust Survivors in Vile Anti-Semitic Attack[97] The extremist group, Antipodean Resistance, vandalized the front gates of Emmy Monash Aged Care in Melbourne, on New Years Day.[98]  'This Country is Under Attack': Alt-Right Activists Doing Nazi Salutes Call on Australians to 'Rise Without Fear' As They Clash With Anti-Racism Protesters as Police Try to Avoid Another 'Cronulla Riot'[99] Right-wing activists Blair Cottrell and Niel Erikson called for their supporters to flock to the beach in Melbourne's southeast on Saturday afternoon to 'take a stand against African crime gangs'.[100]  'Why You Carrying a Knife Bro?'

Isain Venegas, a supervisor in Mexico's public health system, said the shelter was overcrowded, poorly lit and lacked proper facilities for food preparation.[104]  'The Party is Over for the Left-Wing Mayors Who Benefited From Migrant Business' \u2014 Italy's Salvini[105] Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Matteo Salvini stated Friday that the migrant and security decree he put together was a state law and must be followed. This is in the midst of the rebellion of some ten of 8,000 mayors, one of whom is Palermo's Leoluca Orlando.[106]  After Introducing Mass Migration to Europe, Germany Now Bribing Foreigners to Leave[107] The German government has mounted an aggressive campaign to encourage illegal migrants to leave \u2014 bribing them with free rent for a year in their home countries. 'Your country. Your future. Now!' read billboards in seven languages, plastered in nearly 2,500 locations across 80 German cities, reports the National Post.[108]  Australia: Anglican Priest Apologises for 'Deeply Offensive' Comments in Which He Likened Offshore Processing of Asylum-Seekers to the Holocaust[109] At the end of December Father Rod Bower erected a sign outside of Gosford Anglican Church that read 'Manus is how the Holocaust started'.[110]  GoFundMe Campaign for Border Wall Will Shatter All Records[111] We are witnessing something truly extraordinary. In merely 19 days, a GoFundMe campaign to raise private contributions to build sections of the wall along the Mexico border has raised an astonishing $19.0 million. It will soon be the most successful GoFundMe campaign ever\u2014the current record holder is the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund for victims of sexual assault, which raised $22 million in 2018 over a much longer period of time. The campaign to build the wall should blow past that number in a few days. [Comment: A clear sign of the rage of US citizens at politicians who either ignore illegal immigration or are tacitly following a globalist plan of 'open borders' and 'no nation state'.][112]  Trump Considering 'National Emergency' Declaration to Build Wall With Military Coffers[113] WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said it's necessary to use eminent domain to seize border properties like any other infrastructure project, and warned at a Rose Garden press conference today that he has thought about using 'emergency powers' to grant himself authority to build a wall without the approval of Congress. 'We could call a national emergency because of the security of our country. Absolutely. No, we could do it. I haven't done it. I may do it. I may do it. But we could call a national emergency and build it very quickly and it's another way of doing it,' he said. 'But if we can do it through a negotiated process, we're giving that a shot.'[114]  Two Syrian Refugees Beat Up an Orthodox Priest in Athens, Greece[115] A priest has been beaten up by two Syrians in Athens, Greek newspaper Proto Themareports. According to the newspaper, the incident took place outside the Sanctuary of St. Nicholas in Patisia, Athens.[116]  UK: Illegal Migrant Caught Roving Street With Axe and Meat Cleaver[117] An illegal migrant suspected of dealing cocaine and heroin has been caught roving the streets with an axe and meat cleaver after police lost him last year. Arsen Spahiu, a 25-year-old Albanian, was arrested on suspicion of having cocaine and heroin with intent to supply in Southampton in April 2018, reports Portsmouth's The News.[118]  US National Emergency! Trump Set to Declare National Emergency to Stop Deep State[119] POTUS won't allow the Democrats to leave America's southern border vulnerable Alex Jones covers President Trump's statement that he may declare a national emergency in order to get the wall on our southern border built.[120]  Appeals Court Sides With Trump on Transgender Military Ban[121] A federal appeals court on Friday overturned a lower court's ruling blocking President Trump's ban on transgender people serving in the military from taking effect. The ruling hands Trump a win in a case that has seen several courts block the policy. But the policy still cannot take effect because of those other injunctions, which applied nationwide.[122]  Brave New World: Gay Man Impregnates Transgender Partner Who Identifies as Male[123] Stephan and Wyley met on a gay dating app, and they live in a converted bus in their friend's backyard in San Antonio. 'The bio of his Grindr account said something like, 'Country boy, loves the wild, loves animals, vegan' and then like picture of a tree,' Stephan said of Wyley. All of the above is enough to open a few eyebrows \u2014 but the kicker is that Wyley is pregnant, according to an upcoming 'Extreme Love'episode about the couple.[124]  Colleges Are Breeding Grounds for Civil War[125] Education system and our political institutions have turned our children into enemies of the state We have become a nation of angry people. Too many of us carry a chip on our shoulder and find racism everywhere, sexism everywhere, misogyny rampant, homophobia out of control. It is no wonder we have masked leftists lashing out with violence, a new congresswoman making profanity-laced speeches demanding President Trump's impeachment. We now have a Democrat majority House of Representatives with scores of avowed communists in their ranks who are in no mood to cooperate with the system as founded, but to overturn it. Heather MacDonald, political commentator, essayist, attorney, and journalist says that universities and colleges in America today are breeding grounds for hate and planting seeds for civil war. Students are being trained by cultural Marxists in faculty and administration and it's been going on for decades They have been thoroughly indoctrinated in the ways of socialist dogma. The last several generations of these zombies are now pushing their way to the forefront to see their ethics become universal. They are mean, angry and determined. Their rhetoric has become so vile, the next step can only be mass violence. The Democrat leadership can hide it no longer. They have been overrun by these zombie-like clones bent on crushing this country and are being fed and nurtured by the current leadership that dares not go against their will, lest they lose their power. [Comment: 100% correct. USA should never have allowed those Frankfurt School acolytes fleeing Hitler into the USA.][126]  The Wicked Gender-Deluded Mob Must be Defeated[127] Driven by the perverse LGBT agenda, while aided and abetted by the ignorant and immoral mainstream media and the devilish Democratic Party, 'transgender' disasters are playing out all around us. While some of these disasters have 'only' resulted in an adult temper tantrum, a lawsuit, or the loss of a job, others have literally put lives in danger, including those of children Denying liberal dogma on sex doesn't just put you in physical danger; it may also cost you your job. Undeterred by a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court (take note, Christian conservatives), the state of Colorado, and like-minded gender fools, is again out to destroy Jack Phillips financially. Instead of using homosexuality and same-sex 'marriage' to attack Mr. Phillips, this time, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission is armed with the dubious accusations of a vicious sex-deluded activist. Peter Vlaming, a devout Christian, was recently fired from his job teaching French at a Virginia public school because he refused to bow to the LGBT mob. In the summer of 2018, the British National Health Service fired a medical doctor because '[t]he 55-year-old father of four believes sex is genetic and biological, so established at birth.' Most vulnerable in this absurd debate are the children who are the targets of adults who harbor sex delusions. Liberals across the U.S. \u2014 including those at ABC's Good Morning America \u2014 have recently celebrated (read: sexualized) a child 'drag queen.' His parents even recently allowed the 11-year-old boy to 'perform' at a homosexual night club. Across the U.S., children are being indoctrinated into the perverse transgender agenda via 'Drag Queen Story Time.' In addition, some foolish parents are allowing their deceived children to destroy their otherwise healthy bodies \u2014 many times at the risk of the child's life \u2014 with surgeries, dangerous drugs, and other forms of physical mutilation. Little of this would be possible without a complicit medical community. In what should be regarded as malpractice and child abuse, doctors in the most medically advanced but morally corrupt nations in the world are encouraging what science has long said was impossible. Liberals are so blinded by their ideology in this debate that we now have more legislation in support of delusion.[128]  Proof That 'World Government' is Banker Tyranny[129] In 1919, the Rothschild-dominated Bank of England planned to trick the United States into becoming a 'British' colony again by joining the League of Nations. The League of the Nations, like the 'British Empire', was the bankers' fiefdom, and this strategem would merely formalize a colonial status which already existed. The bankers took over the U.S. during the Teddy Roosevelt Administration (1901-1909) when Rothschild front J.P. Morgan alone controlled 25% of American business. The 'Col. E.M. House Report', is a chilling 10-page 'progress report' dated June 10,1919 which proves the League of Nations was an aborted attempt at world government and a facade for banker tyranny. The Report reveals the reality and the tactics behind the United Nations and globalization. House writes: 'We have wrapped this plan in the peace treaty so that the world must accept from us the League or a continuance of the war. The League is in substance the Empire with America admitted on the same basis as our other colonies.' The report oozes contempt for Americans and reveals the deceitful methods international finance employed almost 100 years ago to bring about world government. These goals and methods have not changed. If ever we needed proof of an elite conspiracy to subvert and enslave us, this is it.[130]  The Colonel House Report (1919)[131] Through the Red Cross, the Scout movement, the YMC, the church, and other humane, religious, and quasi-religious organizations, we have created an atmosphere of international effort which strengthens the idea of unity of the English-speaking world. In the co-ordination of this work, Mr. Raymond Fosdick, formerly of the Rockefeller Foundation, has been especially conspicuous. I would also like to mention President Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia University, who has eloquently advocated this form of internationalism and carefully emphasize its distinction from the false internationalism which is infecting the proletariat. The Overseas Club in this country now contains nearly hundred thousand pledged members with a Journal of their own. Our thanks are due to Lord St. George's, St. David's, St. Andrew's, and Pilgrim Clubs, together with the Daughters of the Empire. the Prince of Wales Fund, and the other association and guilds connected with our multitudinous war charities enable us to pervade all sections and classes of the country, and provide us with a force of empire builders whose loyalty an services are both invaluable to us and highly appreciated by the native colonists. The censorship, together with our monopoly of cables and our passport control of passengers, enables us to hold all American newspapers as isolated from the non-American world as if they had been in another planet instead of in another hemisphere The realization of this by the Associated Press and the other universal news gatherers \u2014 except Hearst \u2014 was most helpful in bringing only our point of view to the papers they served. British-born editors and reporters now create imperial sentiment in most American newspapers. As their identity and origins are not usually known, they can talk and write for us as Americans to Americans.[132] [ 1]: <url

It is estimated that the annual number of Germans fleeing the country has increased by 150%. In other news, in a triumphal photo op ceremony, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi signed the articles of impeachment against Donald Trump with multiple pens, which she then handed out to her colleagues as souvenirs.

Financial and technology shares led the rally, with Google's parent Alphabet becoming only the fourth company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, as investors were encouraged by a batch of healthy U.S. economic data along with positive corporate earnings reports.[51]  11 Bernie Sanders Campaign Staffers Lock Twitter Accounts After Video Exposes Staffer's Violent Rhetoric[52] 11 Bernie Sanders campaign Iowa State Directors and Coordinators have locked their Twitter accounts after a shocking Project Veritas investigative video report showed Sanders campaign field organizer Kyle Jurek calling for mass violence and gulags. Head of Project Veritas James O'Keefe reported that the staffers had protected their tweets and noted that this is the 'first campaign where multiple staffers shut down social media.'[53]  Bernie Sanders Subreddit Bans CNN, Saying They 'Have Abandoned Their Journalistic Integrity'[54] Sanders For President, a subreddit dedicated to supporting Senator Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, has become the latest community on the platform to ban all content from news network CNN. In a recent post, Sanders For President moderator Kevin Moore announced that all CNN content will be removed from the community for the foreseeable future because CNN 'have abandoned their journalistic integrity.'[55]  Dental Assistant Says She Was Fired After Writing 'MAGA 2020' On Facebook[56] In South Milwaukee, a dental assistant says she was fired due to the complaint of a person who disagreed with a pro-Trump message she made on her Facebook profile. The case of the Robyn Polak On January 14, President Donald Trump visited Milwaukee to hold a political rally. In support of the Republican president, Robyn Polak, a dental assistant at Precision Dental MKE, posted on her Facebook page the message 'MAGA 2020' (Make America Great Again). It seems that this message was not liked by a Facebook user, who left a negative review on the dental office page, accusing employees of being racist for posting MAGA 2020.[57]  Doctor Shares New Evidence Suggesting Jeffrey Epstein Didn't Kill Himself[58] Dr. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist has claimed that Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself. It's a claim that has steadily become more mainstream in the months following his sudden death. Baden is citing Epstein's burst capillaries in his eyes which is a sign of manual strangulation as opposed to hanging. Baden was a guest on a Dr. Oz special set to air on Thursday, the pathologist examined photographs of Epstein's eyes and other parts of his corpse taken during his autopsy.[59]  Donald Trump Proclaims Religious Freedom Day 2020[60] President Donald J. Trump has officially proclaimed January 16, 2020, 'Religious Freedom Day' to commemorate 'the foundational link between freedom and faith in our country.' 'From its opening pages, the story of America has been rooted in the truth that all men and women are endowed with the right to follow their conscience, worship freely, and live in accordance with their convictions,' reads the proclamation, by which President Trump said he wished to 'reaffirm our commitment to safeguarding the religious liberty of all Americans.'[61]  Epstein Trafficked Girls as Recently as 2018 \u2014 Some as Young as 11, According to Lawsuit by Virgin Islands AG[62] Jeffrey Epstein trafficked and sexually abused girls as young as eleven years old, as recently as 2018, according to a new lawsuit filed against the late pedophile's estate by Virgin Islands Attorney General Denise N. George. The lawsuit claims that girls as young as 11 and 12 were brought to his private estate in the Virgin Islands, known as Little Saint James (or simply 'pedo island') \u2014 where former President Bill Clinton and other high-profile guests reportedly vacationed, according to several Epstein accusers. Epstein kept a computerized database to track the availability and movements of his victims, according to the New York Times.[63]  Finally. The Feds \u2014 Including ICE \u2014 Appear to be Investigating Ilhan Omar[64] On Oct. 30, I reported that the Department of Justice had assigned an FBI Special Agent in Charge, or SAC, to review Rep. Ilhan Omar's apparent, astonishing spree of felonies from 2009 to 2017. Minnesota state Rep. Steve Drazkowski (R) had previously filed a complaint on the matter with the Minnesota District of the Department of Justice. That office \u2014 headed by U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald, a 2018 Donald Trump appointee \u2014 directed the FBI to review the complaint. An FBI SAC formally met with Rep. Drazkowski, and others, in mid-October to receive a prepared file of evidence and related information. I can confirm that the FBI has taken additional steps since this October meeting.[65]  Goldman Sachs Clients 87 Per Cent Sure Trump Will be Re-Elected[66] Goldman Sachs clients are 87 per cent sure that Donald Trump will be re-elected as President later this year. Asked 'Will President Trump Win A Second Term?', a resounding majority of those attending a Goldman Sachs Global Strategy Conference in London yesterday said he would. Their confidence in Trump being returned to the Oval Office probably has a lot to do with the fact that only 5 per cent of respondents think the U.S. economy will enter recession in 2020.[67]  HBO Cancels 'Confederate' Series Before a Single Script is Written; Slavery Defeated[68] Libs talk a lot about the evils of social media, the main one being that people keep using it to express opinions that make libs angry. But social media can be a helpful tool for social progress as well. It can 'cancel' people or things that might literally hurt or kill us by making us think about stuff we don't want to think about. It can prevent Young Adult novels from being published if they're insufficiently #woke. It can keep comedians from being hired by late-night 'comedy' shows if they've ever said anything that somebody, somewhere, didn't like. And now social media has even kept a premium-cable show from being made, before it could use magical mind-control rays to turn all the white people into even bigger racists than they already are. Back in the summer of 2017, America was in the grips of a media-fueled panic about Confederate flags and statues, which after 150 years were suddenly the source of all evil because Hillary lost. And in the middle of all that hysteria, the hapless writing duo of David Benioff and D.B. Weiss announced they were making a new show for HBO called Confederate. (If it seems odd that HBO was still in business with the two of them, remember that in 2017 they hadn't ruined Game of Thrones yet.) Here's how Benioff ...iss described Confederate: 'The series takes place in an alternate timeline, where the southern states have successfully seceded from the Union, giving rise to a nation in which slavery remains legal and has evolved into a modern institution. The story follows a broad swath of characters on both sides of the Mason-Dixon Demilitarized Zone \u2014 freedom fighters, slave hunters, politicians, abolitionists, journalists, the executives of a slave-holding conglomerate and the families of people in their thrall.'[69]  How Scalia Botched Heller and Let the Left Undermine the 2nd Amendment[70] Heller was hailed as a 'landmark' decision \u2014 a triumph of conservative jurisprudence and Scalia's philosophy of 'originalism' \u2014 when it was decided in 2008. But the intervening years have demonstrated that the argument he presented in his opinion was unsound and contained language that enabled the political left to enact most of the gun control it wanted anyway.[71]  Mailchimp Bans Stefan Molyneux After One Tweet From Leftist Activist[72] One tweet from a left-wing activist working for the organized boycotting group Sleeping Giants appears to have been all it took for the email marketing company Mailchimp to boot popular conservative YouTuber Stefan Molyneux off their platform. Nandini Jammi, a co-founder of Matt Rivitz' Sleeping Giants, asked Mailchimp on Monday night if they knew that 'power white nationalist' Stefan Molyneux used their service for his newsletter. 'Molyneux promotes eugenics, race science and 'men's rights' activism,' Jammi said. 'Can you look into this please?' 'Thank you for bringing this to our attention,' Mailchimp responded the next morning. 'We've terminated this account.' [Comment: Mailchimp alternatives \u2014 blog.capterra.com/top-10-mailchimp-alternatives-small-business-email-marketing/ , <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-mailchimp-alternatives/\">www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-mailchimp-alternatives/</url> .][73]  Mailchimp Deplatforms Stefan Molyneux After Allegations From Activist[74] Email marketing service Mailchimp has terminated the account of Stefan Molyneux, host of the philosophy show Freedomain, after a complaint from Nandini Jammi, co-founder of activist group Sleeping Giants. Mailchimp appears to have made the decision largely based on this complaint from Jammi which alleges that Molyneux is a white nationalist who promotes eugenics and race science. Molyneux denied these allegations but Mailchimp decided to terminate his account anyway and thanked Jammi for 'bringing this to our attention.'[75]  New Year, New Browser \u2014 the New Microsoft Edge is Out of Preview and Now Available for Download[76] A little over a year ago, we announced our intention to rebuild Microsoft Edge on the Chromium open source project with the goals of delivering better compatibility for everyone, less fragmentation for web developers, and a partnership with the Chromium community to improve the Chromium engine itself. At Ignite, we unveiled our new vision for the web and search, our colorful new icon, and how Microsoft Edge + Bing are the browser and search engine for business \u2014 and we are thrilled by the growing excitement we've heard from all of you who've tried it out and sent feedback! From this incredible momentum, today I'm pleased to announce the new Microsoft Edge is now available to download on all supported versions of Windows and macOS in more than 90 languages. Microsoft Edge is also available on iOS and Android, providing a true cross-platform experience.

The findings suggest that Parioscorpio venator is the oldest-known scorpion reported to date and may have been capable of leaving its marine habitat and venturing onto land, a behaviour similar to that of present-day horseshoe crabs. Scorpions are among the first animals to have moved from the sea onto land but because their fossil record is limited, how and when they adapted to life on land remains unclear. Andrew Wendruff and colleagues describe two well-preserved specimens of a previously unknown fossil scorpion species discovered in the Waukesha Biota in Wisconsin, USA, which dates from the early Silurian. This makes the fossils older than Dolichophonus loudonensis, from Scotland, which was previously accepted as the oldest known scorpion species.[79]  Pelosi Signed Articles of Impeachment With Pens That Looked Like Bullets[80] Nancy Pelosi signed the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump with pens that looked like bullets as she and other Democrats laughed. 'These are the pens Nancy Pelosi used to sign the articles ...e gave them out to colleagues. Wow they look like bullet cases,' commented Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo.[81]  Physicists Take Dark Matter's Temperature[82] Warm, cold, just right? Physicists at the University of California, Davis are taking the temperature of dark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up about a quarter of our universe. We have very little idea of what dark matter is and physicists have yet to detect a dark matter particle. But we do know that the gravity of clumps of dark matter can distort light from distant objects. Chris Fassnacht, a physics professor at UC Davis and colleagues are using this distortion, called gravitational lensing, to learn more about the properties of dark matter.[83]  Rotten Tomatoes Deletes All the Early User Reviews for Doctor Who: Season 12[84] Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes has scrubbed all the initial user reviews for season 12 of science fiction drama Doctor Who from its site. YouTuber Sheila Allen, who previously drew attention to the Rotten Tomatoes Audience Score for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker being stuck at 86%, discovered that the Rotten Tomatoes user reviews for Doctor Who season 12 had been purged sometime between January 9 and January 11.[85]  Sharyl Attkisson Refiles Spying Suit, Exposes Big Deep State Players[86] In her lawsuit refiled on January 10, Attkisson relied on a whistleblower who was actually involved in hacking her computers. He identified some of the other government officials complicit in the very disturbing spying on her. The refiled complaint quotes government forensics experts as being 'quite shocked,' demonstrating some within the government Intelligence Community thankfully have consciences. The spying occurred after she crossed the Obama administration with her unrelenting reporting on the gun-running scandal called Fast and Furious, then continued through her reporting on the Benghazi disaster, where a United States ambassador and three others stationed at the embassy in Libya were murdered while Obama and then-Secretary of State Hilary Clinton failed to respond with help and protection. The refiled suit meticulously describes the nightmarish facts of how her computers and home were electronically and physically invaded as if she were a real 'enemy of the people' and the government was playing Mission Impossible. Forensic details were derived from numerous investigations, leaving the conclusions unquestionable. The spying was conducted using government proprietary spyware and a mysterious United States Postal Service Internet domain. The latter fact is highly relevant, as government experts explained. A multi-agency government spying unit in Baltimore under Rosenstein's supervision used these techniques, and they were even employed without court-ordered warrants.[87]  The Supreme Court Could Hear Its First Challenge to Section 230[88] The United States' 1996 Communications Decency Act (CDA) Section 230 has worked very well in the intervening years to enable the development and rise of social media and tech giants as legally unencumbered platforms when it comes to publishing third-party user content. That's what's allowed the shape and the face of the internet as we know it today \u2014 but also the unprecedented rise in terms of the influence wielded by some of these companies, like Google, Facebook, Apple, and others. Section 230 protections are currently some of the most debated issues in the political realm, exploring Big Tech's legal status in the US. MLex, a site looking into market regulatory news, reports about a new challenge here.[89]  The Virginia Gun Rights Conflict: Best and Worst Case Scenarios[90] In my article 'Trump Impeachment And The Civil War Scenario', I warned that conservatives and leftists are being pushed to the brink of a shooting war using various methods of social manipulation and 4th Gen warfare and that this conflict, if dictated by gatekeepers of the false Left/Right paradigm, would only benefit establishment elites in the long run. Internal division among the public is designed to keep us at each other's throats while losing focus on the real enemies. Hardline Democrats and the social justice cult are merely a symptom of the disease, they are not the source of the disease. However, I also acknowledge that the rift between conservatives and the political left has become so extreme that reconciliation is almost impossible. War might be unavoidable, and the globalists love it. If they can pretend like they had nothing to do with creating tensions, and if conservatives are so blinded by anger against Democrats that they refuse to admit that some of their own political leaders (including Trump) have been co-opted, the elites win. The danger in any civil war is that BOTH sides end up being manipulated and controlled and that the situation is maneuvered towards an outcome that only serves the interests of a select few. Virginia may be a testbed, a trial run for a nationwide conflagration, and if it does hit a point where state officials compel a violent response from the citizenry, then it is important that liberty advocates remain vigilant and steer clear of incompetent or controlled leaders. It is also important that they remember there is a much larger agenda at play here; the Democrats may be useful idiots fueling that agenda, but most of them are oblivious to their role. Our fight is not with the Democrats, our fight is with the globalists that influence them; the same globalists that are trying to influence us. Leftists argue that sanctuary county resolutions are 'purely symbolic' and have no force of law behind them. This is a rather naive (perhaps deliberately naive) position, as it ignores the fundamentals. The force of law is either compelled by conscience, or it is compelled by violence. The law itself is meaningless without these two factors. If groups of citizens choose not to follow a law because they find it morally reprehensible, there is nothing the state can do except try to frighten them into compliance with the threat of violence. The concept of law by itself has no energy and claiming that something is 'right' because it is now 'law' is not a valid argument. In the case of anti-gun laws in Virginia, the VAST majority of counties in the state and the people in those counties have made it clear that they will not comply. The leftists have completely ignored this fact by simply saying 'They have to comply because the law says so' This is the type of attitude that leads to war. Leftists argue that state laws supersede county authority and there is no legal standing for sanctuary resolutions. The problem with this argument is that it ignores the fact that constitutional protections provided by the Bill of Rights supersede ALL other laws. It does not matter if attempts are being made by state governments or the federal government to degrade constitutional rights, the people are empowered to refuse and fight against ANY laws which violate constitutional rights. [Comment: Recommended reading; a good explantion of the situation in Virginia.][91]  Tucker Carlson Calling Out Virginia Democrats Seeking to Shut Down the 2a and Disarm the Population[92] 'Are people going to go along with this and just sit back and let a constitutional right evaporate, or is there going to be some pushback?'[93]  Yes, It's True, They're Crazy[94] When you receive the queen of spades in a game of hearts, it pretty much dashes your hopes for that hand. Among hearts players, the queen of spades is nicknamed 'Greta.' That nickname has lately become shockingly appropriate. Anointed by the Far Left Crazy as Scold O' The World, Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg has issued a set of 'demands' to the elite globalists who are getting ready to board their private jets and head to Davos for the World Economic Forum. She's more than just some goofy kid babbling about things she doesn't understand. She's Time Magazine's Person of the Year. They trotted her out a few months ago to scold world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly. She's the new voice of Climate Change hysteria, and somebody is making sure she stays on center stage. We need to quote from her at some length to display just how crazy the Far Left Crazy is.[95]  YouTube Removes Pro-Trump T-Shirts From Creator Merch Shelves, Says They Violate Community Guidelines[96] YouTube has started removing pro-Trump t-shirts from the merch shelves of several prominent YouTubers and is telling creators that these shirts violate its community guidelines.

In yet another grooming scandal involving predominately Pakistani men sexually abusing mainly white girls, a new report reveals that Greater Manchester Police 'failed to take appropriate action more than 15 years ago, despite getting details of nearly 100 'persons of interest' who were using takeout restaurants as a base to rape and abuse children in care between the ages of 11 and 17' and despite the fact that the culprits were operating 'in plain sight.' All the victims were 'young white females' aged 11-17 while all the perpetrators were 'almost exclusively Asian adult males, many of whom are associated via the Asian restaurant trade,' according to the report.[103]  'Co-Operation Morphed Into Domination' \u2014 EU 'Superstate' Told to Learn Brexit Lessons[104] Brexit Party MEP Anne Widdecombe has warned Eurocrats to 'learn the lessons' from Brexit and scale back on federalism, or else the European Union will not survive.

Firefighters Who Are 'Racists' For Playing the Circle Game[118] Over the past year, the OK sign has suddenly become a symbol of white power. I know this because the media keeps telling me so. A Chicago Cubs fan was banned from Wrigley Field for life for doing it. British actor and staunch liberal Stephen Frywas accused of white supremacy for doing it. Most recently, it was some West Point cadets. It didn't matter that it was dumb and crazy to call somebody a racist for making a circle with their thumb and forefinger. People needed something to be angry about. Something to click on to escape the emptiness in their souls. Less than a month later, now we're back to this foolishness.[119]  Orban: Austria Natural Partner of V4[120] Austria is a 'natural partner' of Hungary and the Visegrad Group, and they can cooperate in many areas, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said at a news conference in Prague after a summit of the leaders of the V4 countries and Austria on Thursday.[121]  UK: Brexiteer MP Launches Crowdfunding Campaign to Have Big Ben Bong for Brexit[122] Conservative MP Mark Francois has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise the 500,000 needed to restore the bong to Big Ben for Brexit.

Facing up to 20 years in prison, Joseph Gobrick told a judge in Michigan that he had a First Amendment right to view child porn on his computer and that he was in fact an 8-year-old girl, so it didn't matter anyway.

While the IMF cut global growth forecasts, the United Kingdom economy was predicted by the body to continue to grow, fractionally outpacing the European Union's aggregate rate in 2019, 2020, and 2021, the report said.[59]  'Loomer's Law' \u2014 Congressional Candidate Laura Loomer Inspires New Anti-Censorship Bill Targeting Social Media[60] A bill will be introduced next week in Florida, aimed at allowing lawsuits to be filed against social media platforms for political censorship. Breitbart reported that the legislation will be announced on Tuesday by Florida Senator and Republican leader Joe Gruters. According to the bill posted on the website of the Florida State Senate, the goal is to make sure that 'certain' social media platforms that have created a digital public square live up to the standards required by this turn of events, and allow Florida residents the right to political and religious free speech on the platforms. The bill specifically concerns these two types of speech.[61]  'I'm Ready for the F**king Revolution \u2014 Guillotine the Rich' \u2014 James O'Keefe Strikes Again: Second Bernie Sanders Staffer Praises Gulags[62] Project Veritas Action released a new undercover investigation today that includes footage of another Bernie Sanders operative \u2014 Martin Weissgerber \u2014 calling for guillotines and revolution.[63]  AOC Claims Democrats Are 'Center-Conservative' Party[64] Radical socialist suggests party not extreme enough.[65]  App Warning: With One Photo, Strangers Can Find All Your Information[66] An app called Clearview allows the user to snap a photo of anyone. Once that's done, the person who took your picture will have access to all of your information. Privacy is now all but obsolete. People will not, for much longer, be able to walk down the street minding their own business anonymously. According to a report by The New York Times, it won't be long before anyone at any time knows exactly who you are while you're in public. What if a stranger could snap your picture on the sidewalk then use an app to quickly discover your name, address and other details? A startup called Clearview AI has made that possible. Perhaps the worst news is that the police state is already using this technology in some parts of the 'land of the free.'

EIA forecasts that the United States will continue to be a net exporter of total crude oil and petroleum products; renewable energy generation will grow from a 17% share of U.S. electricity generation in 2019 to 22% in 2021; and the energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will decrease by 2.0% in 2020 and by 1.5% in 2021.[71]  Florida Police Officer Suspended for 'Liking' His Wife's Facebook Comments Critical of Rashida Tlaib From Last January![72] Officer Pablo Lima was placed on administrative leave by the Bay Harbor Islands police department on Friday for liking a Facebook post his wife posted back in early 2019. Pablo's wife Anabelle Lima-Taub, a Hallandale Beach commissioner, attacked Democrat lawmaker Rashida Tlaib on Facebook in January 2019. Lima-Taub accused Tlaib of being a 'Hamas-Loving Anti-Semite.' Her husband liked the post and now he's suspended![73]  Google Whistleblower Suggests His Wife's Fatal Car Crash May Not Have Been Accidental[74] Says he was warned of an 'accident' months before. Google whistleblower Dr. Robert Epstein has suggested that his wife's fatal car crash may not have been accidental. Last month, Misti Dawn Vaughn's Ford Ranger spun out of control on a slippery road in California and veered into the path of a tractor trailer. She died from her injuries days later. Police concluded that drugs or alcohol were not factors in the crash. In a tweet posted last night, Epstein appeared to suggest that the crash was not accidental and Vaughn's vehicle could have been tampered with. 'Last year, after I briefed a group of state AGs about #Google's power to rig elections, one of them said, 'I think you're going to die in an accident in a few months,' wrote Epstein. 'A few months later, my beautiful wife #Misti died a violent death. Makes you wonder,' he added. Through his exhaustive studies, Epstein has exposed how algorithm manipulation by Big Tech can shift millions of votes during elections. After the 2016 presidential election, Epstein surmised that search engine bias shifted 2-3 million votes in Hillary Clinton's favor. Epstein has also repeatedly savaged the idea that Big Tech platforms are just 'private companies' and can therefore do what they like. 'Who on Earth gave these private companies the power to make decisions about what everyone in the world is going to see or not see?' asked Epstein, adding, 'These companies shouldn't have that power, period.'[75]  Gov.

The footage featured a man identified as 'paid' South Carolina field organizer Martin Weissgerber was posted a week after the release of video featuring radical Iowa field organizer Kyle Jurek, part of the undercover journalism outfit's #Expose2020 series. In the video, Mr. Weissgerber described himself as a communist and said that he was in contact with groups that planned to hold mass 'yellow-vest' protests like those that have roiled France if Mr. Sandersloses.[79]  Joe Biden Falsely Accuses Bernie Sanders Campaign of 'Doctored Video'[80] The battle ahead of the Democratic primary elections to select the party's candidate for the 2020 US presidential ballot is heating up, with candidates involved in headline-grabbing mutual accusations and other controversies. Speaking of which: Joe Biden, considered by some to be the front-runner to get the nomination, has falsely accused one of his rivals, Senator Bernie Sanders, of using 'a doctored video.'[81]  Man Stabs, Kills Pro-Trump Boss, Drapes American Flag Over Him, Deputies Say[82] ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 A construction worker with anti-government beliefs is accused of fatally stabbing his boss, who was a 'proud and outspoken American and pro-Donald Trump,' according to an Orange County sheriff's arrest affidavit. Mason Trever Toney, 28, was arrested Monday on murder charges in the death of his boss, William Knight, 28. The fatal stabbing was reported at 10:45 a.m. at a construction site at Exit 254 of Florida's Turnpike near State Road 528.[83]  Mandatory Flu Vaccine Coming Your Way?[84] As discussed in my November 5, 2019, article, 'Trojan Horse of Measles \u2014 More Vaccines With the Mandate,' while most state legislation targeting vaccination mandates have focused on measles, what tends to get lost in the debate is that these mandatory vaccination laws are likely to be extended to all vaccines, including the influenza vaccine, the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and any number of vaccines licensed and recommended by the federal government in the future. In other words, measles outbreaks and the fear-mongering by exaggerating disease risks and minimizing vaccine risks are being cleverly used to create propaganda to eliminate the legal right to make vaccine choices across the board. As just one example, in 'Trojan Horse of Measles,' I discuss how a bill has been introduced in New York that requires children to be vaccinated against HPV in order to attend day care and public school. This, despite the incredible health risks associated with the HPV vaccine and its low benefit-to-risk ratio,1 not to mention the fact that it has never been proven to lower cancer rates. On the contrary, emerging data suggest the incidence of cervical cancer increased in Sweden after HPV vaccine was recommended for all girls and women aged 9 to 26 years Chairman and chief legal counsel for Children's Health Defense Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated in 'The Plaintiff's Science Day Presentation on Gardasil,' that Merck's HPV vaccine Gardasil 'has distinguished itself as the most dangerous vaccine ever invented.' In his presentation, Kennedy reveals Merck data showing Gardasil increases the overall risk of death by 370%, risk of autoimmune disease by 2.3% and risk of a serious medical condition by 50%. A 2018 study published in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health5 found that women who received HPV vaccinations suffered higher rates of infertility. According to this study, 'if 100% of females in this study had received the HPV vaccine, data suggest the number of women having ever conceived would have fallen by 2 million.' After 'skeptic' critics of scientific evidence that vaccines have significant health risks publicly attacked the study, the paper was withdrawn by the publisher.6 A 2014 case report paper7 described cases of three adolescent girls who suffered premature ovarian insufficiency after their HPV vaccinations \u2014 a condition that can render them incapable of bearing children in the future. Conveniently, Merck, maker of Gardasil, is also 'the world market leader in fertility treatments,' according to the European Pharmaceutical Review.8[85]  Project Veritas Bernie Sanders Campaign Expos Dominated Social Interactions Despite Mainstream Media Blackout[86] Earlier this week, Project Veritas released a video recorded undercover that shows a man said to be a Bernie Sanders staffer, saying he expects that if US President Donald Trump is re-elected in November, 'cities will burn' \u2014 as well as that Trump voters might be 'reeducated' in case of a Sanders victory. Further, the man \u2014 identified as Kyle Jurek \u2014 described himself as an anarcho-communist and suggested that members of the militant left-wing group Antifa might be in the Sanders campaign. And even though the undercover video was mostly ignored by mainstream media, it still managed to become headline news on the internet. The story succeeded in overshadowing what many would have expected to have the most impact \u2014 namely, a clash between Sanders and another Democratic presidential hopeful, Elizabeth Warren, over whether or not he said that 'a woman can't win' a US election.[87]  Rabid Democrats Accuse Trump of Yet Another Crime, But Ignore Obama's Lawlessness[88] The GAO released their new report on Thursday morning claiming Trump violated federal law, although many suspect the GAO report is meant help Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-California.and her rabid members of the Democratic Party, such as Reps. Adam Schiff, D-California, and Jerrold Nadler, D-New York. According to Sid Franes, a former NYPD detective and ex-director of security, 'The timing of the GAO releasing its report was possibly planned for maximum effect against President Trump especially since it comes during the impeachment process that many recognize is a frame up by the Deep State's 'foot soldiers'' 'If the Democrats believe that they are going to impeach Trump for delaying payments to a rogue regime, they are holding a losing hand in the Swamp's political Poker game. They are a political party that's gone extremely rogue,' said Franes, who has worked as an adviser to a number of political campaigns. [Comment: The Democrat Party has revealed it's ugly face since Trump was elected \u2014 the party is a rabid Communist Party.][89]  Rep. Adam Schiff Caught Leaking Classified Information From House Committee in Effort to Damage President Trump[90] Democrat Adam Schiff leaked sensitive and classified House Committee materials in his obsession to politically damage President Trump. In an exclusive report, we provide the evidence below. On July 12, 2018, Democrat Representative Adam Schiff sent John Szobocsan a letter on official letterhead requesting that Mr. Szobocsan participate in an interview in front of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI):[91]  Sidney Powell Files Motion Withdrawing General Flynn's Guilty Plea[92] The General's original plea is tainted for many reasonsGeneral Flynn never lied to anyone, and then there's the conflict of interest with his previous attorneys, and now the move to withdraw his plea of guilty because the government has engaged in bad faith and vindictive conduct, and has breached the plea agreement pursuant to which he has cooperated for two years. Sidney Powell rightfully has filed the motion to withdraw General Flynn's original plea. Countless exculpatory documents were requested by attorney Sidney Powell from the DOJ's FBI, and Judge Sullivan demanded them. Yet, none were forthcoming and the judge allowed the lack of exculpatory evidence from the FBI to remain hidden. It has even been reported that dirty cop, FBI agent Joe Pientka and his wife are being hidden. Joe was involved with everything corrupt involving the Russia Collusion Hoax and his wife is an attorney for a company involved with Fusion GPS. Why is the FBI allowed to hide exculpatory evidence and not respond to Judge Sullivan's order? Where the h*ll is AG Barr? Where the hell is FBI Director Christopher Wray? And why the hell hasn't the Judge seen to it that his orders were followed? The buck stops with President Trumphe is in charge of the DOJ.[93]  Soros-Funded St. Louis Circuit Attorney Sued for Communications With Felon-Journalist, Her Chief Investigator on Greitens' Case Indicted on 6 Counts of Perjury[94] As reported earlier investigative journalist and Fox News Contributor John Solomon sued controversial St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner last week. What was not reported was the extent of the lawsuit or the extent of this Missouri scandal. John Solomon sued Gardner for violating Sunshine Laws. Gardner, a Soros-funded circuit attorney, refused to turn over documents related to the case against Eric Greitens, a Navy SEAL and former Governor. In 2018 the Soros-backed St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner led a campaign to attack, smear and oust popular Missouri Republican Governor Eric Greitens. When Kim Gardner was elected in 2016, over 70% of Kim Gardner's campaign funds came from George Soros, over $190,000. Gardner and her associate and former FBI agent, William Tisaby, were successful in forcing Governor Eric Greitens to resign from office. Former Missouri Governer Eric Greitens was indicted in February 2018 on invasion of privacy charges for taking a photo of a naked mistress before he ran for governor. The woman claimed it was very traumatizing. The woman also admitted she went back to Eric's house later that same day for more sex. The photo never materialized. And according to our sources there never was a photo.[95]  Target Tori Says She's Giving Away the Proceeds From Her GoFundMe to a Good Cause[96] Target manager Tori, who recently gained mass support from the Twitterverse after journalist David Leavitt called the police on her over a '$0.01' toothbrush, says that she'll be giving the proceeds from her GoFundMe to a good cause. The GoFundMe was set up shortly after Leavitt tried to get Tori to sell him a toothbrush for $0.01 \u2014 seemingly because he had confused a display unit price with the price of the toothbrush he wanted to buy. When Tori refused, Leavitt posted a photo of her to his 200,000+ Twitter followers, called the police, and threatened to take legal action. Twitter threw their support behind Tori and popular meme maker Carpe Donktum set up a GoFundMe to send Tori on a vacation after having to deal with Leavitt.[97]  Tens of Thousands Descend Upon Virginia to Peacefully Support the Second Amendment[98] Violence nowhere to be found to disappointment of mainstream media.[99]  The 'Historic' Sham Impeachment of President Donald J. Trump[100] The January 15 press conference was astonishingly cringeworthy to listen to. A stuttering Nancy Pelosi, who seemed like she was suffering from alcohol withdrawal, uttered some of the nation's most historic quotes and had the gall to compare them to what the Democrats continually allege that President Trump did: ask Ukraine to interfere in our national elections and threaten to withhold foreign aid from Ukraine if they didn't. Of course, this is EXACTLY what quid pro quo Joe Biden did. Biden was caught on tape admitting to extortion and bragging about it, as he demanded Ukraine fire a prosecutor investigating Burisma, an oil company, and its corrupt dealings that involved Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, or else they would not get the foreign aid money. Democrats keep playing by the playbook, 'Accuse the other side of that which you are guilty.' When will this trick get old and people stop going along with it? This January 15th press conference was beyond the theatre of the absurd. Here are some of the things that were said by Nancy Pelosi President Trump's impeachment is comparable to a kangaroo court in a banana republic. Unfortunately for Americans, the Democrat Party is still a viable political party in the United States and represents the socialist / communist / banana republic wing of the nation.[101]  The Impeachment Trial: Getting Trump (And the Clintons) Off the Hook[102] There is no doubt that Trump has an excellent case to make against impeachment and that the Senate won't convict him. The strange part of the story is why his defense team not only includes liberal Democrat Dershowitz but the 'Republican' lawyer who botched the impeachment case against Bill Clinton, Kenneth Starr. He is a Fox News contributor who served as Independent Counsel investigating the Clintons from 1994 to 1999. He failed to pursue the most serious charges, including a cover-up surrounding the 1993 death of Deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster. Strangely, both defended billionaire pedophile Epstein, a high-level friend of the rich and powerful whose alleged suicide in prison has been openly questioned and even ridiculed. Asked why he defended Epstein, Starrreplied, 'I was very happy to respond to the needs of a client of the firm.' The comments were made after a 2015 National Press Club event on 'the future of higher education and the calling of faith-based institutions.'[103]  Trump at Davos: America is Experiencing 'Blue-Collar Boom'[104] President Donald Trump told the World Economic Forum on Tuesday that the United States is living in the midst of a massive 'blue-collar boom' that is targeting the lower classes. 'This is a blue-collar boom,' the president stated at the conference in Davos, Switzerland. 'Since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage-earners has increased by 47 percent, three times faster than the increase for the top one percent.'[105]  Trump at Davos: 'The Time for Skepticism is Over'[106] President Donald Trump highlighted the U.S. economic boom in his address to the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Tuesday while promising he would 'never let radical socialists destroy our economy.'

Three dead alligators deposited at different spots on the floor of the northern Gulf of Mexico \u2014 at depths of up to 6,600 feet \u2014 proved a hearty meal for marine life, and led to the discovery of a new species of marine worms.

It did not take long for the Duke of Sussex to make his departure to Canada after deciding to step away from the royal family.[113]  Austrian Coalition Agreement: The 'Road to Serfdom'[114] While most of the world's attention was focused on the death of a terrorist leader, Iran's Qasem Soleimani, and the ensuing missile retaliation in the Middle East, a small country in the heart of Europe was once again ruled by an elected coalition government. Following snap elections in late September 2019, the Austrian population exhibited great patience until the start of a new decade, when, on January 2, the Austrian People's Party and the Greens proclaimed, to paraphrase the Vatican: 'Habemus gubernationem!' (We have a government!) Given that the two parties entering this government are polar opposites in terms of political orientation, left vs. right, it is not surprising that the negotiations for a 'viable' and lasting government took 100 days until their successful conclusion. Moreover, given what the Greens stand for \u2014 the climate, preventing 'right-wing extremists' (namely the Austrian Freedom Party) from entering government ever again, and transparency \u2014 it would seem irreconcilable with the People's Party's goals: migration and law and order. At first, only the Austrian and European mainstream media and the European Union enthusiasts in Brussels were optimistic about this new coalition. The latest polls, however, indicate rising approval among the population. How long this enthusiasm will last, remains to be seen. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz praised the 326-page coalition agreement as 'incorporating the best of both worlds', and although it contains the proverbial 'good, bad and ugly', regretfully only little can be considered good. In fact, most of what the People's Party and the Greens grandly announce in their pact paves the road to an illiberal democracy, even a totalitarian country, by introducing a dictatorship of political correctness.[115]  EPP's Tusk to Unveil Fidesz Plans in February[116] The head of the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) Donald Tusk, will present his 'assessment' on what to do with its Hungarian member, prime minister Viktor Orban's ruling Fidesz party, at the EPP's next leadership meeting in February. Fidesz was suspended last March after Orban's drift to the far-right.

Mr Farage, who is set to leave his role as an MEP in the European Parliament following Brexit at the end of the month, said that many parties, including the Sweden Democrats and the Left Party, have changed their views on leaving the European Union due to being corrupted by the seductive way of life at the top of the European Union, Dagens Nyheter reports.[119]  Orban Hails Austria as a Partner for Tackling Mass Migration With Visegrad Group[120] Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has praised Austria as being a 'natural partner' for tackling mass illegal migration alongside the Visegrad Group (V4) countries. Prime Minister Orban made his comments in Prague during a summit of the V4 countries, whose members are Hungary, Poland, Czechia and Slovakia, with Austria also attending, whose Chancellor Sebastian Kurz present at the event, Hungary Today reports.[121]  'Our House is Still on Fire': Greta Thunberg Chides Leaders for Climate Inaction[122] A year after warning world leaders 'our house is on fire', Greta Thunberg has returned to Davos to chide decision makers for their inaction on climate change.

Speaking to political and business leaders in a wide-ranging speech that took several victory laps over the performance of the U.S. economy under his leadership, President Trump also hailed a new era of trade deals which emphasised 'reciprocity' \u2014 fairness for both parties \u2014 namechecking new deals with Japan and others, as well as others to come.[129]  Trump: After Devastating Fire, Great Bells of Notre Dame Will Ring Again, 'Giving Glory to God'[130] President Donald Trump has expressed his faith in the reconstruction effort now underway in Paris to revive the Notre Dame cathedral, stating its completion would give 'glory to God' and fill millions of people 'with wonder and awe'. The comments came during President Trump's keynote speech at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland Tuesday. Following wide-ranging remarks on the strengths of the U.S. economy under his leadership, rising employment, and spreading global trade, the President moved to how the world should work to strengthen civilisation itself.[131]  UK: Milton Keynes School on Lockdown: Student Goes on Stabbing Attack During Fire Drill[132] A MILTON KEYNES school is on lockdown after a student was attacked with a blade during a fire drill.

Upananda Brahmachari | HENB | Allahabad | January 21, 2020:: The Allahabad High Court has said that the ban as imposed by a SDM for mounting loudspeakers and amplifiers in mosque in a village in Uttar Pradesh, will not be lifted. The court ordered that the SDM (Sub Divisional Magistrate)'s direction will not be interfered anyway with the exercise of its jurisdiction of court of law. The court said that the cancellation of the SDM's order could damage the social balance. The SDM earlier ordered to stop use of loud speaker of a Mosque for controlling disputes and tensions prevailed between the Hindus and Muslims in that locality in Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh. The SDM stopped the use of sound amplifier in Masjid Abu Bakar Siddiqui and Masjid Rahmani at in village Baddopur, Tehsil Shahganj, District Jaunpur for the purposes of Azaan for Namaz at the end of July 2018 onward, as there was no valid permission to use of sound amplifiers and loud speakers by Mosques and some tension was created in those areas from the use of loud speakers of Mosques. Aggrieved Muslims attached to Mosque committees appealed in Allahabad High Court (WRIT \u2014 C No. \u2014 43167 of 2019) after their earlier plea (Writ Petition (C) No.11840 of 2018) was rejected in the Court of law. Those who filed the petition stated that they should be allowed to play loudspeakers at the mosque for two minutes for five-time prayer (namaj) daily. They claimed that this would not harm pollution and social order. This is part of their religious work. As the population is increasing day by day, and it is important for Muslims to raise a prayer call through loudspeakers before prayers. Rejecting this demand, Judge Pankaj Mittal and Judge Bipin Chandra Dikshit said that according to Article 25 (1) of the Constitution, all citizens are allowed to practice and promote their religion. But, there is no mention to use loudspeakers for any prayer call in any religious books, so far. On the other hand, the priority of the High Court is to apply the law properly to maintain the harmony of the society maintaining proper order to ensure 'social interest and public good'. And in the present case, it is clear that there is no need for evangelism in the society, rather it is very much important to maintain social cohesion.[139][140]  Cases of China's New Mystery Virus Have Quadrupled, Human-to-Human Transmission Confirmed, And it May Soon Arrive Here[141] The mysterious new virus that is starting to spread very rapidly in China has global health officials extremely concerned. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization will convene an emergency meeting to discuss whether this outbreak should be 'declared a global health crisis', and screeners are being put in place at airports all over the world. But to a certain extent it may already be too late, because we know that this virus has already spread via airplane to at least three other countries. And since the early symptoms of this disease are so similar to what one would expect after coming down with a common cold, there could potentially be countless numbers of victims that have not even gone to the hospital because they don't think that anything is seriously wrong.[142]  Australia Hit by Golf-Ball Sized Hail, Dust and Flooding on Top of Fires[143] More extreme weather is hitting Australia as they see giant dust storms, hail and flooding on top of the wildfires.

According to the Times, the complaint said Greenwald, a former contributor to The Guardian who then co-founded the online news publication The Intercept, 'did more than merely receive the hacked messages and oversee the publication' of newsworthy elements. Greenwald was accused by prosecutors of being part of a 'criminal organization' that has hacked into the cellphones of prosecutors and other Brazilian officials, according to the report.[148]  Venezuela Has Less Cash in Its Coffers Than Jay-Z is Worth[149] Venezuela's cash supply has tanked so far that it has less money than Jay-Z.

The Philippines has ordered 500 Chinese citizens deported to prevent the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, Mongolia has closed its border with China. And the Centers for Disease Control is monitoring 110 potential cases of the coronavirus in the USA. In other news, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that Facebook is conspiring to re-elect President Trump. </p><p>To see the headlines and the articles, click #8216;Continue reading#8217; below.

Also Microsoft: Actually Wallpaper-Stripping Bug Will be Fixed[56] Microsoft has quietly admitted that it will be fixing the final Windows 7 patch that left some stretched wallpapers borked. It was to be the last hurrah for Windows 7: After the 14 January patch there would be no more freebies from Microsoft as extended support was turned off in favour of its paid-for Extended Security Update (ESU) program. The up to three years of extra patches is being punted to enterprises or badly organised Germans, but out of reach for most ordinary users. Those ordinary users, however, could be forgiven for feeling a little hard done by after an image of a favourite kitten or corporate logo was replaced, just by the act of applying the final patch \u2014 something more representative of the black heart of the Microsoft of yesteryear. Microsoft updated its support page for the patch, suggesting those afflicted by the curse of KB4534310 should stop using the Stretch option wallpaper, or go for something that matched the desktop resolution.[57]  20 States Start Legal Action to Prevent Trump Administration From Allowing 3D Printed Gun Blueprints Online[58] 20 US states have launched legal action against President Trump's administration in a bid to prevent 3D printer blueprints for guns being published online. Weapons made in this way are referred to as #8216;ghost guns#8217; because they don't have serial numbers and are invisible to metal detectors due to being made out of plastic. Democrats, who are behind the lawsuit, say that their proliferation would bring about more violence. Until now, the US State Department had control over the blueprints used to produce 3D printed guns, but the Trump administration wants to transfer it to the Commerce Department, which critics say would facilitate access to the technology necessary to make such guns, and weaken the government's powers when it comes to exports of weapons.[59]  Another Obama Solar Company Burns Out, Massive Ponzi Scheme[60] Another Obama solar initiative bites the dust, but not until after stealing millions from individuals, companies and the US government. This solar project turned into the largest Ponzi scheme in Eastern California history. It was reported this week that the owners of a massive solar company-turned-Ponzi scheme were indicted this week in Eastern California. According to the DOJ in Eastern California: The owners of DCSolar, a Benicia-based company, pleaded guilty today to charges related to a billion-dollar Ponzi scheme\u2014 the biggest criminal fraud scheme in the history of the Eastern District of California.[61]  Ari Shaffir on Kobe Bryant's Death: #8216;Hollywood Liberals Enjoy Rooting for the Lakers More Than They Dislike Rape#8217;[62] Comedian Ari Shaffir has stoked controversy after he reacted to the death of Kobe Bryant by tweeting, #8216;Hollywood liberals who attack comedy enjoy rooting for the Lakers more than they dislike rape.#8217; Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter were among nine people tragically killed when a helicopter crashed in California in foggy weather yesterday. While most people responded by celebrating Bryant's basketball career, Shaffir took to Twitter to call out #8216;Hollywood liberals#8217; for glamorizing Bryant despite allegations that he raped a 19-year-old girl. The 19-year-old hotel employee claimed Bryant raped her in the summer of 2003 but the case was later dropped after the accuser refused to testify at the trial. Bryant apologized to the girl but said he believed the encounter to be consensual and later settled with her in a separate civil lawsuit.[63]  Breaking: Federal Prosecutors Want to Interview Prince Andrew Over Epstein Scandal[64] The FBI and federal prosecutors in New York have asked if they can interview Prince Andrew in their ongoing investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein child sex-trafficking scandal. According to ABC News, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman announced the news Monday: #8216;Standing outside Epstein's East 71st Street mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Berman said Prince Andrew, despite his public offer of cooperation, has so far provided none. The FBI has reached out to the prince's lawyers to no avail so far, he said.#8217;[65]  CBS Blocks Angry Joe Show's Star Trek: Picard Review for Using Just 26 Seconds of the Official Trailer[66] Joe Vargas, host of The Angry Joe Show, has slammed CBS after his Star Trek: Picard review was blocked worldwide on YouTube as the result of a questionable copyright claim. CBS filed the claim over Vargas' use of two 13-second clips from the publicly available Picard trailer in his 40-minute video review.[67]  CDC Monitoring 110 Possible Coronavirus Cases in 26 States[68] More than a hundred people across 26 states are being monitored for possible cases of the new coronavirus, health officials said Monday. The number of possible cases of the dangerous virus nearly doubled to 110 cases over four days, up from the 63 previously reported to be under surveillance, according to CNBC. #8216;We understand that many people in the United States are worried about this virus and how it will affect Americans,#8217; said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.[69]  Hillary Claims Facebook Conspiring to Re-Elect Trump[70] Authoritarian' Zuckerberg is #8216;Trumpian' Conspiracy theorist Presidential failure Hillary Clinton declared this past weekend that she believes Facebook is conspiring to re-elect President Trump. In an interview with Atlantic, Hillary proclaimed that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is an #8216;authoritarian#8217; who #8216;intend[s] to reelect Trump.#8217; As evidence, Hillary pointed to Facebook leaving up a slowed-down video of Nancy Pelosi that someone uploaded to the platform.[71]  Hundreds of Localities Across the Nation Join Virginians in Declaring Their Counties #8216;Second Amendment Sanctuaries'[72] The #8216;Second Amendment Sanctuary#8217; movement that began in Virginia has gone national \u2014 with hundreds of counties and localities across the nation now declaring themselves to be standing against any new gun laws in their prospective states. The counties and localities are joining at least 91 out of 95 counties in Virginia that have declared themselves #8216;sanctuaries#8217; against laws that infringe upon the Second Amendment, such as Red Flag laws. The Hill tallied up the new areas joining the movement and found that at least 83 counties nationwide joined the movement this month, following 131 last month \u2014 even in states such as Mississippi which do not have any new gun control measures on the table. Their report noted that the counties joining the movement over the past couple of months join hundreds of others who have already made the declaration.[73]  Hunter Biden Agrees to Pay Child Support in Custody Case, Still Hasn't Turned Over Financial Records[74] Hunter Biden, the youngest son of 2020 presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden, has agreed to pay an undisclosed amount in monthly child support to a former Washington, D.C., stripper who now lives in Arkansas and bore him a son out of wedlock in 2018. Biden's agreement to pay child support came two days before he was ordered to appear in court for a hearing concerning whether or not he would be held in contempt for failing to disclose information about his finances, CNBC News reported. The support is retroactive to November 2018, three months after the child was born to Lunden Alexis Roberts, now 28 years old.[75]  J&amp;J Scientific Officer #8216;Pretty Confident' They Can Create Coronavirus Vaccine as Outbreak Widens[76] Johnson &amp; Johnson's chief scientific officer, Dr. Paul Stoffels, told CNBC on Monday that he believes the drugmaker can create a vaccine in the coming months to fight against the fast-spreading coronavirus. But he said it could take up to a year to bring it to market. #8216;We have dozens of scientists working on this so we're pretty confident we can get something made that will work and stay active for the longer term,#8217; said Stoffels, also vice chairman of the executive committee, in a #8216;Squawk Box#8217;interview.[77]  Justice Department to Team Up With States to Outline Google Antitrust Action[78] Google might now face one of the most grueling and intense antitrust investigations ever. At least seven state attorneys general are meeting with the US Justice Department in the coming week to plot the first course of action in what might be a joint investigative effort on the tech giant, reports the Wall Street Journal. While the attorneys general of fifty US states are already conducting an antitrust investigation on Google, the US Justice Department is also heading a broader antitrust review against big tech. But then, the WSJ's sources state that the state and federal authorities haven't shared any information regarding the ongoing investigation(s).[79]  Leader of #8216;The Base' Militant Group Revealed as Intelligence Contractor, Suspected Federal Agent[80] Readers will no doubt be shocked to learn the leader of the #8216;white supremacist neo-Nazi terrorist group#8217; the Base is an intelligence contractor and appears to be a federal agent. In truth, it'd probably be more shocking to learn he wasn't a fed. From The Guardian, #8216;Revealed: the true identity of the leader of an American neo-Nazi terror group#8217;:[81]  Let's Impeach the Entire U.S. House of Representatives[82] The majority of them should be impeached because they sit on their butts and do nothing as to bettering our country. They funded two outrageous wars for 19 years with nothing accomplished, not gained and nothing resolved. They killed over 6,500 of our finest young men and women. They killed tens of thousands of innocents in Afghanistan and Iraq. They feed the pockets of the Military Industrial Complex. They enjoy insider trading on defense contracts that fattens their bank accounts. They ruined thousands of men's lives and their families with PTSD, drug addiction and divorces. They've ruined thousands of kids' lives with fathers being deployed up to 11 times. We've got 22 military-veteran suicides 24/7 because of those wars. It's criminal for the members of Congress to commit such brazen acts of stupidity for 19 years. While Congress funds those wars, it has done NOTHING to stop the invasion of our country by over 25 million illegal border violators. Congress won't enforce the laws on our books, so employers brazenly hire them, transport them and house them. We pay for their medical, their children's K-12 schooling, breakfasts and lunches, and ESL classes. We American taxpayers get screwed while those employers bribe Congress and make billions upon billions, i.e., McDonalds, Hormel, Tyson Chicken, Montfort, Chipotle's, Marriott Hotels, Holiday Inn and hundreds more. At the same time, we've got millions of Americans barely able to exist above the poverty level. Yet, we wasted $6 trillion in those useless, stupid, and insane 19-year wars\u2014that could have been used for life-giving education, better housing, better job training, and better everything for Americans. An average of 300,000 pregnant illegal alien women birth their babies on our soil annually to gain #8216;jackpot#8217; or #8216;anchor baby#8217; status in order to tap into our welfare systems. HR 140 by Rep Steve King of IA has sat in committee for 10 years. It would stop this anchor baby scam, but Congress won't pass it. All of them should be rounded up and impeached. The DACA scam, the same corruption caused by the members of Congress.[83]  Pelosi Shaped Her Golden Impeachment Pens to Look Like Bullets[84] Those ceremonial Impeachment signing pens which Nancy passed out to her co-conspirators were not merely expensive taxpayer funded souvenirs (5K in total). They were part of her #8216;Trump will be out, one way or another#8217; threat. Closeup inspection of those pensthe front third is shaped, colored, and dimensioned identically to a .223 / 5.56X45 round. Could you imagine if the parties were reversed? Pelosi should be censured for this dangerous stunt.[85]  The Stunning Sham Impeachment of Donald Trump[86] From day one, when Donald Trump became the president of the United States, the entire leftist media, law enforcement establishment, former President Obama, and minions of former President Obama, to include Hillary Clinton, Hollywood celebrities, and the Democratic Party had one mission: To force President Trump out of office. They drove investigation after investigation, and after three years, along with tens of millions of dollars spent at taxpayers' expense, they found nothing on him to force him out. ZERO. The Russian hoax turned out to be a hoax. Trump said #8216;[Special counsel Robert] Mueller showed the Democrats not only have nothing, now they have less than nothing.#8217; But that did not please the appetite of hungry leftist wolves who were after blood. Since the House of Representatives is controlled by the Democrats, they contrived a fake excuse to impeach Trump. #8216;House Democrats have long wanted to overturn the votes of 63 million Americans. They have determined that they must impeach President Trump because they cannot legitimately defeat him at the ballot box. The Democrats' use of a phone call with the president of Ukraine \u2014 with a transcript the president himself released \u2014 served as their excuse for this partisan, gratuitous, and pathetic attempt to overthrow the Trump administration and reverse the results of the 2016 election.#8217; It was 100% sham.[87]  Two More Possible Coronavirus Patients Tested in New York[88] Two more New Yorkers have been tested as possible coronavirus patients, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday. Samples for nine people from the Empire State have been sent to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since the outbreak began \u2014 with four coming back negative and five still pending. On Sunday, Cuomo had said seven cases had been sent, with three proving negative and four still up in the air.[89]  US Sending More Staff to 20 Airports for Coronavirus Testing[90] The US government is directing more personnel to assist with coronavirus screenings at 20 airports \u2014 as the outbreak of the deadly virus continues, a report said Monday. The additional resources will be sent to airports that handle nearly all incoming passengers from China, the Washington Post reported, citing the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vice President Mike Pence mentioned the expansion earlier Monday.[91]  USMCA Full Story[92] Despite being heralded as a #8216;big win#8217; by President Trump, the USMCA appears to have all the earmarks of Obama-era trade agreements, with former Obama officials seeing stark similarities. Much of the USMCA's text is virtually identical to that of President Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) \u2014 a #8216;free trade#8217; agreement negotiated among 12 Pacific Rim nations (Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam) and at the time representing 40 percent of the world's GDP. The TPP has since been renamed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). During the 2016 presidential elections, then-candidate Trump staunchly opposed the TPP, making it the centerpiece of his belief in #8216;Americanism, not globalism.#8217; However, it's important to remember that Trump did not personally negotiate the USMCA, nor did he pen any portions of the document. Trump's lead NAFTA/USMCA negotiator was U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer, who's been a longtime member of the globalist, one-world-government-building Council on Foreign Relations, and has also previously applauded the Obama administration's TPP agreement. In addition to Lighthizer, another of Trump's negotiators was his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has had business ties with the Deep State, including Goldman Sachs and George Soros. In addition to Lighthizer and Kushner, many of the negotiators working within both the State Department and USTR office are career diplomats and employees, many of whom also worked in the same capacity during the Obama administration. According to the Huffington Post, #8216;At least half of the men and women standing behind Trump during his Rose Garden ceremony praising the new deal were the same career service staff who negotiated nearly identical provisions in TPP, which Trump had railed against.#8217; Trevor Kincaid, the USTR spokesman for the Obama administration, told the Huffington Post that the individuals standing behind Trump at the Rose Garden were the same USTR team that worked under Obama. #8216;Ironically, he called them horrible negotiators when running for office,#8217; Kincaid said, later adding, #8216;It's really the same with a new name. It's basically the #8216;22 Jump Street' of trade deals.#8217; Giving these powers to the Free Trade Commission makes the USMCA a #8216;living agreement,#8217; much like the TPP, thus allowing the Free Trade Commission to change the agreement without the consent of the U.S. Congress. In fact, the agreement completely undermines Congress' Constitutional Article I, Section 8 power to regulate trade with foreign nations, such as Mexico and Canada, and to impose tariffs on them should the need arise, as in the case of national security.[93]  Warden in Charge When Jeffrey Epstein Died Behind Bars Given Top Job at #8216;Club Fed' Prison[94] The warden in charge when Jeffrey Epstein died in his jail cell is getting a cushy new supervisor's job at #8216;Club Fed' despite Attorney General Bill Barr's demand that he be reassigned to a desk job.

The nation was shocked when they heard that Bryant and his daughter had died in the crash and took to social media to share their condolences. However, as Twitter timelines became filled with mourning fans, Somnez instead used the sensitive moments soon after the deaths to tweet out a three-year-old article containing rape allegations against Bryant.[97]  YouTube Executive Suggests Algorithm Favors News Channels That Have a #8216;Journalism Department#8217;[98] Cristos Goodrow, VP of engineering at Google, is also the head of Google's division dubbed Search and Discovery at YouTube.

Chief Medical Officer Dr. David Williams said in a press conference this afternoon that the Ministry of Health has #8216;never recommended#8217; face masks. Williams acknowledged that while other cultures practice the use of face masks, it would not benefit Canadians to use them according to The Star.[101]  Toronto Private Schools Ask Children to Stay Home After Coronavirus Threat[102] Two private schools in the Greater Toronto Area have made it aware that some parents were on the same flight as the Ontario patient who has been diagnosed with the coronavirus, according to CTV News.

The number of marriages jumped by 27 percent, with 61,979 couples tying the knot, compared with the same period last year, and the highest number since 1989. In the first eleven months of the year, 81,341 children were born, 1,274 fewer than in the same period last year, while 117,964 people died, 933 fewer than in Jan-Nov 2019.[109]  No Reports of Hungarians Affected by Coronavirus[110] The foreign ministry state secretary in charge of communications said on Sunday that there were no reports of Hungarians affected by the coronavirus epidemic, which started in China. #8216;There are no reports of Hungarians abroad or in Hungary affected by the epidemic and no foreigners staying in Hungary who had been affected by the virus in the past,#8217; Tamas Menczer told a press conference.[111]  UK: #8216;We Must End Politically Correct Policing': David Kurten Quits UKIP to Stand for London Mayor[112] London's crime wave has been aggravated by bad policy and its housing crisis cannot be solved without controlling immigration, Christian conservative London Assembly member David Kurten has said, as he announces his run for mayor.

The Constitutional Court declared the bans unconstitutional. In 2017, the Turkish government banned Wikipedia. That ban was removed only recently, after two and a half years. It is not that Wikipedia is a reliable source of information. Banning it altogether is a rogue state behavior. It is not, however, only about Wikipedia: in Turkey, truth, regardless of its source, is feared and often banned. The World Report 2020, released by the Human Rights Watch, drew a realistic yet gloomy picture of civil liberties in Turkey.[123]  Hindu Girl Abducted From Wedding Ceremony, Forcibly Converted and Married Off a Muslim Man in Pakistan[124] Kishore Das, the father of Bharti Bai, said his daughter's marriage ceremony was underway when the kidnapper named Shah Rukh Gul came with several men along with policemen and took his daughter away in broad daylight. Hamza Ameer | India Today Online | Karachi | January 27, 2020:: In Pakistan's Sindh province, where several cases of abduction, conversion and marriage of young Hindu girls have been reported in the recent past, another case surfaced on Sunday. A 24-year-old Hindu woman was allegedly kidnapped by assailants under the supervision of local police authorities from her wedding venue in Hala, a city located in Matiari district in Sindh province, about 215 km away from the provincial capital Karachi. According to reports, the woman Bharti Bai, was then forcefully converted to Islam and married to a Muslim man. Bharti was to be married to a Hindu man in Hala city, when unknown assailants allegedly stormed the venue and kidnapped her. Later, a picture of Bharti along with documents of her conversion to Islam and marriage to Shah Rukh Gul went viral on social media. According to the documents of her conversion, it seems that Bharti had converted to Islam on December 1, 2019, which may be the reason why she was taken away from her wedding venue. As per the conversion certificate, Bharti's new name after converting to Islam is #8216;Bushra'. Jamiat-ul-Uloom Islamia, located at Allama Muhammad Yousuf Banuri town in Karachi, issued the certificate of Bharti's conversion while her conversion was witnessed and certified by Mufti AbuBakar Saeed ur Rehman. As per her National Identity Card, details of which were shared in the documents, her permanent address is in Hala. However, her temporary address is of Gulshan Iqbal area in Karachi, which may be taken as her current area of residence. It is still uncertain as to when she got married to Shah Rukh Gul. However, her marriage certificate aka nikkah document shows that the Muslim man is also a resident of Hala. Shah Rukh, the son of Nisar Ahmed, is also 24 years old. The family of Bharti aka Bushra has demanded for her return, who they claim was kidnapped by Shah Rukh under the supervision and presence of local police authorities. On the other hand, it is being said that Bharti had converted to Islam at least one month prior to the incident. Her parents allegedly found out about her conversion and were getting her married to a Muslim man forcibly. It is being claimed that the news of her marriage prompted Shah Rukh Gul to go to the police and claim that Bharti aka Bushra was his wife and being married off by her parents to a Hindu man illegally. Even though the news and details of the whole episode is based on details gathered from locals in Hala, the issue has raised serious concerns amongst the Hindu community in Pakistan, who are questioning the Imran Khan-led government of its promises to provide security to minorities in the country.[125][126]  Analyst Says Cases of Coronavirus Probably 10 Times Higher Than Official Number[127] A health care analyst says that the number of coronavirus cases is probably ten times higher than is being reported by Chinese authorities. Raymond James health care policy analyst Chris Meekins said that the official numbers of those killed and infected by the virus is #8216;really a fraction#8217; of those who actually have contracted the disease due to China's history of underreporting public health crises. #8216;Based on conversations I've had with individuals both in the U.S. government and more importantly [in China] is that the number that have been reported out of China on this disease are really a fraction of the number of people who have probably had the disease,#8217; Meekins told Yahoo Finance.[128]  China Virus Death Toll Passes 100 as U.S., Canada Issue Travel Warning[129] SHANGHAI (Reuters) \u2014 The United States warned against travel to China on Monday and Canada issued a more narrow travel warning as the death toll from the spreading coronavirus passed 100, with tens of millions stranded during the biggest holiday of the year and global markets rattled. Global stocks fell, oil prices hit three-month lows, and China's yuan dipped to its weakest level in 2020 as investors fretted about damage to the world's second-biggest economy from travel bans and the Lunar New Year holiday, which China extended in a bid to keep people at home.[130]  China Locks Down Cities and Suspends Overseas Tour Groups as Number of Coronavirus Cases Soars[131] The number of coronavirus infections has spiked. The pneumonia-causing illness that infects the respiratory tract is now responsible for 82 deaths in China, up from 56 the day before, and at least 2,744 infections, up from 1,975, health officials in China said Monday. On Saturday, the trade association of Chinese travel agencies also said that it would suspend overseas tour groups and flight/hotel vacation packages for Chinese citizens, effective Monday. The outbreak spread rapidly over the last seven days. It has infected people in Hong Kong, Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, France, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, South Korea, Macao and Nepal. There have also been five confirmed cases in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. It is believed to have originated in Wuhan, likely at a food market. On Saturday, the U.S. State Department ordered the evacuation of all U.S. personnel at the Consulate in Wuhan.[132]  Coronavirus Outbreak: Mongolia Closes China Border[133] The government of Mongolia said Monday it has closed its large border with China, and Malaysia announced that it would bar visitors from the Chinese province at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak after medical officials warned its ability to spread was growing. The ban makes both nations the second and third countries to close its border with China, following North Korea. Malaysian officials said they would halt the issue of visas for Chinese travelers from Wuhan, where the virus was first reported last month, and surrounding areas.[134]  EU Countries to Evacuate Citizens From Virus-Hit Wuhan in China[135] Several European countries are to evacuate their citizens out of the Wuhan area in China where the coronavirus has already killed at least 80 people and affected around 2,700, despite China's massive efforts to contain the epidemic, Deutsche Welle reports. France has confirmed three cases of infection within its borders. French health minister Agnes Buzyn said repatriations by plane will start by midweek, with the agreement of Chinese authorities.[136]  Over and Over Again the Mainstream Media Hasn't Been Telling us the Truth About This Coronavirus Outbreak[137] Ever since this coronavirus outbreak first began, the mainstream media has been feeding us fake news over and over again. Initially, we were repeatedly told that there was very little to be concerned about because it was very unlikely that human to human transmission was happening. But now we know that this virus spreads very, very easily between people. Another thing that we were repeatedly told by the mainstream media was that a victim had to start showing symptoms before they could spread the disease. Unfortunately, now we know that is completely and totally false. As you will see below, Chinese officials have confirmed that even those showing no symptoms at all can spread the disease. But perhaps the biggest fraud of all has been the #8216;official numbers#8217; that the Chinese government has been putting out. According to the latest count, there are now 2,051 confirmed cases and the death toll has risen to 56, but at this point, it has become clear that those numbers are completely divorced from reality. Over the past several days, thousands upon thousands of very sick people have been absolutely overwhelming the hospitals in Wuhan, China. In some cases, people have literally had to wait in line for two days to see a doctor, and in other cases, people have not been able to see a doctor at all. In fact, one 36-year-old woman has taken her very sick husband to multiple hospitals and they still haven't been able to see a doctor. The following comes from the South China Morning Post:[138]  Philippines to Deport 500 Chinese People to Prevent to Spread of Coronavirus[139] The Philippines is to deport 500 Chinese citizens who arrived in the country from Wuhan in an attempt to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

The Ocean Viking, a rescue vessel run by SOS Mediterranee in partnership with Doctors Without Borders (MSF) was carrying 407 people rescued in a total of five operations carried out over 72 hours. Another 78 people were taken on board the Alan Kurdi, run by the Sea-Eye organisation based in Germany. They were rescued in two operations.[150]  Neil Gorsuch Issues Savage Rebuke to Activist Judges and Nationwide Injunctions[151] On Monday, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration's public charge rule to go into effect, striking down a nationwide injunction from a New York judge. The rule allows the government to deny green cards to immigrants who receive public assistance and are therefore considered a #8216;public charge.#8217; In addition to the 5-4 decision allowing the rule to go into effect, Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch issued a concurring opinion rebuking activist judges and their rush to apply #8216;nationwide injunctions#8217; against Trump administration policies. #8216;Today the Court (rightly) grants a stay, allowing the government to pursue (for now) its policy everywhere save Illinois. But, in light of all that's come before, it would be delusional to think that one stay today suffices to remedy the problem. The real problem here is the increasingly common practice of trial courts ordering relief that transcends the cases before them. Whether framed as injunctions of #8216;nationwide,' #8216;universal,' or #8216;cosmic' scope, these orders share the same basic flaw\u2014they direct how the defendant must act toward persons who are not parties to the case,#8217; Gorsuch wrote.[152]  Police Investigating Murder of Pro-Migration Finnish Woman by Her Migrant Boyfriend[153] Police in Finland are investigating the murder of a woman killed by her migrant ex-boyfriend after making pro-mass migration posts on social media. Sanni Ovaska was reportedly killed last week by Hasan Alqina, who then committed suicide. Alqina was in the country as a Palestinian asylum seeker and had earlier been denied a residency permit. Authorities were alerted after a neighbor saw evidence of a crime at the apartment in Hmeenlinna. A photo was later posted to Twitter showing blood seeping under the door of the apartment.[154]  Supreme Court Allows Trump Administration to Enforce #8216;Public Charge' Immigration Restriction[155] The Supreme Court will allow the Trump administration to enforce, for now, its #8216;public charge#8217; immigration restriction, lifting a pair of preliminary injunctions issued by federal judges. The Monday order followed a 5-4 split vote that divided the court's conservatives and liberals. At issue is the administration's rule issued in August that would restrict immigrants entering the United States if the government believes they will rely on public assistance, such as housing or health care benefits. Lower federal courts had blocked the policy from being implemented while the issue is being litigated.[156]  UK: Think Tank: Boris Plan to Scrap 30k Salary Requirement Will See Migration #8216;Spin Out of Control'[157] Reports that Boris Johnson intends to scrap the 30,000 salary requirement for importing foreign workers will see immigration #8216;spin out of control#8217;, a think tank has warned. #8216;The Conservative Government has committed itself to delivering the #8216;people's priorities' and has promised a reduction in the overall level of immigration,#8217; Migration Watch UK recalled in a press release seen by Breitbart London.[158]  Warning Shots Fired at Migrants Trying to Escape at the Hungarian Border[159] The Romanian border police stopped two migrants with warning shots. The men tried to illegally cross the Romanian-Hungarian green border late Saturday night in the vri region of Satu Mare county. On Saturday, the border police spotted two men marching toward Hungary at around 11 p.m. The two migrants did not stop at the order of the border police and approached the state border line fifty meters away. The border police forced the men to stop, with two shots fired into the air \u2014 wrote the Romanian Border Police on its website. Preliminary inquiries revealed that the 29-year-old and 38-year-old men were from Tunisia. They are now prosecuted in Romania for attempted border crossing.[160]  Pastor Sues Vimeo for Deleting His Account and Refusing to Acknowledge His Sexuality as a #8216;Former Homosexual#8217;[161] YouTube's contender Vimeo is now facing a lawsuit over shutting down a pastor's account for uploading videos containing content related to #8216;conversion therapy#8217;. The man describes himself as a #8216;former homosexual#8217; on the platform and suggests that if others are allowed to proclaim their sexuality, he should be too. Vimeo observers a strict ban on promoting #8216;gay-conversion therapy#8217; and refuses to allow content that validates the idea that a person's sexuality can be fluid and change.[162]  #8216;Provocative' Gender Dysphoria Expert Gives Vital Speech at McGill[163] On Thurs Jan 23, University of Toronto professor of psychiatry Dr. Ken Zucker, a leading international expert on gender dysphoria, and editor-in-chief of Archives of Sexual Behaviour, spoke at McGill University. Dr. Zucker's presentation was titled, #8216;Children and Adolescents with Gender Dysphoria: Some contemporary research and clinical issues.#8217; Inviting Dr. Zucker to speak in an open forum was an act of courage, as he is Canada's most controversial researcher/clinician in this domain. In a recent column for the National Post on the run-up to this event, I summarized the story of his persecution by hostile trans activists and linked to a more detailed account. Dr. Zucker's critics accuse him of practicing #8216;conversion therapy,#8217; by which they mean his objective is to prevent his patients from transitioning. But what Dr. Zucker actually practices, as he explained to me in an interview, is #8216;Developmentally Informed Psychotherapy.#8217;[164] [ 1]: <url

Mr. Soros is competing with several other potential buyers, including supporters of the ruling party, in his attempts to acquire the station. In other news, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a church bombing in the Philippines that killed at least 20 people.

Unless some really big name unexpectedly enters the race, there is a decent chance that Elizabeth Warren could win the Democratic nomination in 2020. And if she ultimately won the general election, the Democrats would likely have control of both the House and the Senate during her first two years in the White House as well. So that means that the proposal that you are about to read about could actually become law in the not too distant future. After AOC's proposal to raise the top marginal tax rate to 70 percent received so much favorable attention, it was just a matter of time before Democratic presidential candidates started jumping on the 'soak the rich' bandwagon, and the first one to strike was Elizabeth Warren.[57]  Advanced Social Decay: You Will Cringe When You Read What Has Been Going on Behind Closed Doors All Across America[58] The sad truth is that we have definitely lost our way as a nation It is difficult for me to write this article, and I will warn you in advance that some of the things in this piece are going to make you cringe. Today, there are an increasing number of signs that the very fabric of our society is rotting away all around us. We witnessed a very clear example of this last week when Kyrsten Sinema paraded around on the floor of the U.S. Senate looking like a hooker, but far more telling is what is going on behind closed doors all across America. The stories that I am about to share with you barely made a blip on the news, but they should have, because they are all indications of how far our nation has fallen. Let's start in Colorado[59]  Antifa Member Killed After Pulling Gun on Cops at School[60] A member of an Antifa-related organization was killed after he pulled a weapon on Eugene, Oregon police at a middle school. 'An armed man involved in a custody dispute was shot to death by Eugene police during a struggle just outside Cascade Middle School Friday morning,' said KOIN. 'Authorities said they were called to the school shortly before 10:30 a.m. to escort the man from the school. As they were walking him out, authorities said, he produced a gun.' Charlie Landeros was a far-left activist who used they/them/theirs pronouns. He had recently lost custody of his child, which is reportedly why he was at the school in the first place. He had a loaded pistol in his person, and extra 9mm ammunition in his backpack. [Comment: File this article under 'positive news'.][61]  Google Manipulates Search Results on 'Controversial' Topics, Report Says[62] [] While Google products mostly rely on algorithms to shape search results, the company also engages in manual interventions, according to Daniel Aaronson, senior strategist for the Trust ...fety Product Strategy department at Google Search. 'In extreme cases where we need to act quickly on something that is so obviously not okay, the reactive/manual approach is sometimes necessary,' he said in the discussion thread. This account appears to conflict with Pichai's Dec. 11 testimony to the House Judiciary Committee:  Since online platforms commonly rely on users to report content violations, the mechanism appears to favor those who want to police speech.[63]  Google May Face Rico, Defamation Lawsuits Due to SPLC Partnership, Lawyers Say[64] In recent years, the far-Left Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has faced a slew of lawsuits regarding its deceptive practice of branding mainstream conservative and Christian groups 'hate groups' on par with the Ku Klux Klan. Google has decided to partner with the SPLC, even encouraging employees to work for the organization. Conservative lawyers told PJ Media this partnership may make the tech giant vulnerable to defamation and racketeering lawsuits. This month, Fortune reported that Google's philanthropic arm, Google.org, launched a program that will pay Google employees to do pro bono work for nonprofit groups for up to six months. The company aims to achieve 50,000 hours of pro bono work this year. Google.org names the SPLC as one of its partners for 'inclusion.' Google.org started funding the far-Left group in 2016, and has given the organization $250,000, specifically to fund a 'total redesign of the Teaching Tolerance website.'[65]  Great Disinformation Campaigns From History That Live on and Prosper Today[66] [] At the same time, the Soviet Union put in place a propaganda countermeasures campaign, painting the Nazi regime as a fascist 'conservative' movement and therefore not a socialist movement at all. This not only survives as a widespread false concept today, but also, because of its success as propaganda, it has been built upon using a variation on the central theme. A quote often attributed to the UK war-time Prime Minister Winston Churchill (though probably not said by him) is: 'The fascists of the future will be called anti-fascists.' This has come to fruition, as a number of today's socialist movements have adopted many of the early Nazi tactics used in their rise to power. One need look no further than today's Antifa (Anti-Fascist) organizations for a perfect example.  This past October, Antifa held large demonstrations in the famously left-wing Portland, Oregon, where they were filmed verbally attacking an elderly man in his vehicle and abusing an older wheelchair-bound woman, among many other similar acts. This, while police stood by watching innocent people being abused and taking no action. This association or cooperation seems to run even to the highest levels within the Democratic Party, with the son of Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine being widely reported to be affiliated with Antifa following his arrest after a protest involving the group. Sen. Kaine was the Democratic vice-presidential running mate of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.[67]  High School Students Disqualified From Debate After Quoting Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson[68] A pair of Utah high school seniors lost a debate round because they read quotes from Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro and clinical psychologist Dr. Jordan Peterson, who were deemed 'white supremacists' by the judge.[69]  Hillary Clinton Signals 2020 Run as Deep State Moves Against Roger Stone Ahead of Trump Takedown[70] Alex Jones breaks down the latest developments in the arrest and indictment of Trump advisor Roger Stone, and Infowars reporters are on the ground in Florida to bring you other critical content surrounding the Deep State's efforts to take down Stone, and ultimately, President Trump himself.[71]  'I'm Not Going to Enforce That': Sheriffs Disobey New Anti-Gun Laws \u2014 Refuse to Disarm Citizens[72] In reaction to the tragic shootings throughout 2018, Washington state has passed and is planning to pass a slew of new anti-gun bills that will make them one of the most regulated states in the country. But these bills are being met by resistance from an unlikely group. A handful of sheriffs is standing up to the 'unconstitutional' nature of the bills and is promising disobedience. Sheriff Bob Songer is one of these sheriffs who is outspoken about his resistance. During an interview with the Guardian, published over the weekend, Songer told the newspaper that the anti-gun legislation passed last November 'is unconstitutional on several grounds. I've taken the position that as an elected official, I am not going to enforce that law.' Songer\u2014like every single sheriff and law enforcement officer in the country\u2014swore an oath to uphold the Constitution, and now he's overtly honoring it by protecting the Second Amendment. [Comment: Kudos to such people for honoring their oath to the Constitution and refusing to follow diktats of communist putzes who 'pass' anti-constitutional pretend laws.][73]  Lefties Threaten to Boycott Starbucks if Former CEO Runs for President[74] Correction: Howard Schultz is the former CEO of Starbucks, making the boycott even more asinine. Where will they write their screenplays? Over the weekend, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz announced he is 'seriously considering' a run for president as an Independent in 2020.[75]  Meet the Man Behind a Third of What's on Wikipedia[76] Steven Pruitt has made nearly 3 million edits on Wikipedia and written 35,000 original articles. It's earned him not only accolades but almost legendary status on the internet. The online encyclopedia now boasts more than 5.7 million articles in English and millions more translated into other languages \u2014 all written by online volunteers. Pruitt was named one of the most influential people on the internet by Time magazine in part because one-third of all English language articles on Wikipedia have been edited by Steven. An incredible feat, ignited by a fascination with his own history.[77]  Offended Muslims Demand Nike Remove 'Allah' Shoes[78] Thousands of offended Muslims have signed a petition demanding that Nike remove a 'blasphemous' and 'offensive' shoe that they claim has 'Allah' inscribed on the sole. They claim that the logo on Nike's Air Max 270 trainers resembles the word 'Allah' in Arabic script, 'which will surely be trampled, kicked and become soiled with mud or even filth.' The resemblance is minimal, but 6,000 people have signed a petition which asserts, 'It is outrageous and appalling of Nike to allow the name of God on a shoe. This is disrespectful and extremely offensive to Muslim's and insulting to Islam. Islam teaches compassion, kindness and fairness towards all.'[79]  Telling Fired Journalists 'Learn to Code' Is Now 'Abusive Behavior' On Twitter[80] Update: As quickly as Twitter's actions went viral, their PR group rushed into action to explain why there is no hypocrisy here and that the answer is 'nuanced.'[81]  Trump to Deliver State of the Union Address February 5[82] President Donald Trump on Monday accepted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-CA) invitation to deliver his State of the Union address before the House chamber on February 5. The set date comes after the White House and congressional leaders reached an agreement to end the partial government shutdown last Friday.[83]  Watch: 'Harry Potter' Star Daniel Radcliffe Rails Against Tom Brady for Having a MAGA Hat[84] Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe went on the attack against New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady for the NFL star's apparent support of President Donald Trump. Daniel Radcliffe, who fancies himself a big NFL fan, scoffed at the Patriot's long winning record and said the 'whole world' is rooting against them in the upcoming Super Bowl. 'The whole world is rooting against the Patriots sorry,' Radcliffe told Variety. But Radcliffe also had a particular message for five-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady. 'Take that MAGA hat out your locker,' the actor angrily said. He added that Brady should 'stop winning things.' Radcliffe insisted that the whole country is against Brady because he has kept a red Donald Trump campaign hat in his locker. 'I feel like that was the moment when we were like, as a country, 'Oh, c'mon, dude, we all want to be behind you, you're awesome, don't put that in there.'' [Comment: UK's fake mass media is even more rabidly anti-Trump than American fakestream media.][85]  YouTube to Crack Down on 'Conspiracy' Videos[86] YouTube claims it will stop recommending conspiracy videos. Following complaints over the number of unwelcome videos appearing in recommendations, the Google-owned site says it plans to try and banish them. It says 'borderline' videos that come close to violating community guidelines or those which 'misinform users in a harmful way.' will now be excluded. 'We'll begin reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways\u2014such as videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the earth is flat, or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11.' YouTube says the decision affects less than 1 percent of videos \u2014 but this will still impact millions of clips. [Comment: It is getting so bad that in the near future, any video that says Trump won the election fairly will be demonitized by labelling it a conspiracy video.][87]  Brexit Planners Could Use Martial Law Against Civil Disobedience[88] Legislation would give ministers the power to impose curfews, travel bans, confiscate property and deploy the armed forces. Brexit planners are examining the possibility of martial law in Britain in the event of a 'no-deal' Brexit, it has emerged. Whitehall officials are looking at how to use powers available under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 to stop civil disobedience after the UK leaves the EU. According to a report in The Sunday Times, the legislation gives ministers the power to impose curfews, travel bans, confiscate property and deploy the armed forces.[89]  Earth Could be Crushed to the Size of a Soccer Field by Particle Accelerator Experiments, Says Astronomer[90] Martin Rees, a well-respected British cosmologist, made pretty bold statement late last year when it comes to particle accelerators: there's a small, but real possibility of disaster. Particle accelerators, like the Large Hadron Collider, shoot particles at incredibly high speeds, smash them together, and observe the fallout. These high speed collisions have helped us discover lots of new particles, but according to Rees, this isn't without its risks. In his 2018 book, called On The Future: Prospects for Humanity, he gives some pretty bleak outlooks. 'Maybe a black hole could form, and then suck in everything around it,' he writes, as Sarah Knapton reported over at the Telegraph. 'The second scary possibility is that the quarks would reassemble themselves into compressed objects called strangelets.' 'That in itself would be harmless. However under some hypotheses a strangelet could, by contagion, convert anything else it encounters into a new form of matter, transforming the entire earth in a hyperdense sphere about one hundred metres across.'[91]  Euro Watchdog Investigates Yellow Vest Protest Policing 'Human Rights Issues'[92] The Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights has travelled to Paris to speak with the French government about the Yellow Vest protests after footage and images of the government's heavy-handed attempts to break the protests flashed around the world.[93]  Forget Brexit: Italy vs France Raging Row Could Tear Apart the EU[94] THE EU could be torn apart by the bitter row between France and Italy, branded by a political expert the 'gravest political crisis' involving the two countries since World War 2.[95]  Italy: Mother's Partner Charged Over 7-Yr-Old's Murder[96] Boy allegedly beaten to death, sister injured (ANSA) \u2014 Naples, January 28 \u2014 The partner of the mother of a seven-year-old boy who was allegedly beaten to death at the weekend near Naples has been detained and has been charged with murder and attempted murder after also injuring the boy's sister, sources said on Monday. The suspect denied committing murder during questioning overnight and said the boy fell down a flight of stairs, the sources said. His version of events is being compared with that of the dead boy's mother and his sister, who was injured and taken to hospital. The head of the ward there said her injuries were 'chilling'. 'Her face is all swollen and there was blood on her scalp, injuries probably caused by a brutal beating,' said the surgeon. The suspect is said to be a 24-year-old who was born in Italy to foreign parents.[97]  Italy: Bolzano Health Authority Asks for 'Race' In Questionnaire[98] Case reported to local newspaper by teachers (ANSA) \u2014 Bolzano, January 28 \u2014 Teachers in the northern city of Bolzano have reported that the local health authority asked for the 'ethnic group or race' of students in a questionnaire related to psychiatric services. 'We understand that these are standard forms drafted in the United States,' the teachers told the Alto Adige newspaper. 'But what we cannot work out is how come no one in the Bolzano health authority realized or questioned this'.[99]  Man Killed Sister's Boyfriend 'Because He Was French and Non-Muslim'[100] Samir Kouider has been sentenced to 30 years in jail for the murder of his sister's French, non-Muslim boyfriend. The assize court in Gard rejected Mr Kouider's appeal after forensic evidence contradicted the 29-year-old's claim that his killing of Kevin Roudesly, 21, had been an accident. Having delivered 'several different versions' of the story since his arrest on New Year's Eve, 2013, Kouider this weekend told the court he had shown up outside Roudesly's residence in Avignon on December 28 only with the intention of locating his younger sister Imne, after she ran away from her aunt's house two days earlier But the defendant's insistence he had 'no intention' of killing Kevin and that he carried out the deadly actions only 'in the fury of the moment', were contradicted by forensic evidence, with a doctor's report informing the court the victim 'had his jugular vein sliced and his lungs skewered by the blade'.[101]  Orban Refuses to Pressurise China and Russia, WSJ Writes[102] According to the Wall Street Journal, in a meeting with US Ambassador David B. Cornstein, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban told the American diplomats that he refuses to pressurise China and Russia, and would rather stay neutral like Austria.[103]  Poland May Block Soros Group From Buying Big Radio Station[104] Poland's government signaled it would try to prevent a takeover of the country's second-largest radio station by a group that includes billionaire financier George Soros. Soros has teamed up with publisher Agora SA to place a bid for Radio Zet. They are vying against Fratria, a publisher of a pro-government weekly Sieci, as well as PMPG Polskie Media SA and Polish businessman Zbigniew Jakubas, according to Wirtualnemedia.pl portal.[105]  UK: Boris: If MPs Vote to Delay Brexit They Will Face a Backlash[106] Brexiteer Boris Johnson has come out swinging in his weekly Telegraph hit, claiming that he has heard that Theresa May will pursue a 'Freedom Clause' in her deal and that those MPs seeking to delay and block Brexit risk facing a 'backlash' and increasing the prospect of a No Deal Brexit. Hitting out at those backing the Yvette Cooper/Nick Boles amendment, Boris writes: 'If MPs really vote to delay Brexit (a thin disguise for killing it off) they will risk an incalculable backlash from those who voted Leave.[107]  UK: Boris Blinks First: Brexit Rebel Indicates He Will Support PM May's Surrender Plan[108] Former foreign secretary and London mayor Boris Johnson has indicated he would support the British prime minister's Brexit deal if she is able to win fresh concessions on a so-called 'freedom clause' from the European Union. Johnson, for a time the de facto leader of Britain's small number of Brexit-supporting Tory Members of Parliament, has made much political capital since he quit the government in July by attacking the Prime Minister's 'worst deal in history' Brexit plan, but now says he could support her if she could change just a few words in the proposed agreement with Brussels.[109]  UK: Cabinet Brexiteer: 'Taking No Deal Off Table a Thinly Veiled Attempt to Stop Brexit'[110] Cabinet Brexiteer and former Tory leadership contender Andrea Leadsom has denounced efforts to take a clean, No Deal Brexit 'off the table' as a poorly disguised bid to stop Britain from leaving the EU at all.[111]  UK: Ex-Brexit Secretary Warns Parliamentary Democracy at Stake as Over 100 MPs Move Against Brexit[112] With over 100 MPs poised to block a No Deal exit from the European Union, former Brexit secretary David Davis has warned that Remain diehards risk throwing Britain's parliamentary system into chaos.[113]  Egypt: Tips for Serious Travelers[114] by Srdja Trifkovic My 'Letter from Egypt,' with a comprehensive analysis of the country's political, economic and social situation is coming in a few days' time. For starters, let me present our readers with a few practical tips on how to make the most of this incredible country without spending many thousands of dollars/euros and without being herded around with thousands of others. Preliminary remarks: You don't need to apply for a visa before traveling, they will issue one at the airport upon arrival for $25. Make sure to get an international driving license. Never pay the initial asking price for anything, and always assume that 50% or less is probably realistic. Carry enough cash at all times, as ATMs may be hard to find and are often out of service. Have plenty of small notes, 5 and 10 Egyptian Pounds (LE) for baksheesh \u2014 one LE is around 6 cents, $1 is ca. 17 LE. One dollar bills are more than welcome for heftier tips (bar tenders, pool attendants). Drink only bottled water, which is available everywhere and cheap. Start taking probiotics a week before leaving, and don't stop until returning home. Get a prepaid SIM card from Orange EG when you arrive. Bring your own GPS with Egypt uploaded, better than Google Maps. 1. Make Hurgadha your holiday destination and base camp for a two-week, all-inclusive package tour in winter. It is on the Red Sea, away from the Nile Valley, but it It is the most economical and comfortable take-off point for ventures into central and southern Egypt, inc. Luxor, southern Nile Valley and Aswan. (For Cairo, Alexandria and their environs you'll need another trip, or to relocate to a northern base after a fortnight at Hurghada.) Plan to go between early January and late February, when the prices are low, the temperature ideal (74-78F during the day, dropping to well below 50 at night), sunshine pleasant but not oppressive, and last-minute all-inclusive prices ridiculously low. (From mid-March on you risk dust storms.) My two-week package from Belgrade was 500 euros ($600). It's truly All-Inclusive, inc. a three-hour return flight on Air Cairo's new Airbus 320, a spacious room (more like a mini-suite, really) in a well-tended complex, and unlimited food, wine, beer and cocktails, 24/7. The Long Beach Resort is comfortable, safe, and clean; it's pretty much the same with all other hotel complexes in Egypt's premium Red Sea resort. The food is not Cordon Bleu, but it is wholesome, fresh and honest. For all three main meals it comes in the form of multiple table spreads (which included roast duck last Thursday, pan-fried sole Friday, filet mignon last night). The substantial Sm\u00f6rgsbord of European and Middle Eastern delicacies contains something for every taste. In the morning the spread includes fresh eggs on demand (any style) that taste free-range, freshly squeezed juices, and an array of fresh salads and fruit.

Netanyahu spoke about 'Iran's efforts to militarily entrench itself in Syria and its attempts to destabilise the Middle East'. He highlighted bilateral cooperation between Israel and Italy and said the two leaders spoke about the EastMed gas pipeline, with which he said 'Israel intends to export its own natural gas to Europe, passing through Cyprus and Greece'. On Sunday, Moavero paid tribute to Holocaust victims at Jerusalem's Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center. He expressed 'shame' on behalf of Italy for the 1938 racial laws and also touched on the topic of migrants. 'The Shoah was infinitely more horrible. It's also true, however, that the root is a lack of ability to understand and demonstrate humanity,' Moavero said.[117]  NewsGuard Linked to Saudi Arabia's PR Machine[118] Newsguard, the beltway establishment-backed 'news rating' browser plugin that assigns websites a green or red rating based on their 'trustworthiness,' claims to care about integrity in news. But one of the project's top investors operates a D.C.-based subsidiary that has been trying to manipulate American news media on behalf of Saudi Arabia and its brutal military intervention in Yemen.[119]  Italy to Pull Out of Afghanistan in Year \u2014 Defence Sources[120] But Moavero says 'first I've heard abt it' (ANSA) \u2014 Rome, January 28 \u2014 Italy could pull its contingent from Afghanistan within a year, defence ministry sources said Monday \u2014 but Foreign Minister Enzo Moavaro Milanesi said this was the first he had heard of it. '(Defence) Minister (Elisabetta) Trenta has instructed the Interforce Operating Command (COI) to assess the start of planning to withdraw the Italian contingent in Afghanistan,' the sources said. 'The time frame could be 12 months,' they said. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement's (M5S) MPs on parliamentary foreign affairs committees welcomed Trenta's decision as 'very positive'. M5S No2 Alessandro Di Battista hailed the reported move as 'splendid news'. But League sources said 'let's do what is needed to restore peace and stability. At the moment no decision has been taken but only an assessment by the competent minister'. The M5S and the League are the two government partners. Trenta's request to assess the pullout was 'shared with the premier's office', government sources said Monday evening. The Trump administration's announcement late last month that it wanted to halve US troops in Afghanistan from 14,000 to 7,000 had repercussions on Italian plans for a reconfiguration of its own 800-strong contingent, sources said Monday. A reduction had already been envisaged but thus far a complete closure of the mission had not been discussed, they said. Italian soldiers have been in Afghanistan since 2003. Asked about Trenta's reported move, Moavero said 'I'm learning of this now, that she reportedly said it today. She didn't talk to me about it'. 'As soon as I get back to Rome,' he said on a visit to Israel, 'or as soon as I manage to hear from Minister Trenta, we'll talk about it again'.[121]  Keep Alert on Muslim Neighbor.

The SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors ISIS' online activity, said the militants claimed responsibility via their Amaq propaganda agency. The deaths included 15 civilians and five troops. Among the wounded were 17 troops, two police, two coast guard and 90 civilians.[129]  Trump Says 'Things Are Going Very Well' With North Korea[130] WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Saturday that 'things are going very well with North Korea' and he plans a second summit with leader Kim Jong Un to try to broker a deal that would entice the North to give up its nuclear weapons. 'We've agreed to meet sometime probably the end of February. We've picked a country, but we'll be announcing it in the future. Kim Jong Un is looking very forward to it and so am I,' the president told reporters Saturday at the White House.[131]  Man Dragged Along the Ground by an Angry Mob of Invasion Day Protesters for Wearing an Australian Flag Reveals What Really Sparked Ugly Clash[132] The man at the centre of a violent clash during an anti-Australia Day protest on Saturday claims he was attacked for no reason, and had been standing peacefully when he was dragged to the ground.[133]  One Nation's Mark Latham to Push for a Burqa Ban in All Sydney's Banks, Airports and Government Buildings if He Wins a Seat in Parliament[134] Mark Latham will push to ban the burqa in banks, airports and all government buildings if he's elected into the NSW upper house in March.

The Sea Watch 3 ship, run by a German NGO, rescued the mainly sub-Saharan African migrants off Libya more than a week ago and it is currently sheltering from bad weather off Sicily. The Mediterranean nations of Italy and Malta have both refused to let it dock.[143]  Italian Secret Service: People-Smugglers May Arrange Mass Drowning to Garner Western Sympathy[144] According to Italian newspaper Il Giornale, the Italian secret services are warning of the possibility of people-smugglers purposely causing a disaster at sea in order to garner sympathy from the West and resume the flow of migration. Such a move could be a repeat of other major humanitarian disasters such as a shipwreck which killed around 700 migrants on April 18th, 2015, and led to the commencement of Operation Sophia and an outpouring of support for migrant ferry NGOs operating in the Mediterranean Sea.[145]  A Shocking Political Affair[146] [] One of the best chroniclers declared, 'The protagonists felt a grandeur in the storm that battered them. Decadence was exorcised in the violence of their feelings Hate, evil, and fear encompassed them as well as courage and sacrifice. Their combat was epic and its issue was the life of the Republic.' It seemed inconceivable that the political thunderstorm would relinquish its destructive onslaughts on the public sphere so the sane minds of reason and maturity could claim their rightful place in political debate. The incident in question is known as the Dreyfus Affair, an 1890s political drama in France  Which brings us to the subject at hand, the most recent political affair involving a clutch of high school students.  There are perhaps only two occupations in the country that do not have to face the consequences of failure: professors and pundits. Since so much of what passes for journalism in the United States seems to be a thin masquerade for political preaching, a more accurate way to characterize reporting of the Covington Affair is to classify much of it as propaganda. Thus, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and hosts of equal and lesser organizations leaped into Covington coverage, only to slink away sheepishly when their journalists and editors discovered what they had 'reported' was factually wrong.  Which leaves them and the rest of America's media establishment free to continue working as though nothing had happened. After all, America teems with Covingtons; virtually every day offers possibilities for a diligent media scrounger to fill out a template to advance the narrative. And, who knows, if you're lucky, you might even stumble across something resembling the Dreyfus Affair, with all its drama, glory, and magnitude. Reporting on that would really establish one's reputation. Regardless of whether or not you told the truth.[147]  'Conservative' MP Trying to Abolish 461-Year-Old Tradition of Parliamentary Prayers[148] Crispin Blunt, the 'Conservative' MP for Reigate, is seeking to abolish the 461-year-old tradition of Parliamentary Prayers. Prayers have been said in private before the beginning of parliamentary business in the House of Commons and House of Lords since 1558, according to tradition, but Blunt and three allies have proposed scrapping them as 'not compatible with a society which respects the principle of freedom of and from religion' in an Early Day Motion.[149]  Covington and Killing Conservative Dissent[150] Imagine if you could just disarm your adversaries. In political debate this could mean, as an example, striking from their lips words that could possibly sway others. Now consider that in the recent media smearing of the Covington Catholic High School boys, 'Build the wall!' was treated like 'hate speech.' The sporting of MAGA caps was practically framed as incitement to riot, with Congressman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) actually proposing banning teens from wearing them. It doesn't end there. In 1987, race hustler Jesse Jackson led hundreds of Stanford students in a chant of 'Hey-hey, ho-ho, Western Civ. has got to go!' Back then they were talking about a course, but now the Left wants to make even the term verboten. Talking points synchronized, no small number of leftists now claim the term 'Western Civilization' is a 'dog whistle to white nationalists.' But the Left has long engaged in language manipulation, and for good reason. As the old book The Tyranny of Words instructs, the side that defines the vocabulary of a debate wins the debate. Nonetheless, while leftists steal the language like a pirate, conservatives echo them like their parrot. Conservative commentators will even use the liberal-disgorged euphemism 'undocumented immigrant,' apparently oblivious to how this is like calling a rapist an undocumented husband. Another good example is our 'gender' benders. As I wrote in 2017, 'Many today likely would agree with an Internet commenter I came across who, addressing the distinction between gender and sex, quite self-assuredly wrote, ''Sex' is what you do; 'gender' is what you are.' In reality, though, 'gender' was rarely used vis--vis people until relatively recently. Rather, its definition was as presented in my 1975 edition American Heritage School Dictionary: 'n. In grammar, one of a number of categories, such as masculine, feminine, and neuter, into which words are divided.'' Why was 'gender' co-opted? Well, would we now be having the Gender Wars and arguing about how many dozen 'genders' there are if we hadn't applied the term to humans in the first place? Remember, it was cemented in people's minds that there are only two sexes. A different word was needed to advance the agenda.[151]  Seeing Red: MAGA Hats Trigger Media, Celebrities, SJWs Into Fits of Hate, Intolerance[152] Simply wearing a red MAGA cap makes you fair game for verbal and physical attack. That is the growing sentiment of a disturbingly large portion of the media elites and an even larger portion of vocal academics at the prestige universities. Ditto for the swarms of radical students they've indoctrinated. And double dittos for the hyper-emotive Hollywood prima donnas and the thought police of the LGBTQ mafia. Yes, whether you are white, black, Hispanic, Asian, or Martian, and whether you're man, woman, child, or vegetable, if you dare don a red baseball cap with President Donald Trump's signature 'Make America Great Again' slogan, you have put yourself beyond the pale, according to the 'tolerance' moralists. By placing a MAGA cap on your head, you have aligned yourself with Nazis and the KKK, they say. You're a racist, misogynist, xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic bigot. As such, you have no rights, and deserve any punishment that the 'social justice' vigilantes (SJVs) mete out. You deserve to be doxxed, so that you, your family, your friends, your school, your community, your employer can be subjected to physical and mental harassment, by anonymous cyber-bullies online as well as by real-life street bullies. If you are subjected to violence and death threats, well, that's what you get for wearing that hat, say the apostles of tolerance, peace, and unity.[153]  UK: Man Investigated by Police for Retweeting Transgender Limerick[154] A docker from Humberside has been investigated by police over a limerick he posted on Twitter after an officer claimed it constitutes a 'hate incident' against transgender people. Harry Miller, 53, from Lincoln was contacted on Wednesday by a community cohesion officer following a complaint that had been made about the plant and machinery dealer's social media posts. Citing 30 potentially offensive tweets, the PC singled out a limerick Mr Miller had retweeted which questioned whether transgender women are biological women. It included the lines: 'Your breasts are made of silicone, your vagina goes nowhere.'[155]  Webster University Considers 'Witnessing Whiteness' Program on White Privilege[156] Webster University in St. Louis, Missouri, is considering the implementation of 'Witnessing Whiteness,' a new program that will encourage white students to discuss and come to terms with their own racism and white privilege. Witnessing Whiteness was introduced by Webster University's new Chief Diversity Officer, Vincent Flewellen, who has organized a the same program as the Director of Equity and Inclusion at Washington University, according to the university's school newspaper. The program is based on the book Witnessing Whiteness: The Need To Talk About Race and How To Do It by Shelly Tochluk, and would require all participants to be white. The workshop is said to 'help educate and shine light on racial injustices that happen in the world.' Best comment to the article is from Travis: 'If you're white and this stuff doesn't worry you, then you're ignorant. Read up on Communist China and 'struggle sessions'. Because that's exactly what these classes are. Now go take a look at what the struggle sessions led to. Wake up. If we don't pull our heads out of our asses and put a stop to this cr*p right now, we could very well find ourselves being marched out of our homes into 're-education camps' tomorrow. People think it can't happen here. It can. I don't hate anyone. I'm not advocating violence towards anyone (if anything, it seems to almost always be white or jewish people spearheading this stuff. shame that blacks and hispanics seem to get blamed) I'm simply saying that white people need to grow a damn spine and stand the hell up and say 'This is not acceptable, and we are not going to allow it.' How sad and pathetic is it that we haven't already done that en masse? We're allowing these people to brainwash our children into hating themselves, hating us, hating their ancestors and their history and their heritage. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE! I don't believe in white washing our history. Both the good and the bad should be taught. But this is not that. This is propaganda designed to humiliate and demoralize, and if we cared about our children and their future, we would all be mad as hell about this. Why aren't we?' [Comment: Communist garbage white guilt program of indoctrination. White kids should not sign up for this rubbish and need to stop swallowing this cool aid. It is poison. ][157]  Whistleblower: UK Fire Brigade Setting Harder Entry Test for White Men[158] A whistleblower has accused an English fire brigade of setting entry test pass marks significantly higher for white men than for women and ethnic minorities in order to meet diversity quotas. West Midlands Fire Service requires white men to achieve 70 percent in a verbal, numerical, and mechanical reasoning test before they can progress to an evaluation of their physical fitness, while female candidates, black candidates, candidates with Asian roots, and other ethnic minorities only need to make 60 percent, an anonymous source who spoke to the Daily Mail claims.[159]  Chapter Sixteen: The Communism Behind Environmentalism (Part I)[160] [] The views espoused by the United Nations Environment Agency led by Strong appear almost identical to Marxism: 'Private land ownership is a principal instrument of accumulating wealth and therefore contributes to social injustice. Public control of land use is therefore indispensable.' [15] Maurice Strong chose to settle down in Beijing after retirement and died in 2015. Natalie Grant Wraga, a late expert on the Soviet Union, conducted an in-depth study on the issue and wrote: 'Protection of the environment may be used as a pretext to adopt a series of measures designed to undermine the industrial base of developed nations. It may also serve to introduce malaise by lowering their standard of living and implanting communist values.' [16] In fact, environmentalism does not originate only from the former communist bloc. It goes deeper and relates to the overall goal of communism to undermine the cause of freedom around the world.  Professor Judith Curry, former dean of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, stated in a Senate testimony in 2015 that a scientist employed by NASA said to her: 'I was at a small meeting of NASA-affiliated scientists and was told by our top manager that he was told by his NASA boss that we should not try to publish papers contrary to the current global warming claims, because he (the NASA boss) would then have a headache countering the 'undesirable' publicity.' [57][161]  Davos Elite Wants to Give Amazon, Google and Facebook Even More Power[162] A group of mostly rich countries used the World Economic Forum in Davos to call for negotiations on digital trade. This is 'next big thing' in trade talks: trying to create global rules to govern rapidly increasing online trade and accompanying flows of data (the so-called 'oil' of the new economy). The massive rise in new technologies and online communications is transforming the world economy. And of course, it's true that new technology carries with it the power to transform many people's lives, to help our efforts to wipe out poverty, deliver healthcare and education for all, and halt environmental destruction. But, in the wrong hands, this technology can also do precisely the opposite. What's being dubbed the 'fourth industrial revolution' at Davos is energising global corporations, as they look for new ways to harness our data, cut their costs and increasingly monopolise global trade. To create a set of rules which actually gives these big tech companies \u2014 from Facebook, Amazon and Google to new platforms like Uber and AirBnB \u2014 permanent power over these new technologies, anywhere in the world, would be a disaster.[163]  New Species of Shark Found in Fish Market[164] Another week, another new shark species! While many can believe that scientists find new species in the ocean, swimming around freely that isn't always the case. In fact, it is rarely the case.

According to the pseudonymous Zero Hedge writer, Tyler Durden, mainstream media outlets have been pushing back against the story by pointing fingers at Zero Hedge for covering the topic that has received widespread attention on social media due to the postings of Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding and Dr. Anand Ranganathan, who highlighted studies noting the coronavirus' strange properties.[97]  CNN is Angry That White People Are Trying to Stop the Coronavirus Spreading[98] According to CNN, the real concern about the coronavirus is not the potential for a global pandemic, it's the fact there are too many white people trying to stop it.

In conversations on the sidelines of a DNC executive committee meeting and in telephone calls and texts in recent days, about a half-dozen members have discussed the possibility of a policy reversal to ensure that so-called superdelegates can vote on the first ballot at the party's national convention. Such a move would increase the influence of DNC members, members of Congress and other top party officials, who now must wait until the second ballot to have their say if the convention is contested.[107]  F-35's Gun That Can't Shoot Straight Adds to Its Roster of Flaws[108] Add a gun that can't shoot straight to the problems that dog Lockheed Martin Corp.'s $428 billion F-35 program, including more than 800 software flaws.[109]  Florida Man Friday: One of Our States is Missing[110] Every Friday starts the same way for me.

The failed amendment would have prevented the CFPB from forcing private credit score companies to #8216;make use of information related to political opinions, religious expression, or other expression protected by the First Amendment, whether obtained from a social media account of a consumer or other sources.#8217; The CFPB, established by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) during the Obama administration, would have the legal authority to force credit agencies to assign numbered scores to citizens directly reflecting the information gathered.[117]  Senate Votes No on Additional Witnesses in Impeachment Trial[118] The United States Senate voted Saturday against bringing in additional witnesses to testify before the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.

Speaking to Breitbart News Network Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow on the Breitbart News Daily show on Sirius XM on Brexit Eve, Brexit campaign leader Nigel Farage reflected on the truly historic events of Friday 31st 2020, as after almost 50 years the United Kingdom breaks free from #8216;Project Europe#8217;.[153]  Farage Declares #8216;The War is Over!

Facebook said it had taken the video down due to a privacy breach. The video was removed at the request of the victim of the stunt, 17-year-old Tunisian Yassin, whose surname has not been released. Surrounded by a film crew and a crowd of supporters, nationalist League party leader Salvini rang the bell after a woman who lost her son to drugs told him a pusher lived there. Yassin has said he is not a pusher and that the woman was irked at him because he and friends let off fireworks outside her house. The stunt, in the runup to regional elections which the League lost on Sunday, was widely condemned and drew the ire of Tunisia, whose ambassador protested. Salvini has said he will apologise if the boy turns out not to be a pusher. Yassin's lawyer, anti-hate speech campaigner Cathy La Torre, announced that the video had been removed from the social network. #8216;Facebook has removed from Matteo Salvini's page the video of shame,#8217; she said. La Torre said she had asked for it to be removed because it allegedly instigated race hatred. Yassin, who has not been placed under investigation by police, is suing Salvini. In the Emilia Romagna elections, the League's Lucia Bergonzoni lost by about eight points to the ruling centre-left Democratic Party's (PD) incumbent Governor Stefano Bonaccini. This was a blow to Salvini's hopes of exploiting a victory in one of the staunchest leftwing strongholds to demand a change of government in Rome. The PD are in government with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement (M5S) and two smaller parties. The Emilia Romagna victory has been seen as a boost for the government despite the M5S vote crumbling and despite a defeat to the centre right in the other regional elections on Sunday, in Calabria. Salvini, who has said a victory in Emilia has #8216;only been postponed#8217;, said he would do everything he did in the electoral campaign again, including another stunt at a PD-run town hit by a fostering scandal, Bibbiano. In the aftermath of the Emilia Romagna win, former premier Romano Prodi on Tuesday called on the PD to #8216;open up#8217; to other civic forces like the Sardines, a grassroots movement which sprang up in opposition to Salvini's populist and allegedly rabble-rousing anti-migrant rhetoric.[161]  Italy Most Likely Member to Quit the EU and Demand Independence After Brexit \u2014 Shock Poll[162] A BREXIT Day poll conducted by Express.co.uk has found that Italy is the favourite to follow the UK out of the European Union after Britain leaves at 11pm tonight.[163]  Life After Brexit: Most Important Changes for EU Citizens Living in or Traveling to UK[164] Brexit has been at the center of the news almost continuously for roughly three and a half years.

Speaking to Breitbart London outside the Palace of Westminster on the morning of Brexit Day, just hours before he and other prominent Leave figures are due to host a leaving party expected to be attended by thousands, Nigel Farage said he was ready to hold Boris Johnson and his government to account in the coming months and years.[169]  Online Platforms Need Regulating, Jourova Warns[170] Regulating digital platforms will be part of the EU Commission's plan to defend European democracies and fight disinformation, the commission vice-president Vera Jourova said Thursday (30 January).

The Sunday Business Post/Red C poll showed support for Varadkar's Fine Gael party had fallen seven percentage points to 23% since its last poll in November while fellow center-right rival Fianna Fail was up two points to 26%. It is the first time Varadkar's party has fallen behind its rival in the Red C poll series since he came to power in 2017. The two other major polls published since the start of the campaign showed the party trailing by 12 and 2 points respectively. [Comment: Article dated January 26, 2020.][177]  #8216;This is the Dawn of a New Era': The United Kingdom Has Left the European Union[178] The United Kingdom has left the European Union. The UK left the EU at 11 pm local time, Friday the 31st of January, 2020. The UK will now be in a transition period with the bloc until December 31st, 2020, during which time London and Brussels negotiators will work on a future trade deal. Just one hour earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had addressed the British public in pre-recorded social media posts to herald the #8216;dawn of a new era#8217; in British history.[179]  U.K. Police Will Soon be Able to Search Through U.S. Data Without Asking a Judge[180] Law enforcement officials in the U.S. and U.K. have negotiated a deal that sells out the privacy rights of the public in both nations. For Americans, it will effectively abrogate Fourth Amendment protections, and subject their data to search and seizure by foreign police. This is all going to start happening in a few months\u2014unless Congress does something to stop it now. That's why we're launching an action today, asking you to reach out to your members of Congress and tell them to introduce a joint resolution that could put a halt to the deal. If it isn't stopped, the worst parts of this deal will likely come standard on future agreements, and Americans will be subject to more and more searches by foreign police. The full text of the U.S.-U.K. Cloud Act Agreement was unveiled in November, and it's just as bad as we thought it would be. We joined with 19 other privacy, civil liberties, and human rights organizations, and sent a letter to Congress going through the long list of problems with the first Cloud Act deal. Some of the key problems with the U.S.-U.K. Agreement include: The agreement includes a weak standard for review, that doesn't meet the 4th Amendment's warrant requirement There's no prior judicial authorization required The deal includes no safeguards for free expression The people put under surveillance don't need to be notified, on any level The #8216;minimization#8217; procedures meant to protect U.S. persons are unfair, unequal, and won't do the job It will grant real-time access to communications, allowing foreign police to wiretap Americans' conversations, ignoring the high requirements for a wiretap under U.S. law These extraordinary search powers given to foreign police can be used even for relatively low-level crimes In colonial times, the British military used general warrants to search through houses and seize property. This practice was part of what fueled the American Revolution, and formed the basis for the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Congress shouldn't let an executive agreement, negotiated behind closed doors, give away rights that have been enshrined in U.S. law for nearly 250 years.[181]  UK: London Police Moves Forward With Full-Time Deployment of Facial Recognition Tech That Can't Accurately Recognize Faces[182] The London Metropolitan Police sure loves its facial recognition tech. But it's an unrequited love. The tech doesn't appear to have done anything for the Met during its past deployments. Documents obtained by Big Brother Watch in 2018 showed the Met's deployments had rung up a 98% false positive rate in May of that year. Nothing improved as time went on. Subsequent documents showed a false positive rate of 100%. Every #8216;match#8217; was wrong. Not exactly the sort of thing you want to hear about tech capable of scanning 300 faces per second. This followed an earlier report covering a test run by the South Wales Police at a handful of public events. In comparison, the South Wales tests were a success: a mere 92% of its matches were false positives.

Those years were the heyday of the so-called peace process. As the coordinator of negotiations on civil affairs for the Coordinator of Government Activities in Judea, Samaria and Gaza, I participated in all of the negotiating sessions with the Palestinians that led to a half a dozen or so of agreements, including the Interim or Oslo B agreement from September 28, 1995, which transferred civil and military authorities in Judea and Samaria to the PLO. Throughout the period of my work, I never found any reason to believe the peace process I was a part of would lead to peace. The same Palestinian leaders who joked with us in fancy meeting rooms in Cairo and Taba breached every commitment they made to Israel the minute the sessions ended. Beginning with the PLO's failure to amend its covenant that called for Israel's destruction in nearly every paragraph; through their refusal to abide by the limits they had accepted on the number of weapons and security forces they were permitted to field in the areas under their security control; their continuous breaches of zoning and building laws and regulations; to their constant Nazi-like anti-Semitic propaganda and incitement and solicitation of terrorism against Israel \u2014 it was self-evident they were negotiating in bad faith. They didn't want peace with Israel. They were using the peace process to literally take Israel apart piece by piece. Israel's leaders shrugged it off. Instead of protesting and cutting off contact until Yasser Arafat and his henchmen ended their perfidious behavior, Israel's leaders ignored what was happening before their faces. And in a way, they had no option of doing anything else. When Israel embarked on the Oslo peace process it accepted Oslo's foundational assumption that Israel is to blame for the Palestinian war against it. From the first Oslo agreement, signed on the White House lawn on September 13, 1993, through all its derivative deals, Israel was required to carry out #8216;confidence-building measures,#8217; to prove its good faith and peaceful intentions to Arafat and his deputies. Time after time, Israel was required to release terrorists from prison as a precondition for negotiations with the PLO. The goal of those negotiations in turn was to force Israel to release more terrorists from prison, and give more land, more money, more international legitimacy and still more terrorists to the PLO. On Tuesday, this state of affairs ended[193][194]  Italy Should Stop Ignoring Turkish Cypriots \u2014 Ankara[195] Reaction to Italian concern over ship drilling (ANSA) \u2014 Istanbul, January 30 \u2014 The Turkish foreign ministry said Thursday that #8216;we urge once again all the members of the EU, and in particular Italy, to abandon an approach that ignores the rights of the Turkish Cypriots#8217;. In a phone conversation with Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu Wednesday, Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio voiced #8216;Italy's concern over the presence of Turkish ships engaged in unauthorised drilling activities to the south of Cyprus' exclusive economic zone. The Turkish foreign ministry called this an #8216;unpleasant statement#8217;.[196]  Establishment Admits: We Are #8216;Unable to Stop#8217; The Spread of the Coronavirus[197] One establishment government is finally admitting that the ruling class of the world is going to be unable to stop the spread of the coronavirus. While globalists desperately attempt to craft a vaccine and save the day, other rulers think it could be too late. According to the Daily Mail, Thailand's government admits it's #8216;unable to stop#8217; the spread of the coronavirus. The virus has already proven deadly and could be spreading much more rapidly than mainstream media and establishment ruling classes are willing to admit. Health minister Anutin Charnvirakul said there are too many Chinese visitors to stop the virus from spreading. At least 22,000 people from Wuhan are believed to have visited Thailand in January alone.[198]  100,000 Chinese #8216;Under Observation#8217; As Coronavirus Deaths Soar; State Dept Issues #8216;Do Not Travel#8217; To China#8217; Advisory[199] #8216;Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China.

Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice. Commercial carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China.#8217; The new travel advisory was issued hours after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency. #8216;Those currently in China should consider departing using commercial means,#8217; the department said in the advisory.[200]  5G Launches in Wuhan Weeks Before Coronavirus Outbreak[201] Big Tech doesn't want this video seen, so be sure to defy Silicon Valley elitists by sharing this link In this Infowars Special Report, Greg Reese connects the dots between the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a Netflix docuseries pitching vaccines as a solution to outbreaks, Wuhan's recent launch of 5G and warnings from experts who say 5G could cause #8216;flu-like symptoms.#8217;[202]  Chinese Food Vendors #8216;Are Still Selling Live Wild Animals Including Rats, Badgers and Snakes' After the Country Banned the Trade Following the Coronavirus Outbreak[203] Experts believe the deadly disease, which has killed 213 and infected more than 9,900 worldwide, has been passed onto humans by wildlife sold as food, especially bats and snakes.[204]  Coronavirus a Planetary Drill for World Government Forced Inoculation[205] Mandatory vaccinations could be implemented worldwide if outbreak continues to spread Jon Rappoport of nomorefakenews.com joins The Alex Jones Show to break down how the coronavirus pandemic could be used to implement a world government, forced inoculation program.[206]  Coronavirus Live Updates: China Says Death Toll Hits 259, Confirmed Cases Rise to 11,791[207] This is a live blog.

Meanwhile, overseas Chinese have donated over one million masks, according to People's Daily citing a Fujian official.[208]  Coronavirus: Experts Say Studying Bats Could Help Predict Danger Spots[209] The source of the deadly Wuhan coronavirus has been identified as most likely originating in bats. Scientists believe that they can develop better defence against the infection by closely observing the animals. Scientists can also better predict where future outbreaks will occur by analyzing the DNA of the animal and the virus.[210]  Martenson Fumes: The W.H.O. Just Prioritized Money Over Human Life[211] Yesterday, the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) declared that the Wuhan coronavirus is indeed now a pandemic. Scary news, right? Wellnot if you kept listening. The W.H.O. then proceeded to downplay the risk to public health and took pains to make it clear it doesn't recommend placing restrictions on global trade &amp; travel at this time. What?!? When we may be in dealing with a viral outbreak as (or more!) virulent than the Spanish Flu? (aka The Great Influenza) Folks, this is nothing less than a political decision to keep business/commerce flowing without regard to public health. The W.H.O. has chosen money over people's lives: As an aside, this is not the first time that WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has potentially not told the #8216;whole truth'. As The NY Times reports, he was accused in 2017 of covering up three cholera epidemics in his home country, Ethiopia, when he was health minister.[212]  The True Number of Coronavirus Victims is Far Larger Than You Are Being Told[213] The World Health Organization says that we are facing an #8216;unprecedented outbreak#8217;, and they are basing that assessment on the official numbers that we have been given so far. But what if those numbers are not accurate and this outbreak is actually much, much worse than we have been led to believe? According to the Chinese government, there are now 9,692 confirmed coronavirus cases in China, and the official death toll has risen to 213. But the Wall Street Journal has already documented the fact that the death toll is being artificially suppressed. As I discussed the other day, many of those that have died are being categorized as dying from #8216;severe pneumonia#8217; so that they won't count as coronavirus deaths. Meanwhile, it is becoming exceedingly clear that the number of confirmed cases is also much lower than it should be. Large numbers of victims are being classified as #8216;suspected cases#8217; even after it is quite obvious that they have the virus. CNN spoke to a Chinese woman named Shi Muying who has been told by her doctor that she has the coronravirus, but because a fourth test has not been administered yet she is still considered to be a #8216;suspected case#8217;[214]  W.H.O. Demands #8216;Gratitude and Respect' For Chinese Dictator's Coronavirus Response[215] Bizarre comments from Director-General as it becomes clear Communists have lied about scale of global pandemic The World Health Organisation asked Thursday that China be shown #8216;gratitude and respect#8217; for its handling of the deadly novel coronavirus, despite the the widespread belief among health experts and government officials that the Communist state has been covering up the true scale of the outbreak to save face. After meeting with Chinese dictator Xi Jinping, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared that China needs to be applauded for the #8216;extraordinary steps it has taken to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.#8217;[216]  WHO Orders Countries Not to Engage in #8216;Stigma#8217; Or Discrimination#8217; In Response to Coronavirus Outbreak[217] Despite declaring a global health emergency, the World Health Organization has ordered countries not to engage in #8216;stigma#8217; or #8216;discrimination#8217; in their handling of the coronavirus outbreak. In their official statement declaring the emergency, the WHO stressed that they are not recommending #8216;any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available.#8217; This despite the fact that numerous countries have closed their borders with China and pilots and flight attendants in America are demanding an immediate halt to all flights out of China.[218]  Anti-Vaxxer Anthony Mundine Claims the Coronavirus is Fake and a #8216;Ploy' To Allow for the Introduction of a #8216;Mass Vaccine' In Bizarre Facebook Post[219] The former rugby star made the brazen comments in a bizarre Facebook rant on Saturday morning.[220]  Boy, 14, Is Arrested After Allegedly Starting a Fire That Threatened to Engulf a School in Sydney \u2014 as it is Revealed His Own Mum Dobbed Him to Police[221] A teenage boy was taken to a police station by his own mum after allegedly starting a bushfire on a reserve near Sydney.[222]  #8216;China Isn't Telling the Truth': Alan Jones Slams the Government for Not Grounding All Flights From the Country Immediately to Contain the Spread of the Coronavirus \u2014 Because They're #8216;Frightened' Of Our Biggest Trading Partner[223] The 2GB radio and Sky News host blew up at Senator Marise Payne on Friday morning for not grounding all flights from China to Australia.[224]  #8216;Leave Now': Residents Are Urged to Flee Their Homes Immediately as a State of Emergency is Declared in Canberra With Out-of-Control Bushfires Sending Thick Plumes of Smoke Into the Air[225] The Orroral Valley fire was upgraded to emergency warning level on Friday afternoon and filled the air with plumes of dark smoke as temperatures soared into the 40s in the nation's capital.[226]  Revealed: The Fake Tradie Accused of Scamming Elderly Residents Out of $100,000 Before Trying to Flee Back to Britain[227] James Ashley Bennett, 31, was allegedly part of a group fake tradesmen who preyed on elderly residents in affluent suburbs across Sydney.[228]  The Not-So-Lucky Country: From Groceries and Beer to Electricity, Childcare and Housing \u2014 How Australians Pay Far More Than People in Other Countries for Life's Necessities[229] Australia is fast becoming the least affordable country on earth, shocking new data shows.

Hundreds of migrants gathered Thursday in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, and departed early Friday after word spread through Facebook channels and WhatsApp chain messages during the beginning of the week. The caravan is expected to be made up of at least 8,000 people. The group was set to meet up with other refuge seekers in El Salvador to continue the #8216;Devil's Route' through Guatemala before an anticipated showdown with Mexican security forces at the border. The latest caravan has been labeled the #8216;Devil's Route' because the migrants are setting out on the same path that a cargo train nicknamed #8216;The Devil' transits through, via the Mexican Pacific coast all the way to the Mexico-Texas border.[234]  Hungary: Orban: Soros is the World's #1 Oligarch[235] Prime Minister Viktor Orban in a radio interview accused the #8216;Soros Network#8217; of organising migration across the Balkans.

The most recent filing from Sanders reveals $1,199,579 in spending during the final three months of 2019 to Apollo Jets, LLC, a #8216;luxury private jet charter service.#8217; The campaign spent an additional $23,941 for transportation to Virginia-based Advanced Aviation Team. The candidate who comes closest to matching Sanders in private jet spending was former vice president Joe Biden, whose campaign spent $1,040,698 to Advanced Aviation Team last quarter.[52]  Ohio Inmate Sentenced for Mailing Threat to Akron Municipal Court, Including Drop of Blood and Signing Letter as #8216;Servant of ISIS'[53] CLEVELAND, Ohio \u2014 A Summit County man was sentenced Monday to nearly three years in federal prison for mailing a threatening letter to the Akron Municipal Court and putting his own blood on the paper.

News. The couple announced that they would be leaving their royal family duties last month. Since then they have moved to B.C. where they have been seen on hiking trails close to North Saanich. Reports are stating that the couple hope to spend part of the summer in Markle's hometown of L.A. Some are thinking the move is so Meghan can continue on with her acting career.

Cider Riot closed on Nov. 10 following a series of violent events at or near the establishment that brought scrutiny to its alleged ties with violent far-left extremists. Cider Riot, stylized as #8216;Cider Riot!,#8217; first opened its storefront location in 2016 after a successful kickstarter campaign that raised more than $20,000. It quickly became known as a popular left-wing hang-out due to the outspoken political views of one of its owners, 41-year-old Abram Goldman-Armstrong. But the pub also embraced a far-left political identity by producing products featuring antifa-inspired names and images. #8216;Our Black Bloc Series ciders are our most hardcore and intense, and apt to disappear into the crowd before you know it,#8217; read the advertisement on the website for a series of drinks, nodding to the antifa tactic of wearing black masks and outfits in order to commit crimes anonymously. Beyond branding and marketing however, evidence suggests the pub openly operated as a meeting and organizing space for far-left, violent extremists in Portland.[60]  Trump: Bernie Sanders is a Communist[61] President jokes that Bloomberg needs a box to stand on for debates; media fact checks the claim During a special pre-super bowl interview, President Trump proclaimed that his Democratic rival Bernie Sanders is a Communist, while slamming other Democrats by saying that at least Sanders sticks to what he believes. #8216;I think he's a communist.

Now you could say socialist, but didn't he get married in Moscow?#8217; Trump stated, during the appearance with Sean Hannity.[62]  U.S. Announces More Coronavirus Cases, Details Quarantine Plans for Returning Travelers[63] CHICAGO (Reuters) \u2014 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday announced a second case of transmission of the new coronavirus within the United States and provided more detailed plans on how it will handle travelers returning from China as the country works to limit the outbreak. #8216;We expect to see more cases of person-to-person spread,#8217; Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a conference call that included confirmation of a handful of new cases, bringing the U.S. total to 11.[64]  Verified Leftists Celebrate Rush Limbaugh's Cancer on Twitter[65] Numerous verified leftists on Twitter reacted to Rush Limbaugh's announcement that he was suffering from #8216;advanced lung cancer#8217; by celebrating the news. The veteran radio host broke the news earlier today on his show, telling his viewers, #8216;I can't help but feel that I'm letting everybody down with.

The comments were part of Boris Johnson's first speech on trade since the United Kingdom left the European Union on Friday in which he sung the praises of free trade deals but noted a virulent strain of anti-Americanism that runs through certain parts of British society \u2014 particularly on the old left see can see support for Europe or the United States as a binary choice \u2014 which he derided as #8216;mumbo-jumbo#8217;.[70]  Boris: UK Will Not Accept EU Rules in Bargain for Trade Deal[71] Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU and has said that he would rather accept tariffs than restrictive Brussels regulations. In the deal, 98 per cent of tariffs between the EU and Canada are lifted but there are still Value Added Tax (VAT) and customs checks. The Times reports that Downing Street is prepared to fall back an #8216;Australian#8217;-style deal; Australia does not have an EU FTA, but does have a partnership arrangement that includes other tariffs.[72]  Coronavirus Prevention: Wuhan Hungarians Feel Healthy After Return, Says Chief Medical Officer[73] Hungarians who have returned home from Wuhan in China feel healthy but for the sake of safety they will remain quarantined for two weeks, the chief medical officer said on Monday.

Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday, Mr Farage said of his last day in the European Parliament chamber: #8216;I got the sense in that debate that, for the first time since 2016, they are a little bit more frightened of us than we are of them.#8217;[78]  French Mathematician and Spider Aficionado Cdric Villani Honoured With a New Orb-Weaver[79] Despite being considered as one of the best studied spiders in the Palearctic, the orb-weaver spiders (family Araneidae) remain poorly known in the central parts of the ecozone. To bridge the knowledge gaps, an international research team of researchers took to the Caucasus, Middle East and Central Asia to study two of those genera: Araniella and Neoscona. As a result, in their article, recently published in the open-access scientific journal ZooKeys, arachnologists Alireza Zamani (University of Turku, Finland), Yuri M. Marusik (Institute for Biological Problems of the North RAS, Russia) and Anna \u0160estakova (The Western Slovakian Museum, Slovakia) describe three new to science species, where one: Araniella villanii\u2014carries the name of the flamboyant French mathematician and spider aficionado Cdric Villani, dubbed the #8216;Lady Gaga of Mathematics#8217;.

This comes at the heels of a January price hike. #8216;The wave of electricity price increases in Germany is not abating. According to figures from the comparison and brokerage portal Verivox, 86 utilities have announced average price increases of 8.1 percent for the months February to April,#8217; writes Germany's flagship Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) here. #8216;For a family with an annual consumption of 4000-kilowatt hours, this would mean additional costs of around 100 euros per year.#8217; Already in January, #8216;543 basic utilities had already increased their electricity prices,#8217; according to the FAZ. #8216;The average increase was 5.4 percent.#8217; The price hikes come just as Germany's electricity rates have become among the world's highest. Annually tens of thousands of German households see their power cut off because they are unable to pay their bills. A large portion of the rate hike is due to the feed-in tariffs for green energies such as wind and sun.[82]  Hundreds of Convicted Terrorists Roaming British Streets After Being Granted Early Release[83] HUNDREDS of convicted terrorists are roaming the streets of Britain after being released early from jail like the Streatham knife attacker, the Daily Express can reveal.

Amman stabbed two people during the attack in broad daylight on Sunday afternoon before he was quickly neutralized by plain clothed anti-terror police who had been monitoring him.[102]  Varadkar on the Brink: Irish Voters Abandon PM's Party as Sinn Fein Leads Latest Poll[103] LEO VARADKAR has been dealt a massive blow after rival political party Sinn Fein established a clear lead in a major opinion poll just days before the Irish general election. The Ipsos MRBI survey for the Irish Times had support for left-wing Sinn Fein up four percent from the previous poll last month to 25 percent. SimIlar polls over recent weeks had suggested the party would finish third with the backing of just a fifth of the electorate. The latest survey shows support for centre-right Fianna Fail has slipped two percent to 23 percent, while Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael party are languishing in third position with 20 percent of the vote.[104]  Russia May Deport Any Foreigners Found With Coronavirus, Prime Minister Says[105] Foreigners could be deported from Russia if they test positive for the coronavirus, the prime minister said Monday, according to country's media outlets. Newly appointed Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said a national plan to prevent the spread of the infection in Russia has been signed. #8216;It will allow us to deport foreigners if they are diagnosed with this disease and introduce special restrictions, including isolation and quarantine,#8217; the prime minister said in comments reported by the Tass news agency and Interfax.

At this point we don't know if it will ultimately become a horrifying global pandemic that will affect tens of millions of people, but what we do know is that the virus spreads very easily and the number of cases has been rising at an exponential rate. Meanwhile, three other plagues have also been marching across Asia, and most people in the western world don't even realize that this is happening. What I am about to share with you in this article is quite chilling, and the months ahead will be very dark if these plagues continue to spread. Long before we ever heard of this new coronavirus, African Swine Fever was devastating pork farms from one end of China to the other. There is no vaccine for #8216;pig ebola#8217;, there is no cure, and once it hits a farm the only thing that can be done is to kill every single pig so that it won't spread anywhere else. But even though draconian measures have been implemented, it has just kept spreading, and at this point #8216;about two-thirds of China's swine herd has been lost#8217;[110]  Breaking Now: Scientists Confirm Coronavirus Man-Madecontains #8216;Pshuttle-Sn' Sequence Proving Laboratory Origin[111] Experts believe may be Chinese vaccine experiment gone wrong \u2014 watch live![112]  Coronavirus Cases Hit 20,000 as First Death Reported Outside of China[113] Three more cases of the new coronavirus were confirmed in the U.S. on Sunday, all in California, bringing the total number of people in the country with the disease to 11. The weekend also saw the first death blamed on the flu-like illness outside of China. As of Monday evening there were more than 20,000 confirmed cases in more than two dozen countries, the vast majority of them in China, according to the World Health Organization. There have been at least 425 deaths in China, and one in the Philippines. U.S. officials declared a public health emergency last week and, as a result, foreign nationals who have traveled to China in the last two weeks and aren't immediate family members of U.S. citizens or permanent residents will be temporarily banned from entering the U.S. Under the orders of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, anyone entering the U.S. who has been in China's Hubei province in the last two weeks will be subject to a two-week quarantine[114]  Coronavirus Updates: Hong Kong Reports First Death as Mainland China Cases Cross 20,000[115] This is a live blog. Please check back for updates. All times below are in Beijing time. 11:30 am: Hong Kong confirms 39-year-old man died Hong Kong's Hospital Authority told CNBC that a 39-year-old man died Tuesday morning in the city's first death related to the coronavirus outbreak. Details of the case are set to be announced at a briefing held by the Department of Health and Hospital Authority at 4:30 p.m. local time. This would be the second known death outside of mainland China. On Sunday, officials said a man from Wuhan died in a hospital in Manila, Philippines. 10:59 am: Walmart is cutting rents and fees for its stores in China Walmart said it is cutting rents and management fees in half for business tenants in community stores and Sam's Club, a membership-based line of stores selling goods in bulk at wholesale prices, from Jan. 25 to Feb. 8. The company, which has more than 400 retail locations throughout the country, said last week it donated 1 million yuan to provide medical supplies and increased support to Hubei province. 10:48 am: Former US FDA commissioner says coronavirus will likely become a pandemic The outbreak has already been declared an epidemic in China. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, told CNBC it #8216;likely will#8217; become a pandemic at this point. The World Health Organization describes a pandemic as the worldwide spread of a new disease.[116]  Coronavirus: Hong Kong Hospital Staff Strike to Demand Closure of China Border[117] Hundreds of hospital workers in Hong Kong have gone on strike, demanding the border with mainland China be completely closed to reduce the risk of the coronavirus spreading. Hong Kong has suspended cross-border rail and ferry services, but health workers want a total border closure. Authorities say closing the border completely would go against advice from the World Health Organization. There have been 15 confirmed cases of the virus in the city.[118]  Coronavirus Death Toll Rises to 425; Total Cases Tops 20,400[119] The death toll in mainland China from the new coronavirus has risen to 425, with the total number of cases now standing at 20,438, according to The Associated Press. There are 11 confirmed cases in the United States. China built a 1,000-bed hospital with prefabricated wards in just 10 days outside Wuhan, China, the city at the epicenter of the outbreak. A second hospital with 1,500 beds is due to open soon, according to AP.[120]  Hundreds of Canadians Waiting for Flight Out of Wuhan[121] Hundreds of Canadians are still in China awaiting a flight that will transport them out of Hubei. The province of Hubei has been the centre of the coronavirus outbreak which has killed approximately 360 people and infected over 17,200 people around the world. About 325 Canadians have requested help getting out of China. Flights out of the province will not be available for Canadians showing symptoms of the virus, according to CTV.[122]  Is This the Real Reason Why the Coronavirus is Absolutely Devastating China?[123] Sometimes we overlook the obvious because we don't like the implications. Right now, China is being hit with plague after plague. As I discussed earlier today, the epicenter for the worst coronavirus outbreak in modern human history is in China, the worst African Swine Fever pandemic ever recorded has wiped out #8216;about two-thirds of China's swine herd#8217;, and now an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu threatens to decimate Chinese chicken production. The attention of the entire planet is now keenly focused on China, and it appears that things are only going to get worse in the months ahead. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has initiated a campaign that is designed to stamp out the Christian faith throughout the entire nation. If you are under the age of 18, you are no longer allowed to go to church in China. Officials all over the country are forcing churches to replace pictures of Jesus with pictures of President Xi Jinping, hymns are being replaced with patriotic songs praising the communist government, and there has even been talk of rewriting the Bible to bring it more into alignment with communist values. It has been estimated that the number of Bible-believing Christians in China now exceeds the number of Bible-believing Christians in the United States, and obviously a lot of the underground churches did not want to go along with these deeply repressive measures. So Chinese officials have conducted mass arrests, they have shut down thousands of churches, and Bibles have been publicly burned to send a message to others that may be thinking of attempting to defy the government. I would use the word #8216;tyranny#8217; to describe what is happening, but it doesn't seem nearly strong enough. The following is how the New York Post described the current state of affairs in China Things have gotten so bad that Chinese officials even continue to persecute some Christians after they have died[124]  Muslim Cleric Issues Fatwa Calling for Coronavirus #8216;Annihilation#8217; of Chinese People[125] While the media continues to fret about #8216;racist#8217; bat soup memes, a Muslim cleric just issued a fatwa celebrating the coronavirus outbreak and calling for the #8216;annihilation#8217; of Chinese people. On January 23rd last month, Syrian jihadi cleric Abd Al-Razzaq Al-Mahdi celebrated the spread of coronavirus in China and urged Muslims to pray for Allah to #8216;annihilate#8217; the people of China. #8216;Al-Mahdi is a prominent cleric who is well respected by jihadi factions, and who is known for his sermons and fatwas, in which he encourages Muslims to take part in jihad and carry out attacks inside Russia,#8217; reports MEMRI.[126]  How the China Coronavirus Travel Ban is a $16billion Disaster for Australia's Economy \u2014 With 200,000 International Students and 1.4 Million Tourists Locked Out of the Country \u2014 and it Could Plunge US Into Recession[127] Australia's ban on travellers from China has sparked fears of a looming recession, given Chinese students and tourists pump $16 billion into the economy each year.[128]  Archbishop Protests Slaughter of Christians: Nigeria is #8216;Drifting Toward Anarchy'[129] The ongoing killings of Christians in Nigeria indicate that the country is #8216;drifting towards anarchy,#8217; said Lagos Archbishop Alfred Adewale Martins following the murder of an 18-year-old seminarian last week. In a statement on the diocesan website, the archbishop (pictured) lamented the death of the young seminarian, Michael Nnadi, who had been abducted along with three others in Kaduna State. The other three young seminarians were released but Mnadi was executedby his captors.[130]  Nicaraguan Catholic Church Demands Restoration of Freedom of the Press[131] The archbishop of Managua demanded Sunday the government of Daniel Ortega lift a block on paper and other raw materials from the opposition newspaper La Prensa.

The migrants were trapped in a hidden compartment in the truck that seemed to haul gravel, CNN reported. When investigators and rescuers responded to the impound lot on Jan. 30, they heard banging, CNN said. Laredo police received a tip that made them go back to the truck, the New York Daily News reported. #8216;People were hidden inside a dump trailer loaded with dirt with no means of escape,#8217; U.S. Customs and Border Patrol in southern Texas tweeted.[134]  Government: Some 100,000 Migrants Gathered Along Hungary Southern Border[135] Around 100,000 migrants have gathered south of Hungary along the border posing a risk at the country's border, a government official said on Monday.

Violence broke out near the Kara Tepe camp after hundreds of people marched from the island's congested migrant camps to the city of Mytilene, according to a police official.[138]  Speaker Nancy Pelosi Refuses to Abide by Supreme Court Ruling on Trump Travel Ban[139] The Democratic Party, especially its leaders in both Houses of the U.S. Congress, has demonstrated time and time again that they place little, if any, interest in protecting American citizens. They've also demonstrated that their interest in the U.S. Constitution is how it can be used to actually hurt American people, according to former Chief of Detectives Scott Myers of the Saratoga P.D., and current security director and consulting detective. A perfect example of their propensity to be an anti-Constitution political movement is being ignored by the news media who prefer to intensify their assistance to the Deep State and the Democratic Party in overthrowing the Donald Trump presidency. For example, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-California, is angrily refusing to accept a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that confirmed President Trump's legal right to enforce a travel ban. Pelosi, in the midst of the Trump Impeachment Trial, revealed that the Democratic-controlled House will vote on a bill to repeal President Donald Trump's travel ban, which he ordered to counter the arrival in America of individuals from the world's terrorist havens, especially in the Middle East, Latin America and parts of North Africa. Following weeks of Democrats accusing the Trump administration of racism and unfairness, the Supreme Court ruled that the president had the legal authority to operate the travel ban, which bars citizens of certain countries with high rates of extremist violence from entering the U.S. on national security grounds. Despite the Supreme Court decision, Pelosi said the House Judiciary Committee will propose and fight for her party's bill dubbed #8216;The National Origin-Based Anti discrimination for Non immigrants#8217; or #8216;NO BAN Act,#8217; which was penned by Representative Judy Chu, Pelosi's fellow Democrat from California.[140]  Your Responses From: Devolving Western Civilization[141] Ten years ago, my column, #8216;What if 20 million illegal aliens vacated America#8217; published with incredible responses. (Source: NewWithViews.com, October, 29 2007) Over 100 emails landed in my #8216;in-box'. Angry Americans, fed-up Americans and really PO'd Americans! Even radio host Michael Savage read the column verbatim on his show. It still makes the rounds on social media, but for some mysterious reason, my byline vanished as the original author. For a cliff note review, that commentary chronicled all the benefits Americans would enjoy if those 20 million border hoppers, anchor baby mothers, welfare recipients and illegal workers and their employers actually followed the rule of law\u2014and were sent back to their countries. At the time, Colorado Congressman Tom Tancredo spoke up nationally about closing our borders and obeying our laws. He received white-hot anger from La Rasa, ACLU, CAIR and the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2014groups that do everything in their power to destroy America's borders and legal citizenship. In the past ten years since that commentary, the borders remain as wide open as Maxine Waters' mouth, immigration added 35 million more people to the USA, net gain, and, not a single person in Congress has succeeded in stopping the endless flow of legal and illegal immigrants. Big corporations like Marriott, Holiday Inn, Hormel Foods, Tyson Chicken, Chipotle and hundreds more, bribe the majority of 535 Congressional critters to make sure they take no action to stop the invasion. Results: our country continues to fracture, polarize and fragment faster than ever. Not to mention our exploding cities, poverty and population hyper-growth. What few understand in Washington DC: these immigrants could care less about America or about becoming Americans. The liberal elites think they will never be touched by those unwashed and illiterate masses collecting in our cities. They feel immune. Lewiston, Maine or Minneapolis, Minnesota or Miami, Florida or Los Angeles, California? That won't happen to my city! Unfortunately, it IS happening to every city in America with a welfare office and refugee center.[142]  BuzzFeed Journo Reportedly Blogged About Pedo Fantasies, Rape Jokes and Doxing[143] Twitter will likely find all these outlandish public statements, doxes and tweets to be in perfectly good humor.[144]  Exclusive: Pedophiles Are Using Twitter to Share Child Porn[145] Statement: All accounts found to have or be soliciting child sex exploitation material during the course of this investigation were immediately reported to Twitter. A new investigation by The Post Millennial reveals that the distribution of child pornography is happening in plain sight. While many believe the distribution of these illicit materials is relegated to the seedy underbelly of the internet, this belief is far from true. On Twitter, pedophiles seeking to exchange child pornography and other child sex exploitation images are utilizing secret hashtags to signal their presence and interest to each other. The hashtags #megalinks and #megadump are littered with tweets from otherwise empty accounts offering or soliciting illegal material.[146]  Prof Wants #8216;Social Justice Content' In Math Books[147] A Williams College professor said he would advocate for social justice to be included in mathematics textbooks.

Arthur Robert Firstenberg is an American author and an activist for electromagnetic radiation and health. In his 1997 book Microwaving Our Planet: The Environmental Impact of the Wireless Revolution, he claimed: 'The telecommunications industry has suppressed damaging evidence about its technology since at least 1927.' Firstenberg has also founded the independent campaign group the Celluar Phone Task Force and since 1996 he has argued in numerous publications that wireless technology is dangerous. According to a report by the Daily Star, Firstenberg has also recently started an online petition calling on world organizations, such as the United Nations, World Health Organisation (WHO), and European Union to 'urgently halt the development of 5G,' which is due to be rolled out this year. In fact, Verizon has activated the world's first 5G networks in four cities in the United States: Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, and Sacramento. According to the Firstenberg, wireless networks are 'harmful for humans' and the development of the next generation is 'defined as a crime' under international law, as he states it in the online petition. When speaking to The Daily Star Online, Firstenberg said this 5G rollout is deadly. 'There is about to be as many as 20,000 satellites in the atmosphere. The FCC approved Elon Musk's project for 12,000 satellites on November 15th and he's going to launch his in mid-2019. I'm getting reports from various parts of the world that 5G antennas are being erected all over and people are already getting sick from what's there now and the insect population is getting affected,' Firstenberg stated. 'This could become a global catastrophe. When the first satellites were launched in the late 1990s for mobile phones, on the day they were launched people sensitive to these things got very sick. The mortality rate rose in the US by 5-10% too and there were reports that birds were not flying. People who realized this the most were pigeon racers who released their birds who then didn't return,' he added. And that was when there were only 77 satellites, not 20,000.[64]  BuzzFeed Lobbies Twitter to Ban Memes That Make Fun of 'Blackface' Democrats[65] BuzzFeed is now lobbying Twitter to censor memes that satirize the Democratic Party. Yes, really. Democrats are currently embroiled in a blackface scandal after both Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring admitted to wearing make-up to make them look African-American. One creative conservative chose to make fun out of this by posting a meme during Trump's State of the Union speech which depicted white-wearing Dem Congresswomen in distinctive KKK hoods.[66]  Claremont Institute's Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence Files Amicus Brief Challenging 'Auer Deference'[67] The Claremont Institute's Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence filed an amicus brief in Kisor v. Wilkie, which asks whether the Constitution's text and structure, specifically its separation of powers principles, require or permit courts to defer to a federal administrative agency's interpretation of its own ambiguous regulations. Dr. John Eastman, founder of the Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, argues: 'The doctrine of deference to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations, first announced in Bowles v. Seminole Rock ...nd Co. and ossified in Auer v. Robbins violates standard separation of powers principles. Those principles are the primary protection of individual liberty in the original Constitution.' Because the interpretive authority belongs primarily to the judiciary, and both Seminole Rock and Auer usurp judicial prerogative, Eastman urges the Court to overrule both cases and reverse the Federal Circuit's judgment. Tom Caso, who directs the Institute's Constitutional Jurisprudence Clinic, and Sohan Dasgupta, an alumnus of the 2016 John Marshall Fellowship, co-authored this brief. [][68]  Court Upholds Conviction of Girl Who Urged Suicide With Texts and Calls[69] The supreme court of Massachusetts has upheld the involuntary manslaughter conviction of a girl who, at the age of 17, goaded her boyfriend to commit suicide in a series of text messages and phone calls. The state's highest court rejected her lawyer's arguments that she couldn't be held responsible for his death because she wasn't physically present and that prosecuting her violated her First Amendment rights. Defendant Michelle Carter was sentenced to 15 months in prison in 2017, but the sentence was put on hold pending appeal.[70]  Democratic Congresswoman Tells Black Teen Conservative: 'Be Afraid of Us'[71] Nydia Velazquez in bizarre threat Democratic Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez appeared to threaten black teen conservative CJ Pearson during a Twitter exchange when Velazquez told the 16-year-old, 'be afraid of us'. The spat began when Pearson remarked that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared to be constantly talking throughout Trump's State of the Union speech while 'the woman next to her keeps trying to look the other way.' Velazquez responded aggressively, tweeting, 'Hi @TheCJPearson, I'm not 'the woman sitting next to her'. @AOC and I \u2014 and millions like us \u2014 are the future of this country. And you're right to be afraid of us. But you should learn my name.' Pearson hit back, tweeting, 'I'm sorry, Congresswoman, but as @realDonaldTrump said \u2014 socialism will NOT be the future of this country. And Nydia, nothing about you nor @AOC scares me. It's your policies\u2014 that jeopardize the stability of our nation and the future of my generation\u2014 that scare me.'[72]  Fake News About Holes in Antarctic Glaciers[73] CNN is breathless over a 'Gigantic hole two-thirds the size of Manhattan discovered in Antarctic glacier.' I'm sure they wish the hole actually were in Manhattan and included Trump Tower, but alas the hole is far away from their nemesis, the President. They describe it as, 'A massive cavity' which 'has been discovered growing in an Antarctic glacier, signaling rapid ice decay that has shocked scientists.' It's growing at an 'explosive rate' beneath the Thwaites Glacier, they anxiously report. [ ] Not only CNN, but their other media brethren are also in a panic over this news. The Hill reports a similar story, as does CBS News. The only explanation offered in any of the articles is climate change. Just as climate change was blamed for the polar vortex and recent cold spell in the Upper Midwest. Media mavens attribute everything bad in the world to climate change. Forbes believes climate change caused ISIS. Obesity is also blamed on climate change. Why aren't the journalistic sleuths thinking beyond their preprogrammed left-wing talking points? What else might be causing holes in the Antarctic glaciers? I wonder if CNN ever considered volcanos as the cause of glacial melting? Their cousins across the pond at The Guardian did. They reported that scientists recently discovered 91 new volcanoes below the Antarctic ice sheet. This is in addition to 47 already known volcanoes.[74]  Islamic Lawmaker Ilhan Omar Goes After Covington Catholic Boys Again[75] Prominent Democrat lawmakers like Muslim activist/U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), along with liberals on social media and a number of members of the media, twisted the truth about what happened that day in D.C., as the Covington Catholic boys waited for their bus to take them home to Kentucky from the March For Life. Eventually, several full-length videos were released, showing what really happened, and proving the Covington Catholic students were actually the victims. Now, almost three weeks later, after it's been proven that the Covington Catholic boys were innocent kids targeted by a hate group and by an aging, leftist, Native-American agitator, John Calvi, a reporter for EWTN caught up with Omar to ask her about the Covington Catholic kids. Watch, as Omar refuses to apologize for the intentional trashing of their reputations on her Twitter account.[76]  Jay Byrne: Meet the Man Behind the Monsanto PR Machine[77] Monsanto's former Director of Corporate Communications Jay Byrne, president of the public relations firm v-Fluence, is a key player in the covert propaganda and lobbying campaigns of the world's largest agrichemical companies. Emails obtained by U.S. Right to Know, posted in the UCSF Chemical Industry Documents Archive, reveal a range of deceptive tactics Byrne and other industry allies are using to promote and defend GMO foods and pesticides. The examples here showcase some of the ways companies are moving their messaging into the public arena from behind the cover of neutral-sounding front groups, government helpers and academics who appear to be independent as they work with corporations or their PR consultants. Clients are top agrichemical, agribusiness and drug companies and tradegroups Byrne's client list has included a range of the largest agribusiness and pharmaceutical companies and business groups, including the American Chemistry Council, Syngenta, AstraZeneca, Monsanto, Pfizer, the International Rice Research Institute, the American Farm Bureau, National Corn Growers Association, Grocery Manufacturers Association, Rohm ...as and the pesticide industry trade group CropLife. Cooked up academic front group to attack Monsanto critics A key strategy of the agrichemical industry, as the New York Times reported, is to deploy 'white hat' professors to fight the industry's PR and lobbying battles from behind the cover of the 'gloss of impartiality and weight of authority that come with a professor's pedigree.' In March 2010, Byrne and University of Illinois Professor Bruce Chassy discussed setting up a front group called 'Academics Review' that could attract donations from corporations while appearing to be independent. Byrne compared the idea to the Center for Consumer Freedom (a front group run by infamous corporate propaganda front-man Rick Berman), which 'has cashed in on this to the extreme; and I think we have a much better concept.' Byrne described an ''opportunities' list with targets' they could go after. [] [NOTE: Open page to read his 'To Do' list. Disquieting][78]  Nanny State Hawaii May Increase Smoking Age to 100[79] The state government in Hawaii wants to increase the smoking age to 100. Although pretty much everyone on Earth knows smoking is damaging to a person's overall health, the nanny state is taking it upon themselves to ban the use of more substances. Nothing good can ever come from the government dictating to people what they are allowed to put in their bodies, and that includes smoking. Are we free or not? Do we own ourselves or not? Governments assume they own us as tax cattle and therefore it's their right to tell us how to live our lives. Unfortunately, too many bow down to the whims of the state while others enforce these nanny state policies. If this bill succeeds in becoming a law, it would effectively ban the use of cigarettes for a very vast majority of the Hawaiian population. The bill was proposed by Democrat Richard Creagan, an obvious authoritarian. Even if it does become a law, laws hinge only on the population's willingness to abide by them, so it could be futile much like prohibition was. Not to mention worldwide smoking rates are plummeting to people voluntarily making the decision that it isn't good for them. According to the BBC, Creagan, who was an emergency room physician before he was elected as state representative in 2014, calls the cigarette 'the deadliest artifact in human history' in the bill.[80]  San Francisco's Drug Addicts Now Outnumber High School Students[81] San Francisco's drug addicts now outnumber high school students as it was revealed that the city handed out a record 5.8 million free syringes last year \u2014 about 500,000 more than in 2017. Despite spending an extra $1.8 million dollars last year in an effort to retrieve used needles, the government handed out about 2 million more syringes than it got back.[82]  Ted Malloch Decries Rise of American Marxism[83] Marxism and socialism have swung into fashion in America, laments Ted Malloch, just when they seemed ready to be swept into the dustbin of history. Although the system has failed disastrously wherever it has been applied, from the Soviet Union to Cuba and from Venezuela to North Korea, Malloch notes in an article Wednesday, the Democrat Party seems poised to embrace socialism to its bosom.[84]  The Ocasio-Cortez 'Green New Deal' Is Even Shoddier and More Absurd Than You Thought[85] On Thursday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) unveiled her much-vaunted 'Geen New Deal,' and it's even worse than you expected. Among other absurd things, it calls for abolishing cows, nuclear energy, and airplanes, 'upgrading all existing buildings in the United States,' guaranteeing 'high-quality health care' for all Americans, and spreading the Green New Deal to other countries. Oh, and it isn't even technically a bill. Ocasio-Cortez leaked a copy of the 'Green New Deal' to National Public Radio (NPR), and her slipshod work in progress is a resolution. Rather than making law, the resolution states the 'sense of the House of Representatives.'[86]  The Spoils of Censorship: NYT Raked in $709 Million Digital Revenue in 2018[87] Having the number one search result for most news-related topics being links to your paywall apparently helps your business a lot! Having Big Tech rig their search results to favor you and shut down, censor, demonetize and suppress your competition is very lucrative. The New York Times reported $709 million in digital revenue for 2018. Big Tech has effectively melded itself with the New York Times and the Washington Post (which is also now profitable after being bought by billionaire Jeff Bezos). They working together to crush their competition and set the limits of 'acceptable' political debate. Big Tech wants to shut down competing alt-tech companies like Gab and BitChute so the media moves to demonize and lie about them to get them deplatformed. The media wants to shut down competing voices like Alex Jones and Gavin McInnes so they lie about them and demonize them and Big Tech shuts them down. It's a symbiotic relationship. While companies like the NY Times and WashPo whine incessantly about Trump supposedly threatening the 'free press' (which they comically call themselves), the reality is they themselves are the biggest threat to the free press in America and the number one advocates for political censorship.[88]  The Worst Mayors in America Are Running for President[89] Newark is the most dangerous city in New Jersey, Tallahassee is the most dangerous city in Florida, and South Bend is the most dangerous city in Indiana. But instead of fixing their failed cities, the current mayor of South Bend, and the former mayors of Newark and Tallahassee want to run for president. Mayor Peter Buttigieg has announced that he's forming an exploratory committee for a 2020 run. Media reports have focused on the possibility that he might become America's first gay millennial president, instead of on the fact that he's headed a city since 2011 which has double the national and statewide violent crime rates. And a city where Hispanic poverty rates are 10% higher than the national average, African-American households have double the poverty rate, and Asian-American incomes are halved.[90]  Trump 2020 Campaign Announces Feb. 11th MAGA Rally in El Paso, Texas[91] The president is headed to Texas in the near future to host a 'Make America Great Again' rally. On Wednesday, the Trump campaign announced President Trump will be holding a rally at the El Paso County Coliseum on Monday, February 11, 2019. According to the campaign this will be the president's seventh rally in the Lone Star State.[92]  UFO: Alien Ship Has Entered Our Solar System Insists Harvard Professor[93] A HARVARD professor has insisted that he has found part of an alien spaceship \u2014 and is in the process of finding the evidence. The head of Harvard's astronomy department Avi Loeb believes that a cigar-shaped object discovered in 2017 is an sail, claiming that it is travelling far too quickly to be an asteroid. In an interview with Chicago Tribune Mr Loeb shared that he has been working on an equation that will prove that the strange interstellar object, called Oumuamua and currently passing the orbit of the Jupiter, is a part of an alien spaceship. The astronomer, who has been derided by his colleagues, thinks that Oumuamua is a lightsail that was once the driving force of 'advanced technological equipment.'[94]  Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax's Accuser Vanessa Tyson Discloses Graphic Details of Alleged Sexual Assault[95] The woman who has accused Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexually assaulting her in 2004 on Wednesday released a lengthy statement including details of that alleged attack at the Democratic National Convention. Vanessa Tyson, a politics professor at Scripps College in California, said Fairfax forced her to engage in oral sex with him after they first engaged in 'consensual kissing' in his hotel room in Boston.[96]  Muslim Head Scarf a Symbol of Oppression, Insists Quebec's Minister for Status of Women[97] Quebec's newly appointed minister responsible for the status of women is standing by her position that the Muslim hijab is a symbol of oppression. Speaking to reporters after being named to the portfolio Tuesday, Isabelle Charest said the head scarf 'is not something that women should be wearing.' Charest didn't back down from those comments Wednesday, though she acknowledged that some women choose to wear the hijab themselves, and she 'respects their decision.'[98]  'EC Vice President Timmermans Should Withdraw!'[99] The Hungarian government has called on the European Commission president to withdraw EC vice president Frans Timmermans, who is the spitzenkandidat of the Party of European Socialists, from the commission's work for the duration of his active campaign to become commission president.[100]  Eco-Group Offers Pope Francis $1 Million to 'Go Vegan' For Lent[101] An environmental group has challenged Pope Francis to 'go vegan' for Lent in exchange for $1 million dollars to go to a charity of his choice. An organization called Million Dollar Vegan, supported by celebrities including Paul McCartney, Woody Harrelson and Mena Suvari, launched a video announcing its challenge to the pontiff and enlisted a 12-year-old animal rights activist named Genesis Butler to write an open letter to the pope.[102]  EU Army Has to Happen: Germany's 'Next Chancellor' Demands Euro Armed Force[103] GERMANY'S new Christian Democrat leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer has called for the creation of a European army amid growing global instability caused by sabre-rattling leaders in Russia, China and the US.[104]  France: Grenoble Mosque Shut Down Due to Radical Islamic Preaching[105] Authorities in Grenoble have shut down the Al-Kawthar mosque for six months following accusations of links to radical Islamic ideologies. The decision was made by the prefect of Grenoble who issued a statement on the closure, saying 'The elements collected by the specialised services have established that the remarks made and the ideas and theories disseminated within this place of worship provoke violence, hate, and discrimination.'[106]  France's Le Pen Blasts President Macron Over 'Lack of Democracy'[107] The leader of the French National Party \u2014 Marine Le Pen \u2014 is criticizing French President Emmanuel Macron amid ongoing yellow vest protests. In an interview Wednesday, Le Pen said Macron's attempts at national reconciliation will fail if the president fails to address the demands of yellow vests. She said the popular movement will not subside unless Macron improves the economy, creates jobs, and tackles Islamic mass migration.[108]  Germany's Antitrust Watchdog Restricts Facebook's Data Collection Via Other Sites[109] Facebook faces restrictions in Germany on its collection of data from other sites that it owns like WhatsApp. The social media giant intends to appeal, claiming the watchdog underestimated the competition it faced. The Federal Cartel Office, Germany's antitrust watchdog, is severely restricting the collection of user data by Facebook after a ruling on Thursday that the social media giant abused its market. The company will only be able to use data from various non-Facebook programs and apps that it owns, such as WhatsApp and Instagram, with explicit user consent. Currently, Facebook bundles together much of the information it gleans from users across its various platforms. 'In future, Facebook will no longer be allowed to force its users to agree to the practically unrestricted collection and assigning of non-Facebook data to their Facebook accounts,' Andreas Mundt, president of the antitrust watchdog, said on Thursday in Bonn. [110]  German Mayor Wants to Welcome Home an ISIS Bride[111] Leonora converted to Islam at 15 and traveled to Syria two months later to join ISIS. Only three days after her arrival she became the second wife of a Saxon ISIS fighter called Martin Lemke. She has been arrested and claims to be remorseful but her story turns out to be fabricated.[112]  Italy: Yellow Vests Meeting Fully Legitimate Says Di Maio[113] Macron often attacked us says M5S leader, deputy PM (ANSA) \u2014 Rome, February 7 \u2014 Deputy Premier and 5-Star Movement (M5S) Luigi Di Maio said Thursday his meeting Tuesday with members of the French Yellow Vests protest movement in Paris was 'fully legitimate'. 'And I claim the right to dialogue with other political forces that represent the French people', he said. 'Just like En Marche, the French government party, is allied with the (Democratic Party), an opposition party in Italy, so the M5S meets a political force of opposition to the French government (RIC)'. He added, after France recalled its ambassador, 'the French people is our friend and ally. President Macron has on several occasions attacked the Italian government for political reasons in view of the European elections. 'This has not affected the feeling of friendship that ties our two countries, and never will'. On issues such as immigration, he added, 'dialogue and collaboration with the French government is always maximum and we are willing to have meetings at the highest level with the French government in order to find solutions'.[114]  Italy: 'Collegial' Decision on TAV Says Conte[115] M5S agst project, League in favour (ANSA) \u2014 Beirut, February 7 \u2014 There will be a 'collegial' government decision on whether to go ahead with the TAV Turin-Lyon high-speed rail line, Premier Giuseppe Conte said Thursday, saying the decision would not be 'emotional or personal but transparent'. He said collegial decisions were the 'best way to safeguard Italian interests'. The decision will be taken on the basis of a government-commissioned cost/benefit analysis which has been reported as arguing against completing the project. Senior government partner the 5-Star Movement is against the project while junior partner the League is in favour of it.[116]  Mrs May Leaves Brussels Brexit Talks Empty Handed[117] Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had 'robust' talks Thursday morning, which as promised by European leaders beforehand did nothing to advance the two parties towards a Brexit agreement. The British leader was pictured giving the top Eurocrat a stern glare as the pair shook hands Thursday morning, a move likely calculated to communicate a business-like attitude to British watchers of the talks.[118]  Tensions Ease Between Merkel, Visegrad Leaders[119] German Chancellor Merkel was greeted by the eastern European leaders, a sign that the tensions of 2015 are subsiding. However, Merkel is expected to face tough questions from the alliance's leaders on a host of issues. German Chancellor Angela Merkel met Slovakian Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini in Bratislava on Thursday, as well as the other leaders of the Visegrad group. The group, which comprises Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, was coming together to mark 30 years since the Iron Curtain came down. 'Thirty years ago, people in East Germany and the Visegrad states fought for freedom. The result was a united Germany. Thank you. We will never forget this contribution of the Visegrad Group,' Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert tweeted. [120]  UK: Farage: EU 'Scared' of WTO Clean Brexit[121] Brexit architect Nigel Farage has said that Brussels bureaucrats are 'scared' of a no-deal, clean Brexit because of the cost to European manufacturers and the looming eurozone recession. When asked on Sky News on Wednesday if he were offended by European Council President Donald Tusk saying there was a 'special place in hell' for Brexiteers, the Leave Means Leave vice-chairman said, 'No, not particularly. They're scared, they're rattled. They really worried.[122]  UK: Father Denies Planning Acid Attack on His Three-Year-Old Son in Worcester[123] A father accused of planning an acid attack on his three-year-old son has told a jury he was 'never' involved. The 40-year-old, who cannot be named to protect the identity of his son, added that he was 'shocked' to be arrested.[124]  UK: Homicides Highest for a Decade, Fatal Stabbings Highest Since Records Began[125] Homicides in England and Wales are at their highest rate for decade, as official statistics reveal a rise in fatal stabbings, with largest increases in the numbers of young, male, and black victims. The Office of National Statistics (ONS) data from the Home Office Homicide Index released Thursday revealed that there were 695 homicides in the year to March 2018, 15 per cent higher that in the preceding period.[126]  UK: Why the Left Are So Scared of Turning Point[127] Earlier this week I made the usual mistake of looking at Twitter and saw that 'Turning Point' was trending. This is unusual in Britain. Turning Point is a very successful organization set up in the US to counter the dominance of left-wing views on campus. It turned out to be trending because of the launch of Turning Point UK this week. In essence the response to the launch of Turning Point demonstrated the need to launch Turning Point in the UK. After all, what we are talking about here is a student-oriented organization which wants to extol the virtues of free markets over socialism and individual liberty over identity politics. There is nothing in the group's statements so far that should cause a flutter even among the precious mobs on social media. But the launch of Turning Point UK was covered in exactly the way you might expect.[128]  'Unacceptable Provocation': Italian Populists Troll French Establishment by Meeting Yellow Vests[129] France's foreign ministry has reacted with anger after Italy's populist deputy prime minister Luigi Di Maio met with French Yellow Vests, calling the gathering an 'unacceptable provocation.' Di Maio, whose anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) party governs Italy in coalition with the right-populist League, met with Yellow Vest leader Christophe Chalenon as well as candidates for European Parliament from the anti-government movement on Tuesday.[130]  Female Islamist MP Drops the Veil in Paris, Divides Morocco's Ruling PJD[131] The ruling party can no longer preserve its politico-religious speech following scandals that have involved its politicians and leaders. CASABLANCA \u2014 Morocco's ruling Islamist Justice and Development Party (PJD) is going through turmoil amid growing division between its leaders over scandals involving its politicians. The PJD's popularity dwindled following personal photos of an unveiled female member of parliament in Paris that were shown by Moroccan media. MP Amina Maelainine initially said that the picture with her exposed hair blown by the wind in front of the Moulin Rouge in Paris was fabricated and denounced a 'slanderous' campaign against her. She later admitted on Facebook that the photos were genuine[132]  ISIS 'Caliphate' Down to 1 Per Cent of Original Size as Final Assault Nears[133] BEIRUT (AFP) \u2014 The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria group's (ISIS') 'caliphate' has shrunk to less than 1 per cent of its original size, the US-led coalition said on Thursday (Feb 7), as a final onslaught in eastern Syria loomed. Kurdish-led forces spearheading the offensive have paused operations but US President Donald Trump predicted Wednesday that a final declaration of victory would come next week. At its height, the jihadist proto-state proclaimed by IS in June 2014 straddled swathes of land in Syria and Iraq and was roughly the size of Britain.[134]  No Confirmation Father Dall'Oglio is Alive \u2014 Vatican[135] Jesuit priest in ISIS-held area, according to The Times (ANSA) \u2014 Vatican City, February 7 \u2014 Well-informed Vatican sources on Thursday did not confirm a report in The Times according to which Father Paolo Dall'Oglio, an Italian Jesuit priest kidnapped in Syria in 2013, is alive. 'We have no confirmation', the sources told ANSA of the report, which cited Kurdish forces. The article said the extremist Islamist group is using Dall'Oglio and two other Western hostages, British journalist John Cantlie and a nurse from New Zealand, as 'bargaining chips' in negotiations with the US-backed Kurdish-Arab forces surrounding them.[136]  Leading Muslim Cleric: Pakistan's Blasphemy Laws Save 'Thousands' Of Lives[137] A prominent Muslim cleric has defended Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws, insisting that they actually have saved the lives of 'thousands' of people from public lynching. Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi, known as a 'liberal' and open-minded maulvi (cleric) in his native Pakistan, said this week that blasphemy laws, which severely punish conversion from Islam or insults against the prophet Mohammad or the Qur'an, protect citizens from vigilante justice by turning them over to public officials.[138]  Pak PM Imran Orders Probe Into Attack on Khairpur Hindu Temple and Sacrilege of Holy Books[139] Sacrilege in Pakistan Hindu temple including Bhagavat Gita and Guru Granth Sahib causes uproar. Pak PM Imran Khan orders a probe for eyewash! Upender Singh Bedi | HENB | Karachi | Feb 6, 2019:: Pak Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday (05/02/2019) night ordered a probe and urged the provincial government in Sindh to take action after a Hindu temple in Khairpur was attacked and scriptures holy to Hinduism were set on fire. Muslim miscreants in Pakistan attacked a temple, vandalised idols, and set ablaze Hindu and Sikh religious scriptures on Sunday (03/02/2019). The act has triggered sharp criticism from both the Hindu-Sikh minority communities of Pakistan. The President of Karachi based organisation Pakistan Hind Seva, Sanjesh Dhanja, said that a group of Muslim people forcibly entered Sham Sundar Sewa Mandali temple on Sunday late evening and broke the idols and set fire to Bhagwat Gita and Sri Guru Granth Sahib kept there. The temple is located in Kumb, about 30 kilometres from Khairpur, in Kot Diji taluka of Khairpur district in Sindh province of Pakistan. The temple is surrounded by as many as five dozen houses of Hindus..[140][141]  Brazil's Bolsonaro Suffers Suspected Pneumonia: Doctors[142] Sao Paulo (AFP) \u2014 Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro had a fever and possible pneumonia, his doctors said Thursday, 10 days after the far-right leader underwent surgery on the stomach wound he suffered when stabbed last year. The 63-year-old remains in semi-intensive care in Sao Paulo following a procedure to remove his colostomy bag and reconnect the bowel. 'Last night he had a fever (and) was subjected to a CT scan of the chest and abdomen that showed good intestinal evolution' as well as 'an image consistent with pneumonia,' Bolsonaro's doctors said in their daily medical bulletin. The president's spokesman, Otavio do Rego Barros, said the image 'confirmed the possibility of pneumonia' but added that doctors 'didn't seem more worried' than before.[143]  New 'Unicorn' Mantis Species Found in Brazilian Rainforest[144] Researchers have discovered a handful of new praying mantises, some that boast incredible horn-like appendages on their heads.[145]  Venezuela: Italy Must be Neutral \u2014 Di Maio[146] Can't create another Libya says deputy PM (ANSA) \u2014 Rome, February 7 \u2014 Italy must be neutral on Venezuela and there must not be another Libya, Deputy Premier Luigi Di Maio said Thursday. In a letter to opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaid\u00f2, Di Maio said the Italian government 'must avoid all external interference' and be a possible mediator to arrive at fresh elections, 'free and monitored by international organisms'. Guad\u00f2 on Wednesday asked Di Maio, fellow Deputy Premier Matteo Salvini and Premier Giuseppe Conte to meet a delegation from him in Rome.[147]  Victims of Socialism in Venezuela Warn U.S.: 'Don't Fall for it, ' 'People Are Eating From Trash Bags'[148] Victims of Venezuelan socialism who have come to America recently attended a Venezuela Freedom Rally in Washington, D.C., where Campus Reform asked them for their message to Americans who support socialism. 'Bernie Sanders is your enemy. Do not ever, ever get involved with this individual or any of the other socialists,' one man who escaped Venezuelan socialism warned. 'People are eating from trash bags in the streets,' one woman said.[149]  A Quarter of French Believe 'Elites' Using Mass Migration to 'Replace' Native Europeans[150] The study found that 27 per cent of French believe in an 'Illuminati' of elites who control the population A study claims that up to a quarter of the French population not only believe in a conspiracy of 'elites' but also think those same elites are using mass migration to replace European populations. The study, released by Jean-Jaure's Foundation and Conspiracy Watch, is the second of its kind and looks at the extent to which the French believe in various so-called conspiracy theories. The study found that 27 per cent of French believe in an 'Illuminati' of elites who control the population while one quarter say they believe in the theory of the 'Great Replacement,' Le Point reports. The theory of the Great Replacement was coined by French writer Renaud Camus and encompasses several subjects under the broad scope of interchangeability and exchangeability, from goods and services to people themselves. [Comment: Elites still repeating the lie that it is all a 'conspiracy' even though native population are seeing the effects of mass migration.][151]  Afghan Migrant Who Killed His German Girlfriend Because She Refused to Convert to Islam Sentenced to Life in Prison[152] The illegal Afghan immigrant Ahmad S. was found guilty of murder by the district court of Flensburg in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. He received life imprisonment for killing his 17-year-old German girlfriend 'because she refused to convert to Islam'. His ex, identified only by her first name Mireille, was stabbed 14 times in her flat, after she ended their relationship.[153]  Germany: Killer Caged[154] Illegal immigrant, 30, killed his German girlfriend, 17, 'because she refused to convert to Islam' after lying about being a CHILD to slip into country AN ILLEGAL immigrant, 30, has received life imprisonment for killing his 17-year-old German girlfriend 'because she refused to convert to Islam'.

The man turned out to be 11 years older than he claimed during his trial.[155]  Illegal Immigrant Killed His German Girlfriend, 17, 'Because She Refused to Convert to Islam'[156] After lying about being a CHILD to slip into country AN ILLEGAL immigrant, 30, has received life imprisonment for killing his 17-year-old German girlfriend 'because she refused to convert to Islam'. Identified as Ahmad S. due to privacy reasons, the Afghan was found guilty of murder by the district court of Flensburg in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. The man turned out to be 11 years older than he claimed during his trial. His ex, identified only by her first name Mireille, was stabbed 14 times in her flat, after she ended their relationship. The court heard that the Afghan migrant was jealous she had found a new boyfriend, and hated that he could no longer control every aspect of her life. Yet Ahmad S. denied the murder and claimed that someone else must have committed the crime.[157]  Lauren Southern Slams Pro-Migration NGOs[158] Canadian right-wing YouTuber, author and filmmaker Lauren Southern spoke to Hungarian daily Magyar Hirlap about her upcoming documentary, Borderless. According to Southern, with her team they initially wanted to show how mass immigration disintegrates Europe's culture and traditions, but later they discovered the less talked about aspect of the story: the massive crime ring of smugglers and NGOs that boost illegal immigration to Europe.[159]  Strasbourg 'Concerned' By Security Law in Letter to Conte[160] CoE mentions repercussions on 'access to essential services' (ANSA) \u2014 Strasbourg, February 7 \u2014 The commissioner for human rights of the Council of Europe, Dunja Mijatovic, on Thursday expressed 'concern' in a letter to Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte over the repercussions for migrants and asylum seekers of recent migrant and security legislation. Mijatovic wrote that she was concerned for the possible 'repercussions of the security decree on the right to access accommodation and essential services, healthcare and education, for residents who have a residency permit for humanitarian reasons and by disconcerting information reporting that a number of them would risk becoming homeless'.[161]  Sweden Admits it Cannot Control Its Own Borders[162] The chief of Sweden's National Border Police has sounded the alarm on the ability of his force to do its job \u2014 even to the low standard required by the European Union under its Schengen zone open borders agreement. Former Europol top cop and Swedish police superintendent Patrik Engstr\u00f6m [pictured above, left] made the warning when he said the Border Police that he commands did not have enough resources to adequately patrol the 102 border crossings and ports nationwide. A Swedish newspaper has claimed the nation is short of 500 border officers to do the job adequately, but Engstr\u00f6m declined to discuss specific numbers, Sweden Radio reports. Engstr\u00f6m said: ' the border police's mission is not resourced to meet Schengen's requirements for border control It is a work that is carried out in all seven regions of the police. What is needed, without entering the exact number, is more staff to be able to carry out the external border control that the EU requires. It is about being able to conduct control at both large and small border crossing points.' [ ] The officer's comments come months after an explosive leaked European Union report lifted the lid on the extent of disarray in Sweden's border control apparatus. The paper, which it is alleged was hushed up in the run-up to the 2018 national elections in which immigration and border control were key issues for the electorate, claimed Sweden has the worst border control of any nation in the Schengen zone, and that 'there is no actual border control.' Faults including border agents receiving only very basic training, not being told how to spot forged documents, and not checking for jihadist fighters travelling to the nation were highlighted in the document.[163]  Swedish Migration Board Finds Nearly One in Ten Turkish Passports Are Forgeries[164] The Swedish Migration Board has sounded an alarm over the high number of fake Turkish passports being found at border checks, saying some of the passports show advanced forging knowledge. Since the Autumn of 2018, Swedish border officials have sent around 400 Turkish passports for extra checks and have found that nearly ten per cent of those examined were forgeries, Swedish broadcaster SVT reports.[165]  The Moment Democrats Realize They Just Got Owned by President Trump on Immigration[166] When President Trump finally got to the immigration portion of his speech, he boldly stood in front of Nancy Pelosi and the #ResistTrump Democrats and brilliantly framed his argument for a wall on our southern border. Trump started out by looking at the Republican side of his audience, saying: 'Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration.' It was at that moment, that President Trump turned to address the smug, open borders Democrats, and that's when the gloves came off. Trump looked directly at them and called them out for their hypocrisy, saying: 'Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.' Republicans jumped to their feet and applauded Trump, showing their unity with him on the border issue. 'Meanwhile,' Trump continued, 'working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal immigration, reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals that are so crowded, you can't get in, increased crime and a depleted social safety net. Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate, it is actually very cruel.' Bingo Trump just managed to brilliantly flip the 'compassion' narrative on the Democrats, revealing how welcoming mass numbers of unvetted foreigners into our nation is anything but compassionate for American citizens.[167]  The Strange Death of Europe: Multiculturalism and Diversity Prove Destructive[168] Several dozen letters poured into my inbox in the past week from this series. One from Great Britain rendered these sobering words, 'And the faster and greater the dilution of citizenship due to immigration and multiculturalism, the less likely it will be to find anyone with enough courage to speak out, until finally the real truth of this terrible mistake will be lost forever.' As Douglas Murray states in his book, The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam, mass immigration and competing cultures wreak havoc on European culture like a 1-million-pound steel ball smashing into a skyscraper at the base. No matter how strong or tall the building, and no matter how long it soared into the sky\u2014it will collapse. At some point, with enough of the Middle Eastern and African immigrants flooding into Europe, every country will meet its end. It's called exponential growth, and/or, you could address it from the sociological angle, which means European ethos from each country will fall into the quagmire of diversity and multiculturalism.[169]  These Toronto Hotels' Only 'Guests' Are Illegal Migrants \u2014 While Homeless Citizens Camp in the Snow[170] While Toronto's domestic homeless must go to shelters or even sleep under elevated expressways, Justin Trudeau's increasing number of illegal migrants are given the royal treatment at Toronto hotels.[171]  'We Can't Hide Behind Walls': Macron Hails 'World of Mass Migration'[172] 'We are living in a world of mass migration,' Emmanuel Macron has proclaimed, warning citizens not to be 'deceived' by claims Europe could stem the flow, because border walls 'don't work'. At a town hall in the suburbs of Essonne, a migrant-heavy department south of Paris which was hit hard during the 2005 riots, the French president also hinted he was in favour of amnesty for illegal immigrants while answering questions during what was his first urban appearance as part of a 'grand debate'tour. At a town hall in the suburbs of Essonne, a migrant-heavy department south of Paris which was hit hard during the 2005 riots, the French president also hinted he was in favour of amnesty for illegal immigrants while answering questions during what was his first urban appearance as part of a 'grand debate'tour. [Comment: 'Grand Debate'tour \u2014 what a crock. More like a 'Bend Over and Take It' tour. Western nations citizens need to wake up to this treasonous mass migration plan by the globalist puppet leaders. It is an intentional plan to balkanize and disintegrate western nations prior to implementation of a global tyrannical feudal NWO.][173]  Aborted Baby Parts Are Being Grafted on to Mice in Bizarre Scientific Experiments \u2014 and the U.S. Government is Paying for it[174] Is it okay for the U.S. government to pay for scientific experiments involving bizarre mouse/human hybrid creatures that were created by grafting aborted baby parts on to mice? Needless to say, the answer to that question is self-evident. Our tax dollars are being used to fund experiments that are so sickening that it is difficult to find words to describe how evil they are. What you are about to read is deeply unsettling, but we must get the word out about this, because most Americans have no idea that this is happening. And we must do everything in our power to stop this, because there is no future for any nation that engages in this sort of extreme evil. By this point, most people know that Planned Parenthood sells aborted baby parts to the scientific community. But now we have learned that sickening experiments are being performed that involve fusing aborted baby parts on to mice. The following comes from a bombshell report by the Sun ABORTED babies are being used in macabre experiments in the US that involve grafting dead fetus parts onto mice which are then used to test drugs.[175]  Education's Future: Globalization of Indoctrination[176] In the future, children will all be learning from the same script, literally. Parents will become increasingly sidelined as globalized schools take over everything from mental and dental health to sexuality and nutrition. Indeed, even as Americans fought against the nationalization of education via Common Core, the United Nations was globalizing education and pushing its World Core Curriculum. The UN has decreed that it will decide what children learn and what values they should have. UN leaders have boasted that children's behavior, attitudes, beliefs, views, and even 'spirituality' will be shaped by global programs. And incredibly, national governments have gone along with it. If current trends continue, the future of U.S. education is globalization and indoctrination \u2014 on steroids. It has been happening for decades, of course. It accelerated under the Obama administration. But years before Obama was even a candidate, Microsoft boss Bill Gates \u2014 the chief nongovernmental financier of Common Core \u2014 signed a global education partnership with the UN. And it is going to get worse. Instead of actually educating children, government schools in America and all over the world are being transformed into indoctrination centers. Using a century of psychological research, these indoctrination centers are designed to transform children into unthinking cogs in a globalist machine. Many of its architects have boasted of their agenda to weaponize public schools against individualism, Christianity, religion, and more. Now it is under way. True critical thinking is on the way out \u2014 logic, truth, real philosophy, and more have been replaced with emotionalism and post-modernism. Teaching real history is becoming a thing of the past. Legitimate science, too, is going by the wayside, as 'science' lessons increasingly focus on the man-made global-warming hypothesis, false religious doctrines of atheism disguised as science, and sexual perversion. Even reading, writing, and arithmetic \u2014 the 'Three R's' \u2014 are being replaced with social justice, values clarification, and absurd math that confuses even professional mathematicians. It's by design. The real goal behind what is taking place in education is more than just mass-producing uneducated people unable to resist planetary totalitarianism. It is about transforming human society, bringing the world together under a single system, and preparing children not just to accept tyranny \u2014 but to love it and demand it.

The Elk Grove Unified School District (EGUSD) on Tuesday held its final meeting over whether to adopt History and Social Science textbooks which would highlight contributions to history from LGBTQ figures. Parents blasted the textbooks, which would be used as instruction materials for grades K-8, arguing LGBTQ issues shouldn't be taught to children at such a young age. 'I totally support inclusivity,' stated one woman at the meeting, 'however I do not believe it's necessary for 7 and 8-year-olds to be required to learn about bi-sexuality.' Another person accused the school district of corrupting young minds: 'You are raping the innocence of our children.' And another parent asked why knowing the sexual preferences of historical figures should factor into education. 'If they don't need to know what your sexual preferences are, why is this information relevant for them for historical figures?' she asked. EGUSD argues they need to adopt the new textbooks, published by McGraw-Hill, to replace older ones from 2007. Additionally the textbooks will meet requirements put forth in California's SB 48, or Fair Act, which changed the state's Education Code to require 'inclusion of the contributions of various groups in the history of California and the United States,' including from 'lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans.' Despite tense deliberation with parents, the school board unanimously approved the new textbooks, which will be in EGUSD schools in the upcoming fall semester. [Comment: Parents, pull your kids out of government schools.][181]  Planned Parenthood President Attending State of the Union as Pelosi's Guest[182] House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has invited Planned Parenthood's president, Dr. Leana Wen, to attend President Donald Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday night as her guest, Planned Parenthood announced in a press release on Tuesday. Planned Parenthood says Wen's attendance is significant, given Pres. Trump's pro-life policies:'Tonight, we expect President Trump to address abortion and reproductive rights \u2014 no doubt doubling down on the attacks we've seen over the last two years. Dr. Wen's attendance is significant at a time when women's reproductive rights are under constant threat, and is a symbolic reminder that majority of Americans support access to safe and legal abortion.''I am honored to attend the State of the Union as the guest of Speaker Pelosi,' Wen said in a statement. The president of the nation's largest abortion provider added that she's looking forward to working with Pelosi to advance a common agenda: 'Planned Parenthood is proud to have Speaker Pelosi's leadership of a pro-reproductive health House of Representatives. And we look forward to working with her to advance a pro-women, pro-family, and pro-economy agenda that affirms health care as a fundamental human right, and women's rights\u2014and all people's rights\u2014as human rights.'[183]  The Big Switch \u2014 Socialism's Plan[184] Central to political persuasion is the usage of words in modern language, how traditional definitions are subverted until the word means the opposite of the original intent. What is fascinating is how, by the time the word is accepted under its new guise, it is still emotionally connected to its origin. Trigger words for today have long since been undergoing a slow transformation that has actually switched definitions but not the emotional attachment to what it once meant. As twisted as this sounds, it's primary to converting and controlling public opinion. As an ideal illustration of this phenomenon are two words bandied about by media, politicians and pundits: Liberal and Reactionary. We all know how the terms are currently applied, but are we aware of how the careful usage has preserved the emotional response of which word represented good and which was considered bad? Examining modern dictionaries, it's found that the etymology of these words is fairly well ignored. [ ] Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto was a masterpiece of semantics, relabeling the old feudal system with new verbiage to induce the 'masses' to accept their underclass identity, which requires rising up against the status quo to institute the ancient status quo of overseers distributing equal shares of misery and hopelessness by calling it 'wealth.' All of it managed by a regenerated, renamed noble class of legislators in a politburo of meanness (in the archaic 'Lowness of mind; want [lack] of dignity and elevation; want [lack] of honor. Meanness in men incurs contempt. All dishonesty is meanness.' Webster's 1828 Dictionary) that turns on its own. This is what the Enlightenment instigated from the French Revolution through the 21th century demagogues; Godless elevation of men who killed the aristocracy, replacing the class with themselves who then murdered their comrades to consolidate power. Guillotine to firing squad, nothing has changed.[185] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://hinduexistence.org\">http://hinduexistence.org</url>/ [ 2]: #343332 [ 3]: #343364 [ 4]: #343304 [ 5]: #343404

Meanwhile, more than 450 people have been diagnosed with the disease on the cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan. In other news, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbn spoke to President Trump today on the phone about border protection, mass immigration, and other topics of interest to both leaders.

His report, released in May, noted that Chicago saw no increase in violent crime after judges began implementing those reforms by reducing or eliminating monetary bail for many pretrial defendants. Far more of these defendants were released from custody, yet only 'a very small fraction' were charged afterward with a new violent offense, the report states. But a Tribune investigation has found flaws in both the data underlying Evans' report and the techniques he used to analyze it \u2014 issues that minimize the number of defendants charged with murder and other violent crimes after being released from custody under bail reform.[54]  Bloomberg Caught on Tape Saying the Elderly Should be Denied Medical Care Because of Cost Overruns[55] Monday wasn't a good day for Mike Bloomberg. In fact, it was a really, really bad day. Just a few hours after a video began circulating online showing the former NYC mayor and current 2020 presidential candidate suggesting that American farmers and factory workers lacked the IQ of tech workers, a second clip began making the rounds on social media showing Bloomberg saying society should deny medical care to the elderly to keep health care costs from 'bankrupting us.' 'If you're bleeding, we'll stop the bleeding. If you need an x-ray, you're gonna have to wait,' Bloomberg told a Jewish family, explaining his view on how our medical system should work. 'All of these costs keep going up, no one wants to pay any more money,' he continued. 'And at the rate we're going, health care is going to bankrupt us. So not only do we have a problem, it's gonna be [unintelligible] and say which things we're gonna do and which things we're not. No one wants to do that.' 'If you show up with prostate cancer, and you're 95 years old, we should say, 'Go and enjoyLead a long life. There's no cure, we can't do anything.' A young person, we should do something about it. Society's not willing to do that yet.'[56]  Bloomberg Says Many 'Black and Latino Males' Don't 'Know How to Behave in the Workplace, ' in Newly Uncovered 2011 Video[57] While promoting a $127 million, three-year initiative to help minorities in the workplace in 2011, then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg declared that there's 'this enormous cohort of black and Latino males' who 'don't know how to behave in the workplace' and 'don't have any prospects.' The head-turning comments in a resurfaced interview were just the latest headache for the multibillionaire's campaign. In the past week, Bloomberg has been confronted with his previous claims that farming doesn't take much intelligence and that 'anybody' could do it, as well as his insistence that the way to get guns 'out of the kids' hands is to throw them up against the wall and frisk them.' Additionally, Bloomberg has taken heat for suggesting that a functioning health care system must let the elderly die.[58]  Brawl Breaks Out at Bernie Sanders Rally Over 'Black Guns Matter' Shirt[59] A brawl broke out at a Bernie Sanders rally in Colorado on Sunday when a supporter of the Vermont senator confronted another man for wearing a T-shirt that read 'Black Guns Matter,' a report said. The man sporting the shirt, who is black, told CBS Denver that he was recording the presidential hopeful at the Colorado Convention Center when another rally attendee called him 'racist' because of his shirt. 'He had a problem with the shirt I was wearing,' the man, who was not identified, told the news station.[60]  Don't Look Now, But There Was a Huge Second-Amendment Victory in Virginia Today[61] Take that, Mini Mike. Former New York City mayor, former Republican, current presidential candidate, and never a fan of the Bill of Rights, Mike Bloomberg just saw part of his gun-control agenda suffer a major misfire in Virginia this morning.[62]  It's Looking More and More Like Nevada Will be Another Democratic Clusterfark[63] With less than a week to go before the Nevada caucuses, it's looking like the Democrats will have another wholesale disaster on their hands \u2014 and for the same reasons they screwed up in Iowa. Politico: In interviews, three caucus volunteers described serious concerns about rushed preparations for the Feb. 22 election, including insufficient training for a newly-adopted electronic vote-tally system and confusing instructions on how to administer the caucuses. There are also unanswered questions about the security of Internet connections at some 2,000 precinct sites that will transmit results to a central 'war room' set up by the Nevada Democratic Party.[64]  'Obama Personally Asked the FBI to Investigate Someone on Behalf of George Soros,' Says Alan Dershowitz[65] In an interview with Breitbart News, Alan Dershowitz claimed he is in possession of documents that will show Barack Obama asked the FBI to investigate an unnamed person on behalf of George Soros. Those documents, he says, will come out during a lawsuit that will be filed in the future. Dershowitz said the only difference between Trump and other presidents influencing the Department of Justice is that Trump is open about it while the others 'whispered.'[66]  Orban in Phone Talks With Trump[67] Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Monday had talks with US President Donald Trump by phone, the PM's press chief told MTI. Orban and Trump discussed foreign policy issues such as the importance of combatting illegal migration and border protection, Bertalan Havasi said. The two leaders also touched on the situation in the Middle East, he said, adding that Trump had asked Orban to relay his appreciation to the 'successful and great Hungarian people'.[68]  Trump Continues to Troll Democrats by Holding Nevada Rally a Day Before Caucuses[69] Donald Trump has been shadowing Democrats as they begin the cross country trek of primaries and caucuses to choose his challenger. He has shown up a day or two before the Democratic nominating contests, teasing, mocking, and humiliating his potential opponents. In both Iowa and New Hampshire, Trump's awesome digital ground game revved up the GOP turnout machine that is now putting the fear of god \u2014 or Trump \u2014 into Democratic candidates. Trump is smashing the vote total records of both Obama and Bush, proving he is light years ahead of the Democratic Party. His campaign's digital prowess is, to coin a phrase, 'yuuuuge.'[70]  CN Rail Forced to Lay Off Employees as Anti-Pipeline Protests Continue[71] On Thursday, an announcement was made by CN Rail that it is ceasing operations of its whole network east of Toronto due to ongoing pipeline protests close to Belleville, Ont. Eastern Canada staff are now being laid off as a result according to CBC News.

A citizen's arrest is an arrest made not by a law officer but by a citizen who derives authority from the fact of being a citizen. 'Reconciliation is dead. The events of the past week on Wet'suwet'en territories have been an extreme demonstration of colonial violence, approved by the Trudeau and Horgan governments in contravention of Wet'suwet'en, Canadian and international law,' Extinction Rebellion Vancouver Island wrote in a media advisory. 'Extinction Rebellion Vancouver Island (XRVI) will undertake a peaceful lockdown and execute a citizen's arrest to disrupt the BC government budget speech on Tuesday, which will fund further injury to the Wet'suwet'en Hereditary Chiefs and peoples. Citizens are empowered by a duty to act, and prevent a greater indictable harm; therefore XRVI will be undertaking a lockdown and citizens arrest to prevent further genocidal 'crimes against humanity' toward the Wet'suwet'en Hereditary Chiefs and peoples (under S.C. statute 2000, c. 24).'[74]  Thousand Islands Bridge Reopens After Anti-Pipeline Protests[75] The Thousand Islands Bridge, which had been closed down due to a blockade from people protesting the Coastal GasLink pipeline, has been reopened.

Garneau appeared on CBC's Power and Politics on Monday, explaining the situation 'I have with concerns with respect to safety here. There have been instances with the railroads where people have climbed on railway cars, that happened over the weekend. There have been instances where unexpected blockade was put in an area where a train was, in fact, operating and the railway company was not aware of that, and that can be extremely dangerous,' said Garneau.[78]  200,000 Brits Ditch BBC TV Tax in One Year: Report[79] Nearly 200,000 Britons have cancelled their television licence in one year, a report has revealed, while several Tories have called on Downing Street to stop its 'vendetta' against the BBC by proposing that the broadcaster earn its own money.

Late last Friday evening, 17-year-old Marcus Aroli, a Dane, was with his sister at Tstrup train station in western Copenhagen when they decided to take a train to Albertslund station to buy a soda at the 7/11 since there's no shop of this kind in Tstrup, Norwegian news site Document.no reports.[86]  Eurocrats 'Fighting Like Ferrets in a Sack' Over Brexit Budget Hole[87] European leaders are said to be 'fighting like ferrets in a sack' over how to fill the \u20ac12 billion annual hole left by the UK's exit from the EU. When the UK left the EU on January 31st, the bloc was faced with the multi-billion pound budgetary black hole and will have to look elsewhere to fill it. The bloc's other rich countries, like Denmark and the Netherlands, will likely have to fill the gaps whilst Brussels makes cutbacks to the subsidies of its poorer member states.[88]  Extinction Rebellion Targets Commodity Traders in Geneva[89] (Bloomberg) \u2014 Scores of climate change protesters from a Swiss branch of the Extinction Rebellion campaign group staged protests against commodity houses in Geneva, occupying the office of Vitol Group, the biggest independent oil trader. About 50 protesters breached the offices of Vitol near the Hotel des Bergues in Geneva on Monday, where they used tape to create human outlines on the ground resembling a murder scene. The actions show that disruptive climate activists are now looking beyond crude producers and to the role of commodity traders in buying, transporting, storing and selling fossil fuels. Vitol handles more than 7 million barrels of oil a day and Switzerland is a hub for the industry, with more than 500 firms based there.[90]  German Engineer Leaves \u20ac7 Million Fortune to Nationalist Populist AfD Party[91] A German engineer has bequeathed his \u20ac7 million fortune, including gold and property, to the national populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in his will, Deutsche Welle reports.

One of them is said to have been forced into quarantine protocols by the government, but who knows (via NYT).[130]  WHO Holds Secret Talks With Tech Giants to Stop Spread of Coronavirus 'Misinformation'[131] The World Health Organization has held talks with tech giants to stop the spread of coronavirus 'misinformation,' despite the fact that some things once labeled 'misinformation' have since turned out to be true.

At this point, more than 60 percent of all Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and a whopping 24 percent of the country has more credit card debt than emergency savings. One of the primary principles that any of these 'financial experts' that you see on television will teach you is to have a cushion to fall back on. At the very least, you never know when unexpected expenses like major car repairs or medical bills will come along. And in the event of a major economic collapse, if you do not have any financial cushion at all you will be a sitting duck. Yes, I know that there are millions upon millions of families out there that are just trying to scrape by from month to month at this point. I hear from people that are deeply struggling in this economy all the time. So I don't blame them for not being able to save lots of money. But if you are in a position to build up an emergency fund, you need to do so. We have been experiencing an extended period of relative economic stability, but it will not last. In fact, the time for getting prepared for the next great economic downturn is rapidly running out, and most Americans are not ready for it at all. The following are 14 signs that most Americans are flat broke and totally unprepared for the coming economic crisis:&lt;nl/&gt; #1 According to a survey that was just released, 24 percent of all Americans have more credit card debt than emergency savings.&lt;nl/&gt; #2 That same survey discovered that an additional 13 percent of all Americans do not have any credit card debt, but they do not have a single penny of emergency savings either.&lt;nl/&gt; #3 At this point, approximately 62 percent of all Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; ECB SaysGreece's Reform List a 'Valid Starting Point'[132]&lt;nl/&gt; The European Central Bank said Tuesday the reforms drawn up by Greece in return for a bailout extension were a 'valid starting point' for talks, but that they differed in a number of areas from the existing programme.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Eurozone Agrees on Greek Bailout Extension[133]&lt;nl/&gt; Spiegel reported on Tuesday that Eurozone finance ministers had agreed the details of a financial aid programme for Greece in a conference call.&lt;nl/&gt; The ministers have been discussing a proposal from Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis since 1pm.&lt;nl/&gt; Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said earlier on Tuesday that he was 'cautiously optimistic that on Friday and today we have moved, step by step, towards a solution to the conflict,' Gabriel said.&lt;nl/&gt; Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem had said that the call would only go ahead if the EU, European Central Bank (ECB) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) judged the reforms went far enough.&lt;nl/&gt; 'I think they are very serious' about the reforms, Dijsselbloem said, before adding that 'it is not going to be easy. This is just a first step.'&lt;nl/&gt; And In Berlin, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble asked the Bundestag (German parliament) to schedule time for a vote on the hoped-for deal.&lt;nl/&gt; Germany's ruling coalition between Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Social Democratic Party (SPD), led by Gabriel, are due to have a high-level meeting to discuss the proposal on Tuesday evening.&lt;nl/&gt; Eurozone finance ministers hope that the deal will allow Greece to avoid bankruptcy and reassure its creditors, who have already bailed the country out to the tune of \u20ac240 billion plus a debt writedown of \u20ac100 billion.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Germany: Strong Economy Makes for \u20ac18-Billion Surplus[134]&lt;nl/&gt; Germany's public finances were back in the black in 2014, as growth in Europe's biggest economy shifted up a gear at the end of the year, official data showed Tuesday.&lt;nl/&gt; A group of people from Bangladesh, Nigeria and Syria sustained injuries after a van they were driving in overturned and crashed into a field on Tuesday morning, close to a small southern city of Leskovac.

With Athens and Brussels still at odds, such an eventuality seems more realistic than ever. But how disruptive would a Grexit really be?&lt;nl/&gt; In the final analysis, leaving the euro zone would be an almost incalculable economic risk for Greece, but one which could pay political dividends. The reverse is true for the euro zone. As such, it is hardly surprising that cracks have become apparent in the Greek facade in recent weeks. Greek Finance Minister Varoufakis, for example, has made several concessions to his European counterparts only to see his prime minister withdraw them again.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; The Invisible Chains of Debt Slavery: 'Americans Are More Dependent Than Ever Before'[139]&lt;nl/&gt; Editor's Note: Are we slaves today? Or are we free men? The question might sound insulting on many fronts: of course we're not slaves \u2014 we make our own choices on the free market as to what to eat, what to wear, where to go, what to do for fun and the like. Moreover, comparing our current condition, even if not ideal, to the slavery of days past when people were put in chains and treated as subhuman seems insulting to those who endured it.&lt;nl/&gt; But for those brave enough to face the question, perhaps you have realized that this era is one of economic bondage, of slavery primarily through financial means. Just as many serfs and indentured servants were, we are free to move about, but yet we are not free. With mountains of debt saddled on the vast majority of us, and a long chain of taxes and conditions blocking anyone from true ownership and true prosperity, we dare not call ourselves free in our true heart of hearts. There is something better, and we know it. Those who read this blog know that we are being controlled and manipulated through our financial system, our fiat currency and the invisible chains of debt. Until we address these factors, only a few can truly call themselves free:&lt;nl/&gt; Most Americans Are Slaves And They Don't Even Know It&lt;nl/&gt; Most Americans spend their lives working for others, paying off debts to others and performing tasks that others tell them that they 'must' do. These days, we don't like to think of ourselves as 'servants' or 'slaves', but that is what the vast majority of us are. It is just that the mechanisms of our enslavement have become much more sophisticated over time. It has been said that the borrower is the servant of the lender, and most of us start going into debt very early into our adult years. In fact, those that go to college to 'get an education' are likely to enter the 'real world' with a staggering amount of debt. And of course that is just the beginning of the debt accumulation. Today, when you add up all mortgage debt, all credit card debt and all student loan debt, the average American household is carrying a grand total of 203,163 dollars of debt.&lt;nl/&gt; [Comment: Not just Americans \u2014 every country that has a private central bank. The country goes into debt and pays the private groups that own this bank interest payments. But the debt never gets cleared \u2014 it always grows. Result: hidden slavery. Take a look at Libya \u2014 when Libya was in total chaos what was one of the first things done? The creation of a central bank owned by private groups.]&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Throw Your Grandma Under the Bus[140]&lt;nl/&gt; Merkel and Sch\u00e4uble decided to save Wall Street mogul and derivatives behemoth Deutsche Bank at the cost of the Greek people. Not for economic reasons, but because Deutsche has much more political power inside the European Union than the entire Greek nation. Now you know what's so inherently wrong in that union. Same story for France, where BNP, SocGen and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole had humongous amounts of debt outstanding in Athens. Where's all that debt now, where's it gone? Well, check your wallet.&lt;nl/&gt; When the decision came to throw either their own biggest banks, or the grandmas of a co-member nation of the currency union under the bus, I don't think they even hesitated; they probably only went looking for the most efficient way to do it. And they have control over the perfect vehicle for such tasks: the ECB. A allegedly neutral institution that in reality peddles political influence in a way that guarantees the poorer countries will always wind up footing the bill.&lt;nl/&gt; And now that the systemic risk that Greece still might have been is effectively gone, and the debt has been transferred to the union's bottom dwellers, Merkel and Sch\u00e4uble can talk tough to Greece. Even if it wasn't the Greeks that created this mess, it was Merkel and the Frankfurt bank CEO's she confers with on a daily basis.&lt;nl/&gt; Banks are more important than people, certainly grandmas. That's true on Wall Street, and it's true all over Europe. But it's still just a political decision. And one that could be reversed as easily as it was taken. Which it what the paymasters find so scary about Syriza.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; 'Non-GMO is More Profitable.'[141]&lt;nl/&gt; This is the rising sentiment among farmers of the US as a confluence of factors urges them to become pro-organic. From falling GMO grain prices to a rising tide of public distrust of genetically modified ingredients, failing GMO traits, higher GMO seed prices, and the premium prices that people willingly pay for quality food over toxic junk, the conventional farmer is changing his tune when it comes to Big Ag practices.&lt;nl/&gt; Even if profit is the cornerstone on which this change is based, it is still telling. After all, experts project over $35 billion in sales for organic, non-GMO foods in 2015, and as GMO corn, soy and other GM grain prices rise, along with the costs to grow them (associated with more pesticide and herbicide use to control super weeds, for example) farmers are looking past the GMO propaganda which promised higher yields and more cash for farmers who grew their poison crops.&lt;nl/&gt; This phenomenon is explained clearly in 'The Genetic Engineering of Food and the Failure of Science' (full text available for download here) published in The International Journal of Sociology of Agriculture and Food\u2026&lt;nl/&gt; Other farmers are considering the switch because they are tired of super-weeds. One corn breeder who preferred to remain anonymous for a recent interview stated:&lt;nl/&gt; 'The insect and herbicide traits are losing effectiveness with increased resistant rootworm and weed species. Growers are tired of paying for input costs that are reduced in efficacy and funding additional forms of crop protection.'&lt;nl/&gt; Iowa State University weed specialist Bob Hartzler seconds that sentiment in an interview with Iowa Farmer Today.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; 75% of Air and Rain Samples Contain Monsanto's Round Up[142]&lt;nl/&gt; A new study proves just how invasive Monsanto's best selling chemicals are, revealing how herbicide toxins are appearing in 75% of rain and air samples.&lt;nl/&gt; Take a deep breath. Thanks to the massive use of herbicides across the planet, you likely just inhaled a dose of Monsanto's best-selling herbicide, Round Up; at least according to the latest US Geological Survey published in the journal Enviromental Toxicology and Chemistry.&lt;nl/&gt; The chemical ingredient used in Round Up, known as glyphosate, as well as other 'inert' toxic chemicals, were found in over 75% of the air and rain samples tested from Mississippi in 2007, a large river that cuts through the middle of the US, and is the basin in which hundreds of farms' runoff drains. An evaluation of numerous pesticides currently used were measured through water and air samples collected from 1995 to 2007 during growing season along the MississippiDelta agricultural region.

Pembroke, Virginia, was not one of them, until now.&lt;nl/&gt; CSX Corp is temporarily rerouting up to five oil trains through this small riverside town to bypass the site of an explosive oil train derailment that occurred 90 miles north in Mount Carbon, West Virginia, on Monday. The trains will likely travel instead on a track that hugs the New River and at one point sweeps into the Pembroke town limits.&lt;nl/&gt; In line with a federal protocol established last year following a string of fiery derailments across North America, the Virginia Department of Emergency Management on Tuesday informed 16 counties and cities that oil trains could be coming through their towns, local officials and fire departments said, one day after the Mount Carbon derailment. Those counties passed the information on to local emergency responders.&lt;nl/&gt; 'They sent us information and gave us an emergency response guide sheet,' said Chris Neice, Pembroke's fire chief.&lt;nl/&gt; CSX has notified the state that as many as five trains, each carrying between about 24,000 and 70,000 barrels of oil, will be rerouted, according to Jeff Stern, state coordinator at the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. The trains will run along a Norfolk Southern line that normally transports coal and freight, not oil, until the main route is restored.&lt;nl/&gt; That this is happening with little fanfare in Pembroke and potentially hundreds of other cities and towns along this track stretching as far as Ohio, highlights how ubiquitous oil trains have become in the United States, where crude-by-rail is an essential, yet sometimes explosive, fix for an overwhelmed pipeline network.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; At New York Private Schools, Challenging White Privilege From the Inside[144]&lt;nl/&gt; On a recent morning, 20 or so high school students, most of them white, milled about the meetinghouse at Friends Seminary, a private school in Manhattan.

A sophomore in jeans and a gray hoodie who identifies as Asian-American was seeking to unload 'minority.'

Under the rules of the exercise, no other student was obligated to accept it.&lt;nl/&gt; 'It's just a very strong word to use,' the last girl said.

The group also says it seeks to encourage university administrators to withdraw privileges from the groups that spread hate on the campuses.&lt;nl/&gt; According to the Center, Columbia University is listed first because it is home to the 'most well-known antisemitic professors in the nation such as Rashid Khalidi and Joseph Massad, who has been accused of harassing Jewish students on multiple occasions. In addition, it is home to a highly active SJP chapter that has recently brought BDS founder Omar Barghouti and disgraced antisemitic professor Steven Salaita to campus.'&lt;nl/&gt; The Center also cited a number of offending events held at Columbia University in 2014, such as Israeli Apartheid Week and a protest with signs that read 'Call to Action: Stand with Gaza.'\u2026&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Comcast, Al Sharpton Hit With $20 Billion Racial Discrimination Lawsuit[149]&lt;nl/&gt; Even though the FCC hasn't yet ruled on the proposed merger between Comcast and Time Warner Cable, one group has already filed a lawsuit claiming at least $20 billion in damages from the way the two giants allegedly discriminate against black-owned media.&lt;nl/&gt; The complaint, filed in California on Friday, comes from the National Association of African-American Owned Media, which also filed a similar suit against AT...nd DirecTV in December.&lt;nl/&gt; This time, the plaintiff is not only targeting both Comcast and TWC \u2014 on the eve of the two companies merging to become what would be the largest pay television distributor in the United States \u2014 but also various African-American advocacy groups and MSNBC host Al Sharpton for allegedly facilitating discrimination.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; DOJ Announces it Will Not File Charges Against Zimmerman in Martin Shooting[150]&lt;nl/&gt; The Justice Department announced Tuesday it will not file federal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman, the Florida man who was acquitted last year of second-degree murder for shooting Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager.&lt;nl/&gt; 'Though a comprehensive investigation found that the high standard for a federal hate crime prosecution cannot be met under the circumstances here, this young man's premature death necessitates that we continue the dialogue and be unafraid of confronting the issues and tensions his passing brought to the surface,' Attorney General Eric Holder said in written statement.

In his first official trip here, the relatively unknown candidate was greeted by shouts of 'Mr. President!' Technology executives feted him at their mansions. Local papers described the buzz as 'deafening.' Obama would go on to raise more than $38 million in San Francisco and Silicon Valley.&lt;nl/&gt; Fast-forward eight years: As Hillary Rodham Clinton prepares to enter the 2016 presidential campaign as an overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination, she is viewed here more as respected establishment than exciting start-up. She is not seen as the kind of transformational candidate that Obama was, particularly within the technology community.&lt;nl/&gt; 'I don't hear a lot of, 'Oh, boy, Hillary is going to fix all these problems we have as a country,'?' said Jim Greer, founder of Kongregate, a Web and mobile gaming platform. 'I don't think there's a Silicon Valley candidate in this race yet.'&lt;nl/&gt; Even so, Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, have been busy cultivating personal relationships with many of tech's boldface names.&lt;nl/&gt; [\u2026]&lt;nl/&gt; In the years since, Silicon Valley has experienced explosive growth in wealth, minting scores of new millionaires and billionaires who could be tapped for large donations to Clinton's campaign and an alliance of independent groups poised to back her bid.&lt;nl/&gt; [\u2026]&lt;nl/&gt; To win them over, however, Clinton will have to navigate a thorny issue that has soured the relationship between Obama and many longtime Silicon Valley allies: his administration's national security surveillance practices.

He spent millions of dollars to seal his high school records, his college records, his passport and more. No one steps forth to talk about any high school or college classrooms he shared with them. He's a ghost on the American landscape, but he's in charge of leading our country.&lt;nl/&gt; We know that he wrote a book, Audacity of Hope, where on page 261, he said, 'I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.'&lt;nl/&gt; That single statement illustrates his deepest Islamic religious cognitive choices that violate every single aspect of the American Way of Life and our Constitution.

It's commonly used in an array of rifles sold at local sporting goods store.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; NSA: Snowden Leaks Hurt Ability to Track Terrorists[161]&lt;nl/&gt; Washington (CNN) The head of the National Security Agency expressed deep concerns about terrorists' ability to avoid NSA surveillance, explaining that Edward Snowden's revelations of surveillance techniques and capabilities have had a 'material impact' on NSA ability to prevent and detect terror plots.&lt;nl/&gt; 'I would say that it has had a material impact in our ability to generate insights as to what counterterrorism, what terrorist groups around the world are doing,' Adm. Michael Rogers told a group gathered in Washington for a cybersecurity summit hosted by the New America think tank.&lt;nl/&gt; 'Do you have new blind spots that you didn't have prior to the revelation,' moderator and CNN National Security correspondent Jim Sciutto asked.&lt;nl/&gt; 'Have I lost capability that we had prior to the revelations? Yes,' Rogers responded. 'Anyone who thinks this has not had an impact I would say doesn't know what they're talking about.'&lt;nl/&gt; Snowden himself remains free in Russia. A film about him won an Academy Award on Sunday evening.&lt;nl/&gt; ['Free in Russia' may be an oxymoron for that country's citizens, but doubtless its grateful intelligence organs are seeing to wee Eddie's every need. \u2014 PW]&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Obama: Religious Acceptance Key to Combating Extremism[162]&lt;nl/&gt; President Barack Obama told world leaders on Thursday that promoting democracy and acceptance of people of all faiths are essential to stopping the spread of violent extremism.&lt;nl/&gt; 'Groups like al Qaeda and (ISIS) peddle the lie that some of our countries are hostile to Muslims. Meanwhile we've also seen, most recently in Europe, arise inexcusable acts of anti-Semitism, or in some cases anti-Muslim sentiment, or anti-immigrant sentiment,' Obama said at the closing session of a White House summit on combating extremism. 'When people spew hatred towards others \u2014 because of their faith or because they're immigrants \u2014 it feeds into terrorist narratives.'&lt;nl/&gt; The president's remarks come as anti-Muslim sentiment is on the rise in Europe following terror attacks in Paris and Copenhagen.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Obama: Islam 'Woven Into the Fabric of Our Country Since Founding'[163]&lt;nl/&gt; In his bloviating speech on Thursday at his summit on countering violent extremism, President Obama bent over backwards to make nice with Islam. Not only were terrorists not Muslim, President Obama stated, but Islam played a crucial role in America's founding.&lt;nl/&gt; 'Here in America,' Obama stated, 'Islam has been woven into the fabric of our country since its founding.'&lt;nl/&gt; Obama seems significantly more comfortable with this characterization of the historic role of Islam than he is with the non-fictional actual historic role of Christianity and Judaism in the American founding.&lt;nl/&gt; After all, this is the same man who stated in 2006, 'Whatever we once were, we are no longer a Christian nation \u2014 at least, not just. We are also a Jewish nation, a Muslim nation, a Buddhist nation, and a Hindu nation, and a nation of nonbelievers.'&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Obama Vetoes Keystone Pipeline Bill[164]&lt;nl/&gt; The White House has notified the Senate that President Obama has vetoed legislation authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline.&lt;nl/&gt; President Obama, who for six years signed almost every bill that landed on his desk, is preparing to open a new phase of his presidency \u2014 the veto \u2014 as Congress on Tuesday sent him legislation authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline.&lt;nl/&gt; The Senate sent the bill to Obama on Tuesday morning.&lt;nl/&gt; To date, Obama has issued just two vetoes, fewer than any U.S. president since the 19th century. By contrast, in just one term, President George H.W. Bush issued 44.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Obama's Extremism Summit Promoted Big Government Extremism[165]&lt;nl/&gt; With the Obama administration's controversial 'extremism' summit now over, critics from across the political spectrum are outraged. Muslims and Islamic organizations are crying foul because, they say, the gathering focused too much on jihad and Islamic extremism. Anti-jihad groups are outraged because the summit supposedly did not focus enough on Islamic extremism \u2014 even to the point of avoiding the term entirely \u2014 and because a Muslim Brotherhood-linked figure was selected as Obama's new 'extremism' propaganda czar. Christians were outraged, too, partly because of the half-baked comments by embattled State Department spokesperson Marie 'jobs-for-jihadists' Harf. After being mercilessly ridiculed for suggesting ISIS members needed jobs, Harf claimed that imaginary 'Christian' extremists were also a serious threat.&lt;nl/&gt; In the end, though, few media reports or analysts focused on the fact that Obama's extremism summit ended up promoting all sorts of anti-Constitution and Big Government extremism \u2014 much of it to be imposed at the international level, all of it under the guise of fighting nebulous notions of non-Islamic extremism. Officially dubbed the Summit on Countering Violent Extremism, last week's gathering was an extravaganza for pushing radically increased government power, centralization of power at the federal and global levels, government propaganda, and numerous other extremist schemes. Some analysts even described Obama's summit as a bizarre convergence of the extreme Left and extremist Islam to push common goals: Big Government, less liberty, more wealth redistribution, blurring the lines between church and state by having government 'train' and fund 'religious leaders,' and open attacks on traditional American ideals.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Palestinian Groups Ordered to Pay $218.5 Million to Victims of Attacks[166]&lt;nl/&gt; A US jury ordered the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority (PA) on Monday to pay $218.5 million for supporting deadly terrorist attacks in the Jerusalem area more than a decade ago.&lt;nl/&gt; Victims and their families had requested more than $350 million for a series of shootings and bombings from 2002 to 2004 that killed 33 people and injured more than 450 others.&lt;nl/&gt; 'Now the PLO and the PA know there is a price for supporting terrorism,' said Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in an interview after the verdict.&lt;nl/&gt; Both Palestinian groups said they will appeal the ruling, and it is unclear whether victims would ever be able to collect.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Secret TSA Program Quizzes Travelers Returning to U.S.[167]&lt;nl/&gt; Activist Jonathan Corbett has lifted the lid on a chilling and hitherto secret TSA program which mandates that airlines operating outside of the U.S. conduct invasive security interviews of travelers before allowing them to return to America.&lt;nl/&gt; Corbett uncovered the program after he was asked a number of personal questions before being allowed to board an American Airlines flight from London Heathrow to New York in December, including why he was traveling and how long he had been away. Corbett initially refused to answer before a second agent made it clear that he would be stranded if he didn't comply. After Corbett answered the questions, a security sticker was placed on his passport indicating he had completed the interview.&lt;nl/&gt; The procedure is very similar to the TSA's domestic SPOT program, which was slammed as a $900 million dollar waste of money by a Government Accountability Office investigation in 2013 after it failed to identify a single terrorist.&lt;nl/&gt; Corbett wrote to American Airlines, who told him that the program was under the control of the DHS/TSA and that details were unavailable due to being under a 'Sensitive Security Information' (SSI) designation.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Sim Card Producer Denies Any Real Risk From NSA Hacking Its Encryption Keys[168]&lt;nl/&gt; Apparently, execs at Gemalto went to the same crisis management training program as the top execs at Lenovo. As you probably recall, last week The Intercept revealed that the NSA and GCHQ had hacked into the systems at Gemalto, the world's largest maker of SIM cards for mobile phones, in order to get access to their encryption keys. This is a pretty massive security breach, allowing these intelligence agencies to decrypt calls that people thought were encrypted. But Gemalto insists its SIM cards are perfectly secure:&lt;nl/&gt; Initial conclusions already indicate that Gemalto SIM products (as well as banking cards, passports and other products and platforms) are secure and the Company doesn't expect to endure a significant financial prejudice.&lt;nl/&gt; This sounds an awful lot like Lenovo's initial reaction to the reports about the Superfish/Komodia vulnerability it shoved onto many of its customers computers, saying (totally incorrectly):&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Solving the Bad Cop Problem (And Creating Jobs)[169]&lt;nl/&gt; There are too many bad, violent or mentally jacked-up cops roaming around. Worse, expecting the people who hire them to supervise them properly has apparently become too much to ask. So what to do? I have a bold idea.&lt;nl/&gt; States should pass laws requiring the termination of any law enforcement employee who through their actions generates civil liability upon the state. Correspondingly, cops should pay for malpractice insurance like lawyers and doctors.&lt;nl/&gt; Essentially, a law would need to be passed along the lines of:&lt;nl/&gt; Any law enforcement official within the State of Broke who through their actions as a law enforcement official causes a state, county, or municipal agency to be liable upon a judgement in an amount in excess of $15,000.00 (or $X) shall be have their employment as a law enforcement official within the state terminated not in good standing (NO PENSION). Judgments or liabilities paid by insurance shall not apply to this statute.&lt;nl/&gt; Boom\u2026.Problem fixed! Zany? Impossible? Allow me to explain how it would work and how it could be done even without your state's defunct legislature taking action. Fear not, I am not insulting your state: I live in Florida. Your legislature like mine is probably useless. However, almost every state has a mechanism which allows citizens to place laws on the ballot via petition drives\u2026if all those marijuana proposals can get there, so can this.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; The Mysterious 'Frank' Returns[170]&lt;nl/&gt; Giuliani's public identification of Davis and discussion of his role in grooming a young Barack Obama marks the first time, in my memory, that a top Republican has ever mentioned the Davis-Obama relationship. It was done in the context of Fox News'Megyn Kelly of questioning how Giuliani could dare ask whether Obama loves America.&lt;nl/&gt; If the Republicans had brought this up during the 2008 campaign, Obama might have been defeated and the country could have been spared the last six years of 'progressive' hope and change. The Davis-Obama relationship is something so damaging and corrupt that its public airing would have raised questions about the Democratic Party's vetting of Obama and the direction of the Democratic Party itself.&lt;nl/&gt; However, Republican operative Karl Rove was warning Republicans not to accuse Obama of being a socialist. He said such a charge would generate a negative backlash. The result in 2012 was another Obama victory.&lt;nl/&gt; Now that it has become apparent to more and more people that Obama is not a traditional liberal Democrat and is, in fact, a Marxist with Muslim sympathies, a figure such as Giuliani feels compelled to speak out. So let's take a look at what Giuliani said.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; The Plan to Find Alien Life in Europa's Icy Seas[171]&lt;nl/&gt; How do you solve a problem like Europa? The icy moon of Jupiter is thought to host a vast ocean beneath its frozen crust, making it an ideal target to look for life beyond Earth. But the tiny world also has a perfect storm of problems \u2014 a poorly mapped surface, a space environment full of powerful radiation, geysers that may or may not exist \u2014 that make designing such a mission tricky.&lt;nl/&gt; Last week, more than 200 scientists and engineers met at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, to chart a course for detecting life in Europa's seas. This isn't mere wishful thinking: NASA's 2016 budget gave a dedicated mission to the icy moon the green light, with a launch date for the probe by the mid-2020s.&lt;nl/&gt; 'We're going to do a Europa mission,' NASA science administrator John Grunsfeld told the meeting.

Thursday marks three years to the day since Martin was killed.&lt;nl/&gt; Federal prosecutors concluded there is not sufficient evidence to prove Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Fla., intentionally violated Martin's civil rights, sources told ABC News.&lt;nl/&gt; The case sparked intense discussions over race in America because Martin was walking to his home with only Skittles and an iced tea in his hands.&lt;nl/&gt; [The hands of an MMA-inspired brawler who used them to 'ground and pound' Zimmerman and apply blunt force trauma to his head by smashing it on a concrete sidewalk.

The other two have pled guilty to conspiracy and cooperated with prosecutors. They are scheduled for sentencing on March 16.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Vaccine Propaganda[174]&lt;nl/&gt; It never ceases to amaze me how lies and manipulation keep the pro vaccine circus going! The mainstream media falsely reports that the whooping cough outbreaks and measles are due to the increasing exemption use for public school attendance. Not only is this claim false and designed to inflate anger between those who vaccinate and those who selectively do not, is it causing discrimination against the unvaccinated population. Further discrimination, pediatricians are instructed to refuse care to those who refuse to vaccinate or selectively vaccinate and now employers are forcing yearly vaccines for their employees or they are threatened with termination. The false reporting is causing confusion and fear among people and wrongly directing our public servants to enforce mandated vaccines.&lt;nl/&gt; There is alarming evidence that the use of vaccines does not equate immunity and that vaccines fail to protect. Outbreaks have been documented in highly vaccinated populations for measles, mumps, influenza and pertussis across the country the last twenty years but the medical establishment and our news media fail to mention this. Today, I will defend the unvaccinated position concerning the whooping cough, (pertussis) outbreaks and the measles vaccine failure.&lt;nl/&gt; In my opinion, this controversy is a perfect example propaganda and indoctrination. Indoctrination is the representation of one point of view \u2014 the process is often distinguished from education by the fact that the indoctrinated person is expected not to question or critically examine the doctrine they have learned.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Victory: Hershey to Remove GMO Ingredients From Milk Chocolate[175]&lt;nl/&gt; Joining the lineup of companies that are kneeling to public pressure, candy-maker Hershey has recently announced that it will soon remove genetically modified ingredients from its milk chocolate and Kisses by the end of 2015. What's more, the company is pledging to shift to 'simple ingredients,' which will exemplified by the removal of emulsifier polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) and artificial vanillin.&lt;nl/&gt; Coming straight from Hershey's website:&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Video: 'Barbaric' Sheriff's Deputy Drags Woman Through Courthouse by Shackled Feet[176]&lt;nl/&gt; A shocking video has emerged of a Florida deputy dragging a mentally disturbed defendant around a public Courthouse, pulling forcefully on the chain of the cuffs he had placed around her ankles.&lt;nl/&gt; An investigation is underway after the incident was captured on video by Attorney Bill Gelin. The video shows Broward County Deputy Christopher Johnson pulling a shackled 28-year-old Dasyl Jeanette Rios along a hallway as she screams in pain.&lt;nl/&gt; WSVN News reports that Rios had just been declared mentally incompetent by the court in a felony trespassing case. The situation flared up when Rios was refused to be allowed to say goodbye to her mother after the ruling. She refused to cooperate with officer Johnson, who then began dragging her through the courthouse by the shackles on her feet.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Wanted: An Internet to Call Our Own[177]&lt;nl/&gt; In short, Obama is cutting off access to the Net for little people, but leaving it wide open for his government, opportunistic governments like his own and Islamic terrorists who use it for recruiting, and sending out grisly YouTubes celebrating the deaths of their hostages.&lt;nl/&gt; All things pass, but the Selfies of the rich and powerful are forever.&lt;nl/&gt; Start bracing yourself now for Thursday, Feb. 26, 2015 and you can mark it on your calendar as 'The Day Online Communication Died'.&lt;nl/&gt; Once the dastardly deed passes into 'law', Obama will have plunged the world of communication into inky darkness.

She was well-equipped to succeed too: An ambitious math and science wiz, she could code faster, with fewer errors, than anyone she knew.&lt;nl/&gt; In 2011, after 15 years, she left before achieving a management position.&lt;nl/&gt; Garann Means became a programmer for similar reasons. After 13 years, she quit too, citing a hostile and unwelcoming environment for women.&lt;nl/&gt; Neither expects to ever go back.&lt;nl/&gt; 'There are a lot of things that piled up over the years,' Means said. 'I didn't know how to move forward. There was a lot I had to put up with in the culture of tech. It just didn't seem worth it.'&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;It's a really frustrating thing. The pipeline may not improve much unless women can look ahead and see it's a valuable investment.&lt;nl/&gt; - Laura Sherbin, director of research at the Center for Talent Innovation&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;That's a huge problem for the tech economy. According to the industry group Code.org, computing jobs will more than double by 2020, to 1.4 million. If women continue to leave the field, an already dire shortage of qualified tech workers will grow worse. Last summer, Google, Facebook, Apple and other big tech companies released figures showing that men outnumbered women 4 to 1 or more in their technical sectors.&lt;nl/&gt; It's why the industry is so eager to hire women and minorities. For decades tech companies have relied on a workforce of whites and Asians, most of them men.&lt;nl/&gt; Plenty of programs now encourage girls and minorities to embrace technology at a young age. But amid all the publicity for those efforts, one truth is little discussed: Qualified women are leaving the tech industry in droves.&lt;nl/&gt; Women in tech say filling the pipeline of talent won't do much good if women keep quitting \u2014 it's like trying to fill a leaking bucket.&lt;nl/&gt; [Could pose a problem for haughty Hillary's fund-raising in Silicon Valley. \u2014 PW]&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; How Your Phone and Fitness Band Could End Up Giving Evidence Against You[179]&lt;nl/&gt; A criminal suspect can't be forced to divulge their phone passcode, a US circuit court judge ruled in October 2014.

Over time the men were worn out.&lt;nl/&gt; The army has reported 371 incidents perpetrated against the soldiers standing guard in front of the protected sites. The Defense Ministry has announced that the men will become more mobile, rendering them less vulnerable.&lt;nl/&gt; The army noted that 'reconnoitering, the taking of snapshots and films' by jihadists preparing future attacks had been going on. 'Fourteen serious attacks, with a knife, laser, even blows with heavy sticks,' were reported.

The proposals include empowering French authorities to shut down websites hosting content that is deemed illicit without prior court approval.&lt;nl/&gt; The declaration of war against online hate speech has raised questions about possible violations of civil liberties and the curtailing of due process as France struggles to find a way forward after a wave of deadly violence and anti-Semitic hate crimes in the country.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; France: Terrorists Threaten to Hit Paris Shopping Centres[192]&lt;nl/&gt; Security has been heightened at two of the largest shopping centres in Paris after they were singled out as terror targets in a new video released by the same terrorist group that killed 60 people in a Kenyan mall in 2013.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; France: Charlie Hebdo: First Edition of Satirical Magazine Since the 'Survivors' Issue' Goes on Sale Tomorrow[193]&lt;nl/&gt; The first Charlie Hebdo since the 'survivors' issue', published after jihadist gunmen killed 12 at the satirical monthly's offices in January, went on sale on Wednesday morning.&lt;nl/&gt; Newspaper sellers are expecting a scrum as readers across France hope to get their hands on one of the 2.5 million copies to be released over the next few days.

The investigation brought to light that those arrested in Catalonia operated independently but interacted on Facebook through the internet platform administered from Melilla. They had contact with jihadist sympathizers also in Latin America and countries ranging from Belgium and France to Pakistan, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, the US, Turkey and Tunisia.

The Syrian Church has denounced an 'abandonment' of the community by those who could have intervened but did not. A 17-year-old named Milad was killed and several churches set on fire during the attack. The villages include Tal Hermez, Tal Shamiram, Tal Riman, Tal Nasra, Al-Agibash, Toma Yalda and Al-Haooz in the area of the Khabour river. Archimandrite Emanuel Youkhana has told the Catholic association 'Aid to the Church in Need' that the jihadists had chosen to focus on the area after being defeated in Kobane by the Democratic Union Kurdish Party (PYD).&lt;nl/&gt; The battle began on Monday and the fighters were able to penetrate into the first two villages, taking dozens hostage. 'Fortunately, about 600 families managed to escape towards Qamishli,' said Youkhana, 'but we are concerned about those taken hostage. We know ISIS's barbaric methods well. What is most important, now, is that these people be freed as soon as possible.' Monsignor Jacques Behnan Hindo, Catholic archbishop of Hasaka-Nisibi, said that US fighter planes had flown over the area in recent days but that they had not intervened, and that some 100 Assyrian families have sought refuge in Hasaka without receiving aid from either the Red Crescent or Syrian government aid agencies.&lt;nl/&gt; Hindo added that the UNHCR was also not providing aid to the people. The Khabour river area includes 35 Christian villages. The inhabitants are Assyrians whose families had fled the 1933 Simele massacre in Iraq committed by the armed forces of the Kingdom of Iraq. Some 3,000 people are thought to have been killed within a few days in August of that year, and the others fled into Syria.

The attack on the village near Tell Tamer, not far from Al-Hasakah, an area with a large community of Assyrians, Chaldeans and Syriacs, was attacked on Monday morning, according to a local source who contacted a relative in Canada who then got in touch with A Demand For Action (ADFA), a group that protects the three minorities, the US magazine said.&lt;nl/&gt; The whole area is reportedly under siege: ISIS militants first separated the men from women and children and took many in the mountains of Abd al-Aziz. Women and children remained in the village, which is guarded by ISIS militants, according to the source quoted by Newsweek.&lt;nl/&gt; It is still unclear how many men have been taken hostage, though this initial report appears to indicate that over 100 are being detained and ISIS means to use them in a prisoner exchange with ISIS fighters currently held by Kurdish militia. They have reportedly threatened to kill the villagers if the exchange fails.&lt;nl/&gt; The founder of ADFA, Nuri Kino, told Newsweek that he has spoken with several relatives of those held hostage by ISIS.&lt;nl/&gt; 'Many of them have relatives in Sweden and Germany', he told the magazine, adding that he tried to contact villagers by phone only to have ISIS members pick up.&lt;nl/&gt; It is still difficult to ascertain the situation on the ground as it is unclear how many militants were involved in the raid, which was described as 'huge' and in a climate of total 'panic' by the source quoted by Newsweek.&lt;nl/&gt; Meanwhile Syrian news agency Sana reported that jihadists have stormed several villages in Syria, including Tal Hermez, Tal Shamiram, Tal Riman, Tal Nasra, al-Agibash, Toma Yalda and al-Haooz, in the eastern part of the country, killing dozens.&lt;nl/&gt; The attacks were carried out aboard heavy vehicles and militants burned one of the most ancient churches in Syria, in Tal Hermez, according to the news agency, which quoted local sources.&lt;nl/&gt; The objective of ISIS, according to the news agency, is to reach the border with Turkey in order to make the crossing of weapons and fighters easier. During the attacks, according to the Syrian news agency, coalition forces flew over the area targeted by jihadists without intervening.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; 'Islamic State' Abducts Christians in Attack on Villages in Syria[227]&lt;nl/&gt; The 'Islamic State' has kidnapped 90 Christians in northeastern Syria, according to a monitor.

He noted that US fighter planes had flown over the area in recent days but that they had not intervened despite the fact that some 100 Assyrian families have sought refuge in Hasaka without receiving aid from either the Red Crescent or Syrian government aid agencies.&lt;nl/&gt; Monsignor Hindo added that the UNHCR was also not providing aid to the people and that many Christians had been taken hostage by jihadists and that some village churches had been burnt. He noted that the Tel Tamar village had been attacked first, followed by Tel Shamiran and other small villages all the way to Tel Hermuz, which was burnt to the ground. He claimed that dozens of hostages had been taken in both Tel Hormuz and Tel Shamiran, with the possible intention of using them for ransom or a prisoner exchange.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Jordan Furious Over Pentagon Leak on Secret Anti-Terror Training Camp[230]&lt;nl/&gt; By Maggie Ybarra&lt;nl/&gt; The Pentagon let slip that one of its training camps to help fight Islamic State terrorists is in Jordan \u2014 information the pro-U.S. kingdom had specifically requested be kept private, and the latest gaffe in a series of sensitive leaks coming out of the Department of Defense.&lt;nl/&gt; In order to hide its flub, which was first announced to reporters during a briefing last week, the Pentagon has scrubbed its public transcripts of any mention of the training camp.&lt;nl/&gt; Pentagon officials acknowledged Monday that one of its officers, who was briefing reporters on condition of anonymity last week, likely made the mistake.

Arabs of different faiths, Kurds, Armenians, Assyrian Christians and others lived side by side, embracing a rather durable Syrian nationalism.&lt;nl/&gt; But the increasingly sectarian character of the Syrian conflict and the rise of the Islamic State threaten to unravel the rich tapestry of Syrian society. In neighboring Iraq, the ravages of militants have forced tens of thousands of religious minorities, including Christians, to flee. Last year, the top Christian priest in Baghdad likened the present moment to the horrifying onslaught of the Mongol hordes in the 13th Century, which devastated the region and redrew its political map.&lt;nl/&gt; On Tuesday morning, Islamic State fighters reportedly carried out the mass abduction of dozens of Christians \u2014 some reports suggest at least 90 \u2014 living in villages near the city of Hasakah, in northeastern Syria. In a conflict shaped by endless reports of atrocities, the incident is alarming for its overtly communal nature. Those kidnapped belong to a shrinking population of Assyrian Christians, who have called Hasakah province and Nineveh, across the border in Iraq, home for centuries. Assyrian Christians speak a version of Aramaic, the language thought to have been spoken by Jesus.&lt;nl/&gt; [Still more extras for the snuff vids.

Some Malaysians believe this is religiously required by the Quran; others believe it is an important Muslim custom, one that will 'protect girls from premarital sex as it is supposed to lower their sex drive.'&lt;nl/&gt; A spokeswoman for a local women's rights group, Sisters in Islam, insists that sunat (Malaysian for circumcision) is not mentioned in the Quran.'Previously, it was a cultural practice,' she says, 'but now, because of Islamization, people just relate everything to Islam. And when you link something to religion, people here follow it blindly.'&lt;nl/&gt; FGM has absolutely no medical benefit and poses the gravest harm ranging from infection, pain when urinating, agony during sex and child birth, fistulas, life-long suffering, and even death.&lt;nl/&gt; Increasingly, Malaysian Muslim physicians, often female, are performing FGM procedures (which range from very mild to most severe).

The 74-year-old president of the United Nations Intergovernmental Committee on Climate Change (IPCC), Rajendra Pachauri, did not attend a meeting in Kenya after being accused of sexually harassing a 29-year-old researcher on the New Delhi think tank run by the scientist. Mr Pachauri, who is director general of the Energy and Research institute, allegedly sent unwanted emails, text and Whattsap messages to the young woman. At the moment, judges have not decided to arrest the president of the IPCC, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, thus ensuring immunity at least until the next hearing, scheduled for Thursday. Pachauri rejected the allegations by saying that he had been hacked in an attempt to discredit him. Mr Pachauri was appointed president of the UN committee in 2002 and was subsequently confirmed in the post in 2008 for a second mandate that ends in October this year. He is now at risk of having his image severely damaged and might lose his appointment. The Indian organisers of a conference to be held in Harvard have already cancelled the invitation they had sent him. The IPCC provides guidelines on the protection against climate change to its 194 members. In a recent report, it warned of a 'severe, widespread and irreversible impact' on man and nature unless carbon dioxide emissions are drastically reduced.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; China's Expansion Push in Southeast Asia Renews Concerns[242]&lt;nl/&gt; China's neighbors, in particular, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam, are increasingly concerned there will be no end to their expansion.

Ollivant&lt;nl/&gt; (CNN) Everything you think you know about the 'future of war' is wrong.&lt;nl/&gt; An elite consensus on the 'New Way of War' has been emerging for some time now. Among defense policy experts, think tanks, echoed at Aspen and Davos, the way forward seems clear. The future belongs to cyberwarfare and includes a terrorism problem that will be dealt with by drones and SEALs, and the need to be prepared for the possibility, however remote, of a large-scale naval and aviation campaign in the Far East against a rising China.&lt;nl/&gt; This new American way of war\u2014clean, precise, and (unless things go very bad with China) low-casualty \u2014 seems to capture the persistent technologist mood of America.&lt;nl/&gt; Unfortunately, reality seems uninterested in conforming to this strongly held belief. \u2026 how should the United States respond to this new reality?&lt;nl/&gt; First, (new wars) are in general low-tech and manpower intensive&lt;nl/&gt; Low-tech does not mean 'no-tech,' and even a 40-year old Soviet tank can be a significant weapon if one is not prepared for it. Further, there will be 'islands' of technology that are equivalent or even superior to that used by Western militaries. But this is not a universally high technology force. This manpower is also highly trained, or at least has a critical core that is highly trained, whether ISIS cadres or the 'little green men' (Russian intelligence officers) of the Ukraine. We should expect to encounter professionals.&lt;nl/&gt; Second, they intermingle with the population&lt;nl/&gt; This is 'war amongst the people,' with all the messiness, ambiguity, byzantine relationships and background noise associated with a population center.&lt;nl/&gt; [\u2026]&lt;nl/&gt; Finally, they occur outside the bounds of normal nation-state conflict&lt;nl/&gt; Gaza isn't really a state and both Ukrainian separatists and ISIS, respectively, have stripped Kiev and Baghdad of effective control of the territory they operate within. This is not to say that state boundaries are unimportant, because they are (that Iraq has invited airstrikes against ISIS, while Syria has not, is a key differentiator), but that they are of lesser importance. But many to most future conflicts will occur in these spaces that belong to no state, or only tenuously to a state.&lt;nl/&gt; [\u2026]&lt;nl/&gt; We should continue to expect crises to emerge. Some will occur in areas where key U.S. interests are at stake. Others will happen on the periphery of U.S. national interest. But they will continue to tend to involve well-trained cadres, in contact with the population, and in areas without strong state control.&lt;nl/&gt; [\u2026]&lt;nl/&gt; First, we need to rethink the way we go about buying our military hardware. \u2026 The way that the United States does contracting \u2014 more concerned about being 'fair' than getting the best product for the defense dollar \u2014 may have worked for producing lower-technology items, but falls far short for more complex weapons systems.&lt;nl/&gt; Second, we need to promote our forces who work best with allied forces in these spaces where the state is weak or nonexistent: the Army's Special Forces (popularly known as 'Green Berets'). These forces have undergone significant neglect in the past decade, as the anti-terrorism capabilities of Joint Special Operations Command (SEAL Team Six and Delta Force) were seen as the most pressing need.&lt;nl/&gt; [\u2026]&lt;nl/&gt; Third, we need to continue to focus on prepared and ready land power \u2014 our own rifle squads, companies and battalions who can do the dirty business themselves, if need be. Some of these situations may lend themselves to the use of indigenous land power (someone else's soldiers) supported by U.S. airpower (n.b. The USAF should be tasked to retain the capability to provide exactly this support). This will continue to be the preferred technique. But for in extremis situations, the United States must continue to have a reliable, well-trained, well-led and well-equipped ground force.&lt;nl/&gt; [\u2026]&lt;nl/&gt; Fourth, the Pentagon should focus on systems that push power and information to the 'edge' of the system. We have lived in an age of extreme centralization of information. This has worked out only because the force of choice for the last decade, the SEALs and Deltas of Joint Special Operations Command, are considered a 'national asset' and therefore have had access to this centralized information.&lt;nl/&gt; The forces of choice for the future, rifle companies and Special Forces detachments, will not be privileged with this access. We should think about systems that push information to their level.&lt;nl/&gt; Fifth, many observers have pointed out that the military's traditional personnel management system has defects, both in recruiting and development. \u2026 Long-standing suggestions to increase language training, allow for late entry and/or sabbaticals, increase technical skills, get input from subordinates on their leaders, and recruit outside traditional pools \u2014 for instance, in Silicon Valley \u2014 should all be seriously considered.&lt;nl/&gt; [\u2026]&lt;nl/&gt; Finally, we need to regard with extreme skepticism those who believe that warfare has fundamentally changed in any real way. War will continue to be fought over issues of fear, honor and interest. Despite increasing automation, it will be fought primarily by young men (despite the increasing presence of older men and young women). The next war will likely be very recognizable to someone who fought in one millennia ago.&lt;nl/&gt; [The erudite and well-credentialed Mr.Ollivant overlooks one other potential trait of the wars of the future: the likelihood that, given mass Muslim immigration, increasing racial strife, and a pullulating hard left bent on establishing an American autocracy, they will be fought here rather than

Meanwhile, Germany prevented a shipment of facemasks from being exported to Switzerland. Also, the coronavirus has reached the Greek island of Lesbos, just ten miles from a massive refugee camp. In other news, during a campaign event at an auto plant in Detroit, Joe Biden told an autoworker that he was 'full of s***' for questioning the candidate's commitment to the 2nd Amendment. </p><p>To see the headlines and the articles, click 'Continue reading' below.

The move is also coming after Reddit has been testing forcing mobile users to sign in and use the app \u2014 suggesting that Reddit is making a more forward attempt to monetize the audience.[80]  Airport Says DHS is Not Screening People Coming Into US From Coronavirus Stricken Italy or South Korea[81] A major airport in Atlanta has admitted that neither its own officials, nor the Department of Homeland Security are screening travellers arriving from Italy or South Korea, two countries where the coronavirus has hit the hardest outside of China. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia announced that while the CDC has demanded screening of passengers from China and Iran, no such screening is taking place for those coming in from Italy/South Korea, 'because those countries are doing exit screenings.'[82]  Alex Jones Denies DWI Charge, Texas Newspaper Confirms He Was Below Legal Limit[83] Update (1655ET): InfoWars has published its own account of Alex Jones' interaction with Texas state police on Monday night, and it differs markedly from the story published by the Statesman. According to InfoWars, Jones has been cleared of the DWI charge after blowing less than a 0.08 \u2014 the Texas legal limit. Jones was pulled over in Travis County while driving '45 mph in a 40-mph zone' and admitted to consuming a small amount of sake at a Japanese restaurant, where he had eaten dinner with his wife earlier that evening. Interestingly enough, the Austin Statesman article reporting Jones's arrest was updated shortly after publication to clarify that Jones did blow below the legal limit. The reasons for his arrest are not made clear in the article.[84]  Corrupt Mueller Gang Threatened to Throw General Flynn and His Son in Solitary Confinement if He Didn't Plead Guilty to Lying to FBI[85] General Mike Flynn has now been harassed by corrupt members of the DOJ for more than three years. He and his family have gone through hell all because he knew too much about the Obama Administration's corruption and supported Donald Trump. The General's lovely sister, Barbara Redgate was on BardsOfWar podcast and gave an amazing interview regarding the challenges General Flynn and his family have had to go through since becoming a target of the Deep State. At the 13:30 minute mark of the interview, Ms. Redgate shared the following after listing a plethora of documents that the FBI and DOJ are withholding from the General in relation to his case. Redgate says that shortly after the discovery of corrupt FBI Agents Strzok and Page's texts, the Mueller team is believed to have gone to DAG Rosenstein to obtain permission to indict Flynn's son. This is when the Mueller gang really put pressure on General Flynn. They took young Mike's phone and computers and have never returned them to this day. At the time, young Mike had a 4 month old baby at home. Next she shares the following: Barbara Redgate: Suddenly General Mike is threatened with public arrest and search of his phone. Public arrest of his son. Indictment of his son, and they were going to give him the Manafort treatment, which is put them both in solitary confinement. At the 11th hour before General Flynn signed his plea agreement, at the last minute Special Counsel notifies the defense counsel by phone only that the electronic communications of one agent showed a preference [against] President Trump and the IG was assessing whether that constituted misconduct. General Flynn's attorney's never told this to General Flynn so he thought that the agents who interviewed him in an ambush meeting in the White House believed he had lied. The entire interview is shocking and a must listen.[86]  Dr. Drew Slams Media for 'Hurting People' With Coronavirus Panic[87] Dr Drew has once again spoken out regarding the media's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, urging that the panic being generated is 'hurting people' and that those spreading it should be 'held accountable'. 'A bad flu season is 80,000 dead, we've got about 18,000 dead from influenza this year, we have a hundred from corona,' Dr. Drew said in an interview with CBS.[88]  Joe Biden Lashes Out at Detroit Autoworker: 'You're Full of S***, ' Then Hushes Aide[89] Vice President Joe Biden lashed out at a pro-gun worker in Detroit on Tuesday, telling him he's 'full of s***' before hushing an aide who tried to intervene. Biden was speaking at an auto plant when a worker in a hard hat claimed the presidential candidate was 'actively trying to end our Second Amendment rights.' Standing face-to-face with the worker, Biden responded, 'You're full of s***.'[90]  March 10 Primaries Live Updates: Biden Projected to Win Michigan, Mississippi and Missouri[91] Primary voters in the key battleground state of Michigan as well as Missouri, Mississippi, Idaho, North Dakota and Washington state head to the polls in a closely watched contest that could help determine the next phase of the Democratic race for the presidential nomination. There are 352 delegates up for grabs across the six states. 9: 15 p.m. Here's a glimpse at Democratic turnout in Michigan All the polls have now closed in Michigan. With 51% of the expected vote reporting, turnout in the Democratic primary is about 68% of 2016's total. ABC News has estimated that both Biden and Sanders will pick up at least 11 delegates each in Michigan.[92]  MIT Scientist Claims Coronavirus is a 'Deep State Fraud'[93] MIT scientist Shiva Ayyadurai claims that coronavirus 'fear mongering' is a 'Deep State fraud' to manipulate financial markets. Ayyadurai, who is noted for his controversial claim to be the 'inventor of email,' has a PhD in Biological Engineering and is running as a Republican in the 2020 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts. Responding to President Donald Trump's claim that Democrats and the media are responsible for inflaming the coronavirus scare 'far beyond what the facts would warrant,' Ayyadurai agreed that the panic was being overblown for political and economic reasons.[94]  NYC Hardware Store Selling Hand Sanitizer for $109 a Bottle[95] In yet another shameless act of price gouging, a hardware store in New York is selling bottles of hand sanitizer for $109 dollars a pop. Yes, really. Taking full advantage of the growing hysteria surrounding coronavirus, Scheman ...ant Hardware at Eighth Avenue and 38th Street is now selling 1200 ml bottles of Purell that normally retail for $5.49 for a gargantuan $79 dollars. Meanwhile, larger 2 liter bottles of Purell are selling for $109 each.[96]  President Trump Was Right! 37,000 Flu Deaths Per Year So Far 26 Coronavirus Deaths in US, 19 of Them at Same Life Care Senior Center[97] UPDATE\u2014 26 deaths now in the US and 19 from the Life Care Center of Kirkland. President Trump this morning tweeted out the recent coronavirus numbers in the United States. 'So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life ...e economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that! '[98]  Prince Andrew Still Not Cooperating in Jeffrey Epstein Investigation Despite Pledge: Prosecutors[99] Prince Andrew is still refusing to cooperate with a federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's alleged co-conspirators \u2014 despite a public pledge to do so, federal prosecutors said Monday. 'Contrary to Prince Andrew's very public offer to cooperate with our investigation into Epstein's co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation,' US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman said late Monday morning after an unrelated press conference.[100]  Psychologist: Big Tech Will Use 'Subliminal Methods' To Shift 15 Million Votes on Election Day[101] Psychologist Robert Epstein says that Big Tech is planning to use 'subliminal methods' in the upcoming election that could shift up to 15 million votes and cost Trump the presidency. After the 2016 presidential election, Epstein surmised that search engine bias shifted 2-3 million votes in Hillary Clinton's favor, and he warns that the number in 2020 could be five times that amount. The author says that Google and other social media giants 'can shift opinions and votes in numerous ways that people can't detect' via 'a wide variety of subliminal methods of persuasion that can, in minutes, shift the voting preferences of 20 percent or more of undecided voters without anyone having the slightest idea they've been manipulated.'[102]  The 21 Words Uttered by FISA Court That Change the Russia Collusion Case Forever[103] For much of the last three years, key law enforcement leaders have insisted they did nothing wrong in pursuing counterintelligence surveillance warrants targeting the Trump campaign starting during the 2016 election. And, they've added, if mistakes were made, they were unintentional process errors downstream from them and not an effort to deceive the judges. But in a little-noted passage in a recent order, U.S. District Judge James A. Boasberg, the new chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, took direct aim at the excuses and blame-shifting of these senior Obama administration FBI and DOJ officials. In just 21 words, Boasberg provided the first judicial declaration the FBI had misled the court, not just committed process errors. 'There is thus little doubt that the government breached its duty of candor to the Court with respect to those applications,' Boasberg wrote.[104]  The Boys Season 2's Stormfront Will be a 'Product of the Alt-Right's Ability to Use the Internet to Recruit'[105] Amazon Prime's show The Boys could be catering to the whims of the rest of the entertainment industry in twisting the origins of a comic book character, changing the whole backstory, and introducing a character as something it was not originally intended to be \u2014 all for the sake of trying to take advantage of the current zeitgeist we find ourselves in, especially where it comes to politics and the internet. The character is 'Stormfront' \u2014 originally in the comic books as a Nazi soldier who was smuggled into the US. However, the makers of The Boys on Amazon Prime have made their own twist and changed the villain altogether for the upcoming season 2 of the TV version. Based on the latest information, it is confirmed that Stormfront is now a Jewish woman who was converted to Nazism by the means of 'alt-right' online communities.[106]  Twitter Blocks 'Okie Boomer Girl' Video After Copyright Claim[107] Twitter has blocked the viral video of Neekolul, the 'Okie Boomer Girl,' dancing to the 'OK Doki Boomer' song while wearing a Bernie 2020 t-shirt after it was hit with a copyright claim. After being posted to Twitter on March 2, it quickly went viral and amassed more than 14 million views but was blocked earlier today. Twitter said the video had been 'disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner.' However, YouTuber Senzawa, the creator of the 'OK Doki Boomer' song, tweeted that they did not file the copyright claim.[108]  US Death Toll From Coronavirus Rises to 30, National Guard Sent to NYC Suburb[109] U.S. death toll at 30 Trump 'feels extremely good,' doesn't plan on getting tested 'Likely going to get worse before it gets better,' U.S. surgeon general says National Guard to deliver food, clean schools to NYC suburb Italy's 'Patient No. 1' out of ICU[110]  YouTuber ReviewTechUSA slams 'Sociopathic' Swatter Who Sent Police to His House During Live Stream[111] YouTuber ReviewTechUSA has blasted the 'sociopathic behavior' of the swatter who sent police to his home during his live stream last night. A few minutes before the police arrived, ReviewTechUSA had noticed that his stream was getting an unusually high number of views. '1200 people here right now. What the hell is going on?' ReviewTechUSA remarked. 'I don't get it.' At the time, ReviewTechUSA assumed that bots had caused the upsurge in viewers but after being swatted, he suggested that the person behind the swatting had probably shared a link to his live stream. Moments after ReviewTechUSA noticed the uptick in viewers on his live stream, someone knocked on the door and told him: 'Someone called the police.'[112]  BC's New Ecosocialist Party Wants to Seize Wealth, End 'Pro-Capitalist' Education[113] A new party billing itself as 'further left than the NDP, greener than the Greens' has appeared in British Columbia, promising radical socialist reforms if elected. The BC Ecosocialists are led by Canadian musician Geoff Berner and are a registered political party with Elections BC. The party already has a platform that ranges from sensible propositions like protecting endangered species to radical policies like seizing wealth from the rich, removing 'pro-capitalist/pro-liberal' teachings from schools and a major land redistribution program that would transfer some private ownership to Indigenous groups.[114]  Coronavirus: Experts Say 35 to 70 Percent of Canadians Could be Infected[115] The coronavirus could reportedly infect 35 to 70 percent of Canadians and the country may need to implement quarantine centres and makeshift hospitals to avoid further spread of the virus. Researchers at the University of Toronto have made a disease-transmission model to attempt to find the overall attack rate of the virus in Canada. Research from the model suggests that the rate could surpass 70 percent if no public health interventions are implemented according to the National Post.[116]  Exclusive: University of Victoria De-Platforms Conservative Speaker After Threats of Left-Wing Violence[117] The University of Victoria has cancelled a conservative activist from speaking at a 'free speech club,' because there were 'considerable concerns around safety and security for this event.' As a result of this, the university would only allow the event to continue if the undergraduate student who organized the event paid for a security detail in order to guarantee the protection of both the speaker and the university's property. The event in question was organized so that students could hear a conservative perspective over the recent #ShutDownCanada protests, which led to key areas of Canada's infrastructure being blockaded. Aaron Gunn, a mainstream conservative commentator with a large online following, was given the opportunity to express this perspective by the university's free speech club.[118]  Liberals Spend $2.6 Million on COVID-19 Anti-Racism and Social Media Research[119] While COVID-19 outbreaks are being detected in Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is revealing his priorities. As part of a $27 million federal research funding competition, the Liberal government allocated $2.63 million taxpayer dollars on combating discrimination, racism and social media misinformation. While many of the projects funded were sound scientific and public policy research, seven of the approved studies stuck out as social justice-oriented.[120]  Maclean's Called Alberta's Blockade Buster a Racist, So We're Helping Him Sue \u2014 Will You Support Him?[121] Remember a few weeks ago when some masked eco-terrorists blocked a railroad near Edmonton? Police just stood there and did nothing to remove it. So a handful of peaceful Good Samaritans simply drove up with a big truck and carted away the garbage that was blocking the railroad. It was wonderful \u2014 normal, law-abiding Albertans peacefully solving a problem that all the politicians and police wouldn't. But not to Maclean's magazine. They published a crazy rant about racist white supremacist vigilantes \u2014 and illustrated it with a picture of one of those Good Samaritans, Chase Chomey.[122]  Train Derailment Forces Evacuation From Swalwell, Alberta[123] This is the sixth train derailment in Canada in recent weeks. A train derailment in a southern Alberta hamlet has forced residents to flee their homes. The evacuation was ordered after a CN train collided with a B-Train propane truck in Swalwell, a community of little more than 100 people, 75 km northeast of Calgary. A state of emergency was declared and the hamlet's residents removed. Nothing from the train's intermodal containers spilled.[124]  AfD Calls for Coronavirus Border Checks Following Poland and the Czech Republic's Lead[125] Poland and the Czech Republic, on Monday, March 10th, have started to spot-check vehicles with passengers coming from Germany for symptoms of the coronavirus.

'Ryanair apologises sincerely to all customers for these schedule disruptions, which are caused by national government restrictions and the latest decision of the Italian government to lock down the entire country to combat the Covid-19 virus,' reads a statement from the airline.[128]  Court Hears Alleged Victims of Scottish Nationalist Salmond 'Scared' To Come Forward[129] A woman who has accused Alex Salmond of assaulting her in 2014 said that she was too frightened to initially come forward because the former leader of the devolved Scottish parliament was 'a very powerful man', Edinburgh's High Court has heard. The former first minister of Scotland stands accused of 14 sexual offences against 10 women, including attempted rape and sexual assault. The incidents are alleged to have taken place between June 2008 and November 2014, while Mr Salmond, 65, was in office and leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP).[130]  Dutch Coronavirus Cases Hit 382; Den Haag King's Day Fest Canceled[131] The number of patients in the Netherlands who tested positive for the Covid-19 strain of coronavirus rose to 382, including four people who died. The most recent person to die with the virus was a 78-year-old who had a weakened immune system. Health agency RIVM said 161 of all patients who tested positive were infected abroad, and 156 cases were still under investigation. Over half of the 61 new patients reside in the province of Noord-Brabant, bringing the total there to 157. Meanwhile, the uncertainty over the increasing number of infections has led to the cancellation of events even over a month away. One of the biggest event cancellations to date is the Kingsworld festival, scheduled for King's Day, April 27, in The Hague.

The embassy claimed that Chinese students wearing medical masks were asked to hand over 150 euros by 'police' who they later confirmed with officials in the Paris police were criminals pretending to be officers.[136]  Germany Prevents Shipment of Protective Masks Headed Toward Switzerland[137] German customs authorities have blocked a shipment of protective masks headed toward Switzerland, sparking fresh diplomatic tensions between the two countries as the coronavirus continues to spread throughout Europe. A truckload of 240,000 protective masks bound for Switzerland was blocked by German custom agents following a recent decision made by Germany's federal government to ban exports and other key medical gear amid a worsening coronavirus pandemic, The Local Germany reports.[138]  Germany-Austria Spat Over Anti-Virus Facemasks[139] A German export ban on masks that protects against the coronavirus has angered Austria and Switzerland. 'It can't be that Germany is holding back products for Austria just because they happen to be stored in a German location,' said Austrian economy minister Margarete Schramboeck. 'These products are for the Austrian market, and unilateral moves by Germany are just causing problems in other countries,' she added.[140]  Italian Doctor Shares Grim Account of Hospital Overcapacity Due to COVID-9[141] An Italian doctor took to social media to warn the world about the COVID-19 'tsunami' that has hit the healthcare system of affected regions in the country. In his lengthy and tragic account of treating an influx of coronavirus patients, Dr. Daniel Macchini describes the rapid spread of the virus and the hospital's inability to properly treat new cases. 'The war has literally exploded and battles are uninterrupted day and night. But now that need for beds has arrived in all its drama. One after the other the departments that had been emptied fill up at an impressive pace.' writes Macchini in Italian.[142]  Italy: Sicily Officials Arrested in Graft Probe[143] Businessmen 'got illicit farm subsidies worth millions' (ANSA) \u2014 Palermo, March 4 \u2014 Several Sicilian regional government officials and businessmen were arrested Wednesday in a major graft probe. Palermo finance police executed 24 warrants including four in jail custody, 12 under house arrest and eight stay orders. The functionaries and the businessmen are variously accused of conspiracy, aggravated fraud in getting public monies, corruption, false public statements, revealing official secrets, and suppression and burying public acts. Some 14 companies were seized, three based in Hungary, Austria and Romania, worth a total of some 24 million euros. Also seized were financial assets, goods and property worth over 12.5 million euros. The issuing of illegal contributions totalling some 3.5 million euros was blocked. The investigation focused on the illicit authorisation of farm subsidies by the Sicilian regional government. The finance guard said there had been some 12 million euros in illicit subsidies. Two businessmen allegedly obtained the subsidies by issuing fake invoices through the companies in Hungary, Austria and Romania.[144]  Italy: 2 MN Masks: 1,000 Ventilators Coming From China[145] Utmost priority for Italian orders Wang tells Di Maio (ANSA) \u2014 Rome, March 10 \u2014 Over two million face masks and some 10,000 pulmonary ventilators are set to reach Italy from China under contracts about to be signed, after a phone call between Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio and Chinese counterpart Wang Yi Tuesday. Wang assured Di Maio that Italian orders for the ventilators would be made a priority by Chinese firms after similar requests were made by other European countries. Wang also told Di Maio that the Chinese government had instructed its firms to export two million medical masks.

The Labour MP for Wigan voted Remain in the 2016 referendum and Ms Nandy has since attempted to project an air of Brexit Acceptance including ruling out as party leader campaigning to rejoin the EU. However, Ms Nandy seems keen to delay the UK's exit from the bloc's rules and institutions.[148]  Merkel Expects 60-70 Per Cent of Germans to be Infected With Coronavirus[149] Angela Merkel says she expects around 60-70 per cent of Germans will be infected with the coronavirus, which equates to about 53 million people. Reportedly, the German Parliament fell completely silent when Merkel stated the number. News outlet Bild reported the German Chancellor's comments, which echoed numbers forecast by Berlin virologist Christian Drosten, who added that such a total could take 2 years or longer to reach. Given the fact that coronavirus has a mortality rate of around 1 per cent, this could equate to over half a million deaths, although new methods of fighting the virus could reduce this number.[150]  Poland: President Says Steps Have Been Taken to be Prepared for Coronavirus[151] Addressing the Polish people on the public television network TVP on Tuesday evening, President Andrzej Duda admitted that the situation was serious, since thousands of people have died worldwide following a coronavirus infection. 'The virus has recently reached Poland. We know that the number of infected people will be growing in coming days. I can assure you that the Polish authorities have earlier undertaken appropriate steps in order to be ready for the challenge,' the president said.[152]  Quarantine: Italians Told to Stay Indoors Via Loudspeakers[153] Italians are being told to stay inside unless they need to buy medicines by health authorities patrolling neighborhoods with loudspeakers as the coronavirus quarantine begins to take hold. With 60 million people having their movements restricted, the video has a somewhat post-apocalytpic feel as Italians are told, 'Please stay at home ... outside only when you need to buy medicines or see doctors. Please follow our rules ...ar face masks.' The fact that the clip was posted by the Global Times, an official mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party is somewhat ironic.[154]  Spain: Madrid to Shut Down All Schools for 2 Weeks Amid Coronavirus Spike[155] MADRID (AP) \u2014 Spain's health minister reported a sharp spike in coronavirus cases in and around Madrid and said all schools in the capital region, from kindergartens and universities, would close for two weeks starting Wednesday. Health Minister Salvador Illa announced the closures while giving a second daily update on virus infections in Spain. As of Monday night, the country had 1,204 confirmed cases, an increase of more than 200 from the tally reported at lunchtime, Illa said.[156]  'The UK Has Made Up Its Mind': No 10 Hits Back at EU Over Brexit Ultimatum, Will Publish Draft FTA Pact[157] A spokesman for Prime Minister Johnson said that the UK has'made up its mind' over what it wants from a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, the remarks coming after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Britain must choose either close alignment to the EU or lose access to the Single Market. On Monday, the chief of the EU's powerful executive arm had said that if the UK wants frictionless, tariff-free trade it must 'play by the rules' on matters including accepting European court decisions; 'level playing field' regulations on labour rights, environmental rules, tax, and state aid ( i.e., subsidies given by the government to British industries); and continuous access of Britain's fishing waters to EU fishermen.[158]  Three More People Infected in Hungary[159] According to a post on Tuesday on the government information website koronavirus.gov.hu, another three cases have emerged in Hungary, bringing the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country to 12. Fully 67 people are in quarantine, while samples have been taken from 362 people suspected of carrying the virus, the website said. The three new virus cases, all of them Iranian students studying at the medical Semmelweis University, were diagnosed at St. Laszlo hospital where they have been under observation for several days.[160]  UK PM Boris Johnson Tweet Edited to Suggest Opposite Sentiment About Coronavirus Gains 2.6 Million Views[161] Social media in the current times, by scale alone, has to be entwined with a dose of misinformation. In the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic, many countries are extending their efforts to make sure that their citizens stay safe. Similarly, the UK PM Boris Johnson too spoke about how the whole situation was to be tackled. However, a Twitter user took only half of what Mr Johnson said and started sharing it across Twitter and criticized him for his lackadaisical attitude towards approaching the condition and suggesting that the coronavirus is no big deal.[162]  UK Supermarkets Will be Able to Deliver Through the Night in Wake of Coronavirus Hoarding[163] The UK government will lift environmental restrictions on the logistics operations behind major supermarkets, after apparent panic-buying of hygiene items, including toilet roll and hand sanitiser, meant demand was outstripping supply in some areas. While supermarkets are normally restricted in the hours they are permitted to make deliveries to their premises to reduce noise and disruption to local residents, the government will relax these restrictions to make restocking the shelves easier. The outbreak of coronavirus has seen a significant surge in demand for a range of products, and environment minister George Eustice has agreed to give retailers more freedom to work around the clock to keep the logistics chain free.[164]  UK: Coronavirus: Health Minister Nadine Dorries Tests Positive[165] Health minister and Conservative MP Nadine Dorries says she has been diagnosed with coronavirus. Ms Dorries, the first MP to test positive, said she had taken all the advised precautions after finding out, and had been self-isolating at home. It comes as a sixth person died from the virus in the UK, which has a total of 382 cases. The latest person to die was a man in his early 80s who had underlying health conditions.[166]  UK: MPs Warn Environmentalism Will Hurt Working Class if Petrol Tax Raised[167] Dozens of MPs warned the Chancellor of the Exchequer that ending the freeze on petrol duty because of the country's environmental commitments will hurt the working-class voters who put the Conservatives into government. The 36 backbenchers led by Robert Halfon have penned a letter saying they are 'very concerned' by Rishi Sunak's reported proposal to unfreeze fuel tax which would see the cost of petrol and diesel rise by two pence a litre. The letter was signed by senior Brexiteer Tories Sir Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis, and former transport secretary Chris Grayling.[168]  Watch: Dutch PM Tells Public to Stop Shaking Hands Immediately Shakes Hands of Medical Expert[169] The Dutch Prime Minister has told the public 'today we stop shaking hands' in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus, before shaking hands with a medical advisor on national television and immediately realising his mistake. Speaking at a joint press conference with a top medical advisor on the spread of coronavirus, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said it was not necessary for the country to take major steps like banning public gatherings or closing schools \u2014 as has already happened in Italy \u2014 but that smaller changes in behaviour were needed. To this end, the Prime Minister said 'this is a problem for all of us' and told the nation 'today we stop shaking hands', reports Dutch news site NU.[170]  Coronavirus: 38yo Israeli Man in 'Critical Condition, ' Healthy 32yo Asian Man in Brooklyn 'Has Respiratory Failure'[171] For context, many people, such as the Australian couple below, get the coronavirus and experience little to no symptoms.[172]  Holy Iraqi 'Scholar' Says Coronavirus is 'Divine Punishment Against the Chinese' Then Comes Down With the Coronavirus[173] Holy Iraqi Muslim scholar Hadi al-Modarresi recently delivered a sermon where he claimed the coronavirus was 'divine punishment against the Chinese.'

After China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, its ally, has emerged as the second focal point of coronavirus, and thanks to the ruling mullahs' lies and cover-ups, Tehran is spreading it to the rest of the planet. The Iranian authorities at first claimed that the country was not experiencing a crisis regarding the coronavirus: that no one in Iran had contracted the disease. Soon, however, leaked information disclosed that top Iranian officials were aware of the coronavirus in Iran but had decided to conceal the truth. When a few Iranian authorities were pressured to provide information, they stated that they are not allowed to report the actual number of people who have been infected or died. The head of the Medical Sciences University in Qom, Mohammad Reza Ghadir, for instance, said on Iran's state television that the Ministry of Health had issued a ban on disclosing statistics on the coronavirus outbreak in the country. The question is: Are the ruling mullahs attempting purposefully to spread the coronavirus to other countries as a form of global jihad? Otherwise, why would Iran's top Ayatollah call coronavirus a 'blessing'?[178]  Vladimir Putin Keeps Turkish President Erdogan Waiting Before Syria Talks[179] VLADIMIR PUTIN humiliated Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of a meeting concerning a ceasefire in Syria as both leaders announced plans to contain the escalating conflict.[180]  Russia, Which Closed Its Border in January, Has Coronavirus Under Control[181] Some kind of connection here.[182]  Coronavirus by the Numbers \u2014 83% of Affected Countries Have Death Rates of Infected Persons Less Than 1%[183] According to the most recent data at Worldometer tracking website, the coronavirus mortality rates for individuals catching the virus are declining at a rate closer to the numbers we expect to see in a typical flu virus as the denominator continues to increase on a global scale. According to the most recent data the mortality rate for those infected with the coronavirus is getting closer to what you would expect from a normal flu virus and in many cases is less. The elderly are hit the hardest by the coronavirus and this is similar to the flu where 90% of the deaths come from individuals age 65 and over. According to the US Surgeon General Jerome Adams the average age of death of the coronavirus is 80-year-olds:[184]  COVID-19 Coronavirus Outbreak[185] Coronavirus Cases: 119,186 view by country Deaths: 4,298 Recovered: 66,619[186]  Dr. Oz Argues Coronavirus Numbers From Korea Show Lower Death Rate \u2014 May be No Worse Than Common Flu (Video)[187] Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Director of the Columbia University Integrative Medicine Center, joined Lou Dobbs on Monday night to discuss the ongoing coronavirus panic. As of Monday evening there have been 624 cases reported of the coronavirus. There have been 26 deaths in the US \u2014 19 of the deaths were at the Life Center Senior Center in Washington state. Dr. Oz argued that the coronavirus mortality rate from Korea is no worse than the common flu. Dr. Oz: We've got to get out with these vaccines. I think the US government is already pushing as hard as they can. But the real worry is that we'll rush a vaccine out, give it to a few hundred million people, and run into consequences we've never anticipated. Lou Dobbs: Like what? Dr. Oz: For example a fetus in a pregnant woman, that's a population that's at risk. You could hasten the death of some people with chronic illnesses. They're the ones that are at risk. And here's the thing. I just before walking out on the stage saw some of the data from Korea \u2014 which is very different than the data China shared with us. It showed much lower incidence of death. If I got a population that is not dying any more common than the flu why would I take a big chance with a vaccine?

Despite widespread panic buying and a financial market collapse, figures from these three countries suggest COVID-19 can be successfully combated if the right measures are taken. According to the country's health minister, South Korea has 'passed the peak' of coronavirus infections and is now seeing a decline in cases.[192]  YouTube Introduces Large Coronavirus Health Alerts to Users, Even to Those Who Haven't Searched for the Topic[193] YouTube has started showing notifications that direct users to coronavirus information from health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Health Service (NHS), depending on location. Several YouTube web users in the US are seeing a notification that encourages them to 'Get the latest information from the World Health Organization about COVID-19.'[194]  New Bug Species With 'Wacky Fashion Sense' Named After Lady Gaga[195] This bug was born this way. A graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign discovered a new species of treehopper \u2014 wacky-looking bugs with protruding features that look like horns, antlers, brightly colored flags or dead plant leaves, and that sing to each other by vibrating plant stems. And he decided to honor it with the name of another flamboyant shape-shifter: Lady Gaga. The insect, now called Kaikaia gaga, is a new genus of treehopper discovered after researchers studied insect samples collected about 30 years ago from a tropical forest near the Pacific coast of Nicaragua, according to student Brendan Morris and INHS entomologist Christopher Dietrich, who co-authored a paper about the new Gaga on the block in the journal Zootaxa.[196]  Coronavirus Spreads to Greek Island of Lesbos \u2014 Just Ten Miles From Where 27,000 Migrants Live in Squalor in Refugee Camp[197] The coronavirus has spread to the Greek island of Lesbos \u2014 just 10 miles away from 27,000 migrants living in squalor at a refugee camp. An unidentified 40-year-old woman has been diagnosed with the killer disease, the island's first case, after having recently travelled to Israel and Egypt. She was placed in quarantine on Sunday, the public ERT television reported. Greek authorities have expressed concern over the possibility of the virus spreading on islands such as Lesbos, where thousands of migrants are crammed in overcrowded camps or living rough.[198]  Germany: Key Figures in Merkel's CDU Want More Migrants[199] Despite the political fallout and social turmoil that 2015's migrant crisis brought to Germany, key politicians from Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) believe Germany should accept more migrants, with one potential CDU leader even praising Merkel's 2015 open borders policy. Schleswig-Holstein CDU Prime Minister Daniel Gunther said Germany should accept underage migrants, telling a German broadcaster, 'The situation in the border area between Turkey and Greece has worsened dramatically since the weekend. In the past, Schleswig-Holstein has declared its willingness to help people in need and to participate in quota solutions that the German government negotiates with its European partners. We should set an example here.'[200]  Greek Government: Only Four Per Cent of 'Refugees' Breaching Border Are Syrian[201] Just four per cent of the supposed refugees who have breached the Greek border in recent days are Syrians, according to the Greek government. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Islamist president of Turkey, claimed he was opening his borders to Europe in response to the threat of a fresh wave of refugees from Syria \u2014 despite the fact his reason for invading the north of the country was, ostensibly, to carve out a safe zone for Syrian refugees to be settled in.[202]  ICE and Border Patrol Warn: Illegal Aliens Are Dangerous in More Ways Than One[203] While leftists in the U.S. attempt to tie immigration exclusively to Latinos, many immigrants sneaking into the U.S are not from, Mexico, Central America and South America. They come from as far away as China to enter our country, and therein lies the problem since China is the nation of origin for the Coronavirus. About 330 immigrants from China have been caught attempting to cross American borders illegally so far this year, according to Homeland Security. In addition, three other people from South Korea \u2014 another country with rapidly spreading cases \u2014 have also been arrested at the border, as have 122 people from the Dominican Republican which shares a Caribbean island with the already enormously impoverished Haiti. But it is our southern neighbor that is responsible for more than 1,000 migrants a day who are nabbed attempting to sneak into Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California illegally from Mexico, in which Mexican authorities detected its first case last week, and this week police and medical departments identified five other cases of the deadly virus. And if that many are being caught each day, an unknown but significant number are getting through undetected, Border Patrol officials say.[204]  Illegal Alien Issued Ticket for 'Careless Driving' After Killing Mother, Two Children and Grandmother Near Walt Disney World[205] Thank a Democrat. An illegal alien was cited with a ticket for 'careless driving' after he rear-ended a van and nearly killed an entire family spanning three generations near Disney in Florida. The driver of a truck that killed a mother, two of her children and the grandmother was in the US illegally, according to authorities. Two other children, their father and grandfather who were also in the minivan survived. But after killing 4 people, Lucas Dos Reis Laurindo was only cited with a ticket, the strongest charge that could be made under Florida law. He is currently being held in custody on a visa violation.[206]  Large Number of North Africans Among Migrants on Greek Border[207] While some of the migrants gathered on the Greek border are from Syria, a French broadcaster has revealed that many are actually from countries in North Africa which are not in a state of war at all. Migrants from countries like Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria are said to be numerous among the other nationalities gathered at the border after the Turkish government led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened the gates to Europe.[208]  Marine Le Pen Demands Brussels Threaten Turkey With Sanctions Amid Refugee Crisis[209] BRUSSELS has been urged to threaten Turkey with sanctions during a row over refugees currently in Turkey heading across the border to the continent. Turkey hosts some 3.6 million refugees from Syria and has until now curbed migration to the bloc under a deal it agreed with Brussels in 2016 in return for billions of euros in aid. French opposition leader Marine Le Pen on Monday urged Brussels to threaten Recep Tayyip Erdogan with sanctions after the Turkish leader broke a 2016 pact under which the bloc promised to pay \u20ac6billion in return for Ankara stemming migration flows. European leaders 'cannot be lenient towards [Mr Erdogan] and must threaten him and implement sanctions [against Turkey] if necessary,' Mme Le Pen told RTL radio, before slamming Turkey's 'unacceptable' decision to open its borders to migrants travelling to Europe.[210]  Merkel's Globalist Coalition Opposes the Majority of the German People, Plans to Take in 1,500 'Unaccompanied Minors'[211] Merkel's globalist coalition has decided to take in 1,500 so-called 'unaccompanied minors' and 'refugee children', despite the vast majority of Germans opposing the plan. Despite the people of Germany being overwhelmingly opposed to the plan, the German government still plans to move ahead with the plan and take in at least 1,500 'unaccompanied minors' and 'refugee children', regional daily newspaper Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung reports.[212]  Turkey on Incoming Migrant Waves: European States Will Perish and Economies Will Crash[213] S\u00fcleyman Soylu, Turkey's Interior Minister, has claimed that mass migration across the Greek border will be able to drastically change Europe's governments, economies, and bringing chaos which will cause Europe's stock markets to crash. 'The governments in Europe will change, their economies will deteriorate, their stock markets will collapse,' S\u00fcleyman Soylu said during an interview on the Tarafsiz B\u00f6lge program on CNN T\u00fcrk last Saturday.[214]  Turkey's Islamist Regime Leader Says European Bloc Must Stop 'Stringing it Along' on Migrant Deal[215] ANKARA, Turkey (AP) \u2014 The European Union should stop 'stringing Turkey along' over helping out with the millions of migrants on its territory, the country's foreign minister said Tuesday, a day after the two sides agreed to review a 4-year-old deal aimed at stemming refugee flows to Europe. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the EU must take 'sincere' steps to help Turkey manage the flow of migrants, including finding ways to ensure Syrian refugees can return home.[216]  Turkish Islamist Regime Leader Calls on Greece to Open Its Borders[217] Turkey's Islamist regime leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has called on Greece to open its borders to allow tens of thousands of migrants \u2014 most of whom are fighting-age men \u2014 to pass through the country and head to Europe's northwestern welfare states. Erodgan, who convened with EU and NATO leaders in Brussels on Monday, communicated that he will demand 'much more support' if he is to restrain the unrelenting westward flow of migrants trying to enter continental Europe illegally, The Telegraph reports.[218]  Video: Greek Farmer on Tractor Uses Water Cannon to Repel Migrants[219] Video out of Greece shows a farmer on a tractor using a water cannon to repel migrants who are trying to break through the border.

A statement released along with the video said it was 'depicting a Turkish armoured border surveillance vehicle which tries to pull down part of the border fence with a rope', according to Greek newspaper Kathimerini and the Associated Press.[222]  Chris Selley: Toronto's Head Librarian Digs in Deeper in Her Defence of Free Speech[223] There is no conflict between equity and inclusion and free speech, Vickery Bowles insisted: 'They're mutually reinforcing principles' The several hundred people who gathered outside a midtown Toronto library one night last October to tell controversial feminist Meghan Murphy what they thought of her, or to protest the library's decision to rent a room to the group that invited her to speak \u2014 or both \u2014 had ample reason to suspect they had won the day. They certainly told Murphy what they thought of her; you could hear the din from inside the small basement auditorium where she said nothing at all inflammatory, shocking or hateful about the risks to women she perceives in allowing transgender people to 'self-identify.' And the very next day, with just a single vote against, city council directed staff to re-examine the city's room-booking policies and report back. From across the political spectrum \u2014 from councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam on the far left to nominally conservative Mayor John Tory \u2014 politicians spoke of holding public institutions to a 'higher standard' than private ones. It displayed a perfect misunderstanding or wilful misrepresentation of how rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, actually work: The Charter obligates public institutions, not private ones, to protect them. But it sounded good to a lot of people. City librarian Vickery Bowles, who defended the room booking for Murphy both on philosophical principle and as a legal obligation \u2014 as she did in 2017 when a bunch of literal neo-Nazis, including Paul Fromm, booked a room for a memorial service \u2014 had shockingly few public defenders[224]  Cultural Apathy and Atrophy Through Conformity[225] The Government in our democracy can avoid the appearance of being heavy handed and dictatorial by letting the conformist, brainwashed, fear driven masses themselves enforce the latest far left 'standards' of acceptable behavior upon any non-conformists, recalcitrant upstarts, or anyone thinking outside the box by using a form of indirect coercion on hapless victims via a nudging type of soft shaming, dirty looks, avoidance, or non-acceptance. This is a total totalitarianism where one is afraid to say certain things, but more importantly, is required or forced to say other things that they don't agree with or believe. Shame is is used shamelessly as a control weapon by those who have no shame. Being obligated to deny what we believe in or know as fact, and assenting to what we don't believe in is a form of ultimate tyranny, and there is no better way to deaden or destroy the human personality and the desire for personal growth. The result is that people become morbid, cynical, uncaring, and self-absorbed\u2014and make lame excuses for not making a difference or fighting evil. Once people start saying things merely for social approval or for the sake of their careers, they lose their self-respect and probity. They become easy to manipulate and control. This is the purpose, essence, and methodology of political correctness, aka Cultural Communism. Truth becomes a moving target, yet conformity to whatever is truth or 'in' at the moment is required. Real truth then loses all validity and value and is even scorned, which makes it easy for the elites to continuously and flawlessly exercise full powers over the masses without fear of engendering enough blowback to stir a mass uprising.[226]  Federal Court Rules School District Was Right in Firing High School Coach for Silently Praying on 50-Yard Line After Football Games[227] A federal court ruled last week that Washington state's Bremerton School District's firing of Coach Joe Kennedy for his silent prayer on the side line was acceptable. Coach Kennedy was fired in 2015 for silently kneeling after football games on the 50-yard line. According to Kennedy the school said, 'You can choose between your faith and your job,' and then fired him after he continued to silently pray after games.[228]  Middle School Hangs LGBT Flag in Cafeteria, Bans Flag of Traditional Family[229] Marshall Middle School may face a federal lawsuit. A small town Minnesota school has become a center of controversy because of a LGBT pride flag hanging in its cafeteria. Following several weeks of parental and community concern, packed school board meetings, and student anxiety, Thomas More Society attorneys have requested an array of formal documents from school officials to investigate how policies may have been violated in this scenario. Marshall Middle School in Marshall, Minnesota, serves 679 students in grades 5 to 8. The rainbow pride flag, which is used to represent people who have chosen a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender lifestyle, hangs in the school's cafeteria alongside the United States flag and a variety of international flags. A student-circulated petition opposing the LGBT flag and requests to display other flags offered by the school population were not welcomed by the administration. Thomas More Society Special Counsel Erick Kaardal, who has been retained to represent a group of Marshall residents, commented on the situation. 'At the very least, it's divisive and insensitive. It makes it appear that the school supports one group's beliefs at the expense of others.' Kaardal added that when students expressed their concern to teachers and administrators over the lifestyle that the flag promotes, they were bullied.[230]  Prof Who Said 'Whiteness is Terrorism' Doubles Down, Insists He's 'Right'[231] Trinity College professor Johnny Eric Williams doubled down on his prior statement that 'whiteness is terrorism' in a recent opinion editorial.

I feel very privileged to be launching the sculpture 'The Ring For Peace', a symbolic artwork that sheds light on the theme that is gathering all of us here in Lindau, namely Peace between Religions. I thank Dr. William Vendley, Secretary-General of the Religions for Peace for inviting me. I also thank the Federal Government of Germany for co-organizing this important and timely meeting. Yesterday, I was very glad to meet with my good friend President Frank Walter Steinmeier. I echo what he said in his opening remarks that we should all work for peace and respect. I take the opportunity of this moment and invite you to commit to fulfill this recommendation 'work for peace and respect'. I also commend Dr. Wolfgang Schurer, the inspiration behind this sculpture and artist Mr. Gisbert Baarmann for this extraordinary piece of art. Indeed, The Ring For Piece goes beyond its value as an artwork and stands as a connecting and unifying element, of all religions. In many world religions, the ring symbolizes loyalty, truthfulness and honesty. The Buddhist Wheel of Life, the signet ring of the Prophet Mohammed in Islam, the Ring of Solomon in Judaism.
