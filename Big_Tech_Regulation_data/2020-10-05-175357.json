Those discussions took place during technical meetings attended by representatives of the German automakers, as well as Volkswagen's Audi and Porsche units, regulators allege.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although companies can work together to improve their products, European Union rules prohibit them from doing the opposite, \"to not compete on quality,\" the bloc's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said in a news release Friday. \"We are concerned that this is what happened in this case.\"</p><p>As a result, she said, \"consumers may have been denied the opportunity to buy cars with the best available technology.\"</p><p>The E.U. outlined the allegations in a statement of objections, which is a formal step in an antitrust inquiry. The car manufacturers will now have an opportunity to respond to its findings.</p><p>Daimler said in a statement Friday that it is cooperating with the panel and \"does not expect to receive a fine in this matter.\" </p><p>VW said it would \"examine the complaints and issue a statement after evaluating the investigation file as part of its cooperation.\"</p><p>BMW, meanwhile, said, \"Lawful coordination of industry positions on regulatory framework should not be equated with unlawful cartel agreements.\"</p><p>It is unclear what kind of penalties the automakers might face. </p><p>When asked why a company might want to stall or avoid developing new technology, Andre Boehman, a professor at the University of Michigan's Energy Institute, said, \"The simple answer is cost.\"</p><p>In the E.U. case, he added, the resources needed to develop and implement clean-air technology might have required automakers to raise car prices, which can hurt sales.</p><p>The accusations come just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Volkswagen of defrauding investors during the company's extensive diesel-emissions scandal.</p><p>The SEC alleges VW raised more than $13 billion from American investors as top executives cheated emissions tests. The Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker has dismissed the claims and contends the agency is \"piling on.\"</p><p>In 2017, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to fraud, obstruction of justice and falsifying statements as part of a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over intentionally cheating on emissions tests for at least six years. The company agreed to pay as much as $25 billion to American car owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers.</p><p>The E.U. inquiry is the latest in aggressive actions involving big tech. European regulators' litany of investigations and enforcement actions presents a sharp contrast to their U.S. counterparts, who have come under increasing criticism from lawmakers and consumer advocates for taking a far more subdued approach on competition.</p><p>Last month, Vestager fined Google about $1.7 billion on charges its advertising practices violated antitrust laws, marking the third time in as many years that the region's watchdogs have penalized the U.S. tech giant for harming competition and consumers. All told, European regulators have levied more than $9 billion in fines against the company. </p><p>Vestager has acknowledged that an antitrust investigation against Amazon is in an \"advanced\" stage. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Earlier this week, the head of the Federal Trade Commission, the top U.S. consumer watchdog, asked Congress for more resources and authority to pursue privacy cases. Repeated data breaches and abuses of personal information have raised questions about the FTC's ability to challenge big tech companies.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:hamza.shaban@washpost.com\">hamza.shaban@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-880bff0657dd11e9814fe2f46684196e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTN-V611-JCDY-T06R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><timeReceived>11:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 6, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000264W</classCode><className>BAYERISCHE MOTOREN WERKE AG (BMW)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00062F9</classCode><className>VOLKSWAGEN FINANCIAL SERVICES AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002KER</classCode><className>VOLKSWAGEN AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS336991 MOTORCYCLE, BICYCLE &amp;

Those discussions took place during technical meetings attended by representatives of the German automakers, as well as Volkswagen's Audi and Porsche units, regulators allege.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although companies can work together to improve their products, European Union rules prohibit them from doing the opposite, \"to not compete on quality,\" the bloc's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said in a news release Friday. \"We are concerned that this is what happened in this case.\"</p><p>As a result, she said, \"consumers may have been denied the opportunity to buy cars with the best available technology.\"</p><p>The E.U. outlined the allegations in a statement of objections, which is a formal step in an antitrust inquiry. The car manufacturers will now have an opportunity to respond to its findings.</p><p>Daimler said in a statement Friday that it is cooperating with the panel and \"does not expect to receive a fine in this matter.\" </p><p>VW said it would \"examine the complaints and issue a statement after evaluating the investigation file as part of its cooperation.\"</p><p>BMW, meanwhile, said, \"Lawful coordination of industry positions on regulatory framework should not be equated with unlawful cartel agreements.\"</p><p>It is unclear what kind of penalties the automakers might face. </p><p>When asked why a company might want to stall or avoid developing new technology, Andre Boehman, a professor at the University of Michigan's Energy Institute, said, \"The simple answer is cost.\"</p><p>In the E.U. case, he added, the resources needed to develop and implement clean-air technology might have required automakers to raise car prices, which can hurt sales.</p><p>The accusations come just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Volkswagen of defrauding investors during the company's extensive diesel-emissions scandal.</p><p>The SEC alleges VW raised more than $13 billion from American investors as top executives cheated emissions tests. The Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker has dismissed the claims and contends the agency is \"piling on.\"</p><p>In 2017, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to fraud, obstruction of justice and falsifying statements as part of a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over intentionally cheating on emissions tests for at least six years. The company agreed to pay as much as $25 billion to American car owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers.</p><p>The E.U. inquiry is the latest in aggressive actions involving big tech. European regulators' litany of investigations and enforcement actions presents a sharp contrast to their U.S. counterparts, who have come under increasing criticism from lawmakers and consumer advocates for taking a far more subdued approach on competition.</p><p>Last month, Vestager fined Google about $1.7 billion on charges its advertising practices violated antitrust laws, marking the third time in as many years that the region's watchdogs have penalized the U.S. tech giant for harming competition and consumers. All told, European regulators have levied more than $9 billion in fines against the company. </p><p>Vestager has acknowledged that an antitrust investigation against Amazon is in an \"advanced\" stage. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Earlier this week, the head of the Federal Trade Commission, the top U.S. consumer watchdog, asked Congress for more resources and authority to pursue privacy cases. Repeated data breaches and abuses of personal information have raised questions about the FTC's ability to challenge big tech companies.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:hamza.shaban@washpost.com\">hamza.shaban@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-846c7f24-57f1-11e9-814f-e2f46684196e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTX-X3M1-JBFW-C0C6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Every Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 7, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000264W</classCode><className>BAYERISCHE MOTOREN WERKE AG (BMW)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00062F9</classCode><className>VOLKSWAGEN FINANCIAL SERVICES AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002KER</classCode><className>VOLKSWAGEN AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS336991 MOTORCYCLE, BICYCLE &amp;

Those discussions took place during technical meetings attended by representatives of the German automakers, as well as Volkswagen's Audi and Porsche units, regulators allege.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although companies can work together to improve their products, European Union rules prohibit them from doing the opposite, \"to not compete on quality,\" the bloc's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said in a news release Friday. \"We are concerned that this is what happened in this case.\"</p><p>As a result, she said, \"consumers may have been denied the opportunity to buy cars with the best available technology.\"</p><p>The E.U. outlined the allegations in a statement of objections, which is a formal step in an antitrust inquiry. The car manufacturers will now have an opportunity to respond to its findings.</p><p>Daimler said in a statement Friday that it is cooperating with the panel and \"does not expect to receive a fine in this matter.\" </p><p>VW said it would \"examine the complaints and issue a statement after evaluating the investigation file as part of its cooperation.\"</p><p>BMW, meanwhile, said, \"Lawful coordination of industry positions on regulatory framework should not be equated with unlawful cartel agreements.\"</p><p>It is unclear what kind of penalties the automakers might face. </p><p>When asked why a company might want to stall or avoid developing new technology, Andre Boehman, a professor at the University of Michigan's Energy Institute, said, \"The simple answer is cost.\"</p><p>In the E.U. case, he added, the resources needed to develop and implement clean-air technology might have required automakers to raise car prices, which can hurt sales.</p><p>The accusations come just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Volkswagen of defrauding investors during the company's extensive diesel-emissions scandal.</p><p>The SEC alleges VW raised more than $13 billion from American investors as top executives cheated emissions tests. The Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker has dismissed the claims and contends the agency is \"piling on.\"</p><p>In 2017, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to fraud, obstruction of justice and falsifying statements as part of a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over intentionally cheating on emissions tests for at least six years. The company agreed to pay as much as $25 billion to American car owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers.</p><p>The E.U. inquiry is the latest in aggressive actions involving big tech. European regulators' litany of investigations and enforcement actions presents a sharp contrast to their U.S. counterparts, who have come under increasing criticism from lawmakers and consumer advocates for taking a far more subdued approach on competition.</p><p>Last month, Vestager fined Google about $1.7 billion on charges its advertising practices violated antitrust laws, marking the third time in as many years that the region's watchdogs have penalized the U.S. tech giant for harming competition and consumers. All told, European regulators have levied more than $9 billion in fines against the company. </p><p>Vestager has acknowledged that an antitrust investigation against Amazon is in an \"advanced\" stage. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Earlier this week, the head of the Federal Trade Commission, the top U.S. consumer watchdog, asked Congress for more resources and authority to pursue privacy cases. Repeated data breaches and abuses of personal information have raised questions about the FTC's ability to challenge big tech companies.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:hamza.shaban@washpost.com\">hamza.shaban@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-846c7f2457f111e9814fe2f46684196e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTW-TB01-DYX1-H2D6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><timeReceived>10:26 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 7, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000264W</classCode><className>BAYERISCHE MOTOREN WERKE AG (BMW)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00062F9</classCode><className>VOLKSWAGEN FINANCIAL SERVICES AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002KER</classCode><className>VOLKSWAGEN AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS336991 MOTORCYCLE, BICYCLE &amp;

The German cabinet on Wednesday (Sept. 9) approved draft legislation that would expand the powers of the country\u2019s Federal Cartel Office to regulate companies that dominate the internet economy, Bloomberg  reported . The proposal would, specifically, authorize the regulatory agency to act if marketplace platforms take the data they collect and use it to undermine competitors, such as small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).   \u201cIt\u2019ll help many middle-sized companies, but above all benefit millions of consumers by helping them gauge digital offers better and take decisions without being influenced,\u201d Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said, per the news outlet.   The news comes as the  European Commission said  on Tuesday (Sept. 8) that its agency for antitrust policies was looking at rewriting the rules regarding internet sales and distribution platforms.   Last week, Andreas Mundt, Germany\u2019s top antitrust regulator, told reporters  he is watching the battle between Apple and Fortnite developer  Epic Games over access to Apple\u2019s App Store \u201cwith great interest.\u201d   He noted there are only two major app stores globally: the one run by Apple and the other by Google Play. \u201cEvery developer on this planet who produces an app needs to pass through their gates \u2014 that\u2019s indeed interesting, to put it cautiously,\u201d he said.   The fight with Epic  took off last month  when the game developer launched a payment platform that allowed users to go around the App Store and avoid the 30 percent commission the tech giant charges.   For its part, the European Commission said the need for an update in antitrust regulations is particularly \u201cdue to the growth of online sales and of new market players, such as online platforms.\u201d   \u201cThe market has significantly changed, and (our) evaluation has identified a number of issues that need to be addressed,\u201d said European Commission Executive Vice President  Margrethe Vestager , who is in charge of competition policy. The goal, she said Monday in a press release , is \u201cto ensure that the rules remain fit for a world that is increasingly digital and changing at a fast pace.\u201d   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    NEW PYMNTS DATA: HOW WE SHOP STUDY \u2013 SEPTEMBER 2020     The How We Shop Report, a PYMNTS collaboration with PayPal , aims to understand how consumers of all ages and incomes are shifting to shopping and paying online in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our research builds on a series of studies conducted since March, surveying more than 16,000 consumers on how their shopping habits and payments preferences are changing as the crisis continues. This report focuses on our latest survey of 2,163 respondents and examines how their increased appetite for online commerce and digital touchless methods, such as QR codes, contactless cards and digital wallets, is poised to shape the post-pandemic economy.

Closing bell ringing on Wall Street.  Obviously, a very  exciting day on the stock exchange.  The market is down some 51 points.   So, no records for the Dow.  You can stop ringing the bell now, sir.  Thank  you.  There we go.  I don't know what he's taking, but I suggests he stops  doing it now.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's Monday, it's July the 24th.  Tonight, something nasty under the hood.   Shares in German car companies fall amid serious allegations of collusion.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Donald Trump's growth targets seem a long way off if the IMF's numbers are  to be believed.  And an even more special relation, U.K. and the U.S. are  starting trade talks before Brexit.  I am Richard Quest, live in the  world's financial capital and I mean business.  </p><p>Good evening.  We begin tonight with the share prices of Germany's biggest  car companies falling with a new crisis that's threatening one of Europe's  most powerful and important industries.  It's an allegation that German car  makers colluded to set costs, agree on supplies and develop technologies  like emissions systems.  </p><p>According to \"Der Spiegel,\" the newspaper is reporting that under collusion  -- or alleged collusion, went on for more than three decades, involving  hundreds of executives from the companies and their subsidiaries.  The  shares of all three and the day up to one and three percent.  None of the  three, Daimler, Volkswagen or BMW are commenting specifically.  Volkswagen  plans to hold a special board meeting on Wednesday to discuss the  allegations.  </p><p>It all came about, apparently, because Volkswagen revealed to the  authorities as part of the diesel emissions scandal that these meetings had  been taking place.  But, if true, the seriousness can be seen when you  think of how important the automobile industry, the car industry, is in  Germany.  A source of national pride.  If they were found guilty of  collusion.  It will cause damage on three fronts.  </p><p>Firstly, of course, the monetary front.  If the EU found them guilty and  the German authorities found them guilty, monetary fines which could reach  into the billions of dollars.  The commission says it's too early to  speculate.  That's before, for example, in the litigious United States  people decided to sue the companies in this country claiming damages, costs  and compensation.  The reputational damage would be devastating both to the  car industry is the made in Germany brand.  Which is already struggling  after the diesel emissions scandal.  </p><p>And then the broader economy.  In Germany alone, 800,000 jobs are accounted  for in the industry.  It's one-fifth -- 20 percent, of the country's  industrial revenue comes directly or indirectly from the car industry.   Joining me now, Hans-Olaf Henkel, a member of the European parliament and  former director of the Federation of German Industries.  I will preface,  sir, I will preface, if true and if proven, this would be devastating.  </p><p>HANS-OLAF HENKEL, MEMBER OF EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:  Absolutely, Richard.  It  would be devastating, not only because we have, as you rightfully say,  800,000 employees in Germany depending on this sector, we have tens of  thousands of Americans depending also on German car companies in the U.S.   But let's face it, nothing is proven, and as far as I can see, this has not  been a price-fixing deal or something like that, but possibly an agreement  on certain standards.  </p><p>Now, one has to find out whether it is correct to agree on such standards  like the size of the tank for a liquid which you use in order to get the  diesel emissions under control, or whether it has been something more  serious.  But we have to wait and, indeed, if proven correct, it would be a  disaster.  </p><p>QUEST:  There is clearly -- I think you're right, sir, in the sense of the  devil is going to be in the detail.  You know, were we having ad hoc  meetings about minor matters.  You know it's a very fine line on, one, of  interpretation.  Who should take the lead here?  Should it be the  commission in Europe or the national regulators in Germany, do you think?  </p><p>[16:05:03] HENKEL:  Well, clearly a violation of cartel rules is a  responsibility of the European Commission.  The European Commission has  done, in my view, in my observation, the last decades, very good jobs.   They have unearthed some of those scandals.  By the way, some of them also  happened in Germany.  They have levied hefty fines on those companies.  So,  my -- I am rather confident that the European Commission will do a good job  here.  It is their responsibility.  However, if criminal actions are  involved, then it becomes the responsibility of the German system, like in  the case of VW, which, as we all know, this company has manipulated the  software and committed criminal acts.  That is being pursued by the German  system.  </p><p>QUEST:  Can we turn to Brexit if we may?  I read your article recently on  Brexit.  Your family -- if you look at the end of the second round of  negotiations, you still believe that the prevalence of view is that  Monsieur Barnier and Verhofstadt are wanting to punish rather than get a  good deal.  </p><p>HENKEL:  Yes, I think there is ample evidence.  By the way, I'd like to  make sure that your viewers understand.  I was actively campaigning against  Brexit.  But I believe that one should honor the result of the referendum  of the U.K. And in my view, especially Mr. Verhofstadt doesn't.   Verhofstadt is in Europe, the epitome of a centralized Eurofier.  And he is  now in charge of the group within the parliament covering the Brexit for  the parliament.  By the way, he wasn't even elected by the parliament but  was put in place by Her Schultz when he was president of the parliament.  </p><p>QUEST:  Do you believe that there is wiggle room for the commission, or for  the EU, on the pillars?  This idea, for example, of some form of  accommodation on the single market on the customs union but only if you  take freedom of movement.  Is there gray enough area to allow a deal?  </p><p>HENKEL:  I think we have to allow this kind of deal.  Because, let's face  it, Britain is so very important for the EU.  At least as important for the  EU as the EU is to Britain.  And by the way, the assertion of Verhofstadt  and Barnier to say that a country outside the union should not have the  same deal as a country inside the union is deadly wrong.  Switzerland gets  the same deal as the other countries.  And when it comes to the research  agreement, Horizon 2020, which is a big research funding forum for the EU.   Even Israel is even part of the deal and has the same right as any other EU  country.  So why not give it to the United Kingdom.  </p><p>QUEST:  As we end here, sir, we are grateful to have had you this evening.   What is your fundamental fear in these negotiations?  I know it's early  days, only two rounds.  There are another 18 months or so to go.  And  you'll get a chance to vote on the final package, but what's your  fundamental fear?  </p><p>HENKEL:  My fundamental fear is that there is no agreement, and that would  be a true disaster.  By the way, I think Britain leaving the European  Union, quite frankly, means that the last country with common sense is  leaving the European Union.  Because that country always believed in  subsidiary rather than centralization.  That country also believed in  competition between nations rather than harmonization.  And these kinds of  elements are missing.  So, I think Brexit is a bad story, not only for  Britain, it is also a bad story for the European Union.  </p><p>QUEST:  We're grateful you came to talk to us tonight.  Two important  stories we're covering on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  thank you, sir.  </p><p>Shares of the automakers we started out talking about, Daimler, Volkswagen  and BMW.  They pulled down the European indices.  Just take a look.  You  might have expected worse out of Frankfurt but up a quarter of a percent.   The FTSE was the worse off down one percent.  Only Paris ended in the  green.  Ryanair shares were down after warning that fares could fall.   You're going to hear from its chief marketing officer later in the program.   Also warning that Ryanair may actually stop flying from the U.K. if indeed  Brexit talks go badly.  </p><p>[16:10:00] QUEST:  To Wall Street.  The main -- the larger markets, but the  narrow and the wide, the Dow was down.  It's down 66.9.  Right through the  session it was down.  But the NASDAQ actually closed at a record.  And it's  its 50th closing record since the election.  We're going to get the numbers  from Alphabet, which is Google's parent company.  Alphabet is going to  report in this hour.  When it does we'll have the results for you and give  you some analysis.  The NASDAQ is at a record.  You see the S&amp;P 500 and Dow  both up.  Which merely reinforces the significance of tech in the current  market.  We'll talk about that during the course of the program.  </p><p>Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, made a rare  public statement after meeting the Senate intelligence committee.  He said,  he did not collude with Russia during the presidential campaign.  Kushner  is a real estate developer New York.  He is now denying relying on Russian  funds for his own business.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JARED KUSHNER, SENIOR ADVISOR TO U.S. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I did not collude  with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so.  I  had no improper contacts.  I have not relied on Russian funds for my  businesses.  And I have been fully transparent in providing all requested  information.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Jessica Schneider, we don't hear very often from Jared Kushner.  In  fact, I can't remember -- I mean maybe somebody will prove me wrong in that  he spoke once six months ago to a Tea Party or something, but the reality  is, the fact he had to stand there at the White House with microphones is  evidence of the gravity of this.  </p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  It absolutely is.  I mean,  the Russia investigation has really overtaken this town.  It's the only  thing anyone ever talks about because it does have such enormity.  So yes,  of course, now Jared Kushner is trying to confront this head-on.  He said  in his statement that he wanted to do this to set the record straight.  So,  he tried to do that in releasing that 11-page statement earlier this  morning.  And then, of course, again when he finally went before the  cameras to speak for probably the longest we've ever heard him speak  outside the West Wing today.  </p><p>It was a fairly brief prepared statement, but he said in it quite  forcefully that he did not collude with the Russian government.  That no  one in the campaign colluded.  And then he said that his actions were  proper.  You know, Richard, he also talks about the political implications  of this.  He talked about the fact that, in his view, Donald Trump won fair  and square because he properly read the pulse of the American public,  tailored his message to that.  And then Jared Kushner kind of pushed forth  the president's line that we hear a lot, that any indication otherwise is  just unfair to the American people and really ridicules the American  people.  Any implication that the Russian influence may have tipped the  election is not a fair one to make.  So, he put that in there to.</p><p>QUEST:  I want to jump in here because I am fascinated by what you start  off with when you're saying -- Jessica, how -- paralyzes may be the wrong  word.  But the mood in Washington, as you're heading towards a long, hot  summer.  That mood, is it one of paralysis yet over the government and  Russia?  </p><p>SCHNEIDER:  I don't want to say it's more chaos and confusion.  The  president has these agenda items he is trying to tick off.  The things he  talked about a lot in the campaign.  Health care, infrastructure,  overturning and repealing Obamacare, however, all of that has been  overshadowed by the Russia investigation, and that's in no small part.   Because the president keeps talking about it and in particular tweeting  about it.  </p><p>You know, it was just last week that he talked to the \"New York Times.\"  He  talked a lot about Russia.  He talked about his Attorney General, the fact  that he wasn't happy he recused himself.  So really, I don't know if it's  paralysis, although it may be inside the White House.  But really, it's  just kind of chaotic.  It's confusing and the president really can't stay  on message as I think lawmakers wish he would.  </p><p>QUEST:  Jessica, thank you.  Need that.  We needed to understand the  situation in Washington.  Much appreciated.  Thank you.  </p><p>SCHNEIDER:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  Now, staying with economic growth and the president.  Donald Trump  once promised 4 percent economic growth.  He then set the target of 3  percent.  When we come back after the break, this man, you sir, are going  to help us understand.  The IMF says no to 4 percent.  When it says 2.1  percent.  Anthony Chan will be with us to talk about economics.  </p><p>[16:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  You could say the IMF have lost a bit of confidence in Donald  Trump.  On the campaign trail, campaigning Trump, promised to rev up growth  to 4 percent.  He changed that number slightly to 3 percent as the target  growth.  However, the IMF has chopped its own forecast of U.S. economic  growth to 2.1 percent for this year and next, down from 2.3., 2.5.  Now  these numbers are the latest, matched by Standard &amp; Poor's, which is pretty  close.  It says the economic backdrop is benign and uninspired.  The IMF  worries about uncertainty.  S&amp;P is talking about the failure to get an  infrastructure plan this year or next.  Anthony Chan is chief economist at  Chase Bank.  All right.  This is where the rubber meets the road, as they  say.  </p><p>ANTHONY CHAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CHASE:  Absolutely.  </p><p>QUEST:  Your forecast this year and next for the U.S. is what?</p><p>CHAN:  Two percent for this year and about 2.3 percent next year.  We think  some good stuff will come out of the administration next year but this year  will be challenging.  </p><p>QUEST:  Can growth, not should -- I suppose it can.  Is it likely that  growth could hit 3 percent next year or the year after?  </p><p>CHAN:  I think you can see particular calendar quarters which could give  you 3 percent growth rate.  That's not a problem.  But to see the entire  year at 3 percent or more, very challenging because productivity has been  very low and labor markets are so tight that it's very difficult to get  labor force growth.  Remember that at the end of the day you need labor  force growth and you need productivity growth to basically sum up to that  kind of growth rate.  Right now, the numbers do not add up.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, but there are only two ways you can get really, from the  president's point of view, you can get to 4 percent economic, or 3 percent  economic growth.  You either have to cut taxes and hope you don't -- you'll  blow the deficit.  But you will juice up the economy.  Or you increase  government spending.  That is the -- </p><p>CHAN:  There is another third way.  And that is, if you make -- increase  efficiency and that's done through less regulation and more encouragement  on the part -- </p><p>QUEST:  That takes a lot longer than a quarter or three --</p><p>CHAN:  It does take a lot longer.  This is a multi-year process.   Absolutely.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  Are you seeing evidence yet that that is happening, even  though we have lots of regulations have been eliminated and you have the  take two off the table if you put one on.  So, there are changes taking  place.  </p><p>CHAN:  There are changing things that are taking place, but not of a  sufficient critical mass to generate the 3 percent or 4 percent growth rate  that was hoped for.  </p><p>QUEST:  Does it matter that the U.S. is growing at 2.1, 2.3 percent?   Historically that is on the low side.  One might say it's weak growth but  not exactly disastrous.  </p><p>CHAN:  It is not disastrous.  </p><p>QUEST:  It's still growth.  </p><p>CHAN:  Absolutely.  And, Richard, a lot of research out there suggests and,  in fact, strongly confirms, that when you have sluggish growth, economic  expansion lasts a lot longer.  Remember, this expansion just hit eight  years old in June and the average age of economic expansion is 4.9 years.   This is precisely why this expansion has lasted longer than the historical  average, because it's very sluggish, but nonetheless quite persistent.  </p><p>QUEST:  You don't have the feel-good factor with the 2.2 percent growth, do  you?  People don't feel things are going well?  </p><p>CHAN:  People may not feel it, but in terms of equity markets you're  getting that good-feel factor looking at the equity market rates of return.  </p><p>[16:20:00] QUEST:  All right, you've raised the equity markets.  If he  can't get 4 percent, or even 3 percent, he -- I shouldn't be disrespectful.   If the president can't get 4 percent or 3 percent, how much of this market  do you think he's relying on?  </p><p>CHAN:  Believe it or not, the equity market sort of relies more on  corporate profit growth than it does on economic growth.  And what you saw  in the first calendar quarter, you saw almost 14 percent growth in S&amp;P 500  corporate profits.  The second quarter is shaping up to give you a calendar  quarter that's going to be 8 percent or better and, in fact, the whole year  as a whole is certainly poised to give you something close to 8 percent and  next year perhaps something similar.  </p><p>QUEST:  You're suggesting, then, that this -- obviously, to a certain  extent this market is hoping for tax reform, it's hoping for health care  reform, it's hoping for all the things that would give that productivity  growth you referred to, but it's not completely reliant upon it.  </p><p>CHAN:  Not completely reliant.  And in fact, if you get the things that  you've just mentioned, then the corporate profit growth would be a lot much  stronger.  And remember, that the equity market rates of return are the sum  of corporate profit growth plus dividends for the S&amp;P 500.  That's  precisely why we're looking at a number that's above 10 percent for this  year already.  </p><p>QUEST:  Excellent, good to see you.  </p><p>CHAN:  My pleasure.  </p><p>QUEST:  As always, thank you so much.  </p><p>[16:21:15] Russia is warning that the talk in Washington of further U.S.  sanctions is, in the words of Russia, counterproductive and harmful.  The  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskof is reacting to the news that negotiators in  both houses of Congress in the U.S. have agreed on new measures against  Moscow.  Lawmakers say it said to be in front of President Trump in the  next week.  </p><p>Clare Sebastian joins me from Moscow.  Where the seriousness of this -- you  know, to some extent Clare, because you're normally based in the states --  that the whole question of Russia and sanctions just all gets lost, but  where you are there is a seriousness to it.  </p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT:  right, exactly, Richard.  This is  not a nuanced issue here.  The Kremlin has been clear all along that it  does not like sanctions.  It has called them everything from politically  motivated to a violation of international law, and its sovereignty.  In  this case today was no different.  The Kremlin told us they viewed this  extremely negatively.  But they say, that given the kind of mixed messages  they're hearing from the White House they're going to wait, they said,  patiently to see how they finalize their position.  I guess to see whether  or not President Trump is willing to sign this.  But Richard, this is not  going away, the issue of sanctions.  There is always a condition imposed to  have them lifted and Russia is not willing to make any concessions.  We  have a situation where sanctions on Russia from the United States, from the  European Union, are simply becoming the status quo and they're just  evolving.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK.  But this idea of sanctions and Russia.  It's all tied up --  when everybody talks about, hearing over the last few days -- adoption, an  adoption discussion.  And there is the strange Magnitsky law, which you  need to explain and put into context for how it relates to the sanctions  row.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  This was a law imposed in the U.S. in 2012, Richard, in  response to the death in Russia of a whistle blowing attorney called Sergey  Magnitsky.  It's hard to overestimate really just how controversial this  is.  One man who knows that better than anyone else is the man who has  picked up where Sergey Magnitsky left off.  He continues to fight every day  for justice for him.  Take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Nikolai Gorokhov says he's lucky to be alive.  In  March, the Moscow lawyer fell from his fourth story apartment block  sustaining serious head injuries.  </p><p>(on camera):  What happened?</p><p>NIKOLAI GOROKHOV, MAGNITSKY FAMILY LAWYER TEXT:  Unfortunately, or  fortunately I don't remember what happened.  I came to in the hospital care  unit of the hospital.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Russian media at the time reported it as an  accident.  But he fell while trying to wench a bathtub of to his balcony.   Gorokhov says he had lifted much heavier things safely.  </p><p>(on camera):  Is it possible it could have been an accident?  </p><p>GOROKHOV TEXT:  I can suppose that it wasn't an accident because a set of  circumstances suggests that.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  To understand that set of circumstances, you have  to go back a decade.  In 2007, Sergey Magnitsky, a lawyer for investment  firm Hermitage Capital, uncovered a $230 million tax fraud that he claimed  involved officials in the Russian government.  </p><p>(on camera):  Magnitsky was arrested in 2008, and a year later he died at  this Moscow prison while awaiting trial.  His family says he was denied  medical care and a Russian presidential human rights commission found to  have been tortured.  The Russian government though says he died of heart  failure.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The bill is passed.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  The U.S. Congress instituted Magnitsky Act to  which slapped sanctions on suspected Russian human rights abusers.  Just  two weeks later Russia band American adoptions of Russian children.  In  Moscow, Gorokhov took up the case.  The day after his fall he was doing  court with new evidence that he says prove government officials were behind  the fraud.  </p><p>[16:25:00] He finally made it to court in May.  His appeal was rejected.  </p><p>GOROKHOV TEXT:  we continue to fight for the truth.  Because time reveals  new proof of Sergei's innocence.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera):  Are you worried for your safety or for your  family's safety?  </p><p>GOROKHOV TEXT:  Yes, I have safety concerns about what will happen to me,  to my wife, my child.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  At the time of his fall, Gorokhov was also a  witness in a now-settled New York lawsuit alleging some of the Russian tax  fraud money had been used to buy New York property.  He had provided these  documents to American prosecutors, 90 files in total.  According to a court  filing, those prosecutors were worried individuals in Russia could attempt  to threaten or harm him.  Still, in a case that's become a thorn in the  Kremlin's side, Gorokhov remains undeterred.  </p><p>GOROKHOV TEXT:  Justice is -- Sergei Magnitsky deserves justice.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  So, Richard, Nikolai Gorokhov says he actually welcomes the new  attention that surrounding the Magnitsky affair in the United States.  He  says it shows, while there may noting justice for Sergei Magnitsky in  Russia, it may that there's justice for him outside of Russia.  </p><p>QUEST:  One quick question for you, Clare.  I was talking to Jessica  Schneider a moment ago in Washington -- you may have heard us -- where I  was asking about the sense of paralysis or as she describes it as chaos and  confusion in D.C.  over the Russian affair.  How is the whole thing being  portrayed in Russia, in Moscow, this obsession in Washington with Russia?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  I think there is a few elements to this, Richard.  On one hand  Russia is, frankly, quite surprised that it's become this kind of major  issue that it is in Washington.  But on the other hand, they don't welcome  this at all.  They were, in fact, hoping when Trump took office that there  might be a reset in the relationship with Russia, that there might be a  prospect even of sanctions being lifted.  But the fact that Russia has  become this kind of Achilles' heel for Trump that's become so politically  toxic that he may now be in a situation where he is forced to sign a new  sanctions bill on Russia.  </p><p>This is not what Russia was looking for.  They didn't want to be in a  situation where it was simply too politically difficult for the U.S.  president to reset this relationship.  So, there's many sides to this.  And  there's another one in fact that Russia does like to point out that there  is disarray in Washington because it makes them seem stable by comparison.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  So, it's a complicated issue the way this is being received  here.  </p><p>QUEST:  Clare Sebastian in Moscow for us tonight.  Thank you for staying up  late, Clare.  Thank you.  </p><p>As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, from tea to chickens, trade  has bound that U.S. and the United States across the Atlantic for  centuries.  And the prospect of a new deal which we will discuss.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[16:30:36] QUEST:  Hello.  I am Richard Quest.  There's more QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS in just a moment.  Where Ryanair's chief marketing officer tells  me, the company is running out of time to get answers from the British  government on Brexit.  </p><p>And exit without saving.  Microsoft is finally giving up Paint.  On this  network, the news always comes first.  </p><p>President Donald Trump's son-in-law says he did not collude with Russia and  doesn't know of anyone else in the campaign who did either.  It's Jared  Kushner's first public account of his meeting with the Russians during the  presidential campaign and transition.  Jared Kushner is a senior adviser to  Mr. Trump and insisted all his actions were proper.  </p><p>The Pakistani Taliban is claiming responsibility for a bomb blast at  vegetable market that killed 26 people.  Officials say the attack on Monday  targeted the police in Lahore, the capital of Punjab province.  Almost 50  people were wounded.  </p><p>Thousands of protesters demonstrating outside Poland's Supreme Court got  what they wanted much to everyone's surprise.  The country's president  vetoed two controversial measures that would have given his party sweeping  power over the country's courts.  The president said the laws would not  strengthen the sense of justice, he vowed to rewrite them.</p><p>The parents of Charley Gard have given up their legal fight to take their  son to the United States.  They say it was based on new MRI and body scans  that showed it was too late to treat the terminally ill baby.  He has a  rare genetic disease.  He can't breathe or move on his own.  </p><p>Swiss police are searching for a man who went on a rampage with a chain saw  in northern Switzerland wounded five people.  He apparently is a Swiss  national with no fixed address and apparently lives in a forest.  </p><p>The U.K. and the United States have taken the first steps to what could be  a new era in the so-called special relationship.  The British Trade  Secretary Liam Fox is in Washington where he has kicked off informal talks  with the U.S. after Brexit.  Donald Trump has said he wants a trade deal  with the U.K., Britain, and not just any deal, a very big and powerful  deal, he said.  Liam Fox believes the two countries have a strong economic  bond.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIAM FOX, TRADE SECRETARY, BRITAIN:  It is perhaps a cliche for a British  secretary of state to come to the U.S. and talk about the special  relationship, yet the fact that a phrase is well used does not make it any  less true.  Britain and America are united by language, culture, history,  security and, of course, commerce and trade.  It's perhaps fortuitous that  we are also the first and fifth largest economies in the world.  So, the  economic value of our bond cannot be overstated.  Any who are tempted to  see our exit from the European Union as evidence of Britain looking inwards  should think again.  We have just chosen another path, to embrace the wider  horizons of a truly global Britain.  And as we contemplate our new place in  the world, we do so with a renewed confidence and optimism, acknowledging  the vast opportunities that lie before us, especially when it comes to  strengthening our connection with our single largest trading partner.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  And the phrase is \"the economic value of a bond cannot be  overstated\" as Liam Fox said.  Let's show you, over the centuries, how deep  and strong that bond goes back.  It actually goes back to the colonies in  the 1700s.  You can trace it back almost to golf ball equipment, which is  sent, thank you, from the U.K. to the United States.  And then you have,  well, the famous tea.  Tea which was sent from Britain to the U.S., but  with a very checkered history because the tax on tea from the East India  Company, that sparked the revolution.  </p><p>[16:35:00] So, you can arguably say which side that should go.  We'll put  it back with the U.K.  Then, into the 1800s.  And you get some real  technological improvements.  You get, for example, the first transatlantic  telegraph cable, which connects New York and London.  It is the cable that  is used for trading foreign exchange, which is why the British pound and  U.S. dollar cross rate is still called \"cable.\"  By 1900s, and it's the  second world war and the land lease act of Roosevelt allows the U.S. to  support the U.K. in World War II by leasing and lending boats, ships and  other important war product.  So, to the cultural exchanges.  Well, you've  got famous artists going from the U.K. to the U.S., and in return, you have  lots of Hollywood going back the other way.  </p><p>The so-called British invasion goes one way.  Hollywood exports to the  other.  Then bring it right up to date.  Barack Obama, on Brexit.  He says,  Barack Obama, that Britain will be at the back of the que when it comes to  talking trade.  Donald Trump is a campaigner, immediately says the  opposite.  He says he wants a deal.  He wants a deal done fast.  To show  how this trade relationship continues to grow even in this modern era,  think about these two.  The U.K. is now considering chlorine-washed  chickens from the United States.  It is a trade relationship like none  other.  The depth, the range, the breadth, the value.  Jeffries Briginshaw  joins me now.  Even allowing for the extremely extensive relationship, you  and everybody knows that the British cannot negotiate a trade deal until  they've actually left the union.  So, what's the purpose of these talks?  </p><p>JEFFRIES BRIGINSHAW, CEO, BRITISH-AMERICAN BUSINESS COUNCIL:  As you say, a  lot of if, buts and maybes about when Britain can do trade deals.  Customs,  unions and competencies all getting in the way.  Your graphics and your  kind of interesting analysis showed us that the U.K.-U.S. economy is a  source of strength, opportunity and stability.  You don't necessarily need  a trade deal to dial that up, to get more out of it.  I think what we're  seeing with the politics, if you want, encouragement on both sides, is  encouragement, yes, towards a trade deal as part of this jigsaw puzzle post  Brexit but also saying, OK, what can we do in the meantime as well.   Secretary Fox was keen to talk also today about things that could be done  before a trade deal.  </p><p>QUEST:  How much of this is the optics?  How important is it merely by  showing the world that the U.K. is starting talks?  Because at the end of  the day, you and we all know, nothing can really come of it, even if you  get a memorandum of understanding, it will ten years afterwards to get a  full trade deal.  This is about, in some case, hyperbole.  </p><p>BRIGINSHAW:  I would say political encouragement.  Let's focus, then, on  the things that could be done that don't need a trade deal.  Stronger  science collaboration.  Some regulatory cooperation.  Talking about cyber  security and new rules for cyber security.  Data transfers.  Movement of  people.  So, things that don't need trade deals but that could dial up the  potential of what's already a powerful and strong economy.  </p><p>The U.K., well, the EU, as such, does not have a trade deal with the United  States at the moment.  Therefore, is trading pretty much on WTO terms.  If  the U.K., post Brexit, just continues exactly the same way, shouldn't make  much difference for the U.K.?</p><p>QUEST:  Well, that's a great point.  We are already at 20 percent of our  exports going to the U.S. it's a trillion dollars of two-way investment.   $250 billion and a million jobs in both economies.  So, the real  opportunity is how can we dial that up.  Part of that can come from a trade  negotiation, trade and investment negotiation, and part of it can come  from, as I say, the things we can talk about already and do to strengthen  that relationship.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you.  We'll talk more about it  certainly as the deal does or does not come to fruition.  </p><p>Ryanair.  Europe's largest airline.  It is, look at the numbers.  Which  whichever measure you take.  </p><p>[16:40:00] Ryanair says it may have to move its entire fleet out of Britain  if it doesn't get clarity on Brexit.  On QUEST EXPRESS when I was down at  the exchange, Ryanair's chief marketing officer told me the airline is  running out of time to get answers from the British government.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KENNY JACOBS, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, RYANAIR:  So, if we don't have  absolute clarity come August of next year in terms of what's the  alternative going to be to continue open skies, then we are in unknown  territory.  We want to continue flying between the U.K. and Europe as we do  today.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, but you know as well as I do that flying from the U.K. to  another European country and back again is really very simple.  I mean, in  the industry parlance, that's just third and fourth freedoms.  Countries  have those all the time.  It's the much more complicated stuff of intra- European flying when you are using the U.K. fleet that's the problem.  </p><p>JACOBS:  Yes, but flying between the U.K. and Europe is governed by the  European court of justice as part of open skies.  The European government  decided they're leaving Europe and the European court of justice.  Theresa  May has made it clear.  When they do that, there needs to be a brand-new  bilateral in place between the U.K. and every one of the EU 27.  Something  brand-new does need to be created.  We can't go back to the bilateral that  existed.  Hence, we are calling on the politicians.  We are a year since  the referendum and we are not any clearer on what the alternative will be.   We are making contingency plans.  Those would include that, if we can't fly  for a period of time -- again, we don't want this to happen, but we can see  a situation where there may be no flying between the U.K. and Europe for a  number of months.  We don't want it to happen.  We're encouraging the  government to work fast.  </p><p>QUEST:  Now, now Kenny, how much of this is hyperbole?  How much of this is  you raising the temperature in a situation where perhaps nobody  realistically thinks that any routes will be canceled or flights won't take  place.  </p><p>JACOBS:  There will be a solution, Richard.  Absolutely.  There will be a  solution.  But the issue will be, is there going to be a solution in time.   As I said, it's about us planning our schedules and releasing our schedules  a year in advance.  If we don't have clarity we'll be in unprecedented  territory.  As I said, we don't want this to happen but we need greater  urgency in the coming months than we've seen over the past six months.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  Chief marketing officer for Ryanair.  \"D\" is for disappointing.   Alphabet Google has reported its result.  The stock in after-hours is  falling.  I'll give you the numbers as to why Google appears to be  disappointing tonight.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:45:00] QUEST:  Welcome back, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  Google shares down  3 percent after hours.  The earnings down sharply from last year.  Now,  there is a reason why the earnings are off badly in the quarter.  Profits  hit 2.7 billion by the EU, fine.  So, we kick off a blockbuster earnings  week.  Monday is Alphabet.  Tuesday is McDonald's, AT&amp;T and GM.  I don't  need to read them.  You can read them yourself.  They're on the screen.   It's a busy earnings week so far.  Joining me now, Brian O'Keefe, deputy  editor at \"Fortune.\"  These numbers from Google are interesting.  A large  company everybody has heard of.  The numbers suggest it was a good quarter,  but it's got these regulatory issues, which is becoming prevalent for many  companies.  </p><p>BRIAN O'KEEFE, DEPUTY EDITOR, \"FORTUNE\":  I think especially for the big  tech companies.  Ironically, we were just flagging this in the current  issue where we released the global 500.  Apple.  Google, Facebook.  Have  changed globally.  We were expecting maybe Trump to cause complications  with globalization.  Now they're running into regulatory issues in Europe  right now.  </p><p>QUEST:  On the 500, what has grabbed you about it?  It's always the same  suspects, as they say, at the top.  They might move around a bit, but it's  always the biggest companies that are always there.  What did you find  interesting this time?  </p><p>O'KEEFE:  I think there are two big trends which kind of intersect.  The  two are the rise of technology, the fine against Google notwithstanding.   Big tech companies are making a march up the list.  The second big trend is  the rise of China which is really powerful if you look at the numbers.  </p><p>QUEST:  Although those Chinese companies that are moving in, maybe with the  exception of Ali Baba and one or two others they're still domestic based.   They haven't spread their wings to become household recognition outside of  China.  It's the large domestic issue.  </p><p>O'KEEFE:  The largest companies in China right now are still the state- owned companies.  However, we have two debuts this year.  Ali baba.  And  Tencent.  We did a profile on the H&amp;A group.  </p><p>QUEST:  Which has been buying huge amounts everywhere.  </p><p>O'KEEFE:  Around the world.  Europe, the United States.  Their CEO says  they want to be the local company next-door in the U.S. that's drawing  scrutiny itself in China.  So, you know, they have been forced to come out  and just today released information about their ownership stake.  </p><p>QUEST:  This issue of tech, you know, anyone who has got a portfolio that's  sort of balances out, you look at the -- one looks at the gains from your  tech side, and it's 15, 20, 25 percent growth.  </p><p>O'KEEFE:  Right.  </p><p>QUEST:  Unless it's a McDonald's or a special situation, you look at  everything else.  Honeywell, Caterpillar, Ford.  United Airlines.  There is  nothing equivalent.  </p><p>O'KEEFE:  Certainly, tech has been the big, big powerful story.  You look  at Amazon, for instance.  They are number 26 this year.  That's just their  revenues.  The stock has been unbelievable.  Ali Baba, their stock is up  something like 70 percent year-to-date.  It's tempting to put all your  money into those stocks.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  </p><p>O'KEEFE:  I will say, though, you are getting the benefit of that in the  indexes because they're over represented in the market cap weighted index.   A very smart guy, Warren Buffett would say spread your bets on the index  and by the way Berkshire Hathaway is in the top ten this year for the first  time.</p><p>QUEST:  Never split the stock, of course.  I can't remember how much one  share of Berkshire Hathaway is these days.  It is a huge amount.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  He has never split it.  It used to be going against trend but now  it's becoming more common not to split the stock.  It's become cool to not  split the stock.  </p><p>QUEST:  I always thought that's a bit of a strange thing.  Who wants to buy  half a share of Amazon?  Because it's $1,000.  </p><p>O'KEEFE:  Exactly.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  Appreciate it.  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p>Now the results we've been talking about, only tell part of the tech story.   Let me walk you through Silicon Valley and some of the events that have  taken place today that will make it clear what's happened.  First of all,  Microsoft Paint, those of us of a certain age will remember it.  It's age  32.  But now it faces removal.  Because apparently Microsoft is thinking of  dropping Paint from its next version of Windows.  So, could this be RIP.   Paint, '85 to 2017.  Even though there are 100 million users of it.  </p><p>Then you've got an event today.  Web shares.  WebMD.  Look at that.  Just  what we were talking about the other day.  WebMD is being purchased by KKR.   It's bought by the investment firm.  $2.8 billion is the price.  </p><p>[16:50:00] WebMD says the decision is best for shareholders.  But the  premium.  Look at that.  WebMD does nothing, and that's enough to give you  a heart attack.  </p><p>And finally, Mark Zuckerberg shirts.  Now, Mark Zuckerberg's plain t-shirts  cost just $300.  And they -- feel the quality -- they are custom made for  him.  But now the entrepreneur Klaas Buck created a replica.  You can have  a Mark Zuckerberg t-shirt for $46.  And the proceeds will go to the Chan  Zuckerberg initiative.  So, forget Mr. Zuckerberg's.  300.  All yours for  46 and charity.  Imagine trading on Wall Street before the invention of  radio, tv and computers.  Now, it was this machine.  It's known as the  ticker tape.  It changed everything.  We'll look at the history of the  ticker as we have our chapter of stories from the street.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Wall Street, and the stories from the street that we're looking at  over the course of the summer.  And today it is that most famous of  instruments that created a cultural phenomenon but really goes to the heart  of Wall Street.  The ticker tape! </p><p>This is one of the original Thomas Edison tickers.  </p><p>This is the machine that changed Wall Street.  Before radio and TV, the  stock ticker was the way to get accurate financial information.   Transmitted over telegraph lines.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN STEELE GORDON, WALL STREET HISTORIAN:  It revolutionized the stock  exchange business because now you could effectively trade anywhere in the  country and know what the prices were that minute.  The ticker tape greatly  enlarged the reach of Wall Street.  Thomas Edison was one of the inventors  of it.  </p><p>QUEST:  The movies portrayed the breakthrough as a eureka moment.  Soon  after, a New York city tradition was born, the ticker tape parade.  </p><p>The ticker tape also helped document one of the worst days in Wall Street  history, the crash of 1929.  </p><p>KRISTEN AGUILERA, MUSEUM OF FINANCE:  This is undoubtedly one of the most  important pieces of historical ticker tape.  It was recovered from a  trading floor on the morning of the 1929 crash.  This piece of framed  ticker tape represents the first 45 minutes of trading on that tumultuous  day.  </p><p>QUEST:  Ticker machines are collectors' items.  Some go for $15,000.   Ticker tape was phased out in the 1960s.  But we still call it the ticker  as it crawls across the bottom of the screen.  And that's the ticker tape.   Another chapter in our stories from the street.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[16:55:00] QUEST:  And we still, indeed, have the ticker, where you can now  download or read, go to CNN.com/podcast.  Check out the podcast.  Subscribe  on iTunes, TuneIn or Stitcher.  It's all up there.  Or go to  CNN.com/podcast.  Where did you hear about it?  On the ticker.  Profitable  Moment is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's Profitable Moment.  The allegations of collusion by the  big three German car makers, Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW could not be more  serious.  If proven true it will be devastating for the made in Germany  reputation that these three car companies colluded over emission standards,  engine size or whatever.  I suspect the truth will be somewhere in between.   As you heard earlier in the program, I think it will be much more about we  had meetings to discuss common standards.  </p><p>The problem, of course, is when is a meeting on common standards turning  into something more nefarious and dangerous for competition.  This needs a  full, thorough, deep and dark investigation from the commission and from  the authorities in Germany.  Because if it's true, it's likely the sort of  thing we've not seen before.  That's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight.  I  am Richard Quest in New York.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I  hope it's profitable.

Closing bell ringing on Wall Street.  Obviously, a very  exciting day on the stock exchange.  The market is down some 51 points.   So, no records for the Dow.  You can stop ringing the bell now, sir.  Thank  you.  There we go.  I don't know what he's taking, but I suggests he stops  doing it now.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It's Monday, it's July the 24th.  Tonight, something nasty under the hood.   Shares in German car companies fall amid serious allegations of collusion.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Donald Trump's growth targets seem a long way off if the IMF's numbers are  to be believed.  And an even more special relation, U.K. and the U.S. are  starting trade talks before Brexit.  I am Richard Quest, live in the  world's financial capital and I mean business.  </p><p> Good evening.  We begin tonight with the share prices of Germany's biggest  car companies falling with a new crisis that's threatening one of Europe's  most powerful and important industries.  It's an allegation that German car  makers colluded to set costs, agree on supplies and develop technologies  like emissions systems.  </p><p> According to \"Der Spiegel,\" the newspaper is reporting that under collusion  -- or alleged collusion, went on for more than three decades, involving  hundreds of executives from the companies and their subsidiaries.  The  shares of all three and the day up to one and three percent.  None of the  three, Daimler, Volkswagen or BMW are commenting specifically.  Volkswagen  plans to hold a special board meeting on Wednesday to discuss the  allegations.  </p><p> It all came about, apparently, because Volkswagen revealed to the  authorities as part of the diesel emissions scandal that these meetings had  been taking place.  But, if true, the seriousness can be seen when you  think of how important the automobile industry, the car industry, is in  Germany.  A source of national pride.  If they were found guilty of  collusion.  It will cause damage on three fronts.  </p><p> Firstly, of course, the monetary front.  If the EU found them guilty and  the German authorities found them guilty, monetary fines which could reach  into the billions of dollars.  The commission says it's too early to  speculate.  That's before, for example, in the litigious United States  people decided to sue the companies in this country claiming damages, costs  and compensation.  The reputational damage would be devastating both to the  car industry is the made in Germany brand.  Which is already struggling  after the diesel emissions scandal.  </p><p> And then the broader economy.  In Germany alone, 800,000 jobs are accounted  for in the industry.  It's one-fifth -- 20 percent, of the country's  industrial revenue comes directly or indirectly from the car industry.   Joining me now, Hans-Olaf Henkel, a member of the European parliament and  former director of the Federation of German Industries.  I will preface,  sir, I will preface, if true and if proven, this would be devastating.  </p><p> HANS-OLAF HENKEL, MEMBER OF EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:  Absolutely, Richard.  It  would be devastating, not only because we have, as you rightfully say,  800,000 employees in Germany depending on this sector, we have tens of  thousands of Americans depending also on German car companies in the U.S.   But let's face it, nothing is proven, and as far as I can see, this has not  been a price-fixing deal or something like that, but possibly an agreement  on certain standards.  </p><p> Now, one has to find out whether it is correct to agree on such standards  like the size of the tank for a liquid which you use in order to get the  diesel emissions under control, or whether it has been something more  serious.  But we have to wait and, indeed, if proven correct, it would be a  disaster.  </p><p> QUEST:  There is clearly -- I think you're right, sir, in the sense of the  devil is going to be in the detail.  You know, were we having ad hoc  meetings about minor matters.  You know it's a very fine line on, one, of  interpretation.  Who should take the lead here?  Should it be the  commission in Europe or the national regulators in Germany, do you think?  </p><p> [16:05:03] HENKEL:  Well, clearly a violation of cartel rules is a  responsibility of the European Commission.  The European Commission has  done, in my view, in my observation, the last decades, very good jobs.   They have unearthed some of those scandals.  By the way, some of them also  happened in Germany.  They have levied hefty fines on those companies.  So,  my -- I am rather confident that the European Commission will do a good job  here.  It is their responsibility.  However, if criminal actions are  involved, then it becomes the responsibility of the German system, like in  the case of VW, which, as we all know, this company has manipulated the  software and committed criminal acts.  That is being pursued by the German  system.  </p><p> QUEST:  Can we turn to Brexit if we may?  I read your article recently on  Brexit.  Your family -- if you look at the end of the second round of  negotiations, you still believe that the prevalence of view is that  Monsieur Barnier and Verhofstadt are wanting to punish rather than get a  good deal.  </p><p> HENKEL:  Yes, I think there is ample evidence.  By the way, I'd like to  make sure that your viewers understand.  I was actively campaigning against  Brexit.  But I believe that one should honor the result of the referendum  of the U.K. And in my view, especially Mr. Verhofstadt doesn't.   Verhofstadt is in Europe, the epitome of a centralized Eurofier.  And he is  now in charge of the group within the parliament covering the Brexit for  the parliament.  By the way, he wasn't even elected by the parliament but  was put in place by Her Schultz when he was president of the parliament.  </p><p> QUEST:  Do you believe that there is wiggle room for the commission, or for  the EU, on the pillars?  This idea, for example, of some form of  accommodation on the single market on the customs union but only if you  take freedom of movement.  Is there gray enough area to allow a deal?  </p><p> HENKEL:  I think we have to allow this kind of deal.  Because, let's face  it, Britain is so very important for the EU.  At least as important for the  EU as the EU is to Britain.  And by the way, the assertion of Verhofstadt  and Barnier to say that a country outside the union should not have the  same deal as a country inside the union is deadly wrong.  Switzerland gets  the same deal as the other countries.  And when it comes to the research  agreement, Horizon 2020, which is a big research funding forum for the EU.   Even Israel is even part of the deal and has the same right as any other EU  country.  So why not give it to the United Kingdom.  </p><p> QUEST:  As we end here, sir, we are grateful to have had you this evening.   What is your fundamental fear in these negotiations?  I know it's early  days, only two rounds.  There are another 18 months or so to go.  And  you'll get a chance to vote on the final package, but what's your  fundamental fear?  </p><p> HENKEL:  My fundamental fear is that there is no agreement, and that would  be a true disaster.  By the way, I think Britain leaving the European  Union, quite frankly, means that the last country with common sense is  leaving the European Union.  Because that country always believed in  subsidiary rather than centralization.  That country also believed in  competition between nations rather than harmonization.  And these kinds of  elements are missing.  So, I think Brexit is a bad story, not only for  Britain, it is also a bad story for the European Union.  </p><p> QUEST:  We're grateful you came to talk to us tonight.  Two important  stories we're covering on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  thank you, sir.  </p><p> Shares of the automakers we started out talking about, Daimler, Volkswagen  and BMW.  They pulled down the European indices.  Just take a look.  You  might have expected worse out of Frankfurt but up a quarter of a percent.   The FTSE was the worse off down one percent.  Only Paris ended in the  green.  Ryanair shares were down after warning that fares could fall.   You're going to hear from its chief marketing officer later in the program.   Also warning that Ryanair may actually stop flying from the U.K. if indeed  Brexit talks go badly.  </p><p> [16:10:00] QUEST:  To Wall Street.  The main -- the larger markets, but the  narrow and the wide, the Dow was down.  It's down 66.9.  Right through the  session it was down.  But the NASDAQ actually closed at a record.  And it's  its 50th closing record since the election.  We're going to get the numbers  from Alphabet, which is Google's parent company.  Alphabet is going to  report in this hour.  When it does we'll have the results for you and give  you some analysis.  The NASDAQ is at a record.  You see the S&amp;P 500 and Dow  both up.  Which merely reinforces the significance of tech in the current  market.  We'll talk about that during the course of the program.  </p><p> Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, made a rare  public statement after meeting the Senate intelligence committee.  He said,  he did not collude with Russia during the presidential campaign.  Kushner  is a real estate developer New York.  He is now denying relying on Russian  funds for his own business.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JARED KUSHNER, SENIOR ADVISOR TO U.S. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I did not collude  with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so.  I  had no improper contacts.  I have not relied on Russian funds for my  businesses.  And I have been fully transparent in providing all requested  information.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  Jessica Schneider, we don't hear very often from Jared Kushner.  In  fact, I can't remember -- I mean maybe somebody will prove me wrong in that  he spoke once six months ago to a Tea Party or something, but the reality  is, the fact he had to stand there at the White House with microphones is  evidence of the gravity of this.  </p><p> JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  It absolutely is.  I mean,  the Russia investigation has really overtaken this town.  It's the only  thing anyone ever talks about because it does have such enormity.  So yes,  of course, now Jared Kushner is trying to confront this head-on.  He said  in his statement that he wanted to do this to set the record straight.  So,  he tried to do that in releasing that 11-page statement earlier this  morning.  And then, of course, again when he finally went before the  cameras to speak for probably the longest we've ever heard him speak  outside the West Wing today.  </p><p> It was a fairly brief prepared statement, but he said in it quite  forcefully that he did not collude with the Russian government.  That no  one in the campaign colluded.  And then he said that his actions were  proper.  You know, Richard, he also talks about the political implications  of this.  He talked about the fact that, in his view, Donald Trump won fair  and square because he properly read the pulse of the American public,  tailored his message to that.  And then Jared Kushner kind of pushed forth  the president's line that we hear a lot, that any indication otherwise is  just unfair to the American people and really ridicules the American  people.  Any implication that the Russian influence may have tipped the  election is not a fair one to make.  So, he put that in there to.</p><p> QUEST:  I want to jump in here because I am fascinated by what you start  off with when you're saying -- Jessica, how -- paralyzes may be the wrong  word.  But the mood in Washington, as you're heading towards a long, hot  summer.  That mood, is it one of paralysis yet over the government and  Russia?  </p><p> SCHNEIDER:  I don't want to say it's more chaos and confusion.  The  president has these agenda items he is trying to tick off.  The things he  talked about a lot in the campaign.  Health care, infrastructure,  overturning and repealing Obamacare, however, all of that has been  overshadowed by the Russia investigation, and that's in no small part.   Because the president keeps talking about it and in particular tweeting  about it.  </p><p> You know, it was just last week that he talked to the \"New York Times.\"  He  talked a lot about Russia.  He talked about his Attorney General, the fact  that he wasn't happy he recused himself.  So really, I don't know if it's  paralysis, although it may be inside the White House.  But really, it's  just kind of chaotic.  It's confusing and the president really can't stay  on message as I think lawmakers wish he would.  </p><p> QUEST:  Jessica, thank you.  Need that.  We needed to understand the  situation in Washington.  Much appreciated.  Thank you.  </p><p> SCHNEIDER:  Thank you.</p><p> QUEST:  Now, staying with economic growth and the president.  Donald Trump  once promised 4 percent economic growth.  He then set the target of 3  percent.  When we come back after the break, this man, you sir, are going  to help us understand.  The IMF says no to 4 percent.  When it says 2.1  percent.  Anthony Chan will be with us to talk about economics.  </p><p> [16:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  You could say the IMF have lost a bit of confidence in Donald  Trump.  On the campaign trail, campaigning Trump, promised to rev up growth  to 4 percent.  He changed that number slightly to 3 percent as the target  growth.  However, the IMF has chopped its own forecast of U.S. economic  growth to 2.1 percent for this year and next, down from 2.3., 2.5.  Now  these numbers are the latest, matched by Standard &amp; Poor's, which is pretty  close.  It says the economic backdrop is benign and uninspired.  The IMF  worries about uncertainty.  S&amp;P is talking about the failure to get an  infrastructure plan this year or next.  Anthony Chan is chief economist at  Chase Bank.  All right.  This is where the rubber meets the road, as they  say.  </p><p> ANTHONY CHAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CHASE:  Absolutely.  </p><p> QUEST:  Your forecast this year and next for the U.S. is what?</p><p> CHAN:  Two percent for this year and about 2.3 percent next year.  We think  some good stuff will come out of the administration next year but this year  will be challenging.  </p><p> QUEST:  Can growth, not should -- I suppose it can.  Is it likely that  growth could hit 3 percent next year or the year after?  </p><p> CHAN:  I think you can see particular calendar quarters which could give  you 3 percent growth rate.  That's not a problem.  But to see the entire  year at 3 percent or more, very challenging because productivity has been  very low and labor markets are so tight that it's very difficult to get  labor force growth.  Remember that at the end of the day you need labor  force growth and you need productivity growth to basically sum up to that  kind of growth rate.  Right now, the numbers do not add up.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, but there are only two ways you can get really, from the  president's point of view, you can get to 4 percent economic, or 3 percent  economic growth.  You either have to cut taxes and hope you don't -- you'll  blow the deficit.  But you will juice up the economy.  Or you increase  government spending.  That is the -- </p><p> CHAN:  There is another third way.  And that is, if you make -- increase  efficiency and that's done through less regulation and more encouragement  on the part -- </p><p> QUEST:  That takes a lot longer than a quarter or three --</p><p> CHAN:  It does take a lot longer.  This is a multi-year process.   Absolutely.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right.  Are you seeing evidence yet that that is happening, even  though we have lots of regulations have been eliminated and you have the  take two off the table if you put one on.  So, there are changes taking  place.  </p><p> CHAN:  There are changing things that are taking place, but not of a  sufficient critical mass to generate the 3 percent or 4 percent growth rate  that was hoped for.  </p><p> QUEST:  Does it matter that the U.S. is growing at 2.1, 2.3 percent?   Historically that is on the low side.  One might say it's weak growth but  not exactly disastrous.  </p><p> CHAN:  It is not disastrous.  </p><p> QUEST:  It's still growth.  </p><p> CHAN:  Absolutely.  And, Richard, a lot of research out there suggests and,  in fact, strongly confirms, that when you have sluggish growth, economic  expansion lasts a lot longer.  Remember, this expansion just hit eight  years old in June and the average age of economic expansion is 4.9 years.   This is precisely why this expansion has lasted longer than the historical  average, because it's very sluggish, but nonetheless quite persistent.  </p><p> QUEST:  You don't have the feel-good factor with the 2.2 percent growth, do  you?  People don't feel things are going well?  </p><p> CHAN:  People may not feel it, but in terms of equity markets you're  getting that good-feel factor looking at the equity market rates of return.  </p><p> [16:20:00] QUEST:  All right, you've raised the equity markets.  If he  can't get 4 percent, or even 3 percent, he -- I shouldn't be disrespectful.   If the president can't get 4 percent or 3 percent, how much of this market  do you think he's relying on?  </p><p> CHAN:  Believe it or not, the equity market sort of relies more on  corporate profit growth than it does on economic growth.  And what you saw  in the first calendar quarter, you saw almost 14 percent growth in S&amp;P 500  corporate profits.  The second quarter is shaping up to give you a calendar  quarter that's going to be 8 percent or better and, in fact, the whole year  as a whole is certainly poised to give you something close to 8 percent and  next year perhaps something similar.  </p><p> QUEST:  You're suggesting, then, that this -- obviously, to a certain  extent this market is hoping for tax reform, it's hoping for health care  reform, it's hoping for all the things that would give that productivity  growth you referred to, but it's not completely reliant upon it.  </p><p> CHAN:  Not completely reliant.  And in fact, if you get the things that  you've just mentioned, then the corporate profit growth would be a lot much  stronger.  And remember, that the equity market rates of return are the sum  of corporate profit growth plus dividends for the S&amp;P 500.  That's  precisely why we're looking at a number that's above 10 percent for this  year already.  </p><p> QUEST:  Excellent, good to see you.  </p><p> CHAN:  My pleasure.  </p><p> QUEST:  As always, thank you so much.  </p><p>  [16:21:15] Russia is warning that the talk in Washington of further U.S.  sanctions is, in the words of Russia, counterproductive and harmful.  The  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskof is reacting to the news that negotiators in  both houses of Congress in the U.S. have agreed on new measures against  Moscow.  Lawmakers say it said to be in front of President Trump in the  next week.  </p><p> Clare Sebastian joins me from Moscow.  Where the seriousness of this -- you  know, to some extent Clare, because you're normally based in the states --  that the whole question of Russia and sanctions just all gets lost, but  where you are there is a seriousness to it.  </p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT:  right, exactly, Richard.  This is  not a nuanced issue here.  The Kremlin has been clear all along that it  does not like sanctions.  It has called them everything from politically  motivated to a violation of international law, and its sovereignty.  In  this case today was no different.  The Kremlin told us they viewed this  extremely negatively.  But they say, that given the kind of mixed messages  they're hearing from the White House they're going to wait, they said,  patiently to see how they finalize their position.  I guess to see whether  or not President Trump is willing to sign this.  But Richard, this is not  going away, the issue of sanctions.  There is always a condition imposed to  have them lifted and Russia is not willing to make any concessions.  We  have a situation where sanctions on Russia from the United States, from the  European Union, are simply becoming the status quo and they're just  evolving.  </p><p> QUEST:  OK.  But this idea of sanctions and Russia.  It's all tied up --  when everybody talks about, hearing over the last few days -- adoption, an  adoption discussion.  And there is the strange Magnitsky law, which you  need to explain and put into context for how it relates to the sanctions  row.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  This was a law imposed in the U.S. in 2012, Richard, in  response to the death in Russia of a whistle blowing attorney called Sergey  Magnitsky.  It's hard to overestimate really just how controversial this  is.  One man who knows that better than anyone else is the man who has  picked up where Sergey Magnitsky left off.  He continues to fight every day  for justice for him.  Take a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Nikolai Gorokhov says he's lucky to be alive.  In  March, the Moscow lawyer fell from his fourth story apartment block  sustaining serious head injuries.  </p><p> (on camera):  What happened?</p><p> NIKOLAI GOROKHOV, MAGNITSKY FAMILY LAWYER TEXT:  Unfortunately, or  fortunately I don't remember what happened.  I came to in the hospital care  unit of the hospital.</p><p> SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Russian media at the time reported it as an  accident.  But he fell while trying to wench a bathtub of to his balcony.   Gorokhov says he had lifted much heavier things safely.  </p><p> (on camera):  Is it possible it could have been an accident?  </p><p> GOROKHOV TEXT:  I can suppose that it wasn't an accident because a set of  circumstances suggests that.</p><p> SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  To understand that set of circumstances, you have  to go back a decade.  In 2007, Sergey Magnitsky, a lawyer for investment  firm Hermitage Capital, uncovered a $230 million tax fraud that he claimed  involved officials in the Russian government.  </p><p> (on camera):  Magnitsky was arrested in 2008, and a year later he died at  this Moscow prison while awaiting trial.  His family says he was denied  medical care and a Russian presidential human rights commission found to  have been tortured.  The Russian government though says he died of heart  failure.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The bill is passed.</p><p> SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  The U.S. Congress instituted Magnitsky Act to  which slapped sanctions on suspected Russian human rights abusers.  Just  two weeks later Russia band American adoptions of Russian children.  In  Moscow, Gorokhov took up the case.  The day after his fall he was doing  court with new evidence that he says prove government officials were behind  the fraud.  </p><p> [16:25:00] He finally made it to court in May.  His appeal was rejected.  </p><p> GOROKHOV TEXT:  we continue to fight for the truth.  Because time reveals  new proof of Sergei's innocence.</p><p> SEBASTIAN (on camera):  Are you worried for your safety or for your  family's safety?  </p><p> GOROKHOV TEXT:  Yes, I have safety concerns about what will happen to me,  to my wife, my child.</p><p> SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  At the time of his fall, Gorokhov was also a  witness in a now-settled New York lawsuit alleging some of the Russian tax  fraud money had been used to buy New York property.  He had provided these  documents to American prosecutors, 90 files in total.  According to a court  filing, those prosecutors were worried individuals in Russia could attempt  to threaten or harm him.  Still, in a case that's become a thorn in the  Kremlin's side, Gorokhov remains undeterred.  </p><p> GOROKHOV TEXT:  Justice is -- Sergei Magnitsky deserves justice.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  So, Richard, Nikolai Gorokhov says he actually welcomes the new  attention that surrounding the Magnitsky affair in the United States.  He  says it shows, while there may noting justice for Sergei Magnitsky in  Russia, it may that there's justice for him outside of Russia.  </p><p> QUEST:  One quick question for you, Clare.  I was talking to Jessica  Schneider a moment ago in Washington -- you may have heard us -- where I  was asking about the sense of paralysis or as she describes it as chaos and  confusion in D.C.  over the Russian affair.  How is the whole thing being  portrayed in Russia, in Moscow, this obsession in Washington with Russia?  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  I think there is a few elements to this, Richard.  On one hand  Russia is, frankly, quite surprised that it's become this kind of major  issue that it is in Washington.  But on the other hand, they don't welcome  this at all.  They were, in fact, hoping when Trump took office that there  might be a reset in the relationship with Russia, that there might be a  prospect even of sanctions being lifted.  But the fact that Russia has  become this kind of Achilles' heel for Trump that's become so politically  toxic that he may now be in a situation where he is forced to sign a new  sanctions bill on Russia.  </p><p> This is not what Russia was looking for.  They didn't want to be in a  situation where it was simply too politically difficult for the U.S.  president to reset this relationship.  So, there's many sides to this.  And  there's another one in fact that Russia does like to point out that there  is disarray in Washington because it makes them seem stable by comparison.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  So, it's a complicated issue the way this is being received  here.  </p><p> QUEST:  Clare Sebastian in Moscow for us tonight.  Thank you for staying up  late, Clare.  Thank you.  </p><p> As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, from tea to chickens, trade  has bound that U.S. and the United States across the Atlantic for  centuries.  And the prospect of a new deal which we will discuss.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> [16:30:36] QUEST:  Hello.  I am Richard Quest.  There's more QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS in just a moment.  Where Ryanair's chief marketing officer tells  me, the company is running out of time to get answers from the British  government on Brexit.  </p><p> And exit without saving.  Microsoft is finally giving up Paint.  On this  network, the news always comes first.  </p><p> President Donald Trump's son-in-law says he did not collude with Russia and  doesn't know of anyone else in the campaign who did either.  It's Jared  Kushner's first public account of his meeting with the Russians during the  presidential campaign and transition.  Jared Kushner is a senior adviser to  Mr. Trump and insisted all his actions were proper.  </p><p> The Pakistani Taliban is claiming responsibility for a bomb blast at  vegetable market that killed 26 people.  Officials say the attack on Monday  targeted the police in Lahore, the capital of Punjab province.  Almost 50  people were wounded.  </p><p> Thousands of protesters demonstrating outside Poland's Supreme Court got  what they wanted much to everyone's surprise.  The country's president  vetoed two controversial measures that would have given his party sweeping  power over the country's courts.  The president said the laws would not  strengthen the sense of justice, he vowed to rewrite them.</p><p> The parents of Charley Gard have given up their legal fight to take their  son to the United States.  They say it was based on new MRI and body scans  that showed it was too late to treat the terminally ill baby.  He has a  rare genetic disease.  He can't breathe or move on his own.  </p><p> Swiss police are searching for a man who went on a rampage with a chain saw  in northern Switzerland wounded five people.  He apparently is a Swiss  national with no fixed address and apparently lives in a forest.  </p><p> The U.K. and the United States have taken the first steps to what could be  a new era in the so-called special relationship.  The British Trade  Secretary Liam Fox is in Washington where he has kicked off informal talks  with the U.S. after Brexit.  Donald Trump has said he wants a trade deal  with the U.K., Britain, and not just any deal, a very big and powerful  deal, he said.  Liam Fox believes the two countries have a strong economic  bond.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LIAM FOX, TRADE SECRETARY, BRITAIN:  It is perhaps a cliche for a British  secretary of state to come to the U.S. and talk about the special  relationship, yet the fact that a phrase is well used does not make it any  less true.  Britain and America are united by language, culture, history,  security and, of course, commerce and trade.  It's perhaps fortuitous that  we are also the first and fifth largest economies in the world.  So, the  economic value of our bond cannot be overstated.  Any who are tempted to  see our exit from the European Union as evidence of Britain looking inwards  should think again.  We have just chosen another path, to embrace the wider  horizons of a truly global Britain.  And as we contemplate our new place in  the world, we do so with a renewed confidence and optimism, acknowledging  the vast opportunities that lie before us, especially when it comes to  strengthening our connection with our single largest trading partner.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  And the phrase is \"the economic value of a bond cannot be  overstated\" as Liam Fox said.  Let's show you, over the centuries, how deep  and strong that bond goes back.  It actually goes back to the colonies in  the 1700s.  You can trace it back almost to golf ball equipment, which is  sent, thank you, from the U.K. to the United States.  And then you have,  well, the famous tea.  Tea which was sent from Britain to the U.S., but  with a very checkered history because the tax on tea from the East India  Company, that sparked the revolution.  </p><p> [16:35:00] So, you can arguably say which side that should go.  We'll put  it back with the U.K.  Then, into the 1800s.  And you get some real  technological improvements.  You get, for example, the first transatlantic  telegraph cable, which connects New York and London.  It is the cable that  is used for trading foreign exchange, which is why the British pound and  U.S. dollar cross rate is still called \"cable.\"  By 1900s, and it's the  second world war and the land lease act of Roosevelt allows the U.S. to  support the U.K. in World War II by leasing and lending boats, ships and  other important war product.  So, to the cultural exchanges.  Well, you've  got famous artists going from the U.K. to the U.S., and in return, you have  lots of Hollywood going back the other way.  </p><p> The so-called British invasion goes one way.  Hollywood exports to the  other.  Then bring it right up to date.  Barack Obama, on Brexit.  He says,  Barack Obama, that Britain will be at the back of the que when it comes to  talking trade.  Donald Trump is a campaigner, immediately says the  opposite.  He says he wants a deal.  He wants a deal done fast.  To show  how this trade relationship continues to grow even in this modern era,  think about these two.  The U.K. is now considering chlorine-washed  chickens from the United States.  It is a trade relationship like none  other.  The depth, the range, the breadth, the value.  Jeffries Briginshaw  joins me now.  Even allowing for the extremely extensive relationship, you  and everybody knows that the British cannot negotiate a trade deal until  they've actually left the union.  So, what's the purpose of these talks?  </p><p> JEFFRIES BRIGINSHAW, CEO, BRITISH-AMERICAN BUSINESS COUNCIL:  As you say, a  lot of if, buts and maybes about when Britain can do trade deals.  Customs,  unions and competencies all getting in the way.  Your graphics and your  kind of interesting analysis showed us that the U.K.-U.S. economy is a  source of strength, opportunity and stability.  You don't necessarily need  a trade deal to dial that up, to get more out of it.  I think what we're  seeing with the politics, if you want, encouragement on both sides, is  encouragement, yes, towards a trade deal as part of this jigsaw puzzle post  Brexit but also saying, OK, what can we do in the meantime as well.   Secretary Fox was keen to talk also today about things that could be done  before a trade deal.  </p><p> QUEST:  How much of this is the optics?  How important is it merely by  showing the world that the U.K. is starting talks?  Because at the end of  the day, you and we all know, nothing can really come of it, even if you  get a memorandum of understanding, it will ten years afterwards to get a  full trade deal.  This is about, in some case, hyperbole.  </p><p> BRIGINSHAW:  I would say political encouragement.  Let's focus, then, on  the things that could be done that don't need a trade deal.  Stronger  science collaboration.  Some regulatory cooperation.  Talking about cyber  security and new rules for cyber security.  Data transfers.  Movement of  people.  So, things that don't need trade deals but that could dial up the  potential of what's already a powerful and strong economy.  </p><p> The U.K., well, the EU, as such, does not have a trade deal with the United  States at the moment.  Therefore, is trading pretty much on WTO terms.  If  the U.K., post Brexit, just continues exactly the same way, shouldn't make  much difference for the U.K.?</p><p> QUEST:  Well, that's a great point.  We are already at 20 percent of our  exports going to the U.S. it's a trillion dollars of two-way investment.   $250 billion and a million jobs in both economies.  So, the real  opportunity is how can we dial that up.  Part of that can come from a trade  negotiation, trade and investment negotiation, and part of it can come  from, as I say, the things we can talk about already and do to strengthen  that relationship.  </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you.  We'll talk more about it  certainly as the deal does or does not come to fruition.  </p><p> Ryanair.  Europe's largest airline.  It is, look at the numbers.  Which  whichever measure you take.  </p><p> [16:40:00] Ryanair says it may have to move its entire fleet out of Britain  if it doesn't get clarity on Brexit.  On QUEST EXPRESS when I was down at  the exchange, Ryanair's chief marketing officer told me the airline is  running out of time to get answers from the British government.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KENNY JACOBS, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, RYANAIR:  So, if we don't have  absolute clarity come August of next year in terms of what's the  alternative going to be to continue open skies, then we are in unknown  territory.  We want to continue flying between the U.K. and Europe as we do  today.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, but you know as well as I do that flying from the U.K. to  another European country and back again is really very simple.  I mean, in  the industry parlance, that's just third and fourth freedoms.  Countries  have those all the time.  It's the much more complicated stuff of intra- European flying when you are using the U.K. fleet that's the problem.  </p><p> JACOBS:  Yes, but flying between the U.K. and Europe is governed by the  European court of justice as part of open skies.  The European government  decided they're leaving Europe and the European court of justice.  Theresa  May has made it clear.  When they do that, there needs to be a brand-new  bilateral in place between the U.K. and every one of the EU 27.  Something  brand-new does need to be created.  We can't go back to the bilateral that  existed.  Hence, we are calling on the politicians.  We are a year since  the referendum and we are not any clearer on what the alternative will be.   We are making contingency plans.  Those would include that, if we can't fly  for a period of time -- again, we don't want this to happen, but we can see  a situation where there may be no flying between the U.K. and Europe for a  number of months.  We don't want it to happen.  We're encouraging the  government to work fast.  </p><p> QUEST:  Now, now Kenny, how much of this is hyperbole?  How much of this is  you raising the temperature in a situation where perhaps nobody  realistically thinks that any routes will be canceled or flights won't take  place.  </p><p> JACOBS:  There will be a solution, Richard.  Absolutely.  There will be a  solution.  But the issue will be, is there going to be a solution in time.   As I said, it's about us planning our schedules and releasing our schedules  a year in advance.  If we don't have clarity we'll be in unprecedented  territory.  As I said, we don't want this to happen but we need greater  urgency in the coming months than we've seen over the past six months.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> QUEST:  Chief marketing officer for Ryanair.  \"D\" is for disappointing.   Alphabet Google has reported its result.  The stock in after-hours is  falling.  I'll give you the numbers as to why Google appears to be  disappointing tonight.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [15:45:00] QUEST:  Welcome back, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  Google shares down  3 percent after hours.  The earnings down sharply from last year.  Now,  there is a reason why the earnings are off badly in the quarter.  Profits  hit 2.7 billion by the EU, fine.  So, we kick off a blockbuster earnings  week.  Monday is Alphabet.  Tuesday is McDonald's, AT&amp;T and GM.  I don't  need to read them.  You can read them yourself.  They're on the screen.   It's a busy earnings week so far.  Joining me now, Brian O'Keefe, deputy  editor at \"Fortune.\"  These numbers from Google are interesting.  A large  company everybody has heard of.  The numbers suggest it was a good quarter,  but it's got these regulatory issues, which is becoming prevalent for many  companies.  </p><p> BRIAN O'KEEFE, DEPUTY EDITOR, \"FORTUNE\":  I think especially for the big  tech companies.  Ironically, we were just flagging this in the current  issue where we released the global 500.  Apple.  Google, Facebook.  Have  changed globally.  We were expecting maybe Trump to cause complications  with globalization.  Now they're running into regulatory issues in Europe  right now.  </p><p> QUEST:  On the 500, what has grabbed you about it?  It's always the same  suspects, as they say, at the top.  They might move around a bit, but it's  always the biggest companies that are always there.  What did you find  interesting this time?  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  I think there are two big trends which kind of intersect.  The  two are the rise of technology, the fine against Google notwithstanding.   Big tech companies are making a march up the list.  The second big trend is  the rise of China which is really powerful if you look at the numbers.  </p><p> QUEST:  Although those Chinese companies that are moving in, maybe with the  exception of Ali Baba and one or two others they're still domestic based.   They haven't spread their wings to become household recognition outside of  China.  It's the large domestic issue.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  The largest companies in China right now are still the state- owned companies.  However, we have two debuts this year.  Ali baba.  And  Tencent.  We did a profile on the H&amp;A group.  </p><p> QUEST:  Which has been buying huge amounts everywhere.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  Around the world.  Europe, the United States.  Their CEO says  they want to be the local company next-door in the U.S. that's drawing  scrutiny itself in China.  So, you know, they have been forced to come out  and just today released information about their ownership stake.  </p><p> QUEST:  This issue of tech, you know, anyone who has got a portfolio that's  sort of balances out, you look at the -- one looks at the gains from your  tech side, and it's 15, 20, 25 percent growth.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  Right.  </p><p> QUEST:  Unless it's a McDonald's or a special situation, you look at  everything else.  Honeywell, Caterpillar, Ford.  United Airlines.  There is  nothing equivalent.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  Certainly, tech has been the big, big powerful story.  You look  at Amazon, for instance.  They are number 26 this year.  That's just their  revenues.  The stock has been unbelievable.  Ali Baba, their stock is up  something like 70 percent year-to-date.  It's tempting to put all your  money into those stocks.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  I will say, though, you are getting the benefit of that in the  indexes because they're over represented in the market cap weighted index.   A very smart guy, Warren Buffett would say spread your bets on the index  and by the way Berkshire Hathaway is in the top ten this year for the first  time.</p><p> QUEST:  Never split the stock, of course.  I can't remember how much one  share of Berkshire Hathaway is these days.  It is a huge amount.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  He has never split it.  It used to be going against trend but now  it's becoming more common not to split the stock.  It's become cool to not  split the stock.  </p><p> QUEST:  I always thought that's a bit of a strange thing.  Who wants to buy  half a share of Amazon?  Because it's $1,000.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  Exactly.  </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  Appreciate it.  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p> Now the results we've been talking about, only tell part of the tech story.   Let me walk you through Silicon Valley and some of the events that have  taken place today that will make it clear what's happened.  First of all,  Microsoft Paint, those of us of a certain age will remember it.  It's age  32.  But now it faces removal.  Because apparently Microsoft is thinking of  dropping Paint from its next version of Windows.  So, could this be RIP.   Paint, '85 to 2017.  Even though there are 100 million users of it.  </p><p> Then you've got an event today.  Web shares.  WebMD.  Look at that.  Just  what we were talking about the other day.  WebMD is being purchased by KKR.   It's bought by the investment firm.  $2.8 billion is the price.  </p><p> [16:50:00] WebMD says the decision is best for shareholders.  But the  premium.  Look at that.  WebMD does nothing, and that's enough to give you  a heart attack.  </p><p> And finally, Mark Zuckerberg shirts.  Now, Mark Zuckerberg's plain t-shirts  cost just $300.  And they -- feel the quality -- they are custom made for  him.  But now the entrepreneur Klaas Buck created a replica.  You can have  a Mark Zuckerberg t-shirt for $46.  And the proceeds will go to the Chan  Zuckerberg initiative.  So, forget Mr. Zuckerberg's.  300.  All yours for  46 and charity.  Imagine trading on Wall Street before the invention of  radio, tv and computers.  Now, it was this machine.  It's known as the  ticker tape.  It changed everything.  We'll look at the history of the  ticker as we have our chapter of stories from the street.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  Wall Street, and the stories from the street that we're looking at  over the course of the summer.  And today it is that most famous of  instruments that created a cultural phenomenon but really goes to the heart  of Wall Street.  The ticker tape! </p><p> This is one of the original Thomas Edison tickers.  </p><p> This is the machine that changed Wall Street.  Before radio and TV, the  stock ticker was the way to get accurate financial information.   Transmitted over telegraph lines.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JOHN STEELE GORDON, WALL STREET HISTORIAN:  It revolutionized the stock  exchange business because now you could effectively trade anywhere in the  country and know what the prices were that minute.  The ticker tape greatly  enlarged the reach of Wall Street.  Thomas Edison was one of the inventors  of it.  </p><p> QUEST:  The movies portrayed the breakthrough as a eureka moment.  Soon  after, a New York city tradition was born, the ticker tape parade.  </p><p> The ticker tape also helped document one of the worst days in Wall Street  history, the crash of 1929.  </p><p> KRISTEN AGUILERA, MUSEUM OF FINANCE:  This is undoubtedly one of the most  important pieces of historical ticker tape.  It was recovered from a  trading floor on the morning of the 1929 crash.  This piece of framed  ticker tape represents the first 45 minutes of trading on that tumultuous  day.  </p><p> QUEST:  Ticker machines are collectors' items.  Some go for $15,000.   Ticker tape was phased out in the 1960s.  But we still call it the ticker  as it crawls across the bottom of the screen.  And that's the ticker tape.   Another chapter in our stories from the street.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> [16:55:00] QUEST:  And we still, indeed, have the ticker, where you can now  download or read, go to CNN.com/podcast.  Check out the podcast.  Subscribe  on iTunes, TuneIn or Stitcher.  It's all up there.  Or go to  CNN.com/podcast.  Where did you hear about it?  On the ticker.  Profitable  Moment is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  Tonight's Profitable Moment.  The allegations of collusion by the  big three German car makers, Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW could not be more  serious.  If proven true it will be devastating for the made in Germany  reputation that these three car companies colluded over emission standards,  engine size or whatever.  I suspect the truth will be somewhere in between.   As you heard earlier in the program, I think it will be much more about we  had meetings to discuss common standards.  </p><p> The problem, of course, is when is a meeting on common standards turning  into something more nefarious and dangerous for competition.  This needs a  full, thorough, deep and dark investigation from the commission and from  the authorities in Germany.  Because if it's true, it's likely the sort of  thing we've not seen before.  That's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight.  I  am Richard Quest in New York.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I  hope it's profitable.  Same again tomorrow.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Closing bell ringing on Wall Street.  Obviously, a very  exciting day on the stock exchange.  The market is down some 51 points.   So, no records for the Dow.  You can stop ringing the bell now, sir.  Thank  you.  There we go.  I don't know what he's taking, but I suggests he stops  doing it now.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It's Monday, it's July the 24th.  Tonight, something nasty under the hood.   Shares in German car companies fall amid serious allegations of collusion.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Donald Trump's growth targets seem a long way off if the IMF's numbers are  to be believed.  And an even more special relation, U.K. and the U.S. are  starting trade talks before Brexit.  I am Richard Quest, live in the  world's financial capital and I mean business.  </p><p> Good evening.  We begin tonight with the share prices of Germany's biggest  car companies falling with a new crisis that's threatening one of Europe's  most powerful and important industries.  It's an allegation that German car  makers colluded to set costs, agree on supplies and develop technologies  like emissions systems.  </p><p> According to \"Der Spiegel,\" the newspaper is reporting that under collusion  -- or alleged collusion, went on for more than three decades, involving  hundreds of executives from the companies and their subsidiaries.  The  shares of all three and the day up to one and three percent.  None of the  three, Daimler, Volkswagen or BMW are commenting specifically.  Volkswagen  plans to hold a special board meeting on Wednesday to discuss the  allegations.  </p><p> It all came about, apparently, because Volkswagen revealed to the  authorities as part of the diesel emissions scandal that these meetings had  been taking place.  But, if true, the seriousness can be seen when you  think of how important the automobile industry, the car industry, is in  Germany.  A source of national pride.  If they were found guilty of  collusion.  It will cause damage on three fronts.  </p><p> Firstly, of course, the monetary front.  If the EU found them guilty and  the German authorities found them guilty, monetary fines which could reach  into the billions of dollars.  The commission says it's too early to  speculate.  That's before, for example, in the litigious United States  people decided to sue the companies in this country claiming damages, costs  and compensation.  The reputational damage would be devastating both to the  car industry is the made in Germany brand.  Which is already struggling  after the diesel emissions scandal.  </p><p> And then the broader economy.  In Germany alone, 800,000 jobs are accounted  for in the industry.  It's one-fifth -- 20 percent, of the country's  industrial revenue comes directly or indirectly from the car industry.   Joining me now, Hans-Olaf Henkel, a member of the European parliament and  former director of the Federation of German Industries.  I will preface,  sir, I will preface, if true and if proven, this would be devastating.  </p><p> HANS-OLAF HENKEL, MEMBER OF EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:  Absolutely, Richard.  It  would be devastating, not only because we have, as you rightfully say,  800,000 employees in Germany depending on this sector, we have tens of  thousands of Americans depending also on German car companies in the U.S.   But let's face it, nothing is proven, and as far as I can see, this has not  been a price-fixing deal or something like that, but possibly an agreement  on certain standards.  </p><p> Now, one has to find out whether it is correct to agree on such standards  like the size of the tank for a liquid which you use in order to get the  diesel emissions under control, or whether it has been something more  serious.  But we have to wait and, indeed, if proven correct, it would be a  disaster.  </p><p> QUEST:  There is clearly -- I think you're right, sir, in the sense of the  devil is going to be in the detail.  You know, were we having ad hoc  meetings about minor matters.  You know it's a very fine line on, one, of  interpretation.  Who should take the lead here?  Should it be the  commission in Europe or the national regulators in Germany, do you think?  </p><p> [16:05:03] HENKEL:  Well, clearly a violation of cartel rules is a  responsibility of the European Commission.  The European Commission has  done, in my view, in my observation, the last decades, very good jobs.   They have unearthed some of those scandals.  By the way, some of them also  happened in Germany.  They have levied hefty fines on those companies.  So,  my -- I am rather confident that the European Commission will do a good job  here.  It is their responsibility.  However, if criminal actions are  involved, then it becomes the responsibility of the German system, like in  the case of VW, which, as we all know, this company has manipulated the  software and committed criminal acts.  That is being pursued by the German  system.  </p><p> QUEST:  Can we turn to Brexit if we may?  I read your article recently on  Brexit.  Your family -- if you look at the end of the second round of  negotiations, you still believe that the prevalence of view is that  Monsieur Barnier and Verhofstadt are wanting to punish rather than get a  good deal.  </p><p> HENKEL:  Yes, I think there is ample evidence.  By the way, I'd like to  make sure that your viewers understand.  I was actively campaigning against  Brexit.  But I believe that one should honor the result of the referendum  of the U.K. And in my view, especially Mr. Verhofstadt doesn't.   Verhofstadt is in Europe, the epitome of a centralized Eurofier.  And he is  now in charge of the group within the parliament covering the Brexit for  the parliament.  By the way, he wasn't even elected by the parliament but  was put in place by Her Schultz when he was president of the parliament.  </p><p> QUEST:  Do you believe that there is wiggle room for the commission, or for  the EU, on the pillars?  This idea, for example, of some form of  accommodation on the single market on the customs union but only if you  take freedom of movement.  Is there gray enough area to allow a deal?  </p><p> HENKEL:  I think we have to allow this kind of deal.  Because, let's face  it, Britain is so very important for the EU.  At least as important for the  EU as the EU is to Britain.  And by the way, the assertion of Verhofstadt  and Barnier to say that a country outside the union should not have the  same deal as a country inside the union is deadly wrong.  Switzerland gets  the same deal as the other countries.  And when it comes to the research  agreement, Horizon 2020, which is a big research funding forum for the EU.   Even Israel is even part of the deal and has the same right as any other EU  country.  So why not give it to the United Kingdom.  </p><p> QUEST:  As we end here, sir, we are grateful to have had you this evening.   What is your fundamental fear in these negotiations?  I know it's early  days, only two rounds.  There are another 18 months or so to go.  And  you'll get a chance to vote on the final package, but what's your  fundamental fear?  </p><p> HENKEL:  My fundamental fear is that there is no agreement, and that would  be a true disaster.  By the way, I think Britain leaving the European  Union, quite frankly, means that the last country with common sense is  leaving the European Union.  Because that country always believed in  subsidiary rather than centralization.  That country also believed in  competition between nations rather than harmonization.  And these kinds of  elements are missing.  So, I think Brexit is a bad story, not only for  Britain, it is also a bad story for the European Union.  </p><p> QUEST:  We're grateful you came to talk to us tonight.  Two important  stories we're covering on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  thank you, sir.  </p><p> Shares of the automakers we started out talking about, Daimler, Volkswagen  and BMW.  They pulled down the European indices.  Just take a look.  You  might have expected worse out of Frankfurt but up a quarter of a percent.   The FTSE was the worse off down one percent.  Only Paris ended in the  green.  Ryanair shares were down after warning that fares could fall.   You're going to hear from its chief marketing officer later in the program.   Also warning that Ryanair may actually stop flying from the U.K. if indeed  Brexit talks go badly.  </p><p> [16:10:00] QUEST:  To Wall Street.  The main -- the larger markets, but the  narrow and the wide, the Dow was down.  It's down 66.9.  Right through the  session it was down.  But the NASDAQ actually closed at a record.  And it's  its 50th closing record since the election.  We're going to get the numbers  from Alphabet, which is Google's parent company.  Alphabet is going to  report in this hour.  When it does we'll have the results for you and give  you some analysis.  The NASDAQ is at a record.  You see the S&amp;P 500 and Dow  both up.  Which merely reinforces the significance of tech in the current  market.  We'll talk about that during the course of the program.  </p><p> Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, made a rare  public statement after meeting the Senate intelligence committee.  He said,  he did not collude with Russia during the presidential campaign.  Kushner  is a real estate developer New York.  He is now denying relying on Russian  funds for his own business.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JARED KUSHNER, SENIOR ADVISOR TO U.S. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I did not collude  with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so.  I  had no improper contacts.  I have not relied on Russian funds for my  businesses.  And I have been fully transparent in providing all requested  information.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  Jessica Schneider, we don't hear very often from Jared Kushner.  In  fact, I can't remember -- I mean maybe somebody will prove me wrong in that  he spoke once six months ago to a Tea Party or something, but the reality  is, the fact he had to stand there at the White House with microphones is  evidence of the gravity of this.  </p><p> JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  It absolutely is.  I mean,  the Russia investigation has really overtaken this town.  It's the only  thing anyone ever talks about because it does have such enormity.  So yes,  of course, now Jared Kushner is trying to confront this head-on.  He said  in his statement that he wanted to do this to set the record straight.  So,  he tried to do that in releasing that 11-page statement earlier this  morning.  And then, of course, again when he finally went before the  cameras to speak for probably the longest we've ever heard him speak  outside the West Wing today.  </p><p> It was a fairly brief prepared statement, but he said in it quite  forcefully that he did not collude with the Russian government.  That no  one in the campaign colluded.  And then he said that his actions were  proper.  You know, Richard, he also talks about the political implications  of this.  He talked about the fact that, in his view, Donald Trump won fair  and square because he properly read the pulse of the American public,  tailored his message to that.  And then Jared Kushner kind of pushed forth  the president's line that we hear a lot, that any indication otherwise is  just unfair to the American people and really ridicules the American  people.  Any implication that the Russian influence may have tipped the  election is not a fair one to make.  So, he put that in there to.</p><p> QUEST:  I want to jump in here because I am fascinated by what you start  off with when you're saying -- Jessica, how -- paralyzes may be the wrong  word.  But the mood in Washington, as you're heading towards a long, hot  summer.  That mood, is it one of paralysis yet over the government and  Russia?  </p><p> SCHNEIDER:  I don't want to say it's more chaos and confusion.  The  president has these agenda items he is trying to tick off.  The things he  talked about a lot in the campaign.  Health care, infrastructure,  overturning and repealing Obamacare, however, all of that has been  overshadowed by the Russia investigation, and that's in no small part.   Because the president keeps talking about it and in particular tweeting  about it.  </p><p> You know, it was just last week that he talked to the \"New York Times.\"  He  talked a lot about Russia.  He talked about his Attorney General, the fact  that he wasn't happy he recused himself.  So really, I don't know if it's  paralysis, although it may be inside the White House.  But really, it's  just kind of chaotic.  It's confusing and the president really can't stay  on message as I think lawmakers wish he would.  </p><p> QUEST:  Jessica, thank you.  Need that.  We needed to understand the  situation in Washington.  Much appreciated.  Thank you.  </p><p> SCHNEIDER:  Thank you.</p><p> QUEST:  Now, staying with economic growth and the president.  Donald Trump  once promised 4 percent economic growth.  He then set the target of 3  percent.  When we come back after the break, this man, you sir, are going  to help us understand.  The IMF says no to 4 percent.  When it says 2.1  percent.  Anthony Chan will be with us to talk about economics.  </p><p> [16:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  You could say the IMF have lost a bit of confidence in Donald  Trump.  On the campaign trail, campaigning Trump, promised to rev up growth  to 4 percent.  He changed that number slightly to 3 percent as the target  growth.  However, the IMF has chopped its own forecast of U.S. economic  growth to 2.1 percent for this year and next, down from 2.3., 2.5.  Now  these numbers are the latest, matched by Standard &amp; Poor's, which is pretty  close.  It says the economic backdrop is benign and uninspired.  The IMF  worries about uncertainty.  S&amp;P is talking about the failure to get an  infrastructure plan this year or next.  Anthony Chan is chief economist at  Chase Bank.  All right.  This is where the rubber meets the road, as they  say.  </p><p> ANTHONY CHAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CHASE:  Absolutely.  </p><p> QUEST:  Your forecast this year and next for the U.S. is what?</p><p> CHAN:  Two percent for this year and about 2.3 percent next year.  We think  some good stuff will come out of the administration next year but this year  will be challenging.  </p><p> QUEST:  Can growth, not should -- I suppose it can.  Is it likely that  growth could hit 3 percent next year or the year after?  </p><p> CHAN:  I think you can see particular calendar quarters which could give  you 3 percent growth rate.  That's not a problem.  But to see the entire  year at 3 percent or more, very challenging because productivity has been  very low and labor markets are so tight that it's very difficult to get  labor force growth.  Remember that at the end of the day you need labor  force growth and you need productivity growth to basically sum up to that  kind of growth rate.  Right now, the numbers do not add up.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, but there are only two ways you can get really, from the  president's point of view, you can get to 4 percent economic, or 3 percent  economic growth.  You either have to cut taxes and hope you don't -- you'll  blow the deficit.  But you will juice up the economy.  Or you increase  government spending.  That is the -- </p><p> CHAN:  There is another third way.  And that is, if you make -- increase  efficiency and that's done through less regulation and more encouragement  on the part -- </p><p> QUEST:  That takes a lot longer than a quarter or three --</p><p> CHAN:  It does take a lot longer.  This is a multi-year process.   Absolutely.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right.  Are you seeing evidence yet that that is happening, even  though we have lots of regulations have been eliminated and you have the  take two off the table if you put one on.  So, there are changes taking  place.  </p><p> CHAN:  There are changing things that are taking place, but not of a  sufficient critical mass to generate the 3 percent or 4 percent growth rate  that was hoped for.  </p><p> QUEST:  Does it matter that the U.S. is growing at 2.1, 2.3 percent?   Historically that is on the low side.  One might say it's weak growth but  not exactly disastrous.  </p><p> CHAN:  It is not disastrous.  </p><p> QUEST:  It's still growth.  </p><p> CHAN:  Absolutely.  And, Richard, a lot of research out there suggests and,  in fact, strongly confirms, that when you have sluggish growth, economic  expansion lasts a lot longer.  Remember, this expansion just hit eight  years old in June and the average age of economic expansion is 4.9 years.   This is precisely why this expansion has lasted longer than the historical  average, because it's very sluggish, but nonetheless quite persistent.  </p><p> QUEST:  You don't have the feel-good factor with the 2.2 percent growth, do  you?  People don't feel things are going well?  </p><p> CHAN:  People may not feel it, but in terms of equity markets you're  getting that good-feel factor looking at the equity market rates of return.  </p><p> [16:20:00] QUEST:  All right, you've raised the equity markets.  If he  can't get 4 percent, or even 3 percent, he -- I shouldn't be disrespectful.   If the president can't get 4 percent or 3 percent, how much of this market  do you think he's relying on?  </p><p> CHAN:  Believe it or not, the equity market sort of relies more on  corporate profit growth than it does on economic growth.  And what you saw  in the first calendar quarter, you saw almost 14 percent growth in S&amp;P 500  corporate profits.  The second quarter is shaping up to give you a calendar  quarter that's going to be 8 percent or better and, in fact, the whole year  as a whole is certainly poised to give you something close to 8 percent and  next year perhaps something similar.  </p><p> QUEST:  You're suggesting, then, that this -- obviously, to a certain  extent this market is hoping for tax reform, it's hoping for health care  reform, it's hoping for all the things that would give that productivity  growth you referred to, but it's not completely reliant upon it.  </p><p> CHAN:  Not completely reliant.  And in fact, if you get the things that  you've just mentioned, then the corporate profit growth would be a lot much  stronger.  And remember, that the equity market rates of return are the sum  of corporate profit growth plus dividends for the S&amp;P 500.  That's  precisely why we're looking at a number that's above 10 percent for this  year already.  </p><p> QUEST:  Excellent, good to see you.  </p><p> CHAN:  My pleasure.  </p><p> QUEST:  As always, thank you so much.  </p><p>  [16:21:15] Russia is warning that the talk in Washington of further U.S.  sanctions is, in the words of Russia, counterproductive and harmful.  The  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskof is reacting to the news that negotiators in  both houses of Congress in the U.S. have agreed on new measures against  Moscow.  Lawmakers say it said to be in front of President Trump in the  next week.  </p><p> Clare Sebastian joins me from Moscow.  Where the seriousness of this -- you  know, to some extent Clare, because you're normally based in the states --  that the whole question of Russia and sanctions just all gets lost, but  where you are there is a seriousness to it.  </p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT:  right, exactly, Richard.  This is  not a nuanced issue here.  The Kremlin has been clear all along that it  does not like sanctions.  It has called them everything from politically  motivated to a violation of international law, and its sovereignty.  In  this case today was no different.  The Kremlin told us they viewed this  extremely negatively.  But they say, that given the kind of mixed messages  they're hearing from the White House they're going to wait, they said,  patiently to see how they finalize their position.  I guess to see whether  or not President Trump is willing to sign this.  But Richard, this is not  going away, the issue of sanctions.  There is always a condition imposed to  have them lifted and Russia is not willing to make any concessions.  We  have a situation where sanctions on Russia from the United States, from the  European Union, are simply becoming the status quo and they're just  evolving.  </p><p> QUEST:  OK.  But this idea of sanctions and Russia.  It's all tied up --  when everybody talks about, hearing over the last few days -- adoption, an  adoption discussion.  And there is the strange Magnitsky law, which you  need to explain and put into context for how it relates to the sanctions  row.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  This was a law imposed in the U.S. in 2012, Richard, in  response to the death in Russia of a whistle blowing attorney called Sergey  Magnitsky.  It's hard to overestimate really just how controversial this  is.  One man who knows that better than anyone else is the man who has  picked up where Sergey Magnitsky left off.  He continues to fight every day  for justice for him.  Take a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Nikolai Gorokhov says he's lucky to be alive.  In  March, the Moscow lawyer fell from his fourth story apartment block  sustaining serious head injuries.  </p><p> (on camera):  What happened?</p><p> NIKOLAI GOROKHOV, MAGNITSKY FAMILY LAWYER TEXT:  Unfortunately, or  fortunately I don't remember what happened.  I came to in the hospital care  unit of the hospital.</p><p> SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Russian media at the time reported it as an  accident.  But he fell while trying to wench a bathtub of to his balcony.   Gorokhov says he had lifted much heavier things safely.  </p><p> (on camera):  Is it possible it could have been an accident?  </p><p> GOROKHOV TEXT:  I can suppose that it wasn't an accident because a set of  circumstances suggests that.</p><p> SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  To understand that set of circumstances, you have  to go back a decade.  In 2007, Sergey Magnitsky, a lawyer for investment  firm Hermitage Capital, uncovered a $230 million tax fraud that he claimed  involved officials in the Russian government.  </p><p> (on camera):  Magnitsky was arrested in 2008, and a year later he died at  this Moscow prison while awaiting trial.  His family says he was denied  medical care and a Russian presidential human rights commission found to  have been tortured.  The Russian government though says he died of heart  failure.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The bill is passed.</p><p> SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  The U.S. Congress instituted Magnitsky Act to  which slapped sanctions on suspected Russian human rights abusers.  Just  two weeks later Russia band American adoptions of Russian children.  In  Moscow, Gorokhov took up the case.  The day after his fall he was doing  court with new evidence that he says prove government officials were behind  the fraud.  </p><p> [16:25:00] He finally made it to court in May.  His appeal was rejected.  </p><p> GOROKHOV TEXT:  we continue to fight for the truth.  Because time reveals  new proof of Sergei's innocence.</p><p> SEBASTIAN (on camera):  Are you worried for your safety or for your  family's safety?  </p><p> GOROKHOV TEXT:  Yes, I have safety concerns about what will happen to me,  to my wife, my child.</p><p> SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  At the time of his fall, Gorokhov was also a  witness in a now-settled New York lawsuit alleging some of the Russian tax  fraud money had been used to buy New York property.  He had provided these  documents to American prosecutors, 90 files in total.  According to a court  filing, those prosecutors were worried individuals in Russia could attempt  to threaten or harm him.  Still, in a case that's become a thorn in the  Kremlin's side, Gorokhov remains undeterred.  </p><p> GOROKHOV TEXT:  Justice is -- Sergei Magnitsky deserves justice.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  So, Richard, Nikolai Gorokhov says he actually welcomes the new  attention that surrounding the Magnitsky affair in the United States.  He  says it shows, while there may noting justice for Sergei Magnitsky in  Russia, it may that there's justice for him outside of Russia.  </p><p> QUEST:  One quick question for you, Clare.  I was talking to Jessica  Schneider a moment ago in Washington -- you may have heard us -- where I  was asking about the sense of paralysis or as she describes it as chaos and  confusion in D.C.  over the Russian affair.  How is the whole thing being  portrayed in Russia, in Moscow, this obsession in Washington with Russia?  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  I think there is a few elements to this, Richard.  On one hand  Russia is, frankly, quite surprised that it's become this kind of major  issue that it is in Washington.  But on the other hand, they don't welcome  this at all.  They were, in fact, hoping when Trump took office that there  might be a reset in the relationship with Russia, that there might be a  prospect even of sanctions being lifted.  But the fact that Russia has  become this kind of Achilles' heel for Trump that's become so politically  toxic that he may now be in a situation where he is forced to sign a new  sanctions bill on Russia.  </p><p> This is not what Russia was looking for.  They didn't want to be in a  situation where it was simply too politically difficult for the U.S.  president to reset this relationship.  So, there's many sides to this.  And  there's another one in fact that Russia does like to point out that there  is disarray in Washington because it makes them seem stable by comparison.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  So, it's a complicated issue the way this is being received  here.  </p><p> QUEST:  Clare Sebastian in Moscow for us tonight.  Thank you for staying up  late, Clare.  Thank you.  </p><p> As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, from tea to chickens, trade  has bound that U.S. and the United States across the Atlantic for  centuries.  And the prospect of a new deal which we will discuss.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> [16:30:36] QUEST:  Hello.  I am Richard Quest.  There's more QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS in just a moment.  Where Ryanair's chief marketing officer tells  me, the company is running out of time to get answers from the British  government on Brexit.  </p><p> And exit without saving.  Microsoft is finally giving up Paint.  On this  network, the news always comes first.  </p><p> President Donald Trump's son-in-law says he did not collude with Russia and  doesn't know of anyone else in the campaign who did either.  It's Jared  Kushner's first public account of his meeting with the Russians during the  presidential campaign and transition.  Jared Kushner is a senior adviser to  Mr. Trump and insisted all his actions were proper.  </p><p> The Pakistani Taliban is claiming responsibility for a bomb blast at  vegetable market that killed 26 people.

The country's president  vetoed two controversial measures that would have given his party sweeping  power over the country's courts.  The president said the laws would not  strengthen the sense of justice, he vowed to rewrite them.</p><p> The parents of Charley Gard have given up their legal fight to take their  son to the United States.  They say it was based on new MRI and body scans  that showed it was too late to treat the terminally ill baby.  He has a  rare genetic disease.  He can't breathe or move on his own.  </p><p> Swiss police are searching for a man who went on a rampage with a chain saw  in northern Switzerland wounded five people.  He apparently is a Swiss  national with no fixed address and apparently lives in a forest.  </p><p> The U.K. and the United States have taken the first steps to what could be  a new era in the so-called special relationship.  The British Trade  Secretary Liam Fox is in Washington where he has kicked off informal talks  with the U.S. after Brexit.  Donald Trump has said he wants a trade deal  with the U.K., Britain, and not just any deal, a very big and powerful  deal, he said.  Liam Fox believes the two countries have a strong economic  bond.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LIAM FOX, TRADE SECRETARY, BRITAIN:  It is perhaps a cliche for a British  secretary of state to come to the U.S. and talk about the special  relationship, yet the fact that a phrase is well used does not make it any  less true.  Britain and America are united by language, culture, history,  security and, of course, commerce and trade.  It's perhaps fortuitous that  we are also the first and fifth largest economies in the world.  So, the  economic value of our bond cannot be overstated.  Any who are tempted to  see our exit from the European Union as evidence of Britain looking inwards  should think again.  We have just chosen another path, to embrace the wider  horizons of a truly global Britain.  And as we contemplate our new place in  the world, we do so with a renewed confidence and optimism, acknowledging  the vast opportunities that lie before us, especially when it comes to  strengthening our connection with our single largest trading partner.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  And the phrase is \"the economic value of a bond cannot be  overstated\" as Liam Fox said.  Let's show you, over the centuries, how deep  and strong that bond goes back.  It actually goes back to the colonies in  the 1700s.  You can trace it back almost to golf ball equipment, which is  sent, thank you, from the U.K. to the United States.  And then you have,  well, the famous tea.  Tea which was sent from Britain to the U.S., but  with a very checkered history because the tax on tea from the East India  Company, that sparked the revolution.  </p><p> [16:35:00] So, you can arguably say which side that should go.  We'll put  it back with the U.K.  Then, into the 1800s.  And you get some real  technological improvements.  You get, for example, the first transatlantic  telegraph cable, which connects New York and London.  It is the cable that  is used for trading foreign exchange, which is why the British pound and  U.S. dollar cross rate is still called \"cable.\"  By 1900s, and it's the  second world war and the land lease act of Roosevelt allows the U.S. to  support the U.K. in World War II by leasing and lending boats, ships and  other important war product.  So, to the cultural exchanges.  Well, you've  got famous artists going from the U.K. to the U.S., and in return, you have  lots of Hollywood going back the other way.  </p><p> The so-called British invasion goes one way.  Hollywood exports to the  other.  Then bring it right up to date.  Barack Obama, on Brexit.  He says,  Barack Obama, that Britain will be at the back of the que when it comes to  talking trade.  Donald Trump is a campaigner, immediately says the  opposite.  He says he wants a deal.  He wants a deal done fast.  To show  how this trade relationship continues to grow even in this modern era,  think about these two.  The U.K. is now considering chlorine-washed  chickens from the United States.  It is a trade relationship like none  other.  The depth, the range, the breadth, the value.  Jeffries Briginshaw  joins me now.  Even allowing for the extremely extensive relationship, you  and everybody knows that the British cannot negotiate a trade deal until  they've actually left the union.  So, what's the purpose of these talks?  </p><p> JEFFRIES BRIGINSHAW, CEO, BRITISH-AMERICAN BUSINESS COUNCIL:  As you say, a  lot of if, buts and maybes about when Britain can do trade deals.  Customs,  unions and competencies all getting in the way.  Your graphics and your  kind of interesting analysis showed us that the U.K.-U.S. economy is a  source of strength, opportunity and stability.  You don't necessarily need  a trade deal to dial that up, to get more out of it.  I think what we're  seeing with the politics, if you want, encouragement on both sides, is  encouragement, yes, towards a trade deal as part of this jigsaw puzzle post  Brexit but also saying, OK, what can we do in the meantime as well.   Secretary Fox was keen to talk also today about things that could be done  before a trade deal.  </p><p> QUEST:  How much of this is the optics?  How important is it merely by  showing the world that the U.K. is starting talks?  Because at the end of  the day, you and we all know, nothing can really come of it, even if you  get a memorandum of understanding, it will ten years afterwards to get a  full trade deal.  This is about, in some case, hyperbole.  </p><p> BRIGINSHAW:  I would say political encouragement.  Let's focus, then, on  the things that could be done that don't need a trade deal.  Stronger  science collaboration.  Some regulatory cooperation.  Talking about cyber  security and new rules for cyber security.  Data transfers.  Movement of  people.  So, things that don't need trade deals but that could dial up the  potential of what's already a powerful and strong economy.  </p><p> The U.K., well, the EU, as such, does not have a trade deal with the United  States at the moment.  Therefore, is trading pretty much on WTO terms.  If  the U.K., post Brexit, just continues exactly the same way, shouldn't make  much difference for the U.K.?</p><p> QUEST:  Well, that's a great point.  We are already at 20 percent of our  exports going to the U.S. it's a trillion dollars of two-way investment.   $250 billion and a million jobs in both economies.  So, the real  opportunity is how can we dial that up.  Part of that can come from a trade  negotiation, trade and investment negotiation, and part of it can come  from, as I say, the things we can talk about already and do to strengthen  that relationship.  </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you.  We'll talk more about it  certainly as the deal does or does not come to fruition.  </p><p> Ryanair.  Europe's largest airline.  It is, look at the numbers.  Which  whichever measure you take.  </p><p> [16:40:00] Ryanair says it may have to move its entire fleet out of Britain  if it doesn't get clarity on Brexit.  On QUEST EXPRESS when I was down at  the exchange, Ryanair's chief marketing officer told me the airline is  running out of time to get answers from the British government.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KENNY JACOBS, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, RYANAIR:  So, if we don't have  absolute clarity come August of next year in terms of what's the  alternative going to be to continue open skies, then we are in unknown  territory.  We want to continue flying between the U.K. and Europe as we do  today.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, but you know as well as I do that flying from the U.K. to  another European country and back again is really very simple.  I mean, in  the industry parlance, that's just third and fourth freedoms.  Countries  have those all the time.  It's the much more complicated stuff of intra- European flying when you are using the U.K. fleet that's the problem.  </p><p> JACOBS:  Yes, but flying between the U.K. and Europe is governed by the  European court of justice as part of open skies.  The European government  decided they're leaving Europe and the European court of justice.  Theresa  May has made it clear.  When they do that, there needs to be a brand-new  bilateral in place between the U.K. and every one of the EU 27.  Something  brand-new does need to be created.  We can't go back to the bilateral that  existed.  Hence, we are calling on the politicians.  We are a year since  the referendum and we are not any clearer on what the alternative will be.   We are making contingency plans.  Those would include that, if we can't fly  for a period of time -- again, we don't want this to happen, but we can see  a situation where there may be no flying between the U.K. and Europe for a  number of months.  We don't want it to happen.  We're encouraging the  government to work fast.  </p><p> QUEST:  Now, now Kenny, how much of this is hyperbole?  How much of this is  you raising the temperature in a situation where perhaps nobody  realistically thinks that any routes will be canceled or flights won't take  place.  </p><p> JACOBS:  There will be a solution, Richard.  Absolutely.  There will be a  solution.  But the issue will be, is there going to be a solution in time.   As I said, it's about us planning our schedules and releasing our schedules  a year in advance.  If we don't have clarity we'll be in unprecedented  territory.  As I said, we don't want this to happen but we need greater  urgency in the coming months than we've seen over the past six months.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> QUEST:  Chief marketing officer for Ryanair.  \"D\" is for disappointing.   Alphabet Google has reported its result.  The stock in after-hours is  falling.  I'll give you the numbers as to why Google appears to be  disappointing tonight.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [15:45:00] QUEST:  Welcome back, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  Google shares down  3 percent after hours.  The earnings down sharply from last year.  Now,  there is a reason why the earnings are off badly in the quarter.  Profits  hit 2.7 billion by the EU, fine.  So, we kick off a blockbuster earnings  week.  Monday is Alphabet.  Tuesday is McDonald's, AT&amp;T and GM.  I don't  need to read them.  You can read them yourself.  They're on the screen.   It's a busy earnings week so far.  Joining me now, Brian O'Keefe, deputy  editor at \"Fortune.\"  These numbers from Google are interesting.  A large  company everybody has heard of.  The numbers suggest it was a good quarter,  but it's got these regulatory issues, which is becoming prevalent for many  companies.  </p><p> BRIAN O'KEEFE, DEPUTY EDITOR, \"FORTUNE\":  I think especially for the big  tech companies.  Ironically, we were just flagging this in the current  issue where we released the global 500.  Apple.  Google, Facebook.  Have  changed globally.  We were expecting maybe Trump to cause complications  with globalization.  Now they're running into regulatory issues in Europe  right now.  </p><p> QUEST:  On the 500, what has grabbed you about it?  It's always the same  suspects, as they say, at the top.  They might move around a bit, but it's  always the biggest companies that are always there.  What did you find  interesting this time?  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  I think there are two big trends which kind of intersect.  The  two are the rise of technology, the fine against Google notwithstanding.   Big tech companies are making a march up the list.  The second big trend is  the rise of China which is really powerful if you look at the numbers.  </p><p> QUEST:  Although those Chinese companies that are moving in, maybe with the  exception of Ali Baba and one or two others they're still domestic based.   They haven't spread their wings to become household recognition outside of  China.  It's the large domestic issue.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  The largest companies in China right now are still the state- owned companies.  However, we have two debuts this year.  Ali baba.  And  Tencent.  We did a profile on the H&amp;A group.  </p><p> QUEST:  Which has been buying huge amounts everywhere.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  Around the world.  Europe, the United States.  Their CEO says  they want to be the local company next-door in the U.S. that's drawing  scrutiny itself in China.  So, you know, they have been forced to come out  and just today released information about their ownership stake.  </p><p> QUEST:  This issue of tech, you know, anyone who has got a portfolio that's  sort of balances out, you look at the -- one looks at the gains from your  tech side, and it's 15, 20, 25 percent growth.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  Right.  </p><p> QUEST:  Unless it's a McDonald's or a special situation, you look at  everything else.  Honeywell, Caterpillar, Ford.  United Airlines.  There is  nothing equivalent.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  Certainly, tech has been the big, big powerful story.  You look  at Amazon, for instance.  They are number 26 this year.  That's just their  revenues.  The stock has been unbelievable.  Ali Baba, their stock is up  something like 70 percent year-to-date.  It's tempting to put all your  money into those stocks.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  I will say, though, you are getting the benefit of that in the  indexes because they're over represented in the market cap weighted index.   A very smart guy, Warren Buffett would say spread your bets on the index  and by the way Berkshire Hathaway is in the top ten this year for the first  time.</p><p> QUEST:  Never split the stock, of course.  I can't remember how much one  share of Berkshire Hathaway is these days.  It is a huge amount.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  He has never split it.  It used to be going against trend but now  it's becoming more common not to split the stock.  It's become cool to not  split the stock.  </p><p> QUEST:  I always thought that's a bit of a strange thing.  Who wants to buy  half a share of Amazon?  Because it's $1,000.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  Exactly.  </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  Appreciate it.  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p> Now the results we've been talking about, only tell part of the tech story.   Let me walk you through Silicon Valley and some of the events that have  taken place today that will make it clear what's happened.  First of all,  Microsoft Paint, those of us of a certain age will remember it.  It's age  32.  But now it faces removal.  Because apparently Microsoft is thinking of  dropping Paint from its next version of Windows.  So, could this be RIP.   Paint, '85 to 2017.  Even though there are 100 million users of it.  </p><p> Then you've got an event today.  Web shares.  WebMD.  Look at that.  Just  what we were talking about the other day.  WebMD is being purchased by KKR.   It's bought by the investment firm.  $2.8 billion is the price.  </p><p> [16:50:00] WebMD says the decision is best for shareholders.  But the  premium.  Look at that.  WebMD does nothing, and that's enough to give you  a heart attack.  </p><p> And finally, Mark Zuckerberg shirts.  Now, Mark Zuckerberg's plain t-shirts  cost just $300.  And they -- feel the quality -- they are custom made for  him.  But now the entrepreneur Klaas Buck created a replica.  You can have  a Mark Zuckerberg t-shirt for $46.  And the proceeds will go to the Chan  Zuckerberg initiative.  So, forget Mr. Zuckerberg's.  300.  All yours for  46 and charity.  Imagine trading on Wall Street before the invention of  radio, tv and computers.  Now, it was this machine.  It's known as the  ticker tape.  It changed everything.  We'll look at the history of the  ticker as we have our chapter of stories from the street.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  Wall Street, and the stories from the street that we're looking at  over the course of the summer.  And today it is that most famous of  instruments that created a cultural phenomenon but really goes to the heart  of Wall Street.  The ticker tape! </p><p> This is one of the original Thomas Edison tickers.  </p><p> This is the machine that changed Wall Street.  Before radio and TV, the  stock ticker was the way to get accurate financial information.   Transmitted over telegraph lines.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JOHN STEELE GORDON, WALL STREET HISTORIAN:  It revolutionized the stock  exchange business because now you could effectively trade anywhere in the  country and know what the prices were that minute.  The ticker tape greatly  enlarged the reach of Wall Street.  Thomas Edison was one of the inventors  of it.  </p><p> QUEST:  The movies portrayed the breakthrough as a eureka moment.  Soon  after, a New York city tradition was born, the ticker tape parade.  </p><p> The ticker tape also helped document one of the worst days in Wall Street  history, the crash of 1929.  </p><p> KRISTEN AGUILERA, MUSEUM OF FINANCE:  This is undoubtedly one of the most  important pieces of historical ticker tape.  It was recovered from a  trading floor on the morning of the 1929 crash.  This piece of framed  ticker tape represents the first 45 minutes of trading on that tumultuous  day.  </p><p> QUEST:  Ticker machines are collectors' items.  Some go for $15,000.   Ticker tape was phased out in the 1960s.  But we still call it the ticker  as it crawls across the bottom of the screen.  And that's the ticker tape.   Another chapter in our stories from the street.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> [16:55:00] QUEST:  And we still, indeed, have the ticker, where you can now  download or read, go to CNN.com/podcast.  Check out the podcast.  Subscribe  on iTunes, TuneIn or Stitcher.  It's all up there.  Or go to  CNN.com/podcast.  Where did you hear about it?  On the ticker.  Profitable  Moment is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  Tonight's Profitable Moment.  The allegations of collusion by the  big three German car makers, Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW could not be more  serious.  If proven true it will be devastating for the made in Germany  reputation that these three car companies colluded over emission standards,  engine size or whatever.  I suspect the truth will be somewhere in between.   As you heard earlier in the program, I think it will be much more about we  had meetings to discuss common standards.  </p><p> The problem, of course, is when is a meeting on common standards turning  into something more nefarious and dangerous for competition.  This needs a  full, thorough, deep and dark investigation from the commission and from  the authorities in Germany.  Because if it's true, it's likely the sort of  thing we've not seen before.  That's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight.  I  am Richard Quest in New York.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I  hope it's profitable.  Same again tomorrow.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Closing bell ringing on Wall Street.  Obviously, a very  exciting day on the stock exchange.  The market is down some 51 points.   So, no records for the Dow.  You can stop ringing the bell now, sir.  Thank  you.  There we go.  I don't know what he's taking, but I suggests he stops  doing it now.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's Monday, it's July the 24th.  Tonight, something nasty under the hood.   Shares in German car companies fall amid serious allegations of collusion.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Donald Trump's growth targets seem a long way off if the IMF's numbers are  to be believed.  And an even more special relation, U.K. and the U.S. are  starting trade talks before Brexit.  I am Richard Quest, live in the  world's financial capital and I mean business.  </p><p>Good evening.  We begin tonight with the share prices of Germany's biggest  car companies falling with a new crisis that's threatening one of Europe's  most powerful and important industries.  It's an allegation that German car  makers colluded to set costs, agree on supplies and develop technologies  like emissions systems.  </p><p>According to \"Der Spiegel,\" the newspaper is reporting that under collusion  -- or alleged collusion, went on for more than three decades, involving  hundreds of executives from the companies and their subsidiaries.  The  shares of all three and the day up to one and three percent.  None of the  three, Daimler, Volkswagen or BMW are commenting specifically.  Volkswagen  plans to hold a special board meeting on Wednesday to discuss the  allegations.  </p><p>It all came about, apparently, because Volkswagen revealed to the  authorities as part of the diesel emissions scandal that these meetings had  been taking place.  But, if true, the seriousness can be seen when you  think of how important the automobile industry, the car industry, is in  Germany.  A source of national pride.  If they were found guilty of  collusion.  It will cause damage on three fronts.  </p><p>Firstly, of course, the monetary front.  If the EU found them guilty and  the German authorities found them guilty, monetary fines which could reach  into the billions of dollars.  The commission says it's too early to  speculate.  That's before, for example, in the litigious United States  people decided to sue the companies in this country claiming damages, costs  and compensation.  The reputational damage would be devastating both to the  car industry is the made in Germany brand.  Which is already struggling  after the diesel emissions scandal.  </p><p>And then the broader economy.  In Germany alone, 800,000 jobs are accounted  for in the industry.  It's one-fifth -- 20 percent, of the country's  industrial revenue comes directly or indirectly from the car industry.   Joining me now, Hans-Olaf Henkel, a member of the European parliament and  former director of the Federation of German Industries.  I will preface,  sir, I will preface, if true and if proven, this would be devastating.  </p><p>HANS-OLAF HENKEL, MEMBER OF EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:  Absolutely, Richard.  It  would be devastating, not only because we have, as you rightfully say,  800,000 employees in Germany depending on this sector, we have tens of  thousands of Americans depending also on German car companies in the U.S.   But let's face it, nothing is proven, and as far as I can see, this has not  been a price-fixing deal or something like that, but possibly an agreement  on certain standards.  </p><p>Now, one has to find out whether it is correct to agree on such standards  like the size of the tank for a liquid which you use in order to get the  diesel emissions under control, or whether it has been something more  serious.  But we have to wait and, indeed, if proven correct, it would be a  disaster.  </p><p>QUEST:  There is clearly -- I think you're right, sir, in the sense of the  devil is going to be in the detail.  You know, were we having ad hoc  meetings about minor matters.  You know it's a very fine line on, one, of  interpretation.  Who should take the lead here?  Should it be the  commission in Europe or the national regulators in Germany, do you think?  </p><p>[16:05:03] HENKEL:  Well, clearly a violation of cartel rules is a  responsibility of the European Commission.  The European Commission has  done, in my view, in my observation, the last decades, very good jobs.   They have unearthed some of those scandals.  By the way, some of them also  happened in Germany.  They have levied hefty fines on those companies.  So,  my -- I am rather confident that the European Commission will do a good job  here.  It is their responsibility.  However, if criminal actions are  involved, then it becomes the responsibility of the German system, like in  the case of VW, which, as we all know, this company has manipulated the  software and committed criminal acts.  That is being pursued by the German  system.  </p><p>QUEST:  Can we turn to Brexit if we may?  I read your article recently on  Brexit.  Your family -- if you look at the end of the second round of  negotiations, you still believe that the prevalence of view is that  Monsieur Barnier and Verhofstadt are wanting to punish rather than get a  good deal.  </p><p>HENKEL:  Yes, I think there is ample evidence.  By the way, I'd like to  make sure that your viewers understand.  I was actively campaigning against  Brexit.  But I believe that one should honor the result of the referendum  of the U.K. And in my view, especially Mr. Verhofstadt doesn't.   Verhofstadt is in Europe, the epitome of a centralized Eurofier.  And he is  now in charge of the group within the parliament covering the Brexit for  the parliament.  By the way, he wasn't even elected by the parliament but  was put in place by Her Schultz when he was president of the parliament.  </p><p>QUEST:  Do you believe that there is wiggle room for the commission, or for  the EU, on the pillars?  This idea, for example, of some form of  accommodation on the single market on the customs union but only if you  take freedom of movement.  Is there gray enough area to allow a deal?  </p><p>HENKEL:  I think we have to allow this kind of deal.  Because, let's face  it, Britain is so very important for the EU.  At least as important for the  EU as the EU is to Britain.  And by the way, the assertion of Verhofstadt  and Barnier to say that a country outside the union should not have the  same deal as a country inside the union is deadly wrong.  Switzerland gets  the same deal as the other countries.  And when it comes to the research  agreement, Horizon 2020, which is a big research funding forum for the EU.   Even Israel is even part of the deal and has the same right as any other EU  country.  So why not give it to the United Kingdom.  </p><p>QUEST:  As we end here, sir, we are grateful to have had you this evening.   What is your fundamental fear in these negotiations?  I know it's early  days, only two rounds.  There are another 18 months or so to go.  And  you'll get a chance to vote on the final package, but what's your  fundamental fear?  </p><p>HENKEL:  My fundamental fear is that there is no agreement, and that would  be a true disaster.  By the way, I think Britain leaving the European  Union, quite frankly, means that the last country with common sense is  leaving the European Union.  Because that country always believed in  subsidiary rather than centralization.  That country also believed in  competition between nations rather than harmonization.  And these kinds of  elements are missing.  So, I think Brexit is a bad story, not only for  Britain, it is also a bad story for the European Union.  </p><p>QUEST:  We're grateful you came to talk to us tonight.  Two important  stories we're covering on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  thank you, sir.  </p><p>Shares of the automakers we started out talking about, Daimler, Volkswagen  and BMW.  They pulled down the European indices.  Just take a look.  You  might have expected worse out of Frankfurt but up a quarter of a percent.   The FTSE was the worse off down one percent.  Only Paris ended in the  green.  Ryanair shares were down after warning that fares could fall.   You're going to hear from its chief marketing officer later in the program.   Also warning that Ryanair may actually stop flying from the U.K. if indeed  Brexit talks go badly.  </p><p>[16:10:00] QUEST:  To Wall Street.  The main -- the larger markets, but the  narrow and the wide, the Dow was down.  It's down 66.9.  Right through the  session it was down.  But the NASDAQ actually closed at a record.  And it's  its 50th closing record since the election.  We're going to get the numbers  from Alphabet, which is Google's parent company.  Alphabet is going to  report in this hour.  When it does we'll have the results for you and give  you some analysis.  The NASDAQ is at a record.  You see the S&amp;P 500 and Dow  both up.  Which merely reinforces the significance of tech in the current  market.  We'll talk about that during the course of the program.  </p><p>Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, made a rare  public statement after meeting the Senate intelligence committee.  He said,  he did not collude with Russia during the presidential campaign.  Kushner  is a real estate developer New York.  He is now denying relying on Russian  funds for his own business.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JARED KUSHNER, SENIOR ADVISOR TO U.S. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I did not collude  with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so.  I  had no improper contacts.  I have not relied on Russian funds for my  businesses.  And I have been fully transparent in providing all requested  information.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Jessica Schneider, we don't hear very often from Jared Kushner.  In  fact, I can't remember -- I mean maybe somebody will prove me wrong in that  he spoke once six months ago to a Tea Party or something, but the reality  is, the fact he had to stand there at the White House with microphones is  evidence of the gravity of this.  </p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  It absolutely is.  I mean,  the Russia investigation has really overtaken this town.  It's the only  thing anyone ever talks about because it does have such enormity.  So yes,  of course, now Jared Kushner is trying to confront this head-on.  He said  in his statement that he wanted to do this to set the record straight.  So,  he tried to do that in releasing that 11-page statement earlier this  morning.  And then, of course, again when he finally went before the  cameras to speak for probably the longest we've ever heard him speak  outside the West Wing today.  </p><p>It was a fairly brief prepared statement, but he said in it quite  forcefully that he did not collude with the Russian government.  That no  one in the campaign colluded.  And then he said that his actions were  proper.  You know, Richard, he also talks about the political implications  of this.  He talked about the fact that, in his view, Donald Trump won fair  and square because he properly read the pulse of the American public,  tailored his message to that.  And then Jared Kushner kind of pushed forth  the president's line that we hear a lot, that any indication otherwise is  just unfair to the American people and really ridicules the American  people.  Any implication that the Russian influence may have tipped the  election is not a fair one to make.  So, he put that in there to.</p><p>QUEST:  I want to jump in here because I am fascinated by what you start  off with when you're saying -- Jessica, how -- paralyzes may be the wrong  word.  But the mood in Washington, as you're heading towards a long, hot  summer.  That mood, is it one of paralysis yet over the government and  Russia?  </p><p>SCHNEIDER:  I don't want to say it's more chaos and confusion.  The  president has these agenda items he is trying to tick off.  The things he  talked about a lot in the campaign.  Health care, infrastructure,  overturning and repealing Obamacare, however, all of that has been  overshadowed by the Russia investigation, and that's in no small part.   Because the president keeps talking about it and in particular tweeting  about it.  </p><p>You know, it was just last week that he talked to the \"New York Times.\"  He  talked a lot about Russia.  He talked about his Attorney General, the fact  that he wasn't happy he recused himself.  So really, I don't know if it's  paralysis, although it may be inside the White House.  But really, it's  just kind of chaotic.  It's confusing and the president really can't stay  on message as I think lawmakers wish he would.  </p><p>QUEST:  Jessica, thank you.  Need that.  We needed to understand the  situation in Washington.  Much appreciated.  Thank you.  </p><p>SCHNEIDER:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  Now, staying with economic growth and the president.  Donald Trump  once promised 4 percent economic growth.  He then set the target of 3  percent.  When we come back after the break, this man, you sir, are going  to help us understand.  The IMF says no to 4 percent.  When it says 2.1  percent.  Anthony Chan will be with us to talk about economics.  </p><p>[16:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  You could say the IMF have lost a bit of confidence in Donald  Trump.  On the campaign trail, campaigning Trump, promised to rev up growth  to 4 percent.  He changed that number slightly to 3 percent as the target  growth.  However, the IMF has chopped its own forecast of U.S. economic  growth to 2.1 percent for this year and next, down from 2.3., 2.5.  Now  these numbers are the latest, matched by Standard &amp; Poor's, which is pretty  close.  It says the economic backdrop is benign and uninspired.  The IMF  worries about uncertainty.  S&amp;P is talking about the failure to get an  infrastructure plan this year or next.  Anthony Chan is chief economist at  Chase Bank.  All right.  This is where the rubber meets the road, as they  say.  </p><p>ANTHONY CHAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CHASE:  Absolutely.  </p><p>QUEST:  Your forecast this year and next for the U.S. is what?</p><p>CHAN:  Two percent for this year and about 2.3 percent next year.  We think  some good stuff will come out of the administration next year but this year  will be challenging.  </p><p>QUEST:  Can growth, not should -- I suppose it can.  Is it likely that  growth could hit 3 percent next year or the year after?  </p><p>CHAN:  I think you can see particular calendar quarters which could give  you 3 percent growth rate.  That's not a problem.  But to see the entire  year at 3 percent or more, very challenging because productivity has been  very low and labor markets are so tight that it's very difficult to get  labor force growth.  Remember that at the end of the day you need labor  force growth and you need productivity growth to basically sum up to that  kind of growth rate.  Right now, the numbers do not add up.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, but there are only two ways you can get really, from the  president's point of view, you can get to 4 percent economic, or 3 percent  economic growth.  You either have to cut taxes and hope you don't -- you'll  blow the deficit.  But you will juice up the economy.  Or you increase  government spending.  That is the -- </p><p>CHAN:  There is another third way.  And that is, if you make -- increase  efficiency and that's done through less regulation and more encouragement  on the part -- </p><p>QUEST:  That takes a lot longer than a quarter or three --</p><p>CHAN:  It does take a lot longer.  This is a multi-year process.   Absolutely.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  Are you seeing evidence yet that that is happening, even  though we have lots of regulations have been eliminated and you have the  take two off the table if you put one on.  So, there are changes taking  place.  </p><p>CHAN:  There are changing things that are taking place, but not of a  sufficient critical mass to generate the 3 percent or 4 percent growth rate  that was hoped for.  </p><p>QUEST:  Does it matter that the U.S. is growing at 2.1, 2.3 percent?   Historically that is on the low side.  One might say it's weak growth but  not exactly disastrous.  </p><p>CHAN:  It is not disastrous.  </p><p>QUEST:  It's still growth.  </p><p>CHAN:  Absolutely.  And, Richard, a lot of research out there suggests and,  in fact, strongly confirms, that when you have sluggish growth, economic  expansion lasts a lot longer.  Remember, this expansion just hit eight  years old in June and the average age of economic expansion is 4.9 years.   This is precisely why this expansion has lasted longer than the historical  average, because it's very sluggish, but nonetheless quite persistent.  </p><p>QUEST:  You don't have the feel-good factor with the 2.2 percent growth, do  you?  People don't feel things are going well?  </p><p>CHAN:  People may not feel it, but in terms of equity markets you're  getting that good-feel factor looking at the equity market rates of return.  </p><p>[16:20:00] QUEST:  All right, you've raised the equity markets.  If he  can't get 4 percent, or even 3 percent, he -- I shouldn't be disrespectful.   If the president can't get 4 percent or 3 percent, how much of this market  do you think he's relying on?  </p><p>CHAN:  Believe it or not, the equity market sort of relies more on  corporate profit growth than it does on economic growth.  And what you saw  in the first calendar quarter, you saw almost 14 percent growth in S&amp;P 500  corporate profits.  The second quarter is shaping up to give you a calendar  quarter that's going to be 8 percent or better and, in fact, the whole year  as a whole is certainly poised to give you something close to 8 percent and  next year perhaps something similar.  </p><p>QUEST:  You're suggesting, then, that this -- obviously, to a certain  extent this market is hoping for tax reform, it's hoping for health care  reform, it's hoping for all the things that would give that productivity  growth you referred to, but it's not completely reliant upon it.  </p><p>CHAN:  Not completely reliant.  And in fact, if you get the things that  you've just mentioned, then the corporate profit growth would be a lot much  stronger.  And remember, that the equity market rates of return are the sum  of corporate profit growth plus dividends for the S&amp;P 500.  That's  precisely why we're looking at a number that's above 10 percent for this  year already.  </p><p>QUEST:  Excellent, good to see you.  </p><p>CHAN:  My pleasure.  </p><p>QUEST:  As always, thank you so much.  </p><p>[16:21:15] Russia is warning that the talk in Washington of further U.S.  sanctions is, in the words of Russia, counterproductive and harmful.  The  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskof is reacting to the news that negotiators in  both houses of Congress in the U.S. have agreed on new measures against  Moscow.  Lawmakers say it said to be in front of President Trump in the  next week.  </p><p>Clare Sebastian joins me from Moscow.  Where the seriousness of this -- you  know, to some extent Clare, because you're normally based in the states --  that the whole question of Russia and sanctions just all gets lost, but  where you are there is a seriousness to it.  </p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT:  right, exactly, Richard.  This is  not a nuanced issue here.  The Kremlin has been clear all along that it  does not like sanctions.  It has called them everything from politically  motivated to a violation of international law, and its sovereignty.  In  this case today was no different.  The Kremlin told us they viewed this  extremely negatively.  But they say, that given the kind of mixed messages  they're hearing from the White House they're going to wait, they said,  patiently to see how they finalize their position.  I guess to see whether  or not President Trump is willing to sign this.  But Richard, this is not  going away, the issue of sanctions.  There is always a condition imposed to  have them lifted and Russia is not willing to make any concessions.  We  have a situation where sanctions on Russia from the United States, from the  European Union, are simply becoming the status quo and they're just  evolving.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK.  But this idea of sanctions and Russia.  It's all tied up --  when everybody talks about, hearing over the last few days -- adoption, an  adoption discussion.  And there is the strange Magnitsky law, which you  need to explain and put into context for how it relates to the sanctions  row.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  This was a law imposed in the U.S. in 2012, Richard, in  response to the death in Russia of a whistle blowing attorney called Sergey  Magnitsky.  It's hard to overestimate really just how controversial this  is.  One man who knows that better than anyone else is the man who has  picked up where Sergey Magnitsky left off.  He continues to fight every day  for justice for him.  Take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Nikolai Gorokhov says he's lucky to be alive.  In  March, the Moscow lawyer fell from his fourth story apartment block  sustaining serious head injuries.  </p><p>(on camera):  What happened?</p><p>NIKOLAI GOROKHOV, MAGNITSKY FAMILY LAWYER TEXT:  Unfortunately, or  fortunately I don't remember what happened.  I came to in the hospital care  unit of the hospital.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Russian media at the time reported it as an  accident.  But he fell while trying to wench a bathtub of to his balcony.   Gorokhov says he had lifted much heavier things safely.  </p><p>(on camera):  Is it possible it could have been an accident?  </p><p>GOROKHOV TEXT:  I can suppose that it wasn't an accident because a set of  circumstances suggests that.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  To understand that set of circumstances, you have  to go back a decade.  In 2007, Sergey Magnitsky, a lawyer for investment  firm Hermitage Capital, uncovered a $230 million tax fraud that he claimed  involved officials in the Russian government.  </p><p>(on camera):  Magnitsky was arrested in 2008, and a year later he died at  this Moscow prison while awaiting trial.  His family says he was denied  medical care and a Russian presidential human rights commission found to  have been tortured.  The Russian government though says he died of heart  failure.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The bill is passed.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  The U.S. Congress instituted Magnitsky Act to  which slapped sanctions on suspected Russian human rights abusers.  Just  two weeks later Russia band American adoptions of Russian children.  In  Moscow, Gorokhov took up the case.  The day after his fall he was doing  court with new evidence that he says prove government officials were behind  the fraud.  </p><p>[16:25:00] He finally made it to court in May.  His appeal was rejected.  </p><p>GOROKHOV TEXT:  we continue to fight for the truth.  Because time reveals  new proof of Sergei's innocence.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera):  Are you worried for your safety or for your  family's safety?  </p><p>GOROKHOV TEXT:  Yes, I have safety concerns about what will happen to me,  to my wife, my child.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  At the time of his fall, Gorokhov was also a  witness in a now-settled New York lawsuit alleging some of the Russian tax  fraud money had been used to buy New York property.  He had provided these  documents to American prosecutors, 90 files in total.  According to a court  filing, those prosecutors were worried individuals in Russia could attempt  to threaten or harm him.  Still, in a case that's become a thorn in the  Kremlin's side, Gorokhov remains undeterred.  </p><p>GOROKHOV TEXT:  Justice is -- Sergei Magnitsky deserves justice.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  So, Richard, Nikolai Gorokhov says he actually welcomes the new  attention that surrounding the Magnitsky affair in the United States.  He  says it shows, while there may noting justice for Sergei Magnitsky in  Russia, it may that there's justice for him outside of Russia.  </p><p>QUEST:  One quick question for you, Clare.  I was talking to Jessica  Schneider a moment ago in Washington -- you may have heard us -- where I  was asking about the sense of paralysis or as she describes it as chaos and  confusion in D.C.  over the Russian affair.  How is the whole thing being  portrayed in Russia, in Moscow, this obsession in Washington with Russia?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  I think there is a few elements to this, Richard.  On one hand  Russia is, frankly, quite surprised that it's become this kind of major  issue that it is in Washington.  But on the other hand, they don't welcome  this at all.  They were, in fact, hoping when Trump took office that there  might be a reset in the relationship with Russia, that there might be a  prospect even of sanctions being lifted.  But the fact that Russia has  become this kind of Achilles' heel for Trump that's become so politically  toxic that he may now be in a situation where he is forced to sign a new  sanctions bill on Russia.  </p><p>This is not what Russia was looking for.  They didn't want to be in a  situation where it was simply too politically difficult for the U.S.  president to reset this relationship.  So, there's many sides to this.  And  there's another one in fact that Russia does like to point out that there  is disarray in Washington because it makes them seem stable by comparison.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  So, it's a complicated issue the way this is being received  here.  </p><p>QUEST:  Clare Sebastian in Moscow for us tonight.  Thank you for staying up  late, Clare.  Thank you.  </p><p>As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, from tea to chickens, trade  has bound that U.S. and the United States across the Atlantic for  centuries.

The British Trade  Secretary Liam Fox is in Washington where he has kicked off informal talks  with the U.S. after Brexit.  Donald Trump has said he wants a trade deal  with the U.K., Britain, and not just any deal, a very big and powerful  deal, he said.  Liam Fox believes the two countries have a strong economic  bond.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIAM FOX, TRADE SECRETARY, BRITAIN:  It is perhaps a cliche for a British  secretary of state to come to the U.S. and talk about the special  relationship, yet the fact that a phrase is well used does not make it any  less true.  Britain and America are united by language, culture, history,  security and, of course, commerce and trade.  It's perhaps fortuitous that  we are also the first and fifth largest economies in the world.  So, the  economic value of our bond cannot be overstated.  Any who are tempted to  see our exit from the European Union as evidence of Britain looking inwards  should think again.  We have just chosen another path, to embrace the wider  horizons of a truly global Britain.  And as we contemplate our new place in  the world, we do so with a renewed confidence and optimism, acknowledging  the vast opportunities that lie before us, especially when it comes to  strengthening our connection with our single largest trading partner.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  And the phrase is \"the economic value of a bond cannot be  overstated\" as Liam Fox said.  Let's show you, over the centuries, how deep  and strong that bond goes back.  It actually goes back to the colonies in  the 1700s.  You can trace it back almost to golf ball equipment, which is  sent, thank you, from the U.K. to the United States.  And then you have,  well, the famous tea.  Tea which was sent from Britain to the U.S., but  with a very checkered history because the tax on tea from the East India  Company, that sparked the revolution.  </p><p>[16:35:00] So, you can arguably say which side that should go.  We'll put  it back with the U.K.  Then, into the 1800s.  And you get some real  technological improvements.  You get, for example, the first transatlantic  telegraph cable, which connects New York and London.  It is the cable that  is used for trading foreign exchange, which is why the British pound and  U.S. dollar cross rate is still called \"cable.\"  By 1900s, and it's the  second world war and the land lease act of Roosevelt allows the U.S. to  support the U.K. in World War II by leasing and lending boats, ships and  other important war product.  So, to the cultural exchanges.  Well, you've  got famous artists going from the U.K. to the U.S., and in return, you have  lots of Hollywood going back the other way.  </p><p>The so-called British invasion goes one way.  Hollywood exports to the  other.  Then bring it right up to date.  Barack Obama, on Brexit.  He says,  Barack Obama, that Britain will be at the back of the que when it comes to  talking trade.  Donald Trump is a campaigner, immediately says the  opposite.  He says he wants a deal.  He wants a deal done fast.  To show  how this trade relationship continues to grow even in this modern era,  think about these two.  The U.K. is now considering chlorine-washed  chickens from the United States.  It is a trade relationship like none  other.  The depth, the range, the breadth, the value.  Jeffries Briginshaw  joins me now.  Even allowing for the extremely extensive relationship, you  and everybody knows that the British cannot negotiate a trade deal until  they've actually left the union.  So, what's the purpose of these talks?  </p><p>JEFFRIES BRIGINSHAW, CEO, BRITISH-AMERICAN BUSINESS COUNCIL:  As you say, a  lot of if, buts and maybes about when Britain can do trade deals.  Customs,  unions and competencies all getting in the way.  Your graphics and your  kind of interesting analysis showed us that the U.K.-U.S. economy is a  source of strength, opportunity and stability.  You don't necessarily need  a trade deal to dial that up, to get more out of it.  I think what we're  seeing with the politics, if you want, encouragement on both sides, is  encouragement, yes, towards a trade deal as part of this jigsaw puzzle post  Brexit but also saying, OK, what can we do in the meantime as well.   Secretary Fox was keen to talk also today about things that could be done  before a trade deal.  </p><p>QUEST:  How much of this is the optics?  How important is it merely by  showing the world that the U.K. is starting talks?  Because at the end of  the day, you and we all know, nothing can really come of it, even if you  get a memorandum of understanding, it will ten years afterwards to get a  full trade deal.  This is about, in some case, hyperbole.  </p><p>BRIGINSHAW:  I would say political encouragement.  Let's focus, then, on  the things that could be done that don't need a trade deal.  Stronger  science collaboration.  Some regulatory cooperation.  Talking about cyber  security and new rules for cyber security.  Data transfers.  Movement of  people.  So, things that don't need trade deals but that could dial up the  potential of what's already a powerful and strong economy.  </p><p>The U.K., well, the EU, as such, does not have a trade deal with the United  States at the moment.  Therefore, is trading pretty much on WTO terms.  If  the U.K., post Brexit, just continues exactly the same way, shouldn't make  much difference for the U.K.?</p><p>QUEST:  Well, that's a great point.  We are already at 20 percent of our  exports going to the U.S. it's a trillion dollars of two-way investment.   $250 billion and a million jobs in both economies.  So, the real  opportunity is how can we dial that up.  Part of that can come from a trade  negotiation, trade and investment negotiation, and part of it can come  from, as I say, the things we can talk about already and do to strengthen  that relationship.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you.  We'll talk more about it  certainly as the deal does or does not come to fruition.  </p><p>Ryanair.  Europe's largest airline.  It is, look at the numbers.  Which  whichever measure you take.  </p><p>[16:40:00] Ryanair says it may have to move its entire fleet out of Britain  if it doesn't get clarity on Brexit.  On QUEST EXPRESS when I was down at  the exchange, Ryanair's chief marketing officer told me the airline is  running out of time to get answers from the British government.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KENNY JACOBS, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, RYANAIR:  So, if we don't have  absolute clarity come August of next year in terms of what's the  alternative going to be to continue open skies, then we are in unknown  territory.  We want to continue flying between the U.K. and Europe as we do  today.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, but you know as well as I do that flying from the U.K. to  another European country and back again is really very simple.  I mean, in  the industry parlance, that's just third and fourth freedoms.  Countries  have those all the time.  It's the much more complicated stuff of intra- European flying when you are using the U.K. fleet that's the problem.  </p><p>JACOBS:  Yes, but flying between the U.K. and Europe is governed by the  European court of justice as part of open skies.  The European government  decided they're leaving Europe and the European court of justice.  Theresa  May has made it clear.  When they do that, there needs to be a brand-new  bilateral in place between the U.K. and every one of the EU 27.  Something  brand-new does need to be created.  We can't go back to the bilateral that  existed.  Hence, we are calling on the politicians.  We are a year since  the referendum and we are not any clearer on what the alternative will be.   We are making contingency plans.  Those would include that, if we can't fly  for a period of time -- again, we don't want this to happen, but we can see  a situation where there may be no flying between the U.K. and Europe for a  number of months.  We don't want it to happen.  We're encouraging the  government to work fast.  </p><p>QUEST:  Now, now Kenny, how much of this is hyperbole?  How much of this is  you raising the temperature in a situation where perhaps nobody  realistically thinks that any routes will be canceled or flights won't take  place.  </p><p>JACOBS:  There will be a solution, Richard.  Absolutely.  There will be a  solution.  But the issue will be, is there going to be a solution in time.   As I said, it's about us planning our schedules and releasing our schedules  a year in advance.  If we don't have clarity we'll be in unprecedented  territory.  As I said, we don't want this to happen but we need greater  urgency in the coming months than we've seen over the past six months.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  Chief marketing officer for Ryanair.  \"D\" is for disappointing.   Alphabet Google has reported its result.  The stock in after-hours is  falling.  I'll give you the numbers as to why Google appears to be  disappointing tonight.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:45:00] QUEST:  Welcome back, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  Google shares down  3 percent after hours.  The earnings down sharply from last year.  Now,  there is a reason why the earnings are off badly in the quarter.  Profits  hit 2.7 billion by the EU, fine.  So, we kick off a blockbuster earnings  week.  Monday is Alphabet.  Tuesday is McDonald's, AT&amp;T and GM.  I don't  need to read them.  You can read them yourself.  They're on the screen.   It's a busy earnings week so far.  Joining me now, Brian O'Keefe, deputy  editor at \"Fortune.\"  These numbers from Google are interesting.  A large  company everybody has heard of.  The numbers suggest it was a good quarter,  but it's got these regulatory issues, which is becoming prevalent for many  companies.  </p><p>BRIAN O'KEEFE, DEPUTY EDITOR, \"FORTUNE\":  I think especially for the big  tech companies.  Ironically, we were just flagging this in the current  issue where we released the global 500.  Apple.  Google, Facebook.  Have  changed globally.  We were expecting maybe Trump to cause complications  with globalization.  Now they're running into regulatory issues in Europe  right now.  </p><p>QUEST:  On the 500, what has grabbed you about it?  It's always the same  suspects, as they say, at the top.  They might move around a bit, but it's  always the biggest companies that are always there.  What did you find  interesting this time?  </p><p>O'KEEFE:  I think there are two big trends which kind of intersect.  The  two are the rise of technology, the fine against Google notwithstanding.   Big tech companies are making a march up the list.  The second big trend is  the rise of China which is really powerful if you look at the numbers.  </p><p>QUEST:  Although those Chinese companies that are moving in, maybe with the  exception of Ali Baba and one or two others they're still domestic based.   They haven't spread their wings to become household recognition outside of  China.  It's the large domestic issue.  </p><p>O'KEEFE:  The largest companies in China right now are still the state- owned companies.  However, we have two debuts this year.  Ali baba.  And  Tencent.  We did a profile on the H&amp;A group.  </p><p>QUEST:  Which has been buying huge amounts everywhere.  </p><p>O'KEEFE:  Around the world.  Europe, the United States.  Their CEO says  they want to be the local company next-door in the U.S. that's drawing  scrutiny itself in China.  So, you know, they have been forced to come out  and just today released information about their ownership stake.  </p><p>QUEST:  This issue of tech, you know, anyone who has got a portfolio that's  sort of balances out, you look at the -- one looks at the gains from your  tech side, and it's 15, 20, 25 percent growth.  </p><p>O'KEEFE:  Right.  </p><p>QUEST:  Unless it's a McDonald's or a special situation, you look at  everything else.  Honeywell, Caterpillar, Ford.  United Airlines.  There is  nothing equivalent.  </p><p>O'KEEFE:  Certainly, tech has been the big, big powerful story.  You look  at Amazon, for instance.  They are number 26 this year.  That's just their  revenues.  The stock has been unbelievable.  Ali Baba, their stock is up  something like 70 percent year-to-date.  It's tempting to put all your  money into those stocks.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  </p><p>O'KEEFE:  I will say, though, you are getting the benefit of that in the  indexes because they're over represented in the market cap weighted index.   A very smart guy, Warren Buffett would say spread your bets on the index  and by the way Berkshire Hathaway is in the top ten this year for the first  time.</p><p>QUEST:  Never split the stock, of course.  I can't remember how much one  share of Berkshire Hathaway is these days.  It is a huge amount.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  He has never split it.  It used to be going against trend but now  it's becoming more common not to split the stock.  It's become cool to not  split the stock.  </p><p>QUEST:  I always thought that's a bit of a strange thing.  Who wants to buy  half a share of Amazon?  Because it's $1,000.  </p><p>O'KEEFE:  Exactly.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  Appreciate it.  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p>Now the results we've been talking about, only tell part of the tech story.   Let me walk you through Silicon Valley and some of the events that have  taken place today that will make it clear what's happened.  First of all,  Microsoft Paint, those of us of a certain age will remember it.  It's age  32.  But now it faces removal.  Because apparently Microsoft is thinking of  dropping Paint from its next version of Windows.  So, could this be RIP.   Paint, '85 to 2017.  Even though there are 100 million users of it.  </p><p>Then you've got an event today.  Web shares.  WebMD.  Look at that.  Just  what we were talking about the other day.  WebMD is being purchased by KKR.   It's bought by the investment firm.  $2.8 billion is the price.  </p><p>[16:50:00] WebMD says the decision is best for shareholders.  But the  premium.  Look at that.  WebMD does nothing, and that's enough to give you  a heart attack.  </p><p>And finally, Mark Zuckerberg shirts.  Now, Mark Zuckerberg's plain t-shirts  cost just $300.  And they -- feel the quality -- they are custom made for  him.  But now the entrepreneur Klaas Buck created a replica.  You can have  a Mark Zuckerberg t-shirt for $46.  And the proceeds will go to the Chan  Zuckerberg initiative.  So, forget Mr. Zuckerberg's.  300.  All yours for  46 and charity.  Imagine trading on Wall Street before the invention of  radio, tv and computers.  Now, it was this machine.  It's known as the  ticker tape.  It changed everything.  We'll look at the history of the  ticker as we have our chapter of stories from the street.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Wall Street, and the stories from the street that we're looking at  over the course of the summer.  And today it is that most famous of  instruments that created a cultural phenomenon but really goes to the heart  of Wall Street.  The ticker tape! </p><p>This is one of the original Thomas Edison tickers.  </p><p>This is the machine that changed Wall Street.  Before radio and TV, the  stock ticker was the way to get accurate financial information.   Transmitted over telegraph lines.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN STEELE GORDON, WALL STREET HISTORIAN:  It revolutionized the stock  exchange business because now you could effectively trade anywhere in the  country and know what the prices were that minute.  The ticker tape greatly  enlarged the reach of Wall Street.  Thomas Edison was one of the inventors  of it.  </p><p>QUEST:  The movies portrayed the breakthrough as a eureka moment.  Soon  after, a New York city tradition was born, the ticker tape parade.  </p><p>The ticker tape also helped document one of the worst days in Wall Street  history, the crash of 1929.  </p><p>KRISTEN AGUILERA, MUSEUM OF FINANCE:  This is undoubtedly one of the most  important pieces of historical ticker tape.  It was recovered from a  trading floor on the morning of the 1929 crash.  This piece of framed  ticker tape represents the first 45 minutes of trading on that tumultuous  day.  </p><p>QUEST:  Ticker machines are collectors' items.  Some go for $15,000.   Ticker tape was phased out in the 1960s.  But we still call it the ticker  as it crawls across the bottom of the screen.  And that's the ticker tape.   Another chapter in our stories from the street.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[16:55:00] QUEST:  And we still, indeed, have the ticker, where you can now  download or read, go to CNN.com/podcast.  Check out the podcast.  Subscribe  on iTunes, TuneIn or Stitcher.  It's all up there.  Or go to  CNN.com/podcast.  Where did you hear about it?  On the ticker.  Profitable  Moment is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's Profitable Moment.  The allegations of collusion by the  big three German car makers, Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW could not be more  serious.  If proven true it will be devastating for the made in Germany  reputation that these three car companies colluded over emission standards,  engine size or whatever.  I suspect the truth will be somewhere in between.   As you heard earlier in the program, I think it will be much more about we  had meetings to discuss common standards.  </p><p>The problem, of course, is when is a meeting on common standards turning  into something more nefarious and dangerous for competition.  This needs a  full, thorough, deep and dark investigation from the commission and from  the authorities in Germany.  Because if it's true, it's likely the sort of  thing we've not seen before.  That's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight.  I  am Richard Quest in New York.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I  hope it's profitable.  Same again tomorrow.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Closing bell ringing on Wall Street.  Obviously, a very  exciting day on the stock exchange.  The market is down some 51 points.   So, no records for the Dow.  You can stop ringing the bell now, sir.  Thank  you.  There we go.  I don't know what he's taking, but I suggests he stops  doing it now.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It's Monday, it's July the 24th.  Tonight, something nasty under the hood.   Shares in German car companies fall amid serious allegations of collusion.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Donald Trump's growth targets seem a long way off if the IMF's numbers are  to be believed.  And an even more special relation, U.K. and the U.S. are  starting trade talks before Brexit.  I am Richard Quest, live in the  world's financial capital and I mean business.  </p><p> Good evening.  We begin tonight with the share prices of Germany's biggest  car companies falling with a new crisis that's threatening one of Europe's  most powerful and important industries.  It's an allegation that German car  makers colluded to set costs, agree on supplies and develop technologies  like emissions systems.  </p><p> According to \"Der Spiegel,\" the newspaper is reporting that under collusion  -- or alleged collusion, went on for more than three decades, involving  hundreds of executives from the companies and their subsidiaries.  The  shares of all three and the day up to one and three percent.  None of the  three, Daimler, Volkswagen or BMW are commenting specifically.  Volkswagen  plans to hold a special board meeting on Wednesday to discuss the  allegations.  </p><p> It all came about, apparently, because Volkswagen revealed to the  authorities as part of the diesel emissions scandal that these meetings had  been taking place.  But, if true, the seriousness can be seen when you  think of how important the automobile industry, the car industry, is in  Germany.  A source of national pride.  If they were found guilty of  collusion.  It will cause damage on three fronts.  </p><p> Firstly, of course, the monetary front.  If the EU found them guilty and  the German authorities found them guilty, monetary fines which could reach  into the billions of dollars.  The commission says it's too early to  speculate.  That's before, for example, in the litigious United States  people decided to sue the companies in this country claiming damages, costs  and compensation.  The reputational damage would be devastating both to the  car industry is the made in Germany brand.  Which is already struggling  after the diesel emissions scandal.  </p><p> And then the broader economy.  In Germany alone, 800,000 jobs are accounted  for in the industry.  It's one-fifth -- 20 percent, of the country's  industrial revenue comes directly or indirectly from the car industry.   Joining me now, Hans-Olaf Henkel, a member of the European parliament and  former director of the Federation of German Industries.  I will preface,  sir, I will preface, if true and if proven, this would be devastating.  </p><p> HANS-OLAF HENKEL, MEMBER OF EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:  Absolutely, Richard.  It  would be devastating, not only because we have, as you rightfully say,  800,000 employees in Germany depending on this sector, we have tens of  thousands of Americans depending also on German car companies in the U.S.   But let's face it, nothing is proven, and as far as I can see, this has not  been a price-fixing deal or something like that, but possibly an agreement  on certain standards.  </p><p> Now, one has to find out whether it is correct to agree on such standards  like the size of the tank for a liquid which you use in order to get the  diesel emissions under control, or whether it has been something more  serious.  But we have to wait and, indeed, if proven correct, it would be a  disaster.  </p><p> QUEST:  There is clearly -- I think you're right, sir, in the sense of the  devil is going to be in the detail.  You know, were we having ad hoc  meetings about minor matters.  You know it's a very fine line on, one, of  interpretation.  Who should take the lead here?  Should it be the  commission in Europe or the national regulators in Germany, do you think?  </p><p> [16:05:03] HENKEL:  Well, clearly a violation of cartel rules is a  responsibility of the European Commission.  The European Commission has  done, in my view, in my observation, the last decades, very good jobs.   They have unearthed some of those scandals.  By the way, some of them also  happened in Germany.  They have levied hefty fines on those companies.  So,  my -- I am rather confident that the European Commission will do a good job  here.  It is their responsibility.  However, if criminal actions are  involved, then it becomes the responsibility of the German system, like in  the case of VW, which, as we all know, this company has manipulated the  software and committed criminal acts.  That is being pursued by the German  system.  </p><p> QUEST:  Can we turn to Brexit if we may?  I read your article recently on  Brexit.  Your family -- if you look at the end of the second round of  negotiations, you still believe that the prevalence of view is that  Monsieur Barnier and Verhofstadt are wanting to punish rather than get a  good deal.  </p><p> HENKEL:  Yes, I think there is ample evidence.  By the way, I'd like to  make sure that your viewers understand.  I was actively campaigning against  Brexit.  But I believe that one should honor the result of the referendum  of the U.K. And in my view, especially Mr. Verhofstadt doesn't.   Verhofstadt is in Europe, the epitome of a centralized Eurofier.  And he is  now in charge of the group within the parliament covering the Brexit for  the parliament.  By the way, he wasn't even elected by the parliament but  was put in place by Her Schultz when he was president of the parliament.  </p><p> QUEST:  Do you believe that there is wiggle room for the commission, or for  the EU, on the pillars?  This idea, for example, of some form of  accommodation on the single market on the customs union but only if you  take freedom of movement.  Is there gray enough area to allow a deal?  </p><p> HENKEL:  I think we have to allow this kind of deal.  Because, let's face  it, Britain is so very important for the EU.  At least as important for the  EU as the EU is to Britain.  And by the way, the assertion of Verhofstadt  and Barnier to say that a country outside the union should not have the  same deal as a country inside the union is deadly wrong.  Switzerland gets  the same deal as the other countries.  And when it comes to the research  agreement, Horizon 2020, which is a big research funding forum for the EU.   Even Israel is even part of the deal and has the same right as any other EU  country.  So why not give it to the United Kingdom.  </p><p> QUEST:  As we end here, sir, we are grateful to have had you this evening.   What is your fundamental fear in these negotiations?  I know it's early  days, only two rounds.  There are another 18 months or so to go.  And  you'll get a chance to vote on the final package, but what's your  fundamental fear?  </p><p> HENKEL:  My fundamental fear is that there is no agreement, and that would  be a true disaster.  By the way, I think Britain leaving the European  Union, quite frankly, means that the last country with common sense is  leaving the European Union.  Because that country always believed in  subsidiary rather than centralization.  That country also believed in  competition between nations rather than harmonization.  And these kinds of  elements are missing.  So, I think Brexit is a bad story, not only for  Britain, it is also a bad story for the European Union.  </p><p> QUEST:  We're grateful you came to talk to us tonight.  Two important  stories we're covering on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  thank you, sir.  </p><p> Shares of the automakers we started out talking about, Daimler, Volkswagen  and BMW.  They pulled down the European indices.  Just take a look.  You  might have expected worse out of Frankfurt but up a quarter of a percent.   The FTSE was the worse off down one percent.  Only Paris ended in the  green.  Ryanair shares were down after warning that fares could fall.   You're going to hear from its chief marketing officer later in the program.   Also warning that Ryanair may actually stop flying from the U.K. if indeed  Brexit talks go badly.  </p><p> [16:10:00] QUEST:  To Wall Street.  The main -- the larger markets, but the  narrow and the wide, the Dow was down.  It's down 66.9.  Right through the  session it was down.  But the NASDAQ actually closed at a record.  And it's  its 50th closing record since the election.  We're going to get the numbers  from Alphabet, which is Google's parent company.  Alphabet is going to  report in this hour.  When it does we'll have the results for you and give  you some analysis.  The NASDAQ is at a record.  You see the S&amp;P 500 and Dow  both up.  Which merely reinforces the significance of tech in the current  market.  We'll talk about that during the course of the program.  </p><p> Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, made a rare  public statement after meeting the Senate intelligence committee.  He said,  he did not collude with Russia during the presidential campaign.  Kushner  is a real estate developer New York.  He is now denying relying on Russian  funds for his own business.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JARED KUSHNER, SENIOR ADVISOR TO U.S. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I did not collude  with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so.  I  had no improper contacts.  I have not relied on Russian funds for my  businesses.  And I have been fully transparent in providing all requested  information.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  Jessica Schneider, we don't hear very often from Jared Kushner.  In  fact, I can't remember -- I mean maybe somebody will prove me wrong in that  he spoke once six months ago to a Tea Party or something, but the reality  is, the fact he had to stand there at the White House with microphones is  evidence of the gravity of this.  </p><p> JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  It absolutely is.  I mean,  the Russia investigation has really overtaken this town.  It's the only  thing anyone ever talks about because it does have such enormity.  So yes,  of course, now Jared Kushner is trying to confront this head-on.  He said  in his statement that he wanted to do this to set the record straight.  So,  he tried to do that in releasing that 11-page statement earlier this  morning.  And then, of course, again when he finally went before the  cameras to speak for probably the longest we've ever heard him speak  outside the West Wing today.  </p><p> It was a fairly brief prepared statement, but he said in it quite  forcefully that he did not collude with the Russian government.  That no  one in the campaign colluded.  And then he said that his actions were  proper.  You know, Richard, he also talks about the political implications  of this.  He talked about the fact that, in his view, Donald Trump won fair  and square because he properly read the pulse of the American public,  tailored his message to that.  And then Jared Kushner kind of pushed forth  the president's line that we hear a lot, that any indication otherwise is  just unfair to the American people and really ridicules the American  people.  Any implication that the Russian influence may have tipped the  election is not a fair one to make.  So, he put that in there to.</p><p> QUEST:  I want to jump in here because I am fascinated by what you start  off with when you're saying -- Jessica, how -- paralyzes may be the wrong  word.  But the mood in Washington, as you're heading towards a long, hot  summer.  That mood, is it one of paralysis yet over the government and  Russia?  </p><p> SCHNEIDER:  I don't want to say it's more chaos and confusion.  The  president has these agenda items he is trying to tick off.  The things he  talked about a lot in the campaign.  Health care, infrastructure,  overturning and repealing Obamacare, however, all of that has been  overshadowed by the Russia investigation, and that's in no small part.   Because the president keeps talking about it and in particular tweeting  about it.  </p><p> You know, it was just last week that he talked to the \"New York Times.\"  He  talked a lot about Russia.  He talked about his Attorney General, the fact  that he wasn't happy he recused himself.  So really, I don't know if it's  paralysis, although it may be inside the White House.  But really, it's  just kind of chaotic.  It's confusing and the president really can't stay  on message as I think lawmakers wish he would.  </p><p> QUEST:  Jessica, thank you.  Need that.  We needed to understand the  situation in Washington.  Much appreciated.  Thank you.  </p><p> SCHNEIDER:  Thank you.</p><p> QUEST:  Now, staying with economic growth and the president.  Donald Trump  once promised 4 percent economic growth.  He then set the target of 3  percent.  When we come back after the break, this man, you sir, are going  to help us understand.  The IMF says no to 4 percent.  When it says 2.1  percent.  Anthony Chan will be with us to talk about economics.  </p><p> [16:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  You could say the IMF have lost a bit of confidence in Donald  Trump.  On the campaign trail, campaigning Trump, promised to rev up growth  to 4 percent.  He changed that number slightly to 3 percent as the target  growth.  However, the IMF has chopped its own forecast of U.S. economic  growth to 2.1 percent for this year and next, down from 2.3., 2.5.  Now  these numbers are the latest, matched by Standard &amp; Poor's, which is pretty  close.  It says the economic backdrop is benign and uninspired.  The IMF  worries about uncertainty.  S&amp;P is talking about the failure to get an  infrastructure plan this year or next.  Anthony Chan is chief economist at  Chase Bank.  All right.  This is where the rubber meets the road, as they  say.  </p><p> ANTHONY CHAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CHASE:  Absolutely.  </p><p> QUEST:  Your forecast this year and next for the U.S. is what?</p><p> CHAN:  Two percent for this year and about 2.3 percent next year.  We think  some good stuff will come out of the administration next year but this year  will be challenging.  </p><p> QUEST:  Can growth, not should -- I suppose it can.  Is it likely that  growth could hit 3 percent next year or the year after?  </p><p> CHAN:  I think you can see particular calendar quarters which could give  you 3 percent growth rate.  That's not a problem.  But to see the entire  year at 3 percent or more, very challenging because productivity has been  very low and labor markets are so tight that it's very difficult to get  labor force growth.  Remember that at the end of the day you need labor  force growth and you need productivity growth to basically sum up to that  kind of growth rate.  Right now, the numbers do not add up.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, but there are only two ways you can get really, from the  president's point of view, you can get to 4 percent economic, or 3 percent  economic growth.  You either have to cut taxes and hope you don't -- you'll  blow the deficit.  But you will juice up the economy.  Or you increase  government spending.  That is the -- </p><p> CHAN:  There is another third way.  And that is, if you make -- increase  efficiency and that's done through less regulation and more encouragement  on the part -- </p><p> QUEST:  That takes a lot longer than a quarter or three --</p><p> CHAN:  It does take a lot longer.  This is a multi-year process.   Absolutely.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right.  Are you seeing evidence yet that that is happening, even  though we have lots of regulations have been eliminated and you have the  take two off the table if you put one on.  So, there are changes taking  place.  </p><p> CHAN:  There are changing things that are taking place, but not of a  sufficient critical mass to generate the 3 percent or 4 percent growth rate  that was hoped for.  </p><p> QUEST:  Does it matter that the U.S. is growing at 2.1, 2.3 percent?   Historically that is on the low side.  One might say it's weak growth but  not exactly disastrous.  </p><p> CHAN:  It is not disastrous.  </p><p> QUEST:  It's still growth.  </p><p> CHAN:  Absolutely.  And, Richard, a lot of research out there suggests and,  in fact, strongly confirms, that when you have sluggish growth, economic  expansion lasts a lot longer.  Remember, this expansion just hit eight  years old in June and the average age of economic expansion is 4.9 years.   This is precisely why this expansion has lasted longer than the historical  average, because it's very sluggish, but nonetheless quite persistent.  </p><p> QUEST:  You don't have the feel-good factor with the 2.2 percent growth, do  you?  People don't feel things are going well?  </p><p> CHAN:  People may not feel it, but in terms of equity markets you're  getting that good-feel factor looking at the equity market rates of return.  </p><p> [16:20:00] QUEST:  All right, you've raised the equity markets.  If he  can't get 4 percent, or even 3 percent, he -- I shouldn't be disrespectful.   If the president can't get 4 percent or 3 percent, how much of this market  do you think he's relying on?  </p><p> CHAN:  Believe it or not, the equity market sort of relies more on  corporate profit growth than it does on economic growth.  And what you saw  in the first calendar quarter, you saw almost 14 percent growth in S&amp;P 500  corporate profits.  The second quarter is shaping up to give you a calendar  quarter that's going to be 8 percent or better and, in fact, the whole year  as a whole is certainly poised to give you something close to 8 percent and  next year perhaps something similar.  </p><p> QUEST:  You're suggesting, then, that this -- obviously, to a certain  extent this market is hoping for tax reform, it's hoping for health care  reform, it's hoping for all the things that would give that productivity  growth you referred to, but it's not completely reliant upon it.  </p><p> CHAN:  Not completely reliant.  And in fact, if you get the things that  you've just mentioned, then the corporate profit growth would be a lot much  stronger.  And remember, that the equity market rates of return are the sum  of corporate profit growth plus dividends for the S&amp;P 500.  That's  precisely why we're looking at a number that's above 10 percent for this  year already.  </p><p> QUEST:  Excellent, good to see you.  </p><p> CHAN:  My pleasure.  </p><p> QUEST:  As always, thank you so much.  </p><p>  [16:21:15] Russia is warning that the talk in Washington of further U.S.  sanctions is, in the words of Russia, counterproductive and harmful.  The  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskof is reacting to the news that negotiators in  both houses of Congress in the U.S. have agreed on new measures against  Moscow.  Lawmakers say it said to be in front of President Trump in the  next week.  </p><p> Clare Sebastian joins me from Moscow.  Where the seriousness of this -- you  know, to some extent Clare, because you're normally based in the states --  that the whole question of Russia and sanctions just all gets lost, but  where you are there is a seriousness to it.  </p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT:  right, exactly, Richard.  This is  not a nuanced issue here.  The Kremlin has been clear all along that it  does not like sanctions.  It has called them everything from politically  motivated to a violation of international law, and its sovereignty.  In  this case today was no different.  The Kremlin told us they viewed this  extremely negatively.  But they say, that given the kind of mixed messages  they're hearing from the White House they're going to wait, they said,  patiently to see how they finalize their position.  I guess to see whether  or not President Trump is willing to sign this.  But Richard, this is not  going away, the issue of sanctions.  There is always a condition imposed to  have them lifted and Russia is not willing to make any concessions.  We  have a situation where sanctions on Russia from the United States, from the  European Union, are simply becoming the status quo and they're just  evolving.  </p><p> QUEST:  OK.  But this idea of sanctions and Russia.  It's all tied up --  when everybody talks about, hearing over the last few days -- adoption, an  adoption discussion.  And there is the strange Magnitsky law, which you  need to explain and put into context for how it relates to the sanctions  row.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  This was a law imposed in the U.S. in 2012, Richard, in  response to the death in Russia of a whistle blowing attorney called Sergey  Magnitsky.  It's hard to overestimate really just how controversial this  is.  One man who knows that better than anyone else is the man who has  picked up where Sergey Magnitsky left off.  He continues to fight every day  for justice for him.  Take a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Nikolai Gorokhov says he's lucky to be alive.  In  March, the Moscow lawyer fell from his fourth story apartment block  sustaining serious head injuries.  </p><p> (on camera):  What happened?</p><p> NIKOLAI GOROKHOV, MAGNITSKY FAMILY LAWYER TEXT:  Unfortunately, or  fortunately I don't remember what happened.  I came to in the hospital care  unit of the hospital.</p><p> SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Russian media at the time reported it as an  accident.  But he fell while trying to wench a bathtub of to his balcony.   Gorokhov says he had lifted much heavier things safely.  </p><p> (on camera):  Is it possible it could have been an accident?  </p><p> GOROKHOV TEXT:  I can suppose that it wasn't an accident because a set of  circumstances suggests that.</p><p> SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  To understand that set of circumstances, you have  to go back a decade.  In 2007, Sergey Magnitsky, a lawyer for investment  firm Hermitage Capital, uncovered a $230 million tax fraud that he claimed  involved officials in the Russian government.  </p><p> (on camera):  Magnitsky was arrested in 2008, and a year later he died at  this Moscow prison while awaiting trial.  His family says he was denied  medical care and a Russian presidential human rights commission found to  have been tortured.  The Russian government though says he died of heart  failure.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The bill is passed.</p><p> SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  The U.S. Congress instituted Magnitsky Act to  which slapped sanctions on suspected Russian human rights abusers.  Just  two weeks later Russia band American adoptions of Russian children.  In  Moscow, Gorokhov took up the case.  The day after his fall he was doing  court with new evidence that he says prove government officials were behind  the fraud.  </p><p> [16:25:00] He finally made it to court in May.  His appeal was rejected.  </p><p> GOROKHOV TEXT:  we continue to fight for the truth.  Because time reveals  new proof of Sergei's innocence.</p><p> SEBASTIAN (on camera):  Are you worried for your safety or for your  family's safety?  </p><p> GOROKHOV TEXT:  Yes, I have safety concerns about what will happen to me,  to my wife, my child.</p><p> SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  At the time of his fall, Gorokhov was also a  witness in a now-settled New York lawsuit alleging some of the Russian tax  fraud money had been used to buy New York property.  He had provided these  documents to American prosecutors, 90 files in total.  According to a court  filing, those prosecutors were worried individuals in Russia could attempt  to threaten or harm him.  Still, in a case that's become a thorn in the  Kremlin's side, Gorokhov remains undeterred.  </p><p> GOROKHOV TEXT:  Justice is -- Sergei Magnitsky deserves justice.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  So, Richard, Nikolai Gorokhov says he actually welcomes the new  attention that surrounding the Magnitsky affair in the United States.  He  says it shows, while there may noting justice for Sergei Magnitsky in  Russia, it may that there's justice for him outside of Russia.  </p><p> QUEST:  One quick question for you, Clare.  I was talking to Jessica  Schneider a moment ago in Washington -- you may have heard us -- where I  was asking about the sense of paralysis or as she describes it as chaos and  confusion in D.C.  over the Russian affair.  How is the whole thing being  portrayed in Russia, in Moscow, this obsession in Washington with Russia?  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  I think there is a few elements to this, Richard.  On one hand  Russia is, frankly, quite surprised that it's become this kind of major  issue that it is in Washington.  But on the other hand, they don't welcome  this at all.  They were, in fact, hoping when Trump took office that there  might be a reset in the relationship with Russia, that there might be a  prospect even of sanctions being lifted.  But the fact that Russia has  become this kind of Achilles' heel for Trump that's become so politically  toxic that he may now be in a situation where he is forced to sign a new  sanctions bill on Russia.  </p><p> This is not what Russia was looking for.  They didn't want to be in a  situation where it was simply too politically difficult for the U.S.  president to reset this relationship.  So, there's many sides to this.  And  there's another one in fact that Russia does like to point out that there  is disarray in Washington because it makes them seem stable by comparison.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  So, it's a complicated issue the way this is being received  here.  </p><p> QUEST:  Clare Sebastian in Moscow for us tonight.  Thank you for staying up  late, Clare.  Thank you.  </p><p> As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, from tea to chickens, trade  has bound that U.S. and the United States across the Atlantic for  centuries.  And the prospect of a new deal which we will discuss.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> [16:30:36] QUEST:  Hello.  I am Richard Quest.  There's more QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS in just a moment.

He apparently is a Swiss  national with no fixed address and apparently lives in a forest.  </p><p> The U.K. and the United States have taken the first steps to what could be  a new era in the so-called special relationship.  The British Trade  Secretary Liam Fox is in Washington where he has kicked off informal talks  with the U.S. after Brexit.  Donald Trump has said he wants a trade deal  with the U.K., Britain, and not just any deal, a very big and powerful  deal, he said.  Liam Fox believes the two countries have a strong economic  bond.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LIAM FOX, TRADE SECRETARY, BRITAIN:  It is perhaps a cliche for a British  secretary of state to come to the U.S. and talk about the special  relationship, yet the fact that a phrase is well used does not make it any  less true.  Britain and America are united by language, culture, history,  security and, of course, commerce and trade.  It's perhaps fortuitous that  we are also the first and fifth largest economies in the world.  So, the  economic value of our bond cannot be overstated.  Any who are tempted to  see our exit from the European Union as evidence of Britain looking inwards  should think again.  We have just chosen another path, to embrace the wider  horizons of a truly global Britain.  And as we contemplate our new place in  the world, we do so with a renewed confidence and optimism, acknowledging  the vast opportunities that lie before us, especially when it comes to  strengthening our connection with our single largest trading partner.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  And the phrase is \"the economic value of a bond cannot be  overstated\" as Liam Fox said.  Let's show you, over the centuries, how deep  and strong that bond goes back.  It actually goes back to the colonies in  the 1700s.  You can trace it back almost to golf ball equipment, which is  sent, thank you, from the U.K. to the United States.  And then you have,  well, the famous tea.  Tea which was sent from Britain to the U.S., but  with a very checkered history because the tax on tea from the East India  Company, that sparked the revolution.  </p><p> [16:35:00] So, you can arguably say which side that should go.  We'll put  it back with the U.K.  Then, into the 1800s.  And you get some real  technological improvements.  You get, for example, the first transatlantic  telegraph cable, which connects New York and London.  It is the cable that  is used for trading foreign exchange, which is why the British pound and  U.S. dollar cross rate is still called \"cable.\"  By 1900s, and it's the  second world war and the land lease act of Roosevelt allows the U.S. to  support the U.K. in World War II by leasing and lending boats, ships and  other important war product.  So, to the cultural exchanges.  Well, you've  got famous artists going from the U.K. to the U.S., and in return, you have  lots of Hollywood going back the other way.  </p><p> The so-called British invasion goes one way.  Hollywood exports to the  other.  Then bring it right up to date.  Barack Obama, on Brexit.  He says,  Barack Obama, that Britain will be at the back of the que when it comes to  talking trade.  Donald Trump is a campaigner, immediately says the  opposite.  He says he wants a deal.  He wants a deal done fast.  To show  how this trade relationship continues to grow even in this modern era,  think about these two.  The U.K. is now considering chlorine-washed  chickens from the United States.  It is a trade relationship like none  other.  The depth, the range, the breadth, the value.  Jeffries Briginshaw  joins me now.  Even allowing for the extremely extensive relationship, you  and everybody knows that the British cannot negotiate a trade deal until  they've actually left the union.  So, what's the purpose of these talks?  </p><p> JEFFRIES BRIGINSHAW, CEO, BRITISH-AMERICAN BUSINESS COUNCIL:  As you say, a  lot of if, buts and maybes about when Britain can do trade deals.  Customs,  unions and competencies all getting in the way.  Your graphics and your  kind of interesting analysis showed us that the U.K.-U.S. economy is a  source of strength, opportunity and stability.  You don't necessarily need  a trade deal to dial that up, to get more out of it.  I think what we're  seeing with the politics, if you want, encouragement on both sides, is  encouragement, yes, towards a trade deal as part of this jigsaw puzzle post  Brexit but also saying, OK, what can we do in the meantime as well.   Secretary Fox was keen to talk also today about things that could be done  before a trade deal.  </p><p> QUEST:  How much of this is the optics?  How important is it merely by  showing the world that the U.K. is starting talks?  Because at the end of  the day, you and we all know, nothing can really come of it, even if you  get a memorandum of understanding, it will ten years afterwards to get a  full trade deal.  This is about, in some case, hyperbole.  </p><p> BRIGINSHAW:  I would say political encouragement.  Let's focus, then, on  the things that could be done that don't need a trade deal.  Stronger  science collaboration.  Some regulatory cooperation.  Talking about cyber  security and new rules for cyber security.  Data transfers.  Movement of  people.  So, things that don't need trade deals but that could dial up the  potential of what's already a powerful and strong economy.  </p><p> The U.K., well, the EU, as such, does not have a trade deal with the United  States at the moment.  Therefore, is trading pretty much on WTO terms.  If  the U.K., post Brexit, just continues exactly the same way, shouldn't make  much difference for the U.K.?</p><p> QUEST:  Well, that's a great point.  We are already at 20 percent of our  exports going to the U.S. it's a trillion dollars of two-way investment.   $250 billion and a million jobs in both economies.  So, the real  opportunity is how can we dial that up.  Part of that can come from a trade  negotiation, trade and investment negotiation, and part of it can come  from, as I say, the things we can talk about already and do to strengthen  that relationship.  </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you.  We'll talk more about it  certainly as the deal does or does not come to fruition.  </p><p>Ryanair.  Europe's largest airline.  It is, look at the numbers.  Which  whichever measure you take.  </p><p> [16:40:00] Ryanair says it may have to move its entire fleet out of Britain  if it doesn't get clarity on Brexit.  On QUEST EXPRESS when I was down at  the exchange, Ryanair's chief marketing officer told me the airline is  running out of time to get answers from the British government.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KENNY JACOBS, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, RYANAIR:  So, if we don't have  absolute clarity come August of next year in terms of what's the  alternative going to be to continue open skies, then we are in unknown  territory.  We want to continue flying between the U.K. and Europe as we do  today.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, but you know as well as I do that flying from the U.K. to  another European country and back again is really very simple.  I mean, in  the industry parlance, that's just third and fourth freedoms.  Countries  have those all the time.  It's the much more complicated stuff of intra- European flying when you are using the U.K. fleet that's the problem.  </p><p> JACOBS:  Yes, but flying between the U.K. and Europe is governed by the  European court of justice as part of open skies.  The European government  decided they're leaving Europe and the European court of justice.  Theresa  May has made it clear.  When they do that, there needs to be a brand-new  bilateral in place between the U.K. and every one of the EU 27.  Something  brand-new does need to be created.  We can't go back to the bilateral that  existed.  Hence, we are calling on the politicians.  We are a year since  the referendum and we are not any clearer on what the alternative will be.   We are making contingency plans.  Those would include that, if we can't fly  for a period of time -- again, we don't want this to happen, but we can see  a situation where there may be no flying between the U.K. and Europe for a  number of months.  We don't want it to happen.  We're encouraging the  government to work fast.  </p><p> QUEST:  Now, now Kenny, how much of this is hyperbole?  How much of this is  you raising the temperature in a situation where perhaps nobody  realistically thinks that any routes will be canceled or flights won't take  place.  </p><p> JACOBS:  There will be a solution, Richard.  Absolutely.  There will be a  solution.  But the issue will be, is there going to be a solution in time.   As I said, it's about us planning our schedules and releasing our schedules  a year in advance.  If we don't have clarity we'll be in unprecedented  territory.  As I said, we don't want this to happen but we need greater  urgency in the coming months than we've seen over the past six months.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> QUEST:  Chief marketing officer for Ryanair.  \"D\" is for disappointing.   Alphabet Google has reported its result.  The stock in after-hours is  falling.  I'll give you the numbers as to why Google appears to be  disappointing tonight.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [15:45:00] QUEST:  Welcome back, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  Google shares down  3 percent after hours.  The earnings down sharply from last year.  Now,  there is a reason why the earnings are off badly in the quarter.  Profits  hit 2.7 billion by the EU, fine.  So, we kick off a blockbuster earnings  week.  Monday is Alphabet.  Tuesday is McDonald's, AT&amp;T and GM.  I don't  need to read them.  You can read them yourself.  They're on the screen.   It's a busy earnings week so far.  Joining me now, Brian O'Keefe, deputy  editor at \"Fortune.\"  These numbers from Google are interesting.  A large  company everybody has heard of.  The numbers suggest it was a good quarter,  but it's got these regulatory issues, which is becoming prevalent for many  companies.  </p><p> BRIAN O'KEEFE, DEPUTY EDITOR, \"FORTUNE\":  I think especially for the big  tech companies.  Ironically, we were just flagging this in the current  issue where we released the global 500.  Apple.  Google, Facebook.  Have  changed globally.  We were expecting maybe Trump to cause complications  with globalization.  Now they're running into regulatory issues in Europe  right now.  </p><p> QUEST:  On the 500, what has grabbed you about it?  It's always the same  suspects, as they say, at the top.  They might move around a bit, but it's  always the biggest companies that are always there.  What did you find  interesting this time?  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  I think there are two big trends which kind of intersect.  The  two are the rise of technology, the fine against Google notwithstanding.   Big tech companies are making a march up the list.  The second big trend is  the rise of China which is really powerful if you look at the numbers.  </p><p> QUEST:  Although those Chinese companies that are moving in, maybe with the  exception of Ali Baba and one or two others they're still domestic based.   They haven't spread their wings to become household recognition outside of  China.  It's the large domestic issue.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  The largest companies in China right now are still the state- owned companies.  However, we have two debuts this year.  Ali baba.  And  Tencent.  We did a profile on the H&amp;A group.  </p><p> QUEST:  Which has been buying huge amounts everywhere.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  Around the world.  Europe, the United States.  Their CEO says  they want to be the local company next-door in the U.S. that's drawing  scrutiny itself in China.  So, you know, they have been forced to come out  and just today released information about their ownership stake.  </p><p> QUEST:  This issue of tech, you know, anyone who has got a portfolio that's  sort of balances out, you look at the -- one looks at the gains from your  tech side, and it's 15, 20, 25 percent growth.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  Right.  </p><p> QUEST:  Unless it's a McDonald's or a special situation, you look at  everything else.  Honeywell, Caterpillar, Ford.  United Airlines.  There is  nothing equivalent.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  Certainly, tech has been the big, big powerful story.  You look  at Amazon, for instance.  They are number 26 this year.  That's just their  revenues.  The stock has been unbelievable.  Ali Baba, their stock is up  something like 70 percent year-to-date.  It's tempting to put all your  money into those stocks.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  I will say, though, you are getting the benefit of that in the  indexes because they're over represented in the market cap weighted index.   A very smart guy, Warren Buffett would say spread your bets on the index  and by the way Berkshire Hathaway is in the top ten this year for the first  time.</p><p> QUEST:  Never split the stock, of course.  I can't remember how much one  share of Berkshire Hathaway is these days.  It is a huge amount.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  He has never split it.  It used to be going against trend but now  it's becoming more common not to split the stock.  It's become cool to not  split the stock.  </p><p> QUEST:  I always thought that's a bit of a strange thing.  Who wants to buy  half a share of Amazon?  Because it's $1,000.  </p><p> O'KEEFE:  Exactly.  </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  Appreciate it.  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p> Now the results we've been talking about, only tell part of the tech story.   Let me walk you through Silicon Valley and some of the events that have  taken place today that will make it clear what's happened.  First of all,  Microsoft Paint, those of us of a certain age will remember it.  It's age  32.  But now it faces removal.  Because apparently Microsoft is thinking of  dropping Paint from its next version of Windows.  So, could this be RIP.   Paint, '85 to 2017.  Even though there are 100 million users of it.  </p><p> Then you've got an event today.  Web shares.  WebMD.  Look at that.  Just  what we were talking about the other day.  WebMD is being purchased by KKR.   It's bought by the investment firm.  $2.8 billion is the price.  </p><p> [16:50:00] WebMD says the decision is best for shareholders.  But the  premium.  Look at that.  WebMD does nothing, and that's enough to give you  a heart attack.  </p><p> And finally, Mark Zuckerberg shirts.  Now, Mark Zuckerberg's plain t-shirts  cost just $300.  And they -- feel the quality -- they are custom made for  him.  But now the entrepreneur Klaas Buck created a replica.  You can have  a Mark Zuckerberg t-shirt for $46.  And the proceeds will go to the Chan  Zuckerberg initiative.  So, forget Mr. Zuckerberg's.  300.  All yours for  46 and charity.  Imagine trading on Wall Street before the invention of  radio, tv and computers.  Now, it was this machine.  It's known as the  ticker tape.  It changed everything.  We'll look at the history of the  ticker as we have our chapter of stories from the street.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  Wall Street, and the stories from the street that we're looking at  over the course of the summer.  And today it is that most famous of  instruments that created a cultural phenomenon but really goes to the heart  of Wall Street.  The ticker tape! </p><p> This is one of the original Thomas Edison tickers.  </p><p> This is the machine that changed Wall Street.  Before radio and TV, the  stock ticker was the way to get accurate financial information.   Transmitted over telegraph lines.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JOHN STEELE GORDON, WALL STREET HISTORIAN:  It revolutionized the stock  exchange business because now you could effectively trade anywhere in the  country and know what the prices were that minute.  The ticker tape greatly  enlarged the reach of Wall Street.  Thomas Edison was one of the inventors  of it.  </p><p> QUEST:  The movies portrayed the breakthrough as a eureka moment.  Soon  after, a New York city tradition was born, the ticker tape parade.  </p><p> The ticker tape also helped document one of the worst days in Wall Street  history, the crash of 1929.  </p><p> KRISTEN AGUILERA, MUSEUM OF FINANCE:  This is undoubtedly one of the most  important pieces of historical ticker tape.  It was recovered from a  trading floor on the morning of the 1929 crash.  This piece of framed  ticker tape represents the first 45 minutes of trading on that tumultuous  day.  </p><p> QUEST:  Ticker machines are collectors' items.  Some go for $15,000.   Ticker tape was phased out in the 1960s.  But we still call it the ticker  as it crawls across the bottom of the screen.  And that's the ticker tape.   Another chapter in our stories from the street.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> [16:55:00] QUEST:  And we still, indeed, have the ticker, where you can now  download or read, go to CNN.com/podcast.  Check out the podcast.  Subscribe  on iTunes, TuneIn or Stitcher.  It's all up there.  Or go to  CNN.com/podcast.  Where did you hear about it?  On the ticker.  Profitable  Moment is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  Tonight's Profitable Moment.  The allegations of collusion by the  big three German car makers, Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW could not be more  serious.  If proven true it will be devastating for the made in Germany  reputation that these three car companies colluded over emission standards,  engine size or whatever.  I suspect the truth will be somewhere in between.   As you heard earlier in the program, I think it will be much more about we  had meetings to discuss common standards.  </p><p> The problem, of course, is when is a meeting on common standards turning  into something more nefarious and dangerous for competition.  This needs a  full, thorough, deep and dark investigation from the commission and from  the authorities in Germany.  Because if it's true, it's likely the sort of  thing we've not seen before.  That's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight.  I  am Richard Quest in New York.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I  hope it's profitable.  Same again tomorrow.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Closing bell ringing on Wall Street. Obviously, a very exciting day on the stock exchange. The market is down some 51 points. So, no records for the Dow. You can stop ringing the bell now, sir. Thank you. There we go. I don't know what he's taking, but I suggests he stops doing it now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's Monday, it's July the 24th. Tonight, something nasty under the hood. Shares in German car companies fall amid serious allegations of collusion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Donald Trump's growth targets seem a long way off if the IMF's numbers are to be believed. And an even more special relation, U.K. and the U.S. are starting trade talks before Brexit. I am Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital and I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. We begin tonight with the share prices of Germany's biggest car companies falling with a new crisis that's threatening one of Europe's most powerful and important industries. It's an allegation that German car makers colluded to set costs, agree on supplies and develop technologies like emissions systems.</p><p>According to \"Der Spiegel,\" the newspaper is reporting that under collusion -- or alleged collusion, went on for more than three decades, involving hundreds of executives from the companies and their subsidiaries. The shares of all three and the day up to one and three percent. None of the three, Daimler, Volkswagen or BMW are commenting specifically. Volkswagen plans to hold a special board meeting on Wednesday to discuss the allegations.</p><p>It all came about, apparently, because Volkswagen revealed to the authorities as part of the diesel emissions scandal that these meetings had been taking place. But, if true, the seriousness can be seen when you think of how important the automobile industry, the car industry, is in Germany. A source of national pride. If they were found guilty of collusion. It will cause damage on three fronts.</p><p>Firstly, of course, the monetary front. If the EU found them guilty and the German authorities found them guilty, monetary fines which could reach into the billions of dollars. The commission says it's too early to speculate. That's before, for example, in the litigious United States people decided to sue the companies in this country claiming damages, costs and compensation. The reputational damage would be devastating both to the car industry is the made in Germany brand. Which is already struggling after the diesel emissions scandal.</p><p>And then the broader economy. In Germany alone, 800,000 jobs are accounted for in the industry. It's one-fifth -- 20 percent, of the country's industrial revenue comes directly or indirectly from the car industry. Joining me now, Hans-Olaf Henkel, a member of the European parliament and former director of the Federation of German Industries. I will preface, sir, I will preface, if true and if proven, this would be devastating.</p><p>HANS-OLAF HENKEL, MEMBER OF EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Absolutely, Richard. It would be devastating, not only because we have, as you rightfully say, 800,000 employees in Germany depending on this sector, we have tens of thousands of Americans depending also on German car companies in the U.S. But let's face it, nothing is proven, and as far as I can see, this has not been a price-fixing deal or something like that, but possibly an agreement on certain standards.</p><p>Now, one has to find out whether it is correct to agree on such standards like the size of the tank for a liquid which you use in order to get the diesel emissions under control, or whether it has been something more serious. But we have to wait and, indeed, if proven correct, it would be a disaster.</p><p>QUEST: There is clearly -- I think you're right, sir, in the sense of the devil is going to be in the detail. You know, were we having ad hoc meetings about minor matters. You know it's a very fine line on, one, of interpretation. Who should take the lead here? Should it be the commission in Europe or the national regulators in Germany, do you think?</p><p>[16:05:03] HENKEL: Well, clearly a violation of cartel rules is a responsibility of the European Commission. The European Commission has done, in my view, in my observation, the last decades, very good jobs. They have unearthed some of those scandals. By the way, some of them also happened in Germany. They have levied hefty fines on those companies. So, my -- I am rather confident that the European Commission will do a good job here. It is their responsibility. However, if criminal actions are involved, then it becomes the responsibility of the German system, like in the case of VW, which, as we all know, this company has manipulated the software and committed criminal acts. That is being pursued by the German system.</p><p>QUEST: Can we turn to Brexit if we may? I read your article recently on Brexit. Your family -- if you look at the end of the second round of negotiations, you still believe that the prevalence of view is that Monsieur Barnier and Verhofstadt are wanting to punish rather than get a good deal.</p><p>HENKEL: Yes, I think there is ample evidence. By the way, I'd like to make sure that your viewers understand. I was actively campaigning against Brexit. But I believe that one should honor the result of the referendum of the U.K. And in my view, especially Mr. Verhofstadt doesn't. Verhofstadt is in Europe, the epitome of a centralized Eurofier. And he is now in charge of the group within the parliament covering the Brexit for the parliament. By the way, he wasn't even elected by the parliament but was put in place by Her Schultz when he was president of the parliament.</p><p>QUEST: Do you believe that there is wiggle room for the commission, or for the EU, on the pillars? This idea, for example, of some form of accommodation on the single market on the customs union but only if you take freedom of movement. Is there gray enough area to allow a deal?</p><p>HENKEL: I think we have to allow this kind of deal. Because, let's face it, Britain is so very important for the EU. At least as important for the EU as the EU is to Britain. And by the way, the assertion of Verhofstadt and Barnier to say that a country outside the union should not have the same deal as a country inside the union is deadly wrong. Switzerland gets the same deal as the other countries. And when it comes to the research agreement, Horizon 2020, which is a big research funding forum for the EU. Even Israel is even part of the deal and has the same right as any other EU country. So why not give it to the United Kingdom.</p><p>QUEST: As we end here, sir, we are grateful to have had you this evening. What is your fundamental fear in these negotiations? I know it's early days, only two rounds. There are another 18 months or so to go. And you'll get a chance to vote on the final package, but what's your fundamental fear?</p><p>HENKEL: My fundamental fear is that there is no agreement, and that would be a true disaster. By the way, I think Britain leaving the European Union, quite frankly, means that the last country with common sense is leaving the European Union. Because that country always believed in subsidiary rather than centralization. That country also believed in competition between nations rather than harmonization. And these kinds of elements are missing. So, I think Brexit is a bad story, not only for Britain, it is also a bad story for the European Union.</p><p>QUEST: We're grateful you came to talk to us tonight. Two important stories we're covering on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. thank you, sir.</p><p>Shares of the automakers we started out talking about, Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW. They pulled down the European indices. Just take a look. You might have expected worse out of Frankfurt but up a quarter of a percent. The FTSE was the worse off down one percent. Only Paris ended in the green. Ryanair shares were down after warning that fares could fall. You're going to hear from its chief marketing officer later in the program. Also warning that Ryanair may actually stop flying from the U.K. if indeed Brexit talks go badly.</p><p>[16:10:00] QUEST: To Wall Street. The main -- the larger markets, but the narrow and the wide, the Dow was down. It's down 66.9. Right through the session it was down. But the NASDAQ actually closed at a record. And it's its 50th closing record since the election. We're going to get the numbers from Alphabet, which is Google's parent company. Alphabet is going to report in this hour. When it does we'll have the results for you and give you some analysis. The NASDAQ is at a record. You see the S&amp;P 500 and Dow both up. Which merely reinforces the significance of tech in the current market. We'll talk about that during the course of the program.</p><p>Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, made a rare public statement after meeting the Senate intelligence committee. He said, he did not collude with Russia during the presidential campaign. Kushner is a real estate developer New York. He is now denying relying on Russian funds for his own business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JARED KUSHNER, SENIOR ADVISOR TO U.S. PRESIDENT TRUMP: I did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so. I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds for my businesses. And I have been fully transparent in providing all requested information.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Jessica Schneider, we don't hear very often from Jared Kushner. In fact, I can't remember -- I mean maybe somebody will prove me wrong in that he spoke once six months ago to a Tea Party or something, but the reality is, the fact he had to stand there at the White House with microphones is evidence of the gravity of this.</p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: It absolutely is. I mean, the Russia investigation has really overtaken this town. It's the only thing anyone ever talks about because it does have such enormity. So yes, of course, now Jared Kushner is trying to confront this head-on. He said in his statement that he wanted to do this to set the record straight. So, he tried to do that in releasing that 11-page statement earlier this morning. And then, of course, again when he finally went before the cameras to speak for probably the longest we've ever heard him speak outside the West Wing today.</p><p>It was a fairly brief prepared statement, but he said in it quite forcefully that he did not collude with the Russian government. That no one in the campaign colluded. And then he said that his actions were proper. You know, Richard, he also talks about the political implications of this. He talked about the fact that, in his view, Donald Trump won fair and square because he properly read the pulse of the American public, tailored his message to that. And then Jared Kushner kind of pushed forth the president's line that we hear a lot, that any indication otherwise is just unfair to the American people and really ridicules the American people. Any implication that the Russian influence may have tipped the election is not a fair one to make. So, he put that in there to.</p><p>QUEST: I want to jump in here because I am fascinated by what you start off with when you're saying -- Jessica, how -- paralyzes may be the wrong word. But the mood in Washington, as you're heading towards a long, hot summer. That mood, is it one of paralysis yet over the government and Russia?</p><p>SCHNEIDER: I don't want to say it's more chaos and confusion. The president has these agenda items he is trying to tick off. The things he talked about a lot in the campaign. Health care, infrastructure, overturning and repealing Obamacare, however, all of that has been overshadowed by the Russia investigation, and that's in no small part. Because the president keeps talking about it and in particular tweeting about it.</p><p>You know, it was just last week that he talked to the \"New York Times.\" He talked a lot about Russia. He talked about his Attorney General, the fact that he wasn't happy he recused himself. So really, I don't know if it's paralysis, although it may be inside the White House. But really, it's just kind of chaotic. It's confusing and the president really can't stay on message as I think lawmakers wish he would.</p><p>QUEST: Jessica, thank you. Need that. We needed to understand the situation in Washington. Much appreciated. Thank you.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Now, staying with economic growth and the president. Donald Trump once promised 4 percent economic growth. He then set the target of 3 percent. When we come back after the break, this man, you sir, are going to help us understand. The IMF says no to 4 percent. When it says 2.1 percent. Anthony Chan will be with us to talk about economics.</p><p>[16:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: You could say the IMF have lost a bit of confidence in Donald Trump. On the campaign trail, campaigning Trump, promised to rev up growth to 4 percent. He changed that number slightly to 3 percent as the target growth. However, the IMF has chopped its own forecast of U.S. economic growth to 2.1 percent for this year and next, down from 2.3., 2.5. Now these numbers are the latest, matched by Standard &amp; Poor's, which is pretty close. It says the economic backdrop is benign and uninspired. The IMF worries about uncertainty. S&amp;P is talking about the failure to get an infrastructure plan this year or next. Anthony Chan is chief economist at Chase Bank. All right. This is where the rubber meets the road, as they say.</p><p>ANTHONY CHAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CHASE: Absolutely.</p><p>QUEST: Your forecast this year and next for the U.S. is what?</p><p>CHAN: Two percent for this year and about 2.3 percent next year. We think some good stuff will come out of the administration next year but this year will be challenging.</p><p>QUEST: Can growth, not should -- I suppose it can. Is it likely that growth could hit 3 percent next year or the year after?</p><p>CHAN: I think you can see particular calendar quarters which could give you 3 percent growth rate. That's not a problem. But to see the entire year at 3 percent or more, very challenging because productivity has been very low and labor markets are so tight that it's very difficult to get labor force growth. Remember that at the end of the day you need labor force growth and you need productivity growth to basically sum up to that kind of growth rate. Right now, the numbers do not add up.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but there are only two ways you can get really, from the president's point of view, you can get to 4 percent economic, or 3 percent economic growth. You either have to cut taxes and hope you don't -- you'll blow the deficit. But you will juice up the economy. Or you increase government spending. That is the --</p><p>CHAN: There is another third way. And that is, if you make -- increase efficiency and that's done through less regulation and more encouragement on the part --</p><p>QUEST: That takes a lot longer than a quarter or three --</p><p>CHAN: It does take a lot longer. This is a multi-year process. Absolutely.</p><p>QUEST: Right. Are you seeing evidence yet that that is happening, even though we have lots of regulations have been eliminated and you have the take two off the table if you put one on. So, there are changes taking place.</p><p>CHAN: There are changing things that are taking place, but not of a sufficient critical mass to generate the 3 percent or 4 percent growth rate that was hoped for.</p><p>QUEST: Does it matter that the U.S. is growing at 2.1, 2.3 percent? Historically that is on the low side. One might say it's weak growth but not exactly disastrous.</p><p>CHAN: It is not disastrous.</p><p>QUEST: It's still growth.</p><p>CHAN: Absolutely. And, Richard, a lot of research out there suggests and, in fact, strongly confirms, that when you have sluggish growth, economic expansion lasts a lot longer. Remember, this expansion just hit eight years old in June and the average age of economic expansion is 4.9 years. This is precisely why this expansion has lasted longer than the historical average, because it's very sluggish, but nonetheless quite persistent.</p><p>QUEST: You don't have the feel-good factor with the 2.2 percent growth, do you? People don't feel things are going well?</p><p>CHAN: People may not feel it, but in terms of equity markets you're getting that good-feel factor looking at the equity market rates of return.</p><p>[16:20:00] QUEST: All right, you've raised the equity markets. If he can't get 4 percent, or even 3 percent, he -- I shouldn't be disrespectful. If the president can't get 4 percent or 3 percent, how much of this market do you think he's relying on?</p><p>CHAN: Believe it or not, the equity market sort of relies more on corporate profit growth than it does on economic growth. And what you saw in the first calendar quarter, you saw almost 14 percent growth in S&amp;P 500 corporate profits. The second quarter is shaping up to give you a calendar quarter that's going to be 8 percent or better and, in fact, the whole year as a whole is certainly poised to give you something close to 8 percent and next year perhaps something similar.</p><p>QUEST: You're suggesting, then, that this -- obviously, to a certain extent this market is hoping for tax reform, it's hoping for health care reform, it's hoping for all the things that would give that productivity growth you referred to, but it's not completely reliant upon it.</p><p>CHAN: Not completely reliant. And in fact, if you get the things that you've just mentioned, then the corporate profit growth would be a lot much stronger. And remember, that the equity market rates of return are the sum of corporate profit growth plus dividends for the S&amp;P 500. That's precisely why we're looking at a number that's above 10 percent for this year already.</p><p>QUEST: Excellent, good to see you.</p><p>CHAN: My pleasure.</p><p>QUEST: As always, thank you so much.</p><p>[16:21:15] Russia is warning that the talk in Washington of further U.S. sanctions is, in the words of Russia, counterproductive and harmful. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskof is reacting to the news that negotiators in both houses of Congress in the U.S. have agreed on new measures against Moscow. Lawmakers say it said to be in front of President Trump in the next week.</p><p>Clare Sebastian joins me from Moscow. Where the seriousness of this -- you know, to some extent Clare, because you're normally based in the states -- that the whole question of Russia and sanctions just all gets lost, but where you are there is a seriousness to it.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT: right, exactly, Richard. This is not a nuanced issue here. The Kremlin has been clear all along that it does not like sanctions. It has called them everything from politically motivated to a violation of international law, and its sovereignty. In this case today was no different. The Kremlin told us they viewed this extremely negatively. But they say, that given the kind of mixed messages they're hearing from the White House they're going to wait, they said, patiently to see how they finalize their position. I guess to see whether or not President Trump is willing to sign this. But Richard, this is not going away, the issue of sanctions. There is always a condition imposed to have them lifted and Russia is not willing to make any concessions. We have a situation where sanctions on Russia from the United States, from the European Union, are simply becoming the status quo and they're just evolving.</p><p>QUEST: OK. But this idea of sanctions and Russia. It's all tied up -- when everybody talks about, hearing over the last few days -- adoption, an adoption discussion. And there is the strange Magnitsky law, which you need to explain and put into context for how it relates to the sanctions row.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: This was a law imposed in the U.S. in 2012, Richard, in response to the death in Russia of a whistle blowing attorney called Sergey Magnitsky. It's hard to overestimate really just how controversial this is. One man who knows that better than anyone else is the man who has picked up where Sergey Magnitsky left off. He continues to fight every day for justice for him. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Nikolai Gorokhov says he's lucky to be alive. In March, the Moscow lawyer fell from his fourth story apartment block sustaining serious head injuries.</p><p>(on camera): What happened?</p><p>NIKOLAI GOROKHOV, MAGNITSKY FAMILY LAWYER TEXT: Unfortunately, or fortunately I don't remember what happened. I came to in the hospital care unit of the hospital.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Russian media at the time reported it as an accident. But he fell while trying to wench a bathtub of to his balcony. Gorokhov says he had lifted much heavier things safely.</p><p>(on camera): Is it possible it could have been an accident?</p><p>GOROKHOV TEXT: I can suppose that it wasn't an accident because a set of circumstances suggests that.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): To understand that set of circumstances, you have to go back a decade. In 2007, Sergey Magnitsky, a lawyer for investment firm Hermitage Capital, uncovered a $230 million tax fraud that he claimed involved officials in the Russian government.</p><p>(on camera): Magnitsky was arrested in 2008, and a year later he died at this Moscow prison while awaiting trial. His family says he was denied medical care and a Russian presidential human rights commission found to have been tortured. The Russian government though says he died of heart failure.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The bill is passed.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): The U.S. Congress instituted Magnitsky Act to which slapped sanctions on suspected Russian human rights abusers. Just two weeks later Russia band American adoptions of Russian children. In Moscow, Gorokhov took up the case. The day after his fall he was doing court with new evidence that he says prove government officials were behind the fraud.</p><p>[16:25:00] He finally made it to court in May. His appeal was rejected.</p><p>GOROKHOV TEXT: we continue to fight for the truth. Because time reveals new proof of Sergei's innocence.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera): Are you worried for your safety or for your family's safety?</p><p>GOROKHOV TEXT: Yes, I have safety concerns about what will happen to me, to my wife, my child.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): At the time of his fall, Gorokhov was also a witness in a now-settled New York lawsuit alleging some of the Russian tax fraud money had been used to buy New York property. He had provided these documents to American prosecutors, 90 files in total. According to a court filing, those prosecutors were worried individuals in Russia could attempt to threaten or harm him. Still, in a case that's become a thorn in the Kremlin's side, Gorokhov remains undeterred.</p><p>GOROKHOV TEXT: Justice is -- Sergei Magnitsky deserves justice.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So, Richard, Nikolai Gorokhov says he actually welcomes the new attention that surrounding the Magnitsky affair in the United States. He says it shows, while there may noting justice for Sergei Magnitsky in Russia, it may that there's justice for him outside of Russia.</p><p>QUEST: One quick question for you, Clare. I was talking to Jessica Schneider a moment ago in Washington -- you may have heard us -- where I was asking about the sense of paralysis or as she describes it as chaos and confusion in D.C. over the Russian affair. How is the whole thing being portrayed in Russia, in Moscow, this obsession in Washington with Russia?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: I think there is a few elements to this, Richard. On one hand Russia is, frankly, quite surprised that it's become this kind of major issue that it is in Washington. But on the other hand, they don't welcome this at all. They were, in fact, hoping when Trump took office that there might be a reset in the relationship with Russia, that there might be a prospect even of sanctions being lifted. But the fact that Russia has become this kind of Achilles' heel for Trump that's become so politically toxic that he may now be in a situation where he is forced to sign a new sanctions bill on Russia.</p><p>This is not what Russia was looking for. They didn't want to be in a situation where it was simply too politically difficult for the U.S. president to reset this relationship. So, there's many sides to this. And there's another one in fact that Russia does like to point out that there is disarray in Washington because it makes them seem stable by comparison.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So, it's a complicated issue the way this is being received here.</p><p>QUEST: Clare Sebastian in Moscow for us tonight. Thank you for staying up late, Clare. Thank you.</p><p>As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, from tea to chickens, trade has bound that U.S. and the United States across the Atlantic for centuries. And the prospect of a new deal which we will discuss.</p><p>[16:30:36] QUEST: Hello. I am Richard Quest. There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. Where Ryanair's chief marketing officer tells me, the company is running out of time to get answers from the British government on Brexit.</p><p>And exit without saving. Microsoft is finally giving up Paint. On this network, the news always comes first.</p><p>President Donald Trump's son-in-law says he did not collude with Russia and doesn't know of anyone else in the campaign who did either. It's Jared Kushner's first public account of his meeting with the Russians during the presidential campaign and transition. Jared Kushner is a senior adviser to Mr. Trump and insisted all his actions were proper.</p><p>The Pakistani Taliban is claiming responsibility for a bomb blast at vegetable market that killed 26 people. Officials say the attack on Monday targeted the police in Lahore, the capital of Punjab province. Almost 50 people were wounded.</p><p>Thousands of protesters demonstrating outside Poland's Supreme Court got what they wanted much to everyone's surprise. The country's president vetoed two controversial measures that would have given his party sweeping power over the country's courts. The president said the laws would not strengthen the sense of justice, he vowed to rewrite them.</p><p>The parents of Charley Gard have given up their legal fight to take their son to the United States. They say it was based on new MRI and body scans that showed it was too late to treat the terminally ill baby. He has a rare genetic disease. He can't breathe or move on his own.</p><p>Swiss police are searching for a man who went on a rampage with a chain saw in northern Switzerland wounded five people. He apparently is a Swiss national with no fixed address and apparently lives in a forest.</p><p>The U.K. and the United States have taken the first steps to what could be a new era in the so-called special relationship. The British Trade Secretary Liam Fox is in Washington where he has kicked off informal talks with the U.S. after Brexit. Donald Trump has said he wants a trade deal with the U.K., Britain, and not just any deal, a very big and powerful deal, he said. Liam Fox believes the two countries have a strong economic bond.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIAM FOX, TRADE SECRETARY, BRITAIN: It is perhaps a cliche for a British secretary of state to come to the U.S. and talk about the special relationship, yet the fact that a phrase is well used does not make it any less true. Britain and America are united by language, culture, history, security and, of course, commerce and trade. It's perhaps fortuitous that we are also the first and fifth largest economies in the world. So, the economic value of our bond cannot be overstated. Any who are tempted to see our exit from the European Union as evidence of Britain looking inwards should think again. We have just chosen another path, to embrace the wider horizons of a truly global Britain. And as we contemplate our new place in the world, we do so with a renewed confidence and optimism, acknowledging the vast opportunities that lie before us, especially when it comes to strengthening our connection with our single largest trading partner.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: And the phrase is \"the economic value of a bond cannot be overstated\" as Liam Fox said. Let's show you, over the centuries, how deep and strong that bond goes back. It actually goes back to the colonies in the 1700s. You can trace it back almost to golf ball equipment, which is sent, thank you, from the U.K. to the United States. And then you have, well, the famous tea. Tea which was sent from Britain to the U.S., but with a very checkered history because the tax on tea from the East India Company, that sparked the revolution.</p><p>[16:35:00] So, you can arguably say which side that should go. We'll put it back with the U.K. Then, into the 1800s. And you get some real technological improvements. You get, for example, the first transatlantic telegraph cable, which connects New York and London. It is the cable that is used for trading foreign exchange, which is why the British pound and U.S. dollar cross rate is still called \"cable.\" By 1900s, and it's the second world war and the land lease act of Roosevelt allows the U.S. to support the U.K. in World War II by leasing and lending boats, ships and other important war product. So, to the cultural exchanges. Well, you've got famous artists going from the U.K. to the U.S., and in return, you have lots of Hollywood going back the other way.</p><p>The so-called British invasion goes one way. Hollywood exports to the other. Then bring it right up to date. Barack Obama, on Brexit. He says, Barack Obama, that Britain will be at the back of the que when it comes to talking trade. Donald Trump is a campaigner, immediately says the opposite. He says he wants a deal. He wants a deal done fast. To show how this trade relationship continues to grow even in this modern era, think about these two. The U.K. is now considering chlorine-washed chickens from the United States. It is a trade relationship like none other. The depth, the range, the breadth, the value. Jeffries Briginshaw joins me now. Even allowing for the extremely extensive relationship, you and everybody knows that the British cannot negotiate a trade deal until they've actually left the union. So, what's the purpose of these talks?</p><p>JEFFRIES BRIGINSHAW, CEO, BRITISH-AMERICAN BUSINESS COUNCIL: As you say, a lot of if, buts and maybes about when Britain can do trade deals. Customs, unions and competencies all getting in the way. Your graphics and your kind of interesting analysis showed us that the U.K.-U.S. economy is a source of strength, opportunity and stability. You don't necessarily need a trade deal to dial that up, to get more out of it. I think what we're seeing with the politics, if you want, encouragement on both sides, is encouragement, yes, towards a trade deal as part of this jigsaw puzzle post Brexit but also saying, OK, what can we do in the meantime as well. Secretary Fox was keen to talk also today about things that could be done before a trade deal.</p><p>QUEST: How much of this is the optics? How important is it merely by showing the world that the U.K. is starting talks? Because at the end of the day, you and we all know, nothing can really come of it, even if you get a memorandum of understanding, it will ten years afterwards to get a full trade deal. This is about, in some case, hyperbole.</p><p>BRIGINSHAW: I would say political encouragement. Let's focus, then, on the things that could be done that don't need a trade deal. Stronger science collaboration. Some regulatory cooperation. Talking about cyber security and new rules for cyber security. Data transfers. Movement of people. So, things that don't need trade deals but that could dial up the potential of what's already a powerful and strong economy.</p><p>The U.K., well, the EU, as such, does not have a trade deal with the United States at the moment. Therefore, is trading pretty much on WTO terms. If the U.K., post Brexit, just continues exactly the same way, shouldn't make much difference for the U.K.?</p><p>QUEST: Well, that's a great point. We are already at 20 percent of our exports going to the U.S. it's a trillion dollars of two-way investment. $250 billion and a million jobs in both economies. So, the real opportunity is how can we dial that up. Part of that can come from a trade negotiation, trade and investment negotiation, and part of it can come from, as I say, the things we can talk about already and do to strengthen that relationship.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir. Thank you. We'll talk more about it certainly as the deal does or does not come to fruition.</p><p>Ryanair. Europe's largest airline. It is, look at the numbers. Which whichever measure you take.</p><p>[16:40:00] Ryanair says it may have to move its entire fleet out of Britain if it doesn't get clarity on Brexit. On QUEST EXPRESS when I was down at the exchange, Ryanair's chief marketing officer told me the airline is running out of time to get answers from the British government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KENNY JACOBS, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, RYANAIR: So, if we don't have absolute clarity come August of next year in terms of what's the alternative going to be to continue open skies, then we are in unknown territory. We want to continue flying between the U.K. and Europe as we do today.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but you know as well as I do that flying from the U.K. to another European country and back again is really very simple. I mean, in the industry parlance, that's just third and fourth freedoms. Countries have those all the time. It's the much more complicated stuff of intra- European flying when you are using the U.K. fleet that's the problem.</p><p>JACOBS: Yes, but flying between the U.K. and Europe is governed by the European court of justice as part of open skies. The European government decided they're leaving Europe and the European court of justice. Theresa May has made it clear. When they do that, there needs to be a brand-new bilateral in place between the U.K. and every one of the EU 27. Something brand-new does need to be created. We can't go back to the bilateral that existed. Hence, we are calling on the politicians. We are a year since the referendum and we are not any clearer on what the alternative will be. We are making contingency plans. Those would include that, if we can't fly for a period of time -- again, we don't want this to happen, but we can see a situation where there may be no flying between the U.K. and Europe for a number of months. We don't want it to happen. We're encouraging the government to work fast.</p><p>QUEST: Now, now Kenny, how much of this is hyperbole? How much of this is you raising the temperature in a situation where perhaps nobody realistically thinks that any routes will be canceled or flights won't take place.</p><p>JACOBS: There will be a solution, Richard. Absolutely. There will be a solution. But the issue will be, is there going to be a solution in time. As I said, it's about us planning our schedules and releasing our schedules a year in advance. If we don't have clarity we'll be in unprecedented territory. As I said, we don't want this to happen but we need greater urgency in the coming months than we've seen over the past six months.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Chief marketing officer for Ryanair. \"D\" is for disappointing. Alphabet Google has reported its result. The stock in after-hours is falling. I'll give you the numbers as to why Google appears to be disappointing tonight.</p><p>[15:45:00] QUEST: Welcome back, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Google shares down 3 percent after hours. The earnings down sharply from last year. Now, there is a reason why the earnings are off badly in the quarter. Profits hit 2.7 billion by the EU, fine. So, we kick off a blockbuster earnings week. Monday is Alphabet. Tuesday is McDonald's, AT&amp;T and GM. I don't need to read them. You can read them yourself. They're on the screen. It's a busy earnings week so far. Joining me now, Brian O'Keefe, deputy editor at \"Fortune.\" These numbers from Google are interesting. A large company everybody has heard of. The numbers suggest it was a good quarter, but it's got these regulatory issues, which is becoming prevalent for many companies.</p><p>BRIAN O'KEEFE, DEPUTY EDITOR, \"FORTUNE\": I think especially for the big tech companies. Ironically, we were just flagging this in the current issue where we released the global 500. Apple. Google, Facebook. Have changed globally. We were expecting maybe Trump to cause complications with globalization. Now they're running into regulatory issues in Europe right now.</p><p>QUEST: On the 500, what has grabbed you about it? It's always the same suspects, as they say, at the top. They might move around a bit, but it's always the biggest companies that are always there. What did you find interesting this time?</p><p>O'KEEFE: I think there are two big trends which kind of intersect. The two are the rise of technology, the fine against Google notwithstanding. Big tech companies are making a march up the list. The second big trend is the rise of China which is really powerful if you look at the numbers.</p><p>QUEST: Although those Chinese companies that are moving in, maybe with the exception of Ali Baba and one or two others they're still domestic based. They haven't spread their wings to become household recognition outside of China. It's the large domestic issue.</p><p>O'KEEFE: The largest companies in China right now are still the state- owned companies. However, we have two debuts this year. Ali baba. And Tencent. We did a profile on the H&amp;A group.</p><p>QUEST: Which has been buying huge amounts everywhere.</p><p>O'KEEFE: Around the world. Europe, the United States. Their CEO says they want to be the local company next-door in the U.S. that's drawing scrutiny itself in China. So, you know, they have been forced to come out and just today released information about their ownership stake.</p><p>QUEST: This issue of tech, you know, anyone who has got a portfolio that's sort of balances out, you look at the -- one looks at the gains from your tech side, and it's 15, 20, 25 percent growth.</p><p>O'KEEFE: Right.</p><p>QUEST: Unless it's a McDonald's or a special situation, you look at everything else. Honeywell, Caterpillar, Ford. United Airlines. There is nothing equivalent.</p><p>O'KEEFE: Certainly, tech has been the big, big powerful story. You look at Amazon, for instance. They are number 26 this year. That's just their revenues. The stock has been unbelievable. Ali Baba, their stock is up something like 70 percent year-to-date. It's tempting to put all your money into those stocks.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>O'KEEFE: I will say, though, you are getting the benefit of that in the indexes because they're over represented in the market cap weighted index. A very smart guy, Warren Buffett would say spread your bets on the index and by the way Berkshire Hathaway is in the top ten this year for the first time.</p><p>QUEST: Never split the stock, of course. I can't remember how much one share of Berkshire Hathaway is these days. It is a huge amount.</p><p>O'KEEFE: He has never split it. It used to be going against trend but now it's becoming more common not to split the stock. It's become cool to not split the stock.</p><p>QUEST: I always thought that's a bit of a strange thing. Who wants to buy half a share of Amazon? Because it's $1,000.</p><p>O'KEEFE: Exactly.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir. Appreciate it. Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>Now the results we've been talking about, only tell part of the tech story. Let me walk you through Silicon Valley and some of the events that have taken place today that will make it clear what's happened. First of all, Microsoft Paint, those of us of a certain age will remember it. It's age 32. But now it faces removal. Because apparently Microsoft is thinking of dropping Paint from its next version of Windows. So, could this be RIP. Paint, '85 to 2017. Even though there are 100 million users of it.</p><p>Then you've got an event today. Web shares. WebMD. Look at that. Just what we were talking about the other day. WebMD is being purchased by KKR. It's bought by the investment firm. $2.8 billion is the price.</p><p>[16:50:00] WebMD says the decision is best for shareholders. But the premium. Look at that. WebMD does nothing, and that's enough to give you a heart attack.</p><p>And finally, Mark Zuckerberg shirts. Now, Mark Zuckerberg's plain t-shirts cost just $300. And they -- feel the quality -- they are custom made for him. But now the entrepreneur Klaas Buck created a replica. You can have a Mark Zuckerberg t-shirt for $46. And the proceeds will go to the Chan Zuckerberg initiative. So, forget Mr. Zuckerberg's. 300. All yours for 46 and charity. Imagine trading on Wall Street before the invention of radio, tv and computers. Now, it was this machine. It's known as the ticker tape. It changed everything. We'll look at the history of the ticker as we have our chapter of stories from the street.</p><p>QUEST: Wall Street, and the stories from the street that we're looking at over the course of the summer. And today it is that most famous of instruments that created a cultural phenomenon but really goes to the heart of Wall Street. The ticker tape!</p><p>This is one of the original Thomas Edison tickers.</p><p>This is the machine that changed Wall Street. Before radio and TV, the stock ticker was the way to get accurate financial information. Transmitted over telegraph lines.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN STEELE GORDON, WALL STREET HISTORIAN: It revolutionized the stock exchange business because now you could effectively trade anywhere in the country and know what the prices were that minute. The ticker tape greatly enlarged the reach of Wall Street. Thomas Edison was one of the inventors of it.</p><p>QUEST: The movies portrayed the breakthrough as a eureka moment. Soon after, a New York city tradition was born, the ticker tape parade.</p><p>The ticker tape also helped document one of the worst days in Wall Street history, the crash of 1929.</p><p>KRISTEN AGUILERA, MUSEUM OF FINANCE: This is undoubtedly one of the most important pieces of historical ticker tape. It was recovered from a trading floor on the morning of the 1929 crash. This piece of framed ticker tape represents the first 45 minutes of trading on that tumultuous day.</p><p>QUEST: Ticker machines are collectors' items. Some go for $15,000. Ticker tape was phased out in the 1960s. But we still call it the ticker as it crawls across the bottom of the screen. And that's the ticker tape. Another chapter in our stories from the street.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[16:55:00] QUEST: And we still, indeed, have the ticker, where you can now download or read, go to CNN.com/podcast. Check out the podcast. Subscribe on iTunes, TuneIn or Stitcher. It's all up there. Or go to CNN.com/podcast. Where did you hear about it? On the ticker. Profitable Moment is next.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's Profitable Moment. The allegations of collusion by the big three German car makers, Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW could not be more serious. If proven true it will be devastating for the made in Germany reputation that these three car companies colluded over emission standards, engine size or whatever. I suspect the truth will be somewhere in between. As you heard earlier in the program, I think it will be much more about we had meetings to discuss common standards.</p><p>The problem, of course, is when is a meeting on common standards turning into something more nefarious and dangerous for competition. This needs a full, thorough, deep and dark investigation from the commission and from the authorities in Germany. Because if it's true, it's likely the sort of thing we've not seen before. That's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. I am Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable. Same again tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2017072401cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P3F-5D31-JB20-G3YT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7226\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 24, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002S0T</classCode><className>RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS481111 SCHEDULED PASSENGER AIR TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>RYAAY (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>RYA (LSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Automotive Industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Human Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Aviation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000261</classCode><className>CARTELS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

The ruling is decisive and will most likely lead to stricter regulations governing how data are collected and used.

As society continues to increase its reliance on digital marketing and communication, the value of online profiles highlighting the preferences of society becomes ever more marketable.  Concurrently, large tech companies such as Facebook, Google Inc. and Apple Inc. continue to gain economic power through aggregation of society's personal information and anti-competitive acquisitions of smaller companies.  Facebook on the Dock  On June 23, Germany's Federal Court of Justice ruled that Facebook abused its dominance in social media by illegally amassing user data across its subsidiary platforms Instagram Inc. and WhatsApp.[1] In response, the court ordered Facebook to permit its users to block the company from combining their Facebook data with information about their activities on other applications and websites.  However, this is not the first time that Facebook's data collection practices have been subject to reprimand. In 2017, the European Union fined the company $122 million for violating the agreement that it would abstain from collecting user data across the WhatsApp and Facebook platforms.[2]  Then in July 2019, Facebook agreed to an unprecedented $5 billion penalty to resolve the Federal Trade Commission's probe into its allegations of data abuse.[3] While the $5 billion fine exceeded the largest privacy or data security penalty in history, it represented only 9% of Facebook's 2018 revenue.  Facebook's Dominance a Key Issue  Facebook's dominance over the social media market falls under the umbrella of antitrust law. Under Title 15 of the U.S. Code, Section 2, every person who monopolizes or attempts to monopolize any part of the domestic or international trade is subject to felony prosecution and fines up to $100 million, in the case of a corporation.  The FTC defines a monopolist as \"a company with significant and durable market power.\"[4] Additionally, obtaining a monopoly by use of anti-competitive acquisitions raises red flags with regulators looking for potential antitrust violations.    After decades of unregulated and unchecked growth, the current concern for the true impact of big tech antitrust violations is overdue and now appears to be at the forefront of lawmakers' minds.  On July 29, the CEOs of Amazon.com Inc., Apple, Facebook and Google attended a congressional hearing to answer for their market dominance.[5] During the hearing, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' testimony appeared to lend credence to the claim that Amazon's company policies allowed it to use private data on third-party sellers to develop its own products.[6]  Similarly, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted that the company has adapted features that others have introduced into its own products.[7] In reality, these large tech companies are achieving market dominance by collecting user information, requiring users to submit to unrestricted access to their personal information, and then utilizing this information to develop their own competing products. Once these in-house products are developed, the dominant companies purchase their smaller competitors, leaving the tech giants in control of the remaining market share.  How Can the U.S. Respond?  In order to anticipate potential antitrust violations in the U.S. the FTC should increase the severity of sanctions issued for the exploitation of user data.  The FTC could follow the lead of the EU in this respect. For example, in May 2016, the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, which allows regulators to fine companies up to 4% of their global revenue and generally requires companies to obtain user consent before collecting and using one's personal information.  By introducing heavier fines while also requiring tech companies to limit the amount of personal data they collect, the FTC may be able to reduce the prevalence of future data abuse conflicts.  Some might contend that such change should not be left to the FTC. Arguably, the FTC may be unable to effectively assess the competitive effects of a transaction with enough accuracy and time to permit effective antitrust intervention.[8]  However, the underlying market structure in digital markets has proven to be durable, particularly when a company achieves a dominant position.[9] Therefore, the nature of big tech and the progression of its market should not give the FTC reason to refrain from enforcing aggressive antitrust restrictions against it.  Alternatively, the FTC could propose legislation to prohibit large tech companies from simultaneously offering a marketplace while selling its products in that market place.  For example, the Apple app store allows the company to both offer third-party applications and offer its own Apple-made applications. By effecting this separation of commerce, companies could be prevented from using the leverage of their marketplace to squeeze out smaller app developers or charging excessive commissions to host the third-party apps in the marketplace.  Additionally, the FTC could embrace Sen. Elizabeth Warren's, D-Mass., regulatory plan to repeal some of big tech's acquisitions of smaller competitors.[10] However, the repeal of these acquisitions could bring forth significant job loss if big tech threatens to lay off the employees of its acquisitions, in the effort to forestall this repeal.  The current COVID-19 crisis and the record-breaking unemployment rate in the U.S. should give regulators pause so as to strongly consider the impact of breaking up big tech in the current socioeconomic climate.  If the FTC fails to act, this may impact innovation within the technology sector. The monopolization of data in digital markets is particularly damaging. Arguably, a monopolist may place less value on developing innovative product because they have already maximized their income on a particular product.  However, if there is a proliferation of competition within the tech market, this will likely force competitors to develop better products so as to gain more market share. For example, the competition between Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. has led to consistent supply of high-quality mobile phones.  Conclusion  By aggregating and monopolizing user data, big tech companies could decisively limit the amount of innovative products that are produced each year. Essentially, by exploiting their database and charging high entry fees to use this data, big tech is able to create an entry barrier for other developing companies who may need this data to develop and distribute their products. In turn, we may see fewer newcomers to the technology market.[11]  For example, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft Corp. were all small upstarts before they developed the product that allowed them to ingrain their services within our daily lives. However, by engaging in antitrust-violating practices with our information, big tech may prevent society from witnessing the rise of another Microsoft in our lifetime. This is exactly the type of market chokehold antitrust laws were intended to prevent.   Garrick Josephs is an associate at Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman &amp; Dicker LLP.

For example, in the area of transparency: as long as casual lies and reputable news reports, as long as checked facts and mere opinion, as long as reason and hate speech appear one after another in people's newsfeeds, with nothing to distinguish between them, demagogues will have it far too easy. We need the sources of our information to be crystal clear, particularly when political ads are concerned.Steinmeier went further, saying that these new regulations could 'take the wind out of the sails' of populists, and complained that 'small groups cause disproportionate amounts of noise':Responsible citizens should know all this. And by the way: creating transparency about cash flows and dependencies involved is still the most effective way to take the wind out of the sails of demagogues and populists. We have seen a few cases of this, both in Germany and abroad - and we should keep this up! As any politician or journalist with a social media account will have realised, and studies repeatedly corroborate this, relatively small groups cause disproportionate amounts of noise.United States Internet laws and regulations will fall to Chinese-style censorship if President Trump does not take action immediately.

It specifically alleges that it forces users to sign up on a 'take it or leave it' basis to Facebook's use and collection of their data. Facebook then uses this broad consent to monitor users' non-Facebook data and merge those details with the users Facebook/Instagram/Whatsapp data for use in its own marketing efforts. </p><p>The mass collection of user data is a well-known strategic goal of big tech, but the real question is: what will the FCO do about it? The FCO Allegations The FCO are alleging an abuse of dominance because Facebook users are forced to sign up to a 'take it or leave it' approach to Facebook's use and collection of their data. This means users can either allow the complete use and control by Facebook of their data, or not have a Facebook account at all. The FCO considers that in this circumstance and because of the dominant position of Facebook, users are not really giving their consent at all. Having received users consent the FCO is also concerned that Facebook is using Application Programming Interfaces (API) to monitor user data on third party websites. Facebook will link external websites through the Facebook interface and users can follow these links to access third party websites. What users don't likely know is their activity on these websites is monitored through the API. The API enables Facebook to collect that data, even though the user thinks they have left Facebook. The use of the API actually means the user completes the action and views the third party content without Facebook losing the ability to record the user's movements and interactions. The current case does not concern the collection and use of data on the Facebook network itself. The Bundeskartellamt leaves explicitly open whether this also constitutes a violation of data protection provisions and the abuse of a dominant position. The FCO states that 'in the authority's assessment, consumers must be given more control over these processes and Facebook needs to provide them with suitable options to effectively limit this collection of data'. The Solution? This goal is laudable and the FCO's assessment of Facebook's conduct seems logical, but the real question is: what measure can they take to stop the behaviour? In other data protection cases, such as for the use of tracking cookies by websites, rather lame solutions have been enacted such as the annoying and ineffective cookie notices that users are plagued by when visiting websites. It's not hard to see how the FCO and Facebook could claim the consent to the API data collection is given if users simply have to click through some data collection notice (which they inevitably will) when viewing third party content. More drastic and concrete solutions do exist such as simply banning the use of API data collection by Facebook, or diluting the value of Facebook's mass data collection by insisting it is accessible for free by competitors. Could Facebook be forced to even offer German users a 'data light' user profile with only limited access to users' data by the company? Solutions such as these would severely impact the business model and share price of Facebook and would likely be met with expensive and protracted litigation for the FCO and lobbying on an EU level by the company. The case will be monitored with interest as the FCO expects a final decision including a possible prohibition or commitments from the company in early summer 2018.

It is among a precious handful of rich countries whose people are more likely to buy a newspaper than follow current affairs on Twitter or Facebook. Scarcely two out of five Germans have a social network account, compared with two out of three people in Australia, Britain and the US. It is not that they don't like the internet: more than 90 per cent of them are online, and they spend just as much time watching videos of skateboarding pugs or browsing for remaindered shoes as their European neighbours. It is more that they are specifically reluctant to hawk out their lives for public consumption. My German friends' Facebook accounts are like a fleet of digital Mary Celestes. There might be a profile picture taken on a holiday in Sri Lanka six years ago and the odd status update wishing the world a happy new year, but that is more or less that.</p><p>The country's broader social networking culture is unusually stunted. A few dozen \"influencers\" - including Adrienne Koleszar, a blonde, gym-honed 34-year-old from Dresden who is feted by the tabloids as \"Germany's most gorgeous policewoman\" - are fortunate enough to scrape a living together from their YouTube or Instagram accounts, but they are very much in the minority.</p><p>The German Twittersphere is a niche habitat dominated by strange benthic fauna such as political geeks, journalists, and right-wing obsessives.</p><p>Peter Mannion, a fictional Tory MP in the British television political satire The Thick of It, has three times as many followers as the real-life German Interior Minister. Angela Merkel does not even have a presence. \"If you look at how frequently Europeans use social networks, out of all 28 EU member states, the Germans are truly bottom of the pile,\" says Sabine Trepte, media psychology professor at Stuttgart's Hohenheim University. \"Only a third of Germans look at Facebook on a daily basis,\" she notes, compared to almost twice as many internet users elsewhere.</p><p>I used to have a small menagerie of pet theories on this subject. One: Germans pride themselves on their lack of small talk, which rules out pretty much 85 per cent of social media interactions. Two: big tech has built a business model the size of the Norwegian economy on Andy Warhol's insight that everyone will be famous for 15 minutes. Most people seem perfectly content to sacrifice their privacy in order to get a bit of attention. But perhaps the Germans are simply not that bothered. Three: maybe they just don't care for being bossed around by evangelical Americans with big ideas.</p><p>Over dinner a couple of months ago, though, a German friend politely dismissed all this fanciful speculation. \"Erm, I don't think so,\" she said. \"It's actually because of the Stasi.\" It was less than three decades ago that half the country was in the grip of a totalitarian surveillance state that maintained an informant for every seven ordinary people. The roots of Germany's itchy anxiety about being watched run deeper than that, though. Before the Stasi, there was the Gestapo. And even before the Gestapo, the Prussians riddled Berlin with a formidable network of secret police in the early 19th century.</p><p>\"Perhaps it is really down to our past,\" Trepte says. \"The German fear of surveillance is deeply anchored in German history and in many families' sense of identity. You have to bear in mind that our mothers and fathers can still recall how they or other families were snooped on and persecuted. It was not all that long ago. First came the Nazis, then the Stasi. At the very least, the Germans are cautious and critical.\" These ancient psychological scars have far-reaching consequences in the 21st century. Germany's privacy laws are among the strictest in the world.</p><p>With Berlin's blessing, the EU's competition commissioner has become the only heavyweight regulator to take on Silicon Valley in earnest, imposing fines running to hundreds of millions of euros on previously untouchable companies such as Facebook, Google and Apple.</p><p>A year ago, Germany's ingrained wariness of social media might have seemed fusty and paranoid.

It has pulled up quite considerably from the opening of force, but PSE giving the closing bell. So, we have got one wimpy one and one okay one, but trading is over. It is Monday, 18th of June.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, two weeks to save her coalition. German stocks down heavily after Angela Merkel gets an ultimatum from her own partners.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Audi's Chief Executive is under arrest. Dieselgate is rumbling on and Beyonce's new album has some shade for Spotify. You can hear it now, ironically, not exclusively on Spotify.</p><p>I am Richard Quest, live from the world's financial capital, New York City where it's mixing hot here, but where I still mean business.</p><p>Good evening, Angela Merkel is facing a moment of reckoning. She is being given two weeks to save her coalition and resolve the immigration debate that threatens to bring down Germany's fragile government.</p><p>The Chancellor has been given an ultimatum -- overhaul Germany's migration policies or face a new rebellion from coalition partners. Facing his own migration debate in the United States, President Trump seized on Mrs. Merkel's position to launch an attack on Twitter. He claims the migration issue has caused the people of Germany to turn against their leader. Investors seem concerned by the political turmoil.</p><p>The Xetra DAX fell one percent on Monday, markets are unlikely to be soothed by the words of the Chancellor's chief antagonist. The CDU's party leader warns the crisis won't be over any time soon.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HORST SEEHOFER, FEDERAL MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR: (Through an interpreter). It is ridiculous to say now to determine public that is all about those two weeks and then after that, it will all be wonderful.</p><p>I repeated it to the Board gathered today. I warn you that we are not out of the woods yet, not at all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Atika Shubert joins me now with the latest from Berlin. Two weeks -- now before we get to what happens in that two weeks, let's first of all analyze the compromise that she has agreed to just to get the breathing space for a proper negotiation.</p><p>ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, basically, you heard there from Horst Seehofer that of course is the Interior Minister. He is also the leader of the Bavaria sister party, the Christian Social Union and he was threatening to essentially break up the coalition government unless he was allowed to unveil the 63-point plan to reduce migration, specifically, he wanted to reject the asylum seekers at the border if they had already applied for asylum in other EU countries, and that is where Merkel drew the line.</p><p>She said, \"Listen, I can't accept that one point in your plan. Give me two weeks to find an alternate solution by brokering bilateral agreements.\" And that is where we stand now. So, she has to try and figure out those deals with other EU nations come back on July 1st, report back to her party and say, \"This is how I have resolved it.\"</p><p>QUEST: Right, but what is the core issue here? I mean, I know it is complex that she has to do it, but the agreement to allow for instance migrants to stay in the country where they have arrived. What is the difference between her and her coalition partner?</p><p>SHUBERT: Well, the difference is essentially that of as you know, in the EU, if you're applying for asylum, you're supposed to apply in the country where you enter. Unfortunately, this means that you get a disproportionate number of asylum seekers in Italy, Greece and those external countries.</p><p>Germany did take in about a million refugees during the 2015 crisis and that as far as Seehofer and Merkel's critics are concerned is too many. So, what they want to do is reduce the number by then saying, \"If you've already applied in Italy, Greece or somewhere else, you can't come here to Germany.\" And then push them back.</p><p>Now, Merkel is saying that's a violation of the EU principle of freedom of movement and that Germany can't do that automatically. It needs to broker some sort of a deal if not with all of the EU, then bilateral agreements with different EU partners. That's the difference there.</p><p>So, she has basically bought herself some time to try and broker those agreements, and maybe stave off any political crisis at home.</p><p>QUEST: Is it likely though that the CSU would promote this to a full blown crisis to the point where it would endanger the coalition and Merkel's position?</p><p>SHUBERT: Well, that's the key question. I mean, the CSU is looking at Bavaria local elections in October, that's probably one reason they have taken this up a notch to such high drama, but the reality is, if they broke up the coalition, then the CDU, the Christian Democrats could field their own candidates in Bavaria and it could end up hurting the CSU in the long run.</p><p>[16:05:12]</p><p>SHUBERT: Also, as much as the general public wants to see tougher immigration laws, they don't want to see another round of elections coming up. So, it could work out that the CSU says, \"Listen, we have proven our point, now we will just back down,\" but we'll know better in about two weeks, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Atika Shubert in Berlin. Elmar Brok is a member of the European Parliament -- Parliament of the House and a close ally of Chancellor Merkel, joins me now from Verl in Germany. Good to see you, sir. Thank you.</p><p>How likely is it how that a solution can be found in the two weeks breathing speace that Chancellor Merkel has been given, bearing in mind, she is going to have to get a green light from the other parties, the other countries in Europe?</p><p>ELMAR BROK, MEMBER, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Look at the party (ph) this morning and there was a very strong support from all the leaders of our party and the thing she was pressing (ph), that was the European solution. And (ph) now that per month, 95 percent less migration in (ph) countries than we had October 2015. The great success story and many other measures were taken, and here is a small question around -- around France about was the close with their regional elections and I believe that that (inaudible) and Mrs. Merkel will talk to the neighboring countries because she says if she does not do that without an agreement with our neighboring countries, we will (ph) -- these measures will have no effect.</p><p>QUEST: All right, is in your view -- I mean, it may not be nice or pleasant to say this, but is the German coalition in danger over this issue?</p><p>BROK: Look, you can never know how far people go, but (inaudible) on that with interest (inaudible) breakdown, nothing would be delivered. And also about (inaudible) success (inaudible) for the elections. The only (inaudible) would be the (inaudible) party and therefore, I believe that if some things were to be pushed forward, but that at the end of the day, government will stable (inaudible) of the Bavaria Party in their own elections.</p><p>QUEST: Elmar Brok, thank you. We will keep it short because we have a poor connection tonight, so we will talk to you hopefully again in the future about this, but thank you for joining us in this evening.</p><p>Now, we say with Germany, there was no shortage of drama in the country today after authorities arrested the Chief Executive of Audi, one of the country's biggest auto makers. Rupert Stadler was taken into custody. Investigators are worried he could influence witnesses related to the emission scandal.</p><p>Shares in Audi's parent company, Volkswagen, which has already paid tens of billions of Euros in fines and fees because of the emission scandal fell sharply on the news. Anna Stewart is in London. What's he been arrested for?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So, this is an investigation, a criminal investigation of Audi and it involves the alleged fraud by some 20 former and current employees and one of those is Rupert Stadler. He is being investigated.</p><p>Now, he was arrested, Richard. He is being detained because of the risk of evidence tampering or influencing other witnesses, other managers from Audi over the scandal, so that is why he is being detained today.</p><p>We knew that his apartment was raided last week and today, the Volkswagen supervisory board were meeting to discuss this amongst other things, so everyone is on tenterhooks wondering whether or not he will be forced to tender his resignation.</p><p>QUEST: Okay, so let's be clear about this, the emissions scandal related to Volkswagen cars, where does the emission scandal fit into the whole Audi question?</p><p>STEWART: Well, Audi as a subsidiary of BW is also part of the emissions diesel scandal. It also had cars that were fitted with cheating devices like Volkswagen, but there is a separate investigation that has also linked Volkswagen and watched those CEOs and managers know.</p><p>What they want to know here, Richard is who knew what when and what did they do about it? Was it transparent? Many shareholders have brought this up in separate lawsuits. I mean, there are numerous lawsuits around this saying there wasn't enough transparency from the Board on how big the liabilities would be.</p><p>As you said, tens of billions of dollars.</p><p>QUEST: All right, so that's already been paid, but the moment somebody gets locked up and I am trying to remember how many of the people have been locked up in this case, and I am not sure there have been any, but the moment somebody gets locked up on allegation of -- or potential allegation of witness tampering, then we're moving into a different area, a much more serious area of criminality in that sense.</p><p>STEWART: Absolutely, I think it would be much harder to really dodge this bullet as a CEO. The Board has been incredibly supportive of Rupert Stadler throughout, his being in the company since 1990, and he has faced many calls for his resignation over the last couple of years.</p><p>[00:05:12]</p><p>STEWART: Particularly, actually from minority shareholders, but the Board has supported him every step of the way, and actually last year, despite what he has caused, they actually extended his contract by five years.</p><p>But as you say, bringing someone under arrest changes the story entirely, so everyone is watching to see what will happen in the next sort of 12 hours.</p><p>QUEST: Anna Stewart, thank you for putting that clearly into perspective for us. Thank you.</p><p>Now, stocks are down almost everywhere you choose to look. In fact, there was -- the Dow opened lower and although it recovered, it really was a fairly sharp fall. Look at the grid and you will see. The Dow was off in its worse point down about 260 to 270 points, so it did come back quite a lot.</p><p>But still close of 133 and failed to hold the 25,000 mark. Similarly, losses -- percentage-wise, much less for the NASDAQ and indeed, the fan stocks for most of the day were actually higher. But, that misery could be seen of what we saw or we had just been talking about, not only with Angela Merkel, but Audi can certainly be seen here with the Xetra DAX which is off 1.3 percent and indeed, over the whole market, if you look at the global markets, you've got the US, you've got Europe, you've got Asia.</p><p>It was the Xetra DAX, which is the one that has the biggest fallout, the political fallout for Angela Merkel. US stocks were also lower, it's the trade wars that were worrying those. Paul La Monica is with us. And Paul, as we look at this graph over here, we can see clearly, we were down about 252 to 260 odd points at the open. I mean, there were several attempts to claw back but the day was still down quite sharply.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, we couldn't get there. We obviously still had a triple digit loss and this is a similar pattern what happened on Friday. It looked as if the market was really going to fall very sharply, things looked very bleak and then we recovered by the end of the day.</p><p>I am getting sense from talking to people that there still is nervousness obviously about a potential trade war with China and just about every other major country in the world -- with them and the US, but no one seems to be panicking yet. I think there is still this notion that the cooler heads may eventually prevail, that this is just tough bluster by President Trump et cetera.</p><p>QUEST: Right, so there was an article in \"The Times\" over the weekend that basically said, in the business section, why the trade war everybody is saying Armageddon is dreadful, it will be awful, but there is no evidence of that in the market.</p><p>And Peter Tuchman at the exchange was saying to me today, look, there is not the evidence of it yet in the market because the economy is strong.</p><p>LA MONICA: The economy is still strong, Richard. Earnings growth for the second quarter is expected to be extremely robust. There's talk about analysts projecting almost 20 percent profit growth year over year. The question is going to be when do companies start talking about the nervousness coming into play for the rest of this year and next year.</p><p>You've got the Atlanta Fed, President Raphael Bostic making a speech today where he talked about how earlier this year, he was incredibly optimistic because of the tax cuts, and now he is getting a sense that he is a little bit more worried about the environment going forward because people are telling him that yes, all of these trade bluster could have an impact on their profits going forward.</p><p>People are going to be a little bit more skittish. They may not buy as much as stuff, both corporations and consumers and I think that's a legitimate concern going forward.</p><p>QUEST: It's interesting when we look at it. It's good to see -- didn't you say, as we look at the market, it has tried to rally, and it did to a certain extent, but could not do it.</p><p>LA MONICA: At least not for the Dow, but the NASDAQ did finish positive. You've got people still loving those companies like Facebook and Google and Netflix, Amazon. They seem to be resistant to all of these macro concerns.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: When we return, President Trump is looking beyond his borders with dominance and out into the universe -- we will look for his plans for a Space Force, what that actually means, and Jay-Z and Beyonce remind the world they have their own streaming service and then promptly, we get all the results upon arrival. Go figure.</p><p>[16:15:00]</p><p>QUEST: Now, I do need to just correct one or two minor matters. We showed you all the market numbers earlier, and I am afraid, I think that the machine must have frozen. The top line, the US market shows the Dow, we had it down 113 points, it's not 103 at the close, but the important thing which Paul La Monica quite rightly points out, the NASDAQ actually did eke out a small gain for the session.</p><p>So, just to correct. In case you were a little bit concerned that it didn't look like we've got it exactly right. We didn't get it right, but we have got it right now.</p><p>Google is betting a half a million dollars on China and that's despite Google being blocked mostly by Beijing. Clare Sebastian is here. Who are they buying and how much?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: They are buying just under 1 percent of jd.com for $550 million in cash, Richard, so obviously, this is a big foray into China for Google. They have basically not been operating in terms of their search maps, e-mails, YouTube entirely since 2010, but clearly, they haven't given up on the country.</p><p>We have seen little moves in this direction. They have got two apps in the country. They have got translation and they have got file management. They have visiting since -- which I was there back in November. They have opened an AI center there, so I think this is more of the same (inaudible)...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: Remind us why they are not there as Google.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right, because of the Chinese's government's laws on censorship. They basically couldn't comply ethically with the rules there and they left in 2010.</p><p>QUEST: And they pulled out.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: They pulled out despite the fact that there are 730 million Internet users in China, Richard, more than twice the US's entire population, they still pulled out. But this is something they kind of ignored -- the size and scale of this market. But it is important for jd.com as well.</p><p>QUEST: Why?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Because jd.com just like Alibaba, you've seen them you know, doing road shows in the US and beyond. They want to expand outside of China, that's really important for them because the market there, even though it is huge isn't growing at the same rate as it was. So, there is room for growth. It seems to be international, South East Asia, Europe, the US -- all of these areas jd.com will be able to access through the steel. Its products will be on Google Shopping and there are more what they call retail solutions on the guard...</p><p>QUEST: But what does jd.com do in the EU? We think of jd.com like Alibaba, as just being China's version of Amazon?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Actually, jd.com is even more China's version of Amazon and Alibaba is because it has the logistics network. I've got a video I think of one of their fully automated warehouses. They do what Amazon does. They have their own logistics there. They do two-hour delivery in 50-plus cities around China.</p><p>So, they really do the kind of -- the supply chain that is crucial to e- commerce, and I think that's what Google is so interested in here. They haven't cracked the e-commerce yet.</p><p>QUEST: Thanks. Good. Thank you. Clare Sebastian. Big tech firms like Google aren't the only ones working in this more complex environment. John Stankey, the new head of our parent company, WarnerMedia tells \"New Day\" that everything in the entire economy is more difficult now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN STANKEY, CEO, WARNERMEDIA: I think everything in the industry right now is probably more complex and more difficult than it has ever been, and I think if you were sitting over at Facebook today and asking about what it's like to run their business, the transparency dynamic that any company has to run under and the volatility that it brings in the decision making, that's just part of industry today and I don't think it's unique to our circumstances. I think it's just broad scale across the economy right now.</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN HOST: So, for all of our viewers who are watching, they want to know what this means for them, are there costs going up? What else -- how will this affect them?</p><p>STANKEY: Contrary to what the government alleged, no. Our goal here is actually to innovate on product and you know, for me, personally, why I am excited to be here, I have always been happiest in my career when I get to build things and do unique things and do things that are different.</p><p>And our goal here is to invest in this business and our goal is to do it in a way that provides for platforms and capabilities that are consistent with where technology is taking things. And you know, a classic example might be here at CNN.</p><p>[16:20:11]</p><p>STANKEY: How can we broaden the distribution of the great content you guys build every day? How can we make it more readily available and the push lifestyle that everybody leads and I think there are some very exciting things to do in that regard.</p><p>So, it's about innovating, it's about building new product, it's about investing heavier in content. It's certainly not about going out and just trying to think about we want to raise prices on content for what other people buy.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I think that's interesting because there have been some concerns in the cable industry that we are in a period of decline or shrinkage as opposed to growth and investment? And you're saying in places like HBO, there is more money that should be spent?</p><p>STANKEY: Look, I think that the model as we know it today, you know, standard linear television is a very immature model. Standard linear television in the form how ads are supported in it.</p><p>But there is an opportunity to innovate in that regard, not only with how the content is configured, but to think about how advertising supports that content, and that's why we established the advertising entity with an AT&amp;T that is being led by Brian Lesser.</p><p>The purpose of that is to start building the new ad formats and the more targeted advertising. They can lower ad loads and still monetize content the way where it remains affordable for the customer.</p><p>So, that's the kind of innovation we are going to be working on.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Thank you. The CEO of Warner Media, my boss. President Trump has ordered the creation of a Space Force, calling it the sixth branch of the Armed Forces. Now, the appropriate name, Barbara Starr, joins me from the Pentagon.</p><p>All right, a Space Force will do what?</p><p>BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: I haven't actually thought about that, Richard, until you mentioned it. Well, you know, I thought I would try not to make the \"Star Wars,\" \"Star Trek,\" \"Battlestar Galactica\" jokes, but let me have a go at it.</p><p>I mean, you know, this is not a brand new idea. It's something the Pentagon has long been involved in and trying to make sure that its satellites in space, the things that it relies in for war fighting are safe and secure from adversaries, and that the US can dominate in space.</p><p>So, we already know that some parts of the military pay an awful lot of attention to this, especially the US Air Force.</p><p>The President has for some time now talked about he wants a separate Space Force. Not getting total support from the Pentagon about all of that because there is a lot of worry, it's just going to wind up being more bureaucracy, but here is a bit of today when the President announced this, a bit of his vision from the White House.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This time, we will do more than plant our flag and leave our footprints, we will establish a long term presence, expand our economy and build the foundation for the eventual mission to Mars, which is actually going to happen very quickly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STARR: Well, going to Mars quickly, we will see, as with all things in the United States government. It is going to depend on Congress' funding all of these ideas that the President has, but let's look at a very practical task ahead. One of the biggest things in space for the US military for example is to make sure its GPS satellites -- global positioning satellites -- are always safe and secure because if you have an adversary trying to take those out somehow with some sort of attack, that would not just devastate US war fighting capabilities around the world, it would devastate communications around the world.</p><p>So, it gives you an idea of how much it is a problem, how much it is an issue, but is the President's solution the one that Pentagon wants, not exactly clear just yet that it is, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Okay, so Barbara, with all of this, I guess, you know for a President that loves hype, obviously this has been in the works for some time, what is that gap between hype and reality to fruition and execution?</p><p>STARR: Well, for people, for top commanders in the US military, their question starts with if there is something out there that we are not doing to defend and protect Americans in that space environment, is there something more we should be doing?</p><p>A lot of money, time and attention is being paid to the very question -- advanced defensive capabilities, defensive information attacks all of that, the key question I think, Richard, Congress wants to see something happen, but there may be a very limited appetite for an entire new branch of the US military.</p><p>QUEST: Our own shining star bright and comets skating and great to tell us the story, Barbara, good to see you as always, thank you.</p><p>STARR: Thanks.</p><p>QUEST: Barbara Starr at the Pentagon. Now, from space to slightly at lower altitude, but we all get to fly anyway where Lufthansa, now, we know Norwegian has received already two bids and rejected them from IAG -- the owners of BA et cetera.</p><p>[16:25:16]</p><p>QUEST: Lufthansa is reporting they have now been in contact with Norwegian Air Shuttle as well. So, you have Lufthansa and British Airways and IAG interested in buying Europe's third biggest aircraft low cost group. Both have budget players in play.</p><p>I wanted to look at the destination board and we are going to show you exactly why this is so fascinating because if you look for example at what Lufthansa already owns at the moment, you will see the complexity.</p><p>Now, you've obviously got in the Lufthansa group, Lufthansa the German, Swiss the Swiss Airline, you've got CityLine which is the regional; Edelweiss, the low cost; German Wings and Euro Wings and your Austrian -- they are the main components that Lufthansa already owns within it.</p><p>It's already got as well minority stakes in the Aerologic and Sun Express, so Lufthansa on the one side. Now, you've got AIG and if you look at the airlines AIG has, you'll see exactly how significant that is going to be.</p><p>BA, Iberia and Aer Lingus, Vueling and Level, they are the majorities already that they have got. They are the big carriers that they have got. The minority stakes that -- this is the key one, the key one here, there. Already got 4 percent of Norwegian, nearly 5 percent.</p><p>So, on the both hands, you have Lufthansa and you have IAG, two of the largest groups in the world now both seemingly doing battle trying to get Norwegian. I can tell you from within the industry, the view is Lufthansa may just have the upper hand in all of this if Carsten Spohr decides to go for the full bid, may indeed.</p><p>But Willie Walsh is not going to give up easily, neither Chief Execs, neither Spohr, nor Walsh is prepared to overbid for an airline that they see is already in trouble.</p><p>We will have more after the break.</p><p>Hello, I am Richard Quest, there is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. When Beyonce and Jay-Z set up for a big weekend on their streaming service and how title's rivals are catching up and arguably, the two of them shot themselves in their own fight for bid.</p><p>And the World Health Organization now shows that video game addiction is real. I will speak to the founder of a rehab center for gamers. As we continue, you are watching CNN and here, the facts always come first.</p><p>President Trump is again falsely shaming his political opponents, the Democrats for his own policy on immigration which resulted in family separation at the borders. In remarks earlier today, President Trump said the US would not become a migrant camp for refugee holding facility.</p><p>[16:30:16] Meanwhile, the new CNN poll shows most Republicans approve of the policies which meant more parents and children being separated at the border. Overall, two-thirds of Americans disapprove, the president's approval rating is now at 39 percent.</p><p>Chancellor Merkel of Germany has been given two weeks to reach an agreement with the EU on a new immigration policy that both members of our coalition government can support. The CSU Party, her partners wants a deal to ban migrants who have already applied for asylum elsewhere from entering Germany.</p><p>CSU says if there's no deal, it will unilaterally move forward with the plan. In Britain, the Prime Minister Theresa May has suffered a fresh defeat of her Brexit plans. The House of Lords voted to give parliament the final say on what happens in the event her government fails to reach an exit deal with the EU.</p><p>The legislation is to be debated in the House of Commons on Wednesday. Croatia's Nikola Kalinic has been sent home from the World Cup after he refused to come on as a substitute. The striker said he couldn't play against Nigeria because of a back problem.</p><p>His coach pointed out he also refused to play during a friendly with Brazil earlier this month. A thriller outside of Saint Petersburg where a short while ago England defeated Tunisia, it's the end of day five in the 2018 World Cup. After some early missed chances, England's Captain Harry Kane gave his team an early 1-0 lead, Tunisia leveled it with a penalty, and that was just before the end of the first half.</p><p>Then as time was draining away, it was Harry Kane again with a dramatic header -- yes, and to give England the 2-1 victory. Amanda Davies is in Moscow -- it's a haunting of a match.</p><p>AMANDA DAVIES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Richard, it was, but it's dangerous times because England have won their opening match of this World Cup, and everybody in England has been doing so well in terms of playing down expectations for this very young, relatively untested England side.</p><p>Now, they've won, you do worry what happens next. It wasn't the most convincing performance, it has to be said, but there was some very exciting moments within the side against a Tunisian team that -- or in their first World Cup since 2006 and we knew it would sit very deep, defend very deep in numbers.</p><p>So it was always going to be tough with this England side. The moment that you do get excited about is the fact, so in days gone by, a warm one, England's generally would have settled for that or even worst perhaps conceded a late goal.</p><p>But these guys kept on pushing, kept going and Harry Kane led by example as the captain as you said to score the winner in the 91st minute, and you saw --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>DAVIES: Just what it meant to him and his manager Gary Southgate, a massive results early doors.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, hang on Amanda, it's better to win than lose.</p><p>DAVIES: Absolutely Richard, but you know, I have been through some downs and downs. A little, a few ups. But more downs as an England --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>DAVIES: Supporter over the years, and so you know, I am wearing my red dress, I wore my shirt this morning for breakfast, so we've got to be realistic about it. As this is, you know, one of the rare groups, after this point in the competition has actually gone to plan with the big teams --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>DAVIES: Drawing their opening games, Belgium also won earlier today. So compared to what we've seen with Brazil, with Argentina, with Germany losing yesterday, we know that you can't take anything for granted at all in a World Cup.</p><p>QUEST: And the beauty of all of this is that the atmosphere is starting to build. Whether it'd be the Germany match or even the first match from Russia and Saudi Arabia right the way through to this match, the atmosphere is building up as it's supposed to.</p><p>DAVIES: Yes, it truly is a World Cup. We're just at the bottom of Red Square as we've said to you before, and there's a lot of Mexican fans, there's been some Colombian fans here today. And remember four years ago, Richard, you had your flag pole of flags really and you were texting me as to which flag needed to come out on which day.</p><p>And today, that was really tested, I had a fantastic moment by Saint Basil's which has been open for the first time after they've taken down all the stadium from the concert last week.</p><p>[16:35:00] And there were three fans, there was a Mexican and Argentinean and a Spaniard having a photo taken.</p><p>And then they saw a Colombian and said, come on over, and then there was a Peruvian who joined the party and then there was some Moroccan fans who joined the party and a German and a Swedish fan, and it was really a fantastic moment in front of Saint Basil's, seeing everybody in their shirt with their flags and it is what you would hope a World Cup would turn out to be.</p><p>QUEST: And be assured, Miss Davies, that your vexillology knowledge will be required before we are finished, because the flags return, the flags return when the economic World Cup returns once we get into the knockout rounds which comes later.</p><p>So you may not rest easy, you'll be up all night studying flags, good to see you.</p><p>DAVIES: I will, bye-bye.</p><p>QUEST: Sorted that out. Beyonce and Jay-Z say they don't care about the music industry's obsession with streaming numbers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Plenty stuff, there it is, streaming service and the streaming business, we're going to see -- discuss what it says about the future of Tidal streaming service. That they bring out a new album, maybe it's exclusive to them and then give it to everybody else -- after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Beyonce and Jay z dropped the surprise album over the weekend, it wasn't expected. It managed to get the whole world talking about their streaming service Tidal once again.</p><p>Fans were sent rushing to the app because it was only app -- it was the only way to hear the album at first. Now Beyonce and Jay z have given it to the mega streaming rival Spotify, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>And speaking of Spotify, Beyonce has some choice words about the music business and its obsession with streaming numbers. Listen carefully.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Savory stuff, Larry Miller is here thankfully. Help us to understand it, director of music business at the NYU Steinhardt School. We'll get on to the obsession with streaming numbers in a moment.</p><p>But being weird to surprisingly release your own material on your own streaming service that you've got an interest in and then given away to the competition the next day.</p><p>LARRY MILLER, DIRECTOR OF MUSIC BUSINESS, NYU STEINHARDT SCHOOL: Well, true enough. And if we go back to not so long ago when \"Lemonade\" dropped, of course that dropped on an \"Hbo\" special, but it was also exclusively available on Tidal for a short period of time.</p><p>[16:40:00] QUEST: It was exclusive for a day.</p><p>MILLER: Yes, right, that's very short.</p><p>QUEST: That's very short.</p><p>MILLER: That's very short indeed. But I think that streaming has evolved and the music industry has evolved and Spotify have about $180 million subscribers and Apple have another $40 million or so, and Amazon have many and there are other places people go to stream music.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but if you are Beyonce and Jay z, you're not worried about the money necessarily.</p><p>MILLER: Right.</p><p>QUEST: And if you are committed to your Tidal streaming service, you're prepared to take the punishment that will come by insisting it's only there. So why give it away?</p><p>MILLER: Well, it's important to be where the eyeballs are and air balls are. And any artist wants to be able to gather attention around their latest music --</p><p>QUEST: But you can't have both, Larry, you can't -- I mean, what I'm trying to say is it suggests a lack of commitment to Tidal that they would have done it so quickly --</p><p>MILLER: Well --</p><p>QUEST: Not even seven days.</p><p>MILLER: Right, not even seven days. And so in today's tension economy, who knows what we'll be thinking about a week from now. And so right now, while attention is riveted on Beyonce and Jay z and that amazing video they chose to make some music available a day later.</p><p>QUEST: The louver, they got access to the louver --</p><p>MILLER: Amazing --</p><p>QUEST: For this video which is extraordinary, which is gratifying in a sense to see the amount of money and the amount of effort and care on production values that are put into these, some things, even though sort of extreme things as you say, here today, gone tomorrow.</p><p>MILLER: Fair enough, and so it's incumbent upon artists and the people who they work with today to be able to drive attention by releasing music and video and other things in other to maintain attention for as long as possible.</p><p>QUEST: OK, so as to Beyonce's somewhat vulgar references to streaming and let me -- and then Spotify, you're right, it's a numbers game. I mean, I'm glad you're -- we've got -- the music business expert here, it's a numbers game and Spotify has got the numbers, 175 million.</p><p>MILLER: It is.</p><p>QUEST: Right, as anybody else, I mean, if you want to be heard, you've got to go there.</p><p>MILLER: Yes, you need to be aware that people are and let's not forget, they are in the middle of what I believe is a gigantic sold-out stadium --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>MILLER: For -- they just finished playing in the big football stadium in London --</p><p>QUEST: They did, Wembley. Quick final question, can we say that Spotify is now too big to fail?</p><p>MILLER: I think it's hard to say in this day and age whether anything really is too big to fail, but they are the leader in a growing and super important segment of the music business that now accounts for two-thirds of the revenue in the country.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you sir, thank you.</p><p>MILLER: Thank you for having me.</p><p>QUEST: As we continue tonight, you want to stay on top of the day's business news and headlines in just 90 seconds and try our daily briefing podcast, it's updated twice a day before and after the bell rings on Wall Street, (INAUDIBLE) or Google for CNN flash briefing, just try it, see what you get, and if it doesn't work, e-mail me.</p><p>When we return, Britain's Brexit blues are starting a report, claims the U.K. is about to see its lowest growth if the financial crisis and things aren't going to get much better any time soon.</p><p>[16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: So in the pubs of London where it is still time to get the last order of drinks, and I suspect the England victory is dominating, but once the thrilling World Cup win sort of dissipates, the U.K. will come back to earth.</p><p>The British Chamber of Commerce is now predicting it will be the weakest year of growth for the U.K. economy in almost a decade. Adam Marshall is the Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, good to see you, Adam, thank you for taking time tonight.</p><p>I hope you saw the final results, you saw the game before popping into Australia's to join us. But it is sobering, your numbers, I mean, it doesn't show complete collapse of destitution, but it does show sub-par growth for the foreseeable future.</p><p>ADAM MARSHALL, DIRECTOR GENERAL, BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE: I think that's right, Richard, we are looking at about 1.3 percent growth this year, 1.4 next year and 1.6 in 2020. Those are not the sorts of numbers that really blow the doors off when it comes to a major advanced economy.</p><p>And I think what we'd like to see is two things, one obviously, firms want to see clarity on Brexit as that debate rumbles on terminally. And I think in the U.K., there's also a sense that we have other things to get on with as well to make conditions great for business.</p><p>And there's quite --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>MARSHALL: A lot that the government needs to do here at home as well.</p><p>QUEST: Is there -- is this lone number, is it predicated on the uncertainty on what happens or is there a general view now within the BCC and you're an economist, that whatever happens immediately after Brexit, growth will be lower, even in best case scenario, the U.K. will not be as well off as it was within the EU.</p><p>MARSHALL: Well, the U.K. will certainly see slower growth that it might have done had the country not gone down this route at least in the very short term, that is what we are forecasting. But I think there are some other factors that work here as well.</p><p>Obviously, some of the global trade skirmishes that we've been seeing in recent weeks, unsettled businesses here in the U.K. about their future prospects. So anything that happens between the U.S. and China for example, they may sneeze but the U.K. may very well catch cold as well.</p><p>Same thing about input prices and oil prices --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>MARSHALL: Which have been going up for a lot of U.K. companies too.</p><p>QUEST: And on this question of future growth, obviously, you would have preferred -- I mean, I know the BCC, it would have preferred a single market access. But if you can't get single market access, what is your preferred option for Customs Union and the way forward especially now we seem to be at that essential moment when the negotiation has to decide which way to go.</p><p>MARSHALL: Well, our firms are not much interested in the chronology(ph) about this. They see a lot of labels around Customs Union and single market. And what they say to us is they want answers on practical questions. Who do I pay tax to? Who can I hire? How long can they stay in my business?</p><p>Who is my regulator going to be? And those sorts of practical questions are what really are driving a lot of business considerations around this. You could call the rapport(ph), whatever you want to, but businesses want clarity on their trading conditions and they need to see that with some urgency over the next few months.</p><p>QUEST: OK, so we've had the white paper recently from the -- well, we had the agreement back in March, we've had a white paper, we've got the current disarray one might arguably say in parliament. You just saw today obviously, that the lords says -- once again voted that it should take primacy if there's no deal.</p><p>Something that the Commons is going to have to look back at. I mean, yes, I guess I'm taking you into the chronology of the Brexit process and what you're telling me is it's not very helpful.</p><p>MARSHALL: It's not, in fact, a lot of firms around the country who say look, they're watching and waiting, but what they need is something concrete upon which they can act --</p><p>QUEST: They're not going to get it I think --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>I've got news for you, that's exactly -- I mean, and that's the dirty secret here isn't it? They're not going to get it and even once the agreement is signed, there's still going to be a level of uncertainty that will be damaging to your members. Can you accept that?</p><p>MARSHALL: No, I think businesses know that there's going to be uncertainty for some time to come, a very few pundits have said to us, well, once you negotiate with the European Union, you negotiate with the European Union forever.</p><p>It's very likely to be the case that those negotiations will be ongoing for a long time. But businesses do need a degree of certainty here, Richard, they do need something to work off of, and I think their biggest dismay, their biggest opprobrium is actually for the U.K. politicians, they can't agree on a route forward to go into that negotiating room.</p><p>[16:50:00] Because what we know in business is you go into a negotiation with a clear position and that's what we need our government to do.</p><p>QUEST: Right, let's just talk about these, the strength at the moment of the U.K. economy. All right, unemployment is down and there could be a labor shortage, but wage inflation is starting to pick up again. Now, the Bank of England would like to start raising rates because inflation has started to move up, but it can't because of their -- I mean, all roads lead back to Brexit because of the uncertainty.</p><p>But the economy itself is fundamentally robust.</p><p>MARSHALL: Yes, there's some strength in the economy, it's been threading water though as the way we like to put it. It's not sinking, but it is threading water. We're not seeing the kind of growth we'd want to see.</p><p>These are the interest rates we're forecasting one rise over the coming months and perhaps one more in the period until 2020. But even the window for those minimal source of rise to 75 or a 100 basis points is starting to close. Because as you rightly say, uncertainty is going to mean the bank is going to want to keep conditions as smooth as possible for business.</p><p>So we don't see a very strong case for significant rate rises in the near future.</p><p>QUEST: You'll forgive me if I don't say I'm sorry to hear that, I mean, got a U.K. mortgage, I'm rather glad that it might be a little bit longer to enjoy the good times, good to see you sir, thank you.</p><p>MARSHALL: And you, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: We'll talk more about this in detail as the process goes on, good to have you. The games industry is taking in $100 billion, that's right, $100 billion a year. The World Health Organization is now warning it could be triggering(ph) a new public health concern.</p><p>It's called gaming disorder and it's just been listed as a mental health condition. It describes compulsive players who just plays from similar to those of gambling addicts. The WHO says it applies to behavior lasting 12 months or more.</p><p>Joining me now is the co-founder of a rehab center for internet and video gaming addiction is Hilarie Cash, she joins me from reSTART which is live from Seattle in Washington. Were you surprised that it's taken so long to get the WHO to recognize gaming as a gaming disorder.</p><p>HILARIE CASH, CO-FOUNDER, RESTART: Not really, I -- you know, this whole phenomenon has taken the world by storm and actually moving very quickly. And research, you know, they're going to make their decisions based on the research findings. And research is by its nature rather slow.</p><p>So I think it's not -- but I think I'm just glad it's finally here.</p><p>QUEST: What are the symptoms of gaming disorder? How does somebody recognize when they've got it?</p><p>CASH: I think the best way to think about it is that when you are out of control and you are gaming in spite of its negative consequences, you've got a problem.</p><p>QUEST: And the treatment for it, how far does it accord to the other traditional addictions? Obviously, drugs, alcohol, gambling, overspending, all the others. Does it follow the same model for treatment, whether it'd be the 12-step model or otherwise?</p><p>CASH: Well, I can tell you that our model of treatment is to be very holistic in what we're trying to do. So we are -- the adults as well as the adolescents tries spending at least two months free of all screens, and the idea is that they need that time to -- for their brains to come back to normal functioning, they need that time to get their health back, they usually are chronically sleep deprived, unfit and they've been eating very poorly for a long time.</p><p>So they're getting their health back, they're developing skills that they really are going to need if they're going to be functional young adults. And they're getting a plan together for how they're going to abuse digital technology again in a sustainable and healthy way.</p><p>After that two months period, there's been if they choose and about 80 percent of them do choose, you go on to the second phase of the program, that's the phase where they're now for the adults living in apartments together in --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>CASH: In small groups, they're getting part-time work and they're just starting to live life like adults need to live life --</p><p>QUEST: OK, so final question, with the other addictions, alcohol, drugs and the like, the general view is total abstinence. What is too many, a thousand, never enough. With gaming addiction or gaming disorder, do you believe that you can't do it at all or do you believe there's a manageable way you can do it.</p><p>CASH: Well, I think there's a manageable way you can use a digital technology.</p><p>[16:55:00] I think if you're gaming addict, you're really getting on thin ice if you try to go back to gaming and chances are very high that you will relapse. So we ask the guys when they come into program and are developing what we call the life balance friend --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>CASH: To think through -- what are their bottom lines and those bottom lines almost always are going to include video games.</p><p>QUEST: Good to talk to you, thank you, I appreciate your time tonight, thank you. We will have a different profitable moment after the break, this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS live from New York.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment, it is lovely in an era where we are talking about the misery and mayhem that we're able to turn our attention to something much more pleasant. Weddings within the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS team who makes no apology for showing you the very best that we have got.</p><p>Our senior producer John and his new bride Ali(ph), yes, that's the two at the front, and the rest are the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS team that all sort of -- I think the director summed it up rather well. I think -- well, she says you all scrubbed up rather nicely over the weekend.</p><p>And our technical director Rick Flair(ph) and his new wife Emily, yes, they also scrubbed up rather nicely on the way to and from their ceremony. So we take this opportunity because it's only right and proper that we remember this program that we bring to you every night with love and privilege is made by people behind the cameras and they actually put it together.</p><p>And today, four of them have enjoyed weddings. And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable. Congratulations to all my colleagues.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018061801cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SKN-6R51-JB20-G0P6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7990\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 18, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It has pulled up quite considerably from the  opening of force, but PSE giving the closing bell.  So, we have got one  wimpy one and one okay one, but trading is over.  It is Monday, 18th of  June.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tonight, two weeks to save her coalition.  German stocks down heavily after  Angela Merkel gets an ultimatum from her own partners.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Audi's Chief Executive is under arrest.  Dieselgate is rumbling on and  Beyonce's new album has some shade for Spotify.  You can hear it now,  ironically, not exclusively on Spotify.  </p><p> I am Richard Quest, live from the world's financial capital, New York City  where it's mixing hot here, but where I still mean business.  </p><p> Good evening, Angela Merkel is facing a moment of reckoning.  She is being  given two weeks to save her coalition and resolve the immigration debate  that threatens to bring down Germany's fragile government.  </p><p> The Chancellor has been given an ultimatum -- overhaul Germany's migration  policies or face a new rebellion from coalition partners.  Facing his own  migration debate in the United States, President Trump seized on Mrs.  Merkel's position to launch an attack on Twitter.  He claims the migration  issue has caused the people of Germany to turn against their leader.   Investors seem concerned by the political turmoil.  </p><p> The Xetra DAX fell one percent on Monday, markets are unlikely to be  soothed by the words of the Chancellor's chief antagonist.  The CDU's party  leader warns the crisis won't be over any time soon.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> HORST SEEHOFER, FEDERAL MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR:  (Through an  interpreter).  It is ridiculous to say now to determine public that is all  about those two weeks and then after that, it will all be wonderful.  </p><p> I repeated it to the Board gathered today.  I warn you that we are not out  of the woods yet, not at all.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Atika Shubert joins me now with the latest from Berlin.  Two weeks  -- now before we get to what happens in that two weeks, let's first of all  analyze the compromise that she has agreed to just to get the breathing  space for a proper negotiation.  </p><p> ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, well,  basically, you heard there from Horst Seehofer that of course is the  Interior Minister.  He is also the leader of the Bavaria sister party, the  Christian Social Union and he was threatening to essentially break up the  coalition government unless he was allowed to unveil the 63-point plan to  reduce migration, specifically, he wanted to reject the asylum seekers at  the border if they had already applied for asylum in other EU countries,  and that is where Merkel drew the line.  </p><p> She said, \"Listen, I can't accept that one point in your plan.  Give me two  weeks to find an alternate solution by brokering bilateral agreements.\"   And that is where we stand now.  So, she has to try and figure out those  deals with other EU nations come back on July 1st, report back to her party  and say, \"This is how I have resolved it.\"  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, but what is the core issue here?  I mean, I know it is  complex that she has to do it, but the agreement to allow for instance  migrants to stay in the country where they have arrived.  What is the  difference between her and her coalition partner?  </p><p> SHUBERT:  Well, the difference is essentially that of as you know, in the  EU, if you're applying for asylum, you're supposed to apply in the country  where you enter.  Unfortunately, this means that you get a disproportionate  number of asylum seekers in Italy, Greece and those external countries.  </p><p> Germany did take in about a million refugees during the 2015 crisis and  that as far as Seehofer and Merkel's critics are concerned is too many.   So, what they want to do is reduce the number by then saying, \"If you've  already applied in Italy, Greece or somewhere else, you can't come here to  Germany.\"  And then push them back.  </p><p> Now, Merkel is saying that's a violation of the EU principle of freedom of  movement and that Germany can't do that automatically.  It needs to broker  some sort of a deal if not with all of the EU, then bilateral agreements  with different EU partners.  That's the difference there.  </p><p> So, she has basically bought herself some time to try and broker those  agreements, and maybe stave off any political crisis at home.  </p><p> QUEST:  Is it likely though that the CSU would promote this to a full blown  crisis to the point where it would endanger the coalition and Merkel's  position?  </p><p> SHUBERT:  Well, that's the key question.  I mean, the CSU is looking at  Bavaria local elections in October, that's probably one reason they have  taken this up a notch to such high drama, but the reality is, if they broke  up the coalition, then the CDU, the Christian Democrats could field their  own candidates in Bavaria and it could end up hurting the CSU in the long  run.  </p><p> [16:05:12]  </p><p> SHUBERT:  Also, as much as the general public wants to see tougher  immigration laws, they don't want to see another round of elections coming  up.  So, it could work out that the CSU says, \"Listen, we have proven our  point, now we will just back down,\" but we'll know better in about two  weeks, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  Atika Shubert in Berlin.  Elmar Brok is a member of the European  Parliament -- Parliament of the House and a close ally of Chancellor  Merkel, joins me now from Verl in Germany.  Good to see you, sir.  Thank  you.  </p><p> How likely is it how that a solution can be found in the two weeks  breathing speace that Chancellor Merkel has been given, bearing in mind,  she is going to have to get a green light from the other parties, the other  countries in Europe?  </p><p> ELMAR BROK, MEMBER, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:  Look at the party (ph) this  morning and there was a very strong support from all the leaders of our  party and the thing she was pressing (ph), that was the European solution.   And (ph) now that per month, 95 percent less migration in (ph) countries  than we had October 2015.  The great success story and many other measures  were taken, and here is a small question around -- around France about was  the close with their regional elections and I believe that that (inaudible)  and Mrs. Merkel will talk to the neighboring countries because she says if  she does not do that without an agreement with our neighboring countries,  we will (ph) -- these measures will have no effect.  </p><p> QUEST:  All right, is in your view -- I mean, it may not be nice or  pleasant to say this, but is the German coalition in danger over this  issue?  </p><p> BROK:  Look, you can never know how far people go, but (inaudible) on that  with interest (inaudible) breakdown, nothing would be delivered.  And also  about (inaudible) success (inaudible) for the elections.  The only  (inaudible) would be the (inaudible) party and therefore, I believe that if  some things were to be pushed forward, but that at the end of the day,  government will stable (inaudible) of the Bavaria Party in their own  elections.  </p><p> QUEST:  Elmar Brok, thank you.  We will keep it short because we have a  poor connection tonight, so we will talk to you hopefully again in the  future about this, but thank you for joining us in this evening.  </p><p> Now, we say with Germany, there was no shortage of drama in the country  today after authorities arrested the Chief Executive of Audi, one of the  country's biggest auto makers.  Rupert Stadler was taken into custody.   Investigators are worried he could influence witnesses related to the  emission scandal.  </p><p> Shares in Audi's parent company, Volkswagen, which has already paid tens of  billions of Euros in fines and fees because of the emission scandal fell  sharply on the news.  Anna Stewart is in London.  What's he been arrested  for?  </p><p> ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  So, this is an investigation, a criminal  investigation of Audi and it involves the alleged fraud by some 20 former  and current employees and one of those is Rupert Stadler.  He is being  investigated.  </p><p> Now, he was arrested, Richard.  He is being detained because of the risk of  evidence tampering or influencing other witnesses, other managers from Audi  over the scandal, so that is why he is being detained today.  </p><p> We knew that his apartment was raided last week and today, the Volkswagen  supervisory board were meeting to discuss this amongst other things, so  everyone is on tenterhooks wondering whether or not he will be forced to  tender his resignation.  </p><p> QUEST:  Okay, so let's be clear about this, the emissions scandal related  to Volkswagen cars, where does the emission scandal fit into the whole Audi  question?  </p><p> STEWART:  Well, Audi as a subsidiary of BW is also part of the emissions  diesel scandal.  It also had cars that were fitted with cheating devices  like Volkswagen, but there is a separate investigation that has also linked  Volkswagen and watched those CEOs and managers know.  </p><p> What they want to know here, Richard is who knew what when and what did  they do about it?  Was it transparent?  Many shareholders have brought this  up in separate lawsuits.  I mean, there are numerous lawsuits around this  saying there wasn't enough transparency from the Board on how big the  liabilities would be.  </p><p> As you said, tens of billions of dollars.  </p><p> QUEST:  All right, so that's already been paid, but the moment somebody  gets locked up and I am trying to remember how many of the people have been  locked up in this case, and I am not sure there have been any, but the  moment somebody gets locked up on allegation of -- or potential allegation  of witness tampering, then we're moving into a different area, a much more  serious area of criminality in that sense.  </p><p> STEWART:  Absolutely, I think it would be much harder to really dodge this  bullet as a CEO.  The Board has been incredibly supportive of Rupert  Stadler throughout, his being in the company since 1990, and he has faced  many calls for his resignation over the last couple of years.  </p><p> [00:05:12]  </p><p> STEWART:  Particularly, actually from minority shareholders, but the Board  has supported him every step of the way, and actually last year, despite  what he has caused, they actually extended his contract by five years.  </p><p> But as you say, bringing someone under arrest changes the story entirely,  so everyone is watching to see what will happen in the next sort of 12  hours.  </p><p> QUEST:  Anna Stewart, thank you for putting that clearly into perspective  for us.  Thank you.  </p><p> Now, stocks are down almost everywhere you choose to look.  In fact, there  was -- the Dow opened lower and although it recovered, it really was a  fairly sharp fall.  Look at the grid and you will see.  The Dow was off in  its worse point down about 260 to 270 points, so it did come back quite a  lot.  </p><p> But still close of 133 and failed to hold the 25,000 mark.  Similarly,  losses -- percentage-wise, much less for the NASDAQ and indeed, the fan  stocks for most of the day were actually higher.  But, that misery could be  seen of what we saw or we had just been talking about, not only with Angela  Merkel, but Audi can certainly be seen here with the Xetra DAX which is off  1.3 percent and indeed, over the whole market, if you look at the global  markets, you've got the US, you've got Europe, you've got Asia.  </p><p> It was the Xetra DAX, which is the one that has the biggest fallout, the  political fallout for Angela Merkel.  US stocks were also lower, it's the  trade wars that were worrying those.  Paul La Monica is with us.  And Paul,  as we look at this graph over here, we can see clearly, we were down about  252 to 260 odd points at the open.  I mean, there were several attempts to  claw back but the day was still down quite sharply.  </p><p> PAUL LA MONICA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, we couldn't get there.  We  obviously still had a triple digit loss and this is a similar pattern what  happened on Friday.  It looked as if the market was really going to fall  very sharply, things looked very bleak and then we recovered by the end of  the day.  </p><p> I am getting sense from talking to people that there still is nervousness  obviously about a potential trade war with China and just about every other  major country in the world -- with them and the US, but no one seems to be  panicking yet.  I think there is still this notion that the cooler heads  may eventually prevail, that this is just tough bluster by President Trump  et cetera.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, so there was an article in \"The Times\" over the weekend that  basically said, in the business section, why the trade war everybody is  saying Armageddon is dreadful, it will be awful, but there is no evidence  of that in the market.  </p><p> And Peter Tuchman at the exchange was saying to me today, look, there is  not the evidence of it yet in the market because the economy is strong.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  The economy is still strong, Richard.  Earnings growth for the  second quarter is expected to be extremely robust.  There's talk about  analysts projecting almost 20 percent profit growth year over year.  The  question is going to be when do companies start talking about the  nervousness coming into play for the rest of this year and next year.  </p><p> You've got the Atlanta Fed, President Raphael Bostic making a speech today  where he talked about how earlier this year, he was incredibly optimistic  because of the tax cuts, and now he is getting a sense that he is a little  bit more worried about the environment going forward because people are  telling him that yes, all of these trade bluster could have an impact on  their profits going forward.  </p><p> People are going to be a little bit more skittish.  They may not buy as  much as stuff, both corporations and consumers and I think that's a  legitimate concern going forward.  </p><p> QUEST:  It's interesting when we look at it.  It's good to see -- didn't  you say, as we look at the market, it has tried to rally, and it did to a  certain extent, but could not do it.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  At least not for the Dow, but the NASDAQ did finish positive.   You've got people still loving those companies like Facebook and Google and  Netflix, Amazon.  They seem to be resistant to all of these macro concerns.  </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you.  Thank you.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Thank you.  </p><p> QUEST:  When we return, President Trump is looking beyond his borders with  dominance and out into the universe -- we will look for his plans for a  Space Force, what that actually means, and Jay-Z and Beyonce remind the  world they have their own streaming service and then promptly, we get all  the results upon arrival.  Go figure.  </p><p> [16:15:00]  </p><p> QUEST:  Now, I do need to just correct one or two minor matters.  We showed  you all the market numbers earlier, and I am afraid, I think that the  machine must have frozen.  The top line, the US market shows the Dow, we  had it down 113 points, it's not 103 at the close, but the important thing  which Paul La Monica quite rightly points out, the NASDAQ actually did eke  out a small gain for the session.  </p><p> So, just to correct.  In case you were a little bit concerned that it  didn't look like we've got it exactly right.  We didn't get it right, but  we have got it right now.  </p><p>Google is betting a half a million dollars on China and that's despite  Google being blocked mostly by Beijing.  Clare Sebastian is here.  Who are  they buying and how much?  </p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  They are buying just under 1 percent  of jd.com for $550 million in cash, Richard, so obviously, this is a big  foray into China for Google.  They have basically not been operating in  terms of their search maps, e-mails, YouTube entirely since 2010, but  clearly, they haven't given up on the country.  </p><p> We have seen little moves in this direction.  They have got two apps in the  country.  They have got translation and they have got file management.   They have visiting since -- which I was there back in November.  They have  opened an AI center there, so I think this is more of the same  (inaudible)...  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> QUEST:  Remind us why they are not there as Google.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Right, because of the Chinese's government's laws on  censorship.  They basically couldn't comply ethically with the rules there  and they left in 2010.  </p><p> QUEST:  And they pulled out.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  They pulled out despite the fact that there are 730 million  Internet users in China, Richard, more than twice the US's entire  population, they still pulled out.  But this is something they kind of  ignored -- the size and scale of this market.  But it is important for  jd.com as well.  </p><p> QUEST:  Why?  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Because jd.com just like Alibaba, you've seen them you know,  doing road shows in the US and beyond.  They want to expand outside of  China, that's really important for them because the market there, even  though it is huge isn't growing at the same rate as it was.  So, there is  room for growth.  It seems to be international, South East Asia, Europe,  the US -- all of these areas jd.com will be able to access through the  steel.  Its products will be on Google Shopping and there are more what  they call retail solutions on the guard...  </p><p> QUEST:  But what does jd.com do in the EU?  We think of jd.com like  Alibaba, as just being China's version of Amazon?  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Actually, jd.com is even more China's version of Amazon and  Alibaba is because it has the logistics network.  I've got a video I think  of one of their fully automated warehouses.  They do what Amazon does.   They have their own logistics there.  They do two-hour delivery in 50-plus  cities around China.  </p><p> So, they really do the kind of -- the supply chain that is crucial to e- commerce, and I think that's what Google is so interested in here.  They  haven't cracked the e-commerce yet.  </p><p> QUEST:  Thanks.  Good.  Thank you.  Clare Sebastian.  Big tech firms like  Google aren't the only ones working in this more complex environment.  John  Stankey, the new head of our parent company, WarnerMedia tells \"New Day\"  that everything in the entire economy is more difficult now.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p> JOHN STANKEY, CEO, WARNERMEDIA:  I think everything in the industry right  now is probably more complex and more difficult than it has ever been, and  I think if you were sitting over at Facebook today and asking about what  it's like to run their business, the transparency dynamic that any company  has to run under and the volatility that it brings in the decision making,  that's just part of industry today and I don't think it's unique to our  circumstances.  I think it's just broad scale across the economy right now.  </p><p> ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN HOST:  So, for all of our viewers who are watching,  they want to know what this means for them, are there costs going up?  What  else -- how will this affect them?  </p><p> STANKEY:  Contrary to what the government alleged, no.  Our goal here is  actually to innovate on product and you know, for me, personally, why I am  excited to be here, I have always been happiest in my career when I get to  build things and do unique things and do things that are different.  </p><p> And our goal here is to invest in this business and our goal is to do it in  a way that provides for platforms and capabilities that are consistent with  where technology is taking things.  And you know, a classic example might  be here at CNN.  </p><p> [16:20:11]  </p><p> STANKEY:  How can we broaden the distribution of the great content you guys  build every day?  How can we make it more readily available and the push  lifestyle that everybody leads and I think there are some very exciting  things to do in that regard.  </p><p> So, it's about innovating, it's about building new product, it's about  investing heavier in content.  It's certainly not about going out and just  trying to think about we want to raise prices on content for what other  people buy.  </p><p> BRIAN STELTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  I think that's interesting because there  have been some concerns in the cable industry that we are in a period of  decline or shrinkage as opposed to growth and investment?  And you're  saying in places like HBO, there is more money that should be spent?  </p><p> STANKEY:  Look, I think that the model as we know it today, you know,  standard linear television is a very immature model.  Standard linear  television in the form how ads are supported in it.  </p><p> But there is an opportunity to innovate in that regard, not only with how  the content is configured, but to think about how advertising supports that  content, and that's why we established the advertising entity with an AT&amp;T  that is being led by Brian Lesser.  </p><p> The purpose of that is to start building the new ad formats and the more  targeted advertising.  They can lower ad loads and still monetize content  the way where it remains affordable for the customer.  </p><p> So, that's the kind of innovation we are going to be working on.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> QUEST:  Thank you.  The CEO of Warner Media, my boss.  President Trump has  ordered the creation of a Space Force, calling it the sixth branch of the  Armed Forces.  Now, the appropriate name, Barbara Starr, joins me from the  Pentagon.  </p><p> All right, a Space Force will do what?  </p><p> BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  I haven't actually thought  about that, Richard, until you mentioned it.  Well, you know, I thought I  would try not to make the \"Star Wars,\" \"Star Trek,\" \"Battlestar Galactica\"  jokes, but let me have a go at it.  </p><p> I mean, you know, this is not a brand new idea.  It's something the  Pentagon has long been involved in and trying to make sure that its  satellites in space, the things that it relies in for war fighting are safe  and secure from adversaries, and that the US can dominate in space.  </p><p> So, we already know that some parts of the military pay an awful lot of  attention to this, especially the US Air Force.  </p><p> The President has for some time now talked about he wants a separate Space  Force.  Not getting total support from the Pentagon about all of that  because there is a lot of worry, it's just going to wind up being more  bureaucracy, but here is a bit of today when the President announced this,  a bit of his vision from the White House.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This time, we will do more  than plant our flag and leave our footprints, we will establish a long term  presence, expand our economy and build the foundation for the eventual  mission to Mars, which is actually going to happen very quickly.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> STARR:  Well, going to Mars quickly, we will see, as with all things in the  United States government.  It is going to depend on Congress' funding all  of these ideas that the President has, but let's look at a very practical  task ahead.  One of the biggest things in space for the US military for  example is to make sure its GPS satellites -- global positioning satellites  -- are always safe and secure because if you have an adversary trying to  take those out somehow with some sort of attack, that would not just  devastate US war fighting capabilities around the world, it would devastate  communications around the world.  </p><p> So, it gives you an idea of how much it is a problem, how much it is an  issue, but is the President's solution the one that Pentagon wants, not  exactly clear just yet that it is, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  Okay, so Barbara, with all of this, I guess, you know for a  President that loves hype, obviously this has been in the works for some  time, what is that gap between hype and reality to fruition and execution?  </p><p> STARR:  Well, for people, for top commanders in the US military, their  question starts with if there is something out there that we are not doing  to defend and protect Americans in that space environment, is there  something more we should be doing?  </p><p> A lot of money, time and attention is being paid to the very question --  advanced defensive capabilities, defensive information attacks all of that,  the key question I think, Richard, Congress wants to see something happen,  but there may be a very limited appetite for an entire new branch of the US  military.  </p><p> QUEST:  Our own shining star bright and comets skating and great to tell us  the story, Barbara, good to see you as always, thank you.  </p><p> STARR:  Thanks.  </p><p> QUEST:  Barbara Starr at the Pentagon.  Now, from space to slightly at  lower altitude, but we all get to fly anyway where Lufthansa, now, we know  Norwegian has received already two bids and rejected them from IAG -- the  owners of BA et cetera.  </p><p> [16:25:16]  </p><p> QUEST:  Lufthansa is reporting they have now been in contact with Norwegian  Air Shuttle as well.  So, you have Lufthansa and British Airways and IAG  interested in buying Europe's third biggest aircraft low cost group.  Both  have budget players in play.  </p><p> I wanted to look at the destination board and we are going to show you  exactly why this is so fascinating because if you look for example at what  Lufthansa already owns at the moment, you will see the complexity.  </p><p> Now, you've obviously got in the Lufthansa group, Lufthansa the German,  Swiss the Swiss Airline, you've got CityLine which is the regional;  Edelweiss, the low cost; German Wings and Euro Wings and your Austrian --  they are the main components that Lufthansa already owns within it.  </p><p> It's already got as well minority stakes in the Aerologic and Sun Express,  so Lufthansa on the one side.  Now, you've got AIG and if you look at the  airlines AIG has, you'll see exactly how significant that is going to be.  </p><p> BA, Iberia and Aer Lingus, Vueling and Level, they are the majorities  already that they have got.  They are the big carriers that they have got.   The minority stakes that -- this is the key one, the key one here, there.   Already got 4 percent of Norwegian, nearly 5 percent.  </p><p> So, on the both hands, you have Lufthansa and you have IAG, two of the  largest groups in the world now both seemingly doing battle trying to get  Norwegian.  I can tell you from within the industry, the view is Lufthansa  may just have the upper hand in all of this if Carsten Spohr decides to go  for the full bid, may indeed.  </p><p> But Willie Walsh is not going to give up easily, neither Chief Execs,  neither Spohr, nor Walsh is prepared to overbid for an airline that they  see is already in trouble.  </p><p> We will have more after the break.  </p><p> Hello, I am Richard Quest, there is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a  moment.  When Beyonce and Jay-Z set up for a big weekend on their streaming  service and how title's rivals are catching up and arguably, the two of  them shot themselves in their own fight for bid.  </p><p> And the World Health Organization now shows that video game addiction is  real.  I will speak to the founder of a rehab center for gamers.  As we  continue, you are watching CNN and here, the facts always come first.  </p><p> President Trump is again falsely shaming his political opponents, the  Democrats for his own policy on immigration which resulted in family  separation at the borders.  In remarks earlier today, President Trump said  the US would not become a migrant camp for refugee holding facility.  </p><p> [16:30:16]  Meanwhile, the new CNN poll shows most Republicans approve of  the policies which meant more parents and children being separated at the  border.  Overall, two-thirds of Americans disapprove, the president's  approval rating is now at 39 percent. </p><p> Chancellor Merkel of Germany has been given two weeks to reach an agreement  with the EU on a new immigration policy that both members of our coalition  government can support.  The CSU Party, her partners wants a deal to ban  migrants who have already applied for asylum elsewhere from entering  Germany.</p><p> CSU says if there's no deal, it will unilaterally move forward with the  plan.  In Britain, the Prime Minister Theresa May has suffered a fresh  defeat of her Brexit plans.  The House of Lords voted to give parliament  the final say on what happens in the event her government fails to reach an  exit deal with the EU. </p><p> The legislation is to be debated in the House of Commons on Wednesday.   Croatia's Nikola Kalinic has been sent home from the World Cup after he  refused to come on as a substitute.  The striker said he couldn't play  against Nigeria because of a back problem. </p><p> His coach pointed out he also refused to play during a friendly with Brazil  earlier this month.  A thriller outside of Saint Petersburg where a short  while ago England defeated Tunisia, it's the end of day five in the 2018  World Cup.  After some early missed chances, England's Captain Harry Kane  gave his team an early 1-0 lead, Tunisia leveled it with a penalty, and  that was just before the end of the first half.</p><p> Then as time was draining away, it was Harry Kane again with a dramatic  header -- yes, and to give England the 2-1 victory.  Amanda Davies is in  Moscow -- it's a haunting of a match. </p><p> AMANDA DAVIES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Richard, it was, but it's dangerous  times because England have won their opening match of this World Cup, and  everybody in England has been doing so well in terms of playing down  expectations for this very young, relatively untested England side. </p><p> Now, they've won, you do worry what happens next.  It wasn't the most  convincing performance, it has to be said, but there was some very exciting  moments within the side against a Tunisian team that -- or in their first  World Cup since 2006 and we knew it would sit very deep, defend very deep  in numbers.</p><p> So it was always going to be tough with this England side.  The moment that  you do get excited about is the fact, so in days gone by, a warm one,  England's generally would have settled for that or even worst perhaps  conceded a late goal.</p><p> But these guys kept on pushing, kept going and Harry Kane led by example as  the captain as you said to score the winner in the 91st minute, and you saw  -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> DAVIES:  Just what it meant to him and his manager Gary Southgate, a  massive results early doors. </p><p> QUEST:  Oh, hang on Amanda, it's better to win than lose. </p><p> DAVIES:  Absolutely Richard, but you know, I have been through some downs  and downs.  A little, a few ups.  But more downs as an England -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> DAVIES:  Supporter over the years, and so you know, I am wearing my red  dress, I wore my shirt this morning for breakfast, so we've got to be  realistic about it.  As this is, you know, one of the rare groups, after  this point in the competition has actually gone to plan with the big teams  -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> DAVIES:  Drawing their opening games, Belgium also won earlier today.  So  compared to what we've seen with Brazil, with Argentina, with Germany  losing yesterday, we know that you can't take anything for granted at all  in a World Cup. </p><p> QUEST:  And the beauty of all of this is that the atmosphere is starting to  build.  Whether it'd be the Germany match or even the first match from  Russia and Saudi Arabia right the way through to this match, the atmosphere  is building up as it's supposed to. </p><p> DAVIES:  Yes, it truly is a World Cup.  We're just at the bottom of Red  Square as we've said to you before, and there's a lot of Mexican fans,  there's been some Colombian fans here today.  And remember four years ago,  Richard, you had your flag pole of flags really and you were texting me as  to which flag needed to come out on which day. </p><p> And today, that was really tested, I had a fantastic moment by Saint  Basil's which has been open for the first time after they've taken down all  the stadium from the concert last week.  </p><p> [16:35:00] And there were three fans, there was a Mexican and Argentinean  and a Spaniard having a photo taken. </p><p> And then they saw a Colombian and said, come on over, and then there was a  Peruvian who joined the party and then there was some Moroccan fans who  joined the party and a German and a Swedish fan, and it was really a  fantastic moment in front of Saint Basil's, seeing everybody in their shirt  with their flags and it is what you would hope a World Cup would turn out  to be. </p><p> QUEST:  And be assured, Miss Davies, that your vexillology knowledge will  be required before we are finished, because the flags return, the flags  return when the economic World Cup returns once we get into the knockout  rounds which comes later.</p><p> So you may not rest easy, you'll be up all night studying flags, good to  see you.</p><p> DAVIES:  I will, bye-bye. </p><p> QUEST:  Sorted that out.  Beyonce and Jay-Z say they don't care about the  music industry's obsession with streaming numbers. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> (MUSIC) </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Plenty stuff, there it is, streaming service and the streaming  business, we're going to see -- discuss what it says about the future of  Tidal streaming service.  That they bring out a new album, maybe it's  exclusive to them and then give it to everybody else -- after the break. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Beyonce and Jay z dropped the surprise album over the weekend, it  wasn't expected.  It managed to get the whole world talking about their  streaming service Tidal once again.</p><p> Fans were sent rushing to the app because it was only app -- it was the  only way to hear the album at first.  Now Beyonce and Jay z have given it  to the mega streaming rival Spotify, Apple and Amazon. </p><p> And speaking of Spotify, Beyonce has some choice words about the music  business and its obsession with streaming numbers.  Listen carefully. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> (MUSIC) </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Savory stuff, Larry Miller is here thankfully.  Help us to  understand it, director of music business at the NYU Steinhardt School.   We'll get on to the obsession with streaming numbers in a moment.</p><p> But being weird to surprisingly release your own material on your own  streaming service that you've got an interest in and then given away to the  competition the next day. </p><p> LARRY MILLER, DIRECTOR OF MUSIC BUSINESS, NYU STEINHARDT SCHOOL:  Well,  true enough.  And if we go back to not so long ago when \"Lemonade\" dropped,  of course that dropped on an \"Hbo\" special, but it was also exclusively  available on Tidal for a short period of time. </p><p> [16:40:00] QUEST:  It was exclusive for a day. </p><p> MILLER:  Yes, right, that's very short. </p><p> QUEST:  That's very short. </p><p> MILLER:  That's very short indeed.  But I think that streaming has evolved  and the music industry has evolved and Spotify have about $180 million  subscribers and Apple have another $40 million or so, and Amazon have many  and there are other places people go to stream music.</p><p> QUEST:  Right, but if you are Beyonce and Jay z, you're not worried about  the money necessarily. </p><p> MILLER:  Right.  </p><p> QUEST:  And if you are committed to your Tidal streaming service, you're  prepared to take the punishment that will come by insisting it's only  there.  So why give it away? </p><p> MILLER:  Well, it's important to be where the eyeballs are and air balls  are.  And any artist wants to be able to gather attention around their  latest music -- </p><p> QUEST:  But you can't have both, Larry, you can't -- I mean, what I'm  trying to say is it suggests a lack of commitment to Tidal that they would  have done it so quickly -- </p><p> MILLER:  Well -- </p><p> QUEST:  Not even seven days. </p><p> MILLER:  Right, not even seven days.  And so in today's tension economy,  who knows what we'll be thinking about a week from now.  And so right now,  while attention is riveted on Beyonce and Jay z and that amazing video they  chose to make some music available a day later. </p><p> QUEST:  The louver, they got access to the louver -- </p><p> MILLER:  Amazing -- </p><p> QUEST:  For this video which is extraordinary, which is gratifying in a  sense to see the amount of money and the amount of effort and care on  production values that are put into these, some things, even though sort of  extreme things as you say, here today, gone tomorrow. </p><p> MILLER:  Fair enough, and so it's incumbent upon artists and the people who  they work with today to be able to drive attention by releasing music and  video and other things in other to maintain attention for as long as  possible.</p><p> QUEST:  OK, so as to Beyonce's somewhat vulgar references to streaming and  let me -- and then Spotify, you're right, it's a numbers game.  I mean, I'm  glad you're -- we've got -- the music business expert here, it's a numbers  game and Spotify has got the numbers, 175 million. </p><p> MILLER:  It is. </p><p> QUEST:  Right, as anybody else, I mean, if you want to be heard, you've got  to go there. </p><p> MILLER:  Yes, you need to be aware that people are and let's not forget,  they are in the middle of what I believe is a gigantic sold-out stadium -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> MILLER:  For -- they just finished playing in the big football stadium in  London -- </p><p> QUEST:  They did, Wembley.  Quick final question, can we say that Spotify  is now too big to fail? </p><p> MILLER:  I think it's hard to say in this day and age whether anything  really is too big to fail, but they are the leader in a growing and super  important segment of the music business that now accounts for two-thirds of  the revenue in the country. </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you sir, thank you. </p><p> MILLER:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p> QUEST:  As we continue tonight, you want to stay on top of the day's  business news and headlines in just 90 seconds and try our daily briefing  podcast, it's updated twice a day before and after the bell rings on Wall  Street, (INAUDIBLE) or Google for CNN flash briefing, just try it, see what  you get, and if it doesn't work, e-mail me.</p><p> When we return, Britain's Brexit blues are starting a report, claims the  U.K. is about to see its lowest growth if the financial crisis and things  aren't going to get much better any time soon. </p><p> [16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  So in the pubs of London where it is still time to get the last  order of drinks, and I suspect the England victory is dominating, but once  the thrilling World Cup win sort of dissipates, the U.K. will come back to  earth.</p><p> The British Chamber of Commerce is now predicting it will be the weakest  year of growth for the U.K. economy in almost a decade.  Adam Marshall is  the Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, good to see you,  Adam, thank you for taking time tonight. </p><p> I hope you saw the final results, you saw the game before popping into  Australia's to join us.  But it is sobering, your numbers, I mean, it  doesn't show complete collapse of destitution, but it does show sub-par  growth for the foreseeable future.</p><p> ADAM MARSHALL, DIRECTOR GENERAL, BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE:  I think  that's right, Richard, we are looking at about 1.3 percent growth this  year, 1.4 next year and 1.6 in 2020.  Those are not the sorts of numbers  that really blow the doors off when it comes to a major advanced economy. </p><p> And I think what we'd like to see is two things, one obviously, firms want  to see clarity on Brexit as that debate rumbles on terminally.  And I think  in the U.K., there's also a sense that we have other things to get on with  as well to make conditions great for business.</p><p> And there's quite -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> MARSHALL:  A lot that the government needs to do here at home as well. </p><p> QUEST:  Is there -- is this lone number, is it predicated on the  uncertainty on what happens or is there a general view now within the BCC  and you're an economist, that whatever happens immediately after Brexit,  growth will be lower, even in best case scenario, the U.K. will not be as  well off as it was within the EU. </p><p> MARSHALL:  Well, the U.K. will certainly see slower growth that it might  have done had the country not gone down this route at least in the very  short term, that is what we are forecasting.  But I think there are some  other factors that work here as well. </p><p> Obviously, some of the global trade skirmishes that we've been seeing in  recent weeks, unsettled businesses here in the U.K. about their future  prospects.  So anything that happens between the U.S. and China for  example, they may sneeze but the U.K. may very well catch cold as well.</p><p> Same thing about input prices and oil prices -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> MARSHALL:  Which have been going up for a lot of U.K. companies too. </p><p> QUEST:  And on this question of future growth, obviously, you would have  preferred -- I mean, I know the BCC, it would have preferred a single  market access.  But if you can't get single market access, what is your  preferred option for Customs Union and the way forward especially now we  seem to be at that essential moment when the negotiation has to decide  which way to go. </p><p> MARSHALL:  Well, our firms are not much interested in the chronology(ph)  about this.  They see a lot of labels around Customs Union and single  market.  And what they say to us is they want answers on practical  questions.  Who do I pay tax to? Who can I hire? How long can they stay in  my business? </p><p>Who is my regulator going to be? And those sorts of practical questions are  what really are driving a lot of business considerations around this.  You  could call the rapport(ph), whatever you want to, but businesses want  clarity on their trading conditions and they need to see that with some  urgency over the next few months. </p><p> QUEST:  OK, so we've had the white paper recently from the -- well, we had  the agreement back in March, we've had a white paper, we've got the current  disarray one might arguably say in parliament.  You just saw today  obviously, that the lords says -- once again voted that it should take  primacy if there's no deal. </p><p> Something that the Commons is going to have to look back at.  I mean, yes,  I guess I'm taking you into the chronology of the Brexit process and what  you're telling me is it's not very helpful. </p><p> MARSHALL:  It's not, in fact, a lot of firms around the country who say  look, they're watching and waiting, but what they need is something  concrete upon which they can act -- </p><p> QUEST:  They're not going to get it I think --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> I've got news for you, that's exactly -- I mean, and that's the dirty  secret here isn't it? They're not going to get it and even once the  agreement is signed, there's still going to be a level of uncertainty that  will be damaging to your members.  Can you accept that? </p><p> MARSHALL:  No, I think businesses know that there's going to be uncertainty  for some time to come, a very few pundits have said to us, well, once you  negotiate with the European Union, you negotiate with the European Union  forever. </p><p> It's very likely to be the case that those negotiations will be ongoing for  a long time.  But businesses do need a degree of certainty here, Richard,  they do need something to work off of, and I think their biggest dismay,  their biggest opprobrium is actually for the U.K. politicians, they can't  agree on a route forward to go into that negotiating room.</p><p> [16:50:00] Because what we know in business is you go into a negotiation  with a clear position and that's what we need our government to do.</p><p> QUEST:  Right, let's just talk about these, the strength at the moment of  the U.K. economy.  All right, unemployment is down and there could be a  labor shortage, but wage inflation is starting to pick up again.  Now, the  Bank of England would like to start raising rates because inflation has  started to move up, but it can't because of their -- I mean, all roads lead  back to Brexit because of the uncertainty. </p><p> But the economy itself is fundamentally robust. </p><p> MARSHALL:  Yes, there's some strength in the economy, it's been threading  water though as the way we like to put it.  It's not sinking, but it is  threading water.  We're not seeing the kind of growth we'd want to see.</p><p> These are the interest rates we're forecasting one rise over the coming  months and perhaps one more in the period until 2020.  But even the window  for those minimal source of rise to 75 or a 100 basis points is starting to  close.  Because as you rightly say, uncertainty is going to mean the bank  is going to want to keep conditions as smooth as possible for business.</p><p> So we don't see a very strong case for significant rate rises in the near  future.</p><p> QUEST:  You'll forgive me if I don't say I'm sorry to hear that, I mean,  got a U.K. mortgage, I'm rather glad that it might be a little bit longer  to enjoy the good times, good to see you sir, thank you. </p><p> MARSHALL:  And you, Richard.</p><p> QUEST:  We'll talk more about this in detail as the process goes on, good  to have you.  The games industry is taking in $100 billion, that's right,  $100 billion a year.  The World Health Organization is now warning it could  be triggering(ph) a new public health concern. </p><p> It's called gaming disorder and it's just been listed as a mental health  condition.  It describes compulsive players who just plays from similar to  those of gambling addicts.  The WHO says it applies to behavior lasting 12  months or more.</p><p> Joining me now is the co-founder of a rehab center for internet and video  gaming addiction is Hilarie Cash, she joins me from reSTART which is live  from Seattle in Washington.  Were you surprised that it's taken so long to  get the WHO to recognize gaming as a gaming disorder. </p><p> HILARIE CASH, CO-FOUNDER, RESTART:  Not really, I -- you know, this whole  phenomenon has taken the world by storm and actually moving very quickly.   And research, you know, they're going to make their decisions based on the  research findings.  And research is by its nature rather slow. </p><p> So I think it's not -- but I think I'm just glad it's finally here. </p><p> QUEST:  What are the symptoms of gaming disorder? How does somebody  recognize when they've got it? </p><p> CASH:  I think the best way to think about it is that when you are out of  control and you are gaming in spite of its negative consequences, you've  got a problem.</p><p> QUEST:  And the treatment for it, how far does it accord to the other  traditional addictions? Obviously, drugs, alcohol, gambling, overspending,  all the others.  Does it follow the same model for treatment, whether it'd  be the 12-step model or otherwise? </p><p> CASH:  Well, I can tell you that our model of treatment is to be very  holistic in what we're trying to do.  So we are -- the adults as well as  the adolescents tries spending at least two months free of all screens, and  the idea is that they need that time to -- for their brains to come back to  normal functioning, they need that time to get their health back, they  usually are chronically sleep deprived, unfit and they've been eating very  poorly for a long time. </p><p> So they're getting their health back, they're developing skills that they  really are going to need if they're going to be functional young adults.   And they're getting a plan together for how they're going to abuse digital  technology again in a sustainable and healthy way. </p><p> After that two months period, there's been if they choose and about 80  percent of them do choose, you go on to the second phase of the program,  that's the phase where they're now for the adults living in apartments  together in -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> CASH:  In small groups, they're getting part-time work and they're just  starting to live life like adults need to live life -- </p><p> QUEST:  OK, so final question, with the other addictions, alcohol, drugs  and the like, the general view is total abstinence.  What is too many, a  thousand, never enough.  With gaming addiction or gaming disorder, do you  believe that you can't do it at all or do you believe there's a manageable  way you can do it. </p><p> CASH:  Well, I think there's a manageable way you can use a digital  technology.  </p><p> [16:55:00] I think if you're gaming addict, you're really getting on thin  ice if you try to go back to gaming and chances are very high that you will  relapse.  So we ask the guys when they come into program and are developing  what we call the life balance friend -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> CASH:  To think through -- what are their bottom lines and those bottom  lines almost always are going to include video games. </p><p> QUEST:  Good to talk to you, thank you, I appreciate your time tonight,  thank you.  We will have a different profitable moment after the break,  this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS live from New York. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, it is lovely in an era where we are  talking about the misery and mayhem that we're able to turn our attention  to something much more pleasant.  Weddings within the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS  team who makes no apology for showing you the very best that we have got. </p><p> Our senior producer John and his new bride Ali(ph), yes, that's the two at  the front, and the rest are the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS team that all sort of  -- I think the director summed it up rather well.  I think -- well, she  says you all scrubbed up rather nicely over the weekend. </p><p> And our technical director Rick Flair(ph) and his new wife Emily, yes, they  also scrubbed up rather nicely on the way to and from their ceremony.  So  we take this opportunity because it's only right and proper that we  remember this program that we bring to you every night with love and  privilege is made by people behind the cameras and they actually put it  together. </p><p> And today, four of them have enjoyed weddings.  And that is QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York.  Whatever you're up  to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.  Congratulations to all my  colleagues. </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It has pulled up quite considerably from the  opening of force, but PSE giving the closing bell.  So, we have got one  wimpy one and one okay one, but trading is over.  It is Monday, 18th of  June.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tonight, two weeks to save her coalition.  German stocks down heavily after  Angela Merkel gets an ultimatum from her own partners.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Audi's Chief Executive is under arrest.  Dieselgate is rumbling on and  Beyonce's new album has some shade for Spotify.  You can hear it now,  ironically, not exclusively on Spotify.  </p><p> I am Richard Quest, live from the world's financial capital, New York City  where it's mixing hot here, but where I still mean business.  </p><p> Good evening, Angela Merkel is facing a moment of reckoning.  She is being  given two weeks to save her coalition and resolve the immigration debate  that threatens to bring down Germany's fragile government.  </p><p> The Chancellor has been given an ultimatum -- overhaul Germany's migration  policies or face a new rebellion from coalition partners.  Facing his own  migration debate in the United States, President Trump seized on Mrs.  Merkel's position to launch an attack on Twitter.  He claims the migration  issue has caused the people of Germany to turn against their leader.   Investors seem concerned by the political turmoil.  </p><p> The Xetra DAX fell one percent on Monday, markets are unlikely to be  soothed by the words of the Chancellor's chief antagonist.  The CDU's party  leader warns the crisis won't be over any time soon.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> HORST SEEHOFER, FEDERAL MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR:  (Through an  interpreter).  It is ridiculous to say now to determine public that is all  about those two weeks and then after that, it will all be wonderful.  </p><p> I repeated it to the Board gathered today.  I warn you that we are not out  of the woods yet, not at all.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Atika Shubert joins me now with the latest from Berlin.  Two weeks  -- now before we get to what happens in that two weeks, let's first of all  analyze the compromise that she has agreed to just to get the breathing  space for a proper negotiation.  </p><p> ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, well,  basically, you heard there from Horst Seehofer that of course is the  Interior Minister.  He is also the leader of the Bavaria sister party, the  Christian Social Union and he was threatening to essentially break up the  coalition government unless he was allowed to unveil the 63-point plan to  reduce migration, specifically, he wanted to reject the asylum seekers at  the border if they had already applied for asylum in other EU countries,  and that is where Merkel drew the line.  </p><p> She said, \"Listen, I can't accept that one point in your plan.  Give me two  weeks to find an alternate solution by brokering bilateral agreements.\"   And that is where we stand now.  So, she has to try and figure out those  deals with other EU nations come back on July 1st, report back to her party  and say, \"This is how I have resolved it.\"  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, but what is the core issue here?  I mean, I know it is  complex that she has to do it, but the agreement to allow for instance  migrants to stay in the country where they have arrived.  What is the  difference between her and her coalition partner?  </p><p> SHUBERT:  Well, the difference is essentially that of as you know, in the  EU, if you're applying for asylum, you're supposed to apply in the country  where you enter.  Unfortunately, this means that you get a disproportionate  number of asylum seekers in Italy, Greece and those external countries.  </p><p> Germany did take in about a million refugees during the 2015 crisis and  that as far as Seehofer and Merkel's critics are concerned is too many.   So, what they want to do is reduce the number by then saying, \"If you've  already applied in Italy, Greece or somewhere else, you can't come here to  Germany.\"  And then push them back.  </p><p> Now, Merkel is saying that's a violation of the EU principle of freedom of  movement and that Germany can't do that automatically.  It needs to broker  some sort of a deal if not with all of the EU, then bilateral agreements  with different EU partners.  That's the difference there.  </p><p> So, she has basically bought herself some time to try and broker those  agreements, and maybe stave off any political crisis at home.  </p><p> QUEST:  Is it likely though that the CSU would promote this to a full blown  crisis to the point where it would endanger the coalition and Merkel's  position?  </p><p> SHUBERT:  Well, that's the key question.  I mean, the CSU is looking at  Bavaria local elections in October, that's probably one reason they have  taken this up a notch to such high drama, but the reality is, if they broke  up the coalition, then the CDU, the Christian Democrats could field their  own candidates in Bavaria and it could end up hurting the CSU in the long  run.  </p><p> [16:05:12]  </p><p> SHUBERT:  Also, as much as the general public wants to see tougher  immigration laws, they don't want to see another round of elections coming  up.  So, it could work out that the CSU says, \"Listen, we have proven our  point, now we will just back down,\" but we'll know better in about two  weeks, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  Atika Shubert in Berlin.  Elmar Brok is a member of the European  Parliament -- Parliament of the House and a close ally of Chancellor  Merkel, joins me now from Verl in Germany.  Good to see you, sir.  Thank  you.  </p><p> How likely is it how that a solution can be found in the two weeks  breathing speace that Chancellor Merkel has been given, bearing in mind,  she is going to have to get a green light from the other parties, the other  countries in Europe?  </p><p> ELMAR BROK, MEMBER, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:  Look at the party (ph) this  morning and there was a very strong support from all the leaders of our  party and the thing she was pressing (ph), that was the European solution.   And (ph) now that per month, 95 percent less migration in (ph) countries  than we had October 2015.  The great success story and many other measures  were taken, and here is a small question around -- around France about was  the close with their regional elections and I believe that that (inaudible)  and Mrs. Merkel will talk to the neighboring countries because she says if  she does not do that without an agreement with our neighboring countries,  we will (ph) -- these measures will have no effect.  </p><p> QUEST:  All right, is in your view -- I mean, it may not be nice or  pleasant to say this, but is the German coalition in danger over this  issue?  </p><p> BROK:  Look, you can never know how far people go, but (inaudible) on that  with interest (inaudible) breakdown, nothing would be delivered.  And also  about (inaudible) success (inaudible) for the elections.  The only  (inaudible) would be the (inaudible) party and therefore, I believe that if  some things were to be pushed forward, but that at the end of the day,  government will stable (inaudible) of the Bavaria Party in their own  elections.  </p><p> QUEST:  Elmar Brok, thank you.  We will keep it short because we have a  poor connection tonight, so we will talk to you hopefully again in the  future about this, but thank you for joining us in this evening.  </p><p> Now, we say with Germany, there was no shortage of drama in the country  today after authorities arrested the Chief Executive of Audi, one of the  country's biggest auto makers.  Rupert Stadler was taken into custody.   Investigators are worried he could influence witnesses related to the  emission scandal.  </p><p> Shares in Audi's parent company, Volkswagen, which has already paid tens of  billions of Euros in fines and fees because of the emission scandal fell  sharply on the news.  Anna Stewart is in London.  What's he been arrested  for?  </p><p> ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  So, this is an investigation, a criminal  investigation of Audi and it involves the alleged fraud by some 20 former  and current employees and one of those is Rupert Stadler.  He is being  investigated.  </p><p> Now, he was arrested, Richard.  He is being detained because of the risk of  evidence tampering or influencing other witnesses, other managers from Audi  over the scandal, so that is why he is being detained today.  </p><p> We knew that his apartment was raided last week and today, the Volkswagen  supervisory board were meeting to discuss this amongst other things, so  everyone is on tenterhooks wondering whether or not he will be forced to  tender his resignation.  </p><p> QUEST:  Okay, so let's be clear about this, the emissions scandal related  to Volkswagen cars, where does the emission scandal fit into the whole Audi  question?  </p><p> STEWART:  Well, Audi as a subsidiary of BW is also part of the emissions  diesel scandal.  It also had cars that were fitted with cheating devices  like Volkswagen, but there is a separate investigation that has also linked  Volkswagen and watched those CEOs and managers know.  </p><p> What they want to know here, Richard is who knew what when and what did  they do about it?  Was it transparent?  Many shareholders have brought this  up in separate lawsuits.  I mean, there are numerous lawsuits around this  saying there wasn't enough transparency from the Board on how big the  liabilities would be.  </p><p> As you said, tens of billions of dollars.  </p><p> QUEST:  All right, so that's already been paid, but the moment somebody  gets locked up and I am trying to remember how many of the people have been  locked up in this case, and I am not sure there have been any, but the  moment somebody gets locked up on allegation of -- or potential allegation  of witness tampering, then we're moving into a different area, a much more  serious area of criminality in that sense.  </p><p> STEWART:  Absolutely, I think it would be much harder to really dodge this  bullet as a CEO.  The Board has been incredibly supportive of Rupert  Stadler throughout, his being in the company since 1990, and he has faced  many calls for his resignation over the last couple of years.  </p><p> [00:05:12]  </p><p> STEWART:  Particularly, actually from minority shareholders, but the Board  has supported him every step of the way, and actually last year, despite  what he has caused, they actually extended his contract by five years.  </p><p> But as you say, bringing someone under arrest changes the story entirely,  so everyone is watching to see what will happen in the next sort of 12  hours.  </p><p> QUEST:  Anna Stewart, thank you for putting that clearly into perspective  for us.  Thank you.  </p><p> Now, stocks are down almost everywhere you choose to look.  In fact, there  was -- the Dow opened lower and although it recovered, it really was a  fairly sharp fall.  Look at the grid and you will see.  The Dow was off in  its worse point down about 260 to 270 points, so it did come back quite a  lot.  </p><p> But still close of 133 and failed to hold the 25,000 mark.  Similarly,  losses -- percentage-wise, much less for the NASDAQ and indeed, the fan  stocks for most of the day were actually higher.  But, that misery could be  seen of what we saw or we had just been talking about, not only with Angela  Merkel, but Audi can certainly be seen here with the Xetra DAX which is off  1.3 percent and indeed, over the whole market, if you look at the global  markets, you've got the US, you've got Europe, you've got Asia.  </p><p> It was the Xetra DAX, which is the one that has the biggest fallout, the  political fallout for Angela Merkel.  US stocks were also lower, it's the  trade wars that were worrying those.  Paul La Monica is with us.  And Paul,  as we look at this graph over here, we can see clearly, we were down about  252 to 260 odd points at the open.  I mean, there were several attempts to  claw back but the day was still down quite sharply.  </p><p> PAUL LA MONICA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, we couldn't get there.  We  obviously still had a triple digit loss and this is a similar pattern what  happened on Friday.  It looked as if the market was really going to fall  very sharply, things looked very bleak and then we recovered by the end of  the day.  </p><p> I am getting sense from talking to people that there still is nervousness  obviously about a potential trade war with China and just about every other  major country in the world -- with them and the US, but no one seems to be  panicking yet.  I think there is still this notion that the cooler heads  may eventually prevail, that this is just tough bluster by President Trump  et cetera.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, so there was an article in \"The Times\" over the weekend that  basically said, in the business section, why the trade war everybody is  saying Armageddon is dreadful, it will be awful, but there is no evidence  of that in the market.  </p><p> And Peter Tuchman at the exchange was saying to me today, look, there is  not the evidence of it yet in the market because the economy is strong.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  The economy is still strong, Richard.  Earnings growth for the  second quarter is expected to be extremely robust.  There's talk about  analysts projecting almost 20 percent profit growth year over year.  The  question is going to be when do companies start talking about the  nervousness coming into play for the rest of this year and next year.  </p><p> You've got the Atlanta Fed, President Raphael Bostic making a speech today  where he talked about how earlier this year, he was incredibly optimistic  because of the tax cuts, and now he is getting a sense that he is a little  bit more worried about the environment going forward because people are  telling him that yes, all of these trade bluster could have an impact on  their profits going forward.  </p><p> People are going to be a little bit more skittish.  They may not buy as  much as stuff, both corporations and consumers and I think that's a  legitimate concern going forward.  </p><p> QUEST:  It's interesting when we look at it.  It's good to see -- didn't  you say, as we look at the market, it has tried to rally, and it did to a  certain extent, but could not do it.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  At least not for the Dow, but the NASDAQ did finish positive.   You've got people still loving those companies like Facebook and Google and  Netflix, Amazon.  They seem to be resistant to all of these macro concerns.  </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you.  Thank you.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Thank you.  </p><p> QUEST:  When we return, President Trump is looking beyond his borders with  dominance and out into the universe -- we will look for his plans for a  Space Force, what that actually means, and Jay-Z and Beyonce remind the  world they have their own streaming service and then promptly, we get all  the results upon arrival.  Go figure.  </p><p> [16:15:00]  </p><p> QUEST:  Now, I do need to just correct one or two minor matters.  We showed  you all the market numbers earlier, and I am afraid, I think that the  machine must have frozen.  The top line, the US market shows the Dow, we  had it down 113 points, it's not 103 at the close, but the important thing  which Paul La Monica quite rightly points out, the NASDAQ actually did eke  out a small gain for the session.  </p><p> So, just to correct.  In case you were a little bit concerned that it  didn't look like we've got it exactly right.  We didn't get it right, but  we have got it right now.  </p><p>Google is betting a half a million dollars on China and that's despite  Google being blocked mostly by Beijing.  Clare Sebastian is here.  Who are  they buying and how much?  </p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  They are buying just under 1 percent  of jd.com for $550 million in cash, Richard, so obviously, this is a big  foray into China for Google.  They have basically not been operating in  terms of their search maps, e-mails, YouTube entirely since 2010, but  clearly, they haven't given up on the country.  </p><p> We have seen little moves in this direction.  They have got two apps in the  country.  They have got translation and they have got file management.   They have visiting since -- which I was there back in November.  They have  opened an AI center there, so I think this is more of the same  (inaudible)...  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> QUEST:  Remind us why they are not there as Google.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Right, because of the Chinese's government's laws on  censorship.  They basically couldn't comply ethically with the rules there  and they left in 2010.  </p><p> QUEST:  And they pulled out.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  They pulled out despite the fact that there are 730 million  Internet users in China, Richard, more than twice the US's entire  population, they still pulled out.  But this is something they kind of  ignored -- the size and scale of this market.  But it is important for  jd.com as well.  </p><p> QUEST:  Why?  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Because jd.com just like Alibaba, you've seen them you know,  doing road shows in the US and beyond.  They want to expand outside of  China, that's really important for them because the market there, even  though it is huge isn't growing at the same rate as it was.  So, there is  room for growth.  It seems to be international, South East Asia, Europe,  the US -- all of these areas jd.com will be able to access through the  steel.  Its products will be on Google Shopping and there are more what  they call retail solutions on the guard...  </p><p> QUEST:  But what does jd.com do in the EU?  We think of jd.com like  Alibaba, as just being China's version of Amazon?  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Actually, jd.com is even more China's version of Amazon and  Alibaba is because it has the logistics network.  I've got a video I think  of one of their fully automated warehouses.  They do what Amazon does.   They have their own logistics there.  They do two-hour delivery in 50-plus  cities around China.  </p><p> So, they really do the kind of -- the supply chain that is crucial to e- commerce, and I think that's what Google is so interested in here.  They  haven't cracked the e-commerce yet.  </p><p> QUEST:  Thanks.  Good.  Thank you.  Clare Sebastian.  Big tech firms like  Google aren't the only ones working in this more complex environment.  John  Stankey, the new head of our parent company, WarnerMedia tells \"New Day\"  that everything in the entire economy is more difficult now.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p> JOHN STANKEY, CEO, WARNERMEDIA:  I think everything in the industry right  now is probably more complex and more difficult than it has ever been, and  I think if you were sitting over at Facebook today and asking about what  it's like to run their business, the transparency dynamic that any company  has to run under and the volatility that it brings in the decision making,  that's just part of industry today and I don't think it's unique to our  circumstances.  I think it's just broad scale across the economy right now.  </p><p> ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN HOST:  So, for all of our viewers who are watching,  they want to know what this means for them, are there costs going up?  What  else -- how will this affect them?  </p><p> STANKEY:  Contrary to what the government alleged, no.  Our goal here is  actually to innovate on product and you know, for me, personally, why I am  excited to be here, I have always been happiest in my career when I get to  build things and do unique things and do things that are different.  </p><p> And our goal here is to invest in this business and our goal is to do it in  a way that provides for platforms and capabilities that are consistent with  where technology is taking things.  And you know, a classic example might  be here at CNN.  </p><p> [16:20:11]  </p><p> STANKEY:  How can we broaden the distribution of the great content you guys  build every day?  How can we make it more readily available and the push  lifestyle that everybody leads and I think there are some very exciting  things to do in that regard.  </p><p> So, it's about innovating, it's about building new product, it's about  investing heavier in content.  It's certainly not about going out and just  trying to think about we want to raise prices on content for what other  people buy.  </p><p> BRIAN STELTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  I think that's interesting because there  have been some concerns in the cable industry that we are in a period of  decline or shrinkage as opposed to growth and investment?  And you're  saying in places like HBO, there is more money that should be spent?  </p><p> STANKEY:  Look, I think that the model as we know it today, you know,  standard linear television is a very immature model.  Standard linear  television in the form how ads are supported in it.  </p><p> But there is an opportunity to innovate in that regard, not only with how  the content is configured, but to think about how advertising supports that  content, and that's why we established the advertising entity with an AT&amp;T  that is being led by Brian Lesser.  </p><p> The purpose of that is to start building the new ad formats and the more  targeted advertising.  They can lower ad loads and still monetize content  the way where it remains affordable for the customer.  </p><p> So, that's the kind of innovation we are going to be working on.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> QUEST:  Thank you.  The CEO of Warner Media, my boss.  President Trump has  ordered the creation of a Space Force, calling it the sixth branch of the  Armed Forces.  Now, the appropriate name, Barbara Starr, joins me from the  Pentagon.  </p><p> All right, a Space Force will do what?  </p><p> BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  I haven't actually thought  about that, Richard, until you mentioned it.  Well, you know, I thought I  would try not to make the \"Star Wars,\" \"Star Trek,\" \"Battlestar Galactica\"  jokes, but let me have a go at it.  </p><p> I mean, you know, this is not a brand new idea.  It's something the  Pentagon has long been involved in and trying to make sure that its  satellites in space, the things that it relies in for war fighting are safe  and secure from adversaries, and that the US can dominate in space.  </p><p> So, we already know that some parts of the military pay an awful lot of  attention to this, especially the US Air Force.  </p><p> The President has for some time now talked about he wants a separate Space  Force.  Not getting total support from the Pentagon about all of that  because there is a lot of worry, it's just going to wind up being more  bureaucracy, but here is a bit of today when the President announced this,  a bit of his vision from the White House.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This time, we will do more  than plant our flag and leave our footprints, we will establish a long term  presence, expand our economy and build the foundation for the eventual  mission to Mars, which is actually going to happen very quickly.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> STARR:  Well, going to Mars quickly, we will see, as with all things in the  United States government.  It is going to depend on Congress' funding all  of these ideas that the President has, but let's look at a very practical  task ahead.  One of the biggest things in space for the US military for  example is to make sure its GPS satellites -- global positioning satellites  -- are always safe and secure because if you have an adversary trying to  take those out somehow with some sort of attack, that would not just  devastate US war fighting capabilities around the world, it would devastate  communications around the world.  </p><p> So, it gives you an idea of how much it is a problem, how much it is an  issue, but is the President's solution the one that Pentagon wants, not  exactly clear just yet that it is, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  Okay, so Barbara, with all of this, I guess, you know for a  President that loves hype, obviously this has been in the works for some  time, what is that gap between hype and reality to fruition and execution?  </p><p> STARR:  Well, for people, for top commanders in the US military, their  question starts with if there is something out there that we are not doing  to defend and protect Americans in that space environment, is there  something more we should be doing?  </p><p> A lot of money, time and attention is being paid to the very question --  advanced defensive capabilities, defensive information attacks all of that,  the key question I think, Richard, Congress wants to see something happen,  but there may be a very limited appetite for an entire new branch of the US  military.  </p><p> QUEST:  Our own shining star bright and comets skating and great to tell us  the story, Barbara, good to see you as always, thank you.  </p><p> STARR:  Thanks.  </p><p> QUEST:  Barbara Starr at the Pentagon.  Now, from space to slightly at  lower altitude, but we all get to fly anyway where Lufthansa, now, we know  Norwegian has received already two bids and rejected them from IAG -- the  owners of BA et cetera.  </p><p> [16:25:16]  </p><p> QUEST:  Lufthansa is reporting they have now been in contact with Norwegian  Air Shuttle as well.  So, you have Lufthansa and British Airways and IAG  interested in buying Europe's third biggest aircraft low cost group.  Both  have budget players in play.  </p><p> I wanted to look at the destination board and we are going to show you  exactly why this is so fascinating because if you look for example at what  Lufthansa already owns at the moment, you will see the complexity.  </p><p> Now, you've obviously got in the Lufthansa group, Lufthansa the German,  Swiss the Swiss Airline, you've got CityLine which is the regional;  Edelweiss, the low cost; German Wings and Euro Wings and your Austrian --  they are the main components that Lufthansa already owns within it.  </p><p> It's already got as well minority stakes in the Aerologic and Sun Express,  so Lufthansa on the one side.  Now, you've got AIG and if you look at the  airlines AIG has, you'll see exactly how significant that is going to be.  </p><p> BA, Iberia and Aer Lingus, Vueling and Level, they are the majorities  already that they have got.  They are the big carriers that they have got.   The minority stakes that -- this is the key one, the key one here, there.   Already got 4 percent of Norwegian, nearly 5 percent.  </p><p> So, on the both hands, you have Lufthansa and you have IAG, two of the  largest groups in the world now both seemingly doing battle trying to get  Norwegian.  I can tell you from within the industry, the view is Lufthansa  may just have the upper hand in all of this if Carsten Spohr decides to go  for the full bid, may indeed.  </p><p> But Willie Walsh is not going to give up easily, neither Chief Execs,  neither Spohr, nor Walsh is prepared to overbid for an airline that they  see is already in trouble.  </p><p> We will have more after the break.  </p><p> Hello, I am Richard Quest, there is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a  moment.  When Beyonce and Jay-Z set up for a big weekend on their streaming  service and how title's rivals are catching up and arguably, the two of  them shot themselves in their own fight for bid.  </p><p> And the World Health Organization now shows that video game addiction is  real.  I will speak to the founder of a rehab center for gamers.  As we  continue, you are watching CNN and here, the facts always come first.  </p><p> President Trump is again falsely shaming his political opponents, the  Democrats for his own policy on immigration which resulted in family  separation at the borders.  In remarks earlier today, President Trump said  the US would not become a migrant camp for refugee holding facility.  </p><p> [16:30:16]  Meanwhile, the new CNN poll shows most Republicans approve of  the policies which meant more parents and children being separated at the  border.  Overall, two-thirds of Americans disapprove, the president's  approval rating is now at 39 percent. </p><p> Chancellor Merkel of Germany has been given two weeks to reach an agreement  with the EU on a new immigration policy that both members of our coalition  government can support.  The CSU Party, her partners wants a deal to ban  migrants who have already applied for asylum elsewhere from entering  Germany.</p><p> CSU says if there's no deal, it will unilaterally move forward with the  plan.  In Britain, the Prime Minister Theresa May has suffered a fresh  defeat of her Brexit plans.  The House of Lords voted to give parliament  the final say on what happens in the event her government fails to reach an  exit deal with the EU. </p><p> The legislation is to be debated in the House of Commons on Wednesday.   Croatia's Nikola Kalinic has been sent home from the World Cup after he  refused to come on as a substitute.  The striker said he couldn't play  against Nigeria because of a back problem. </p><p> His coach pointed out he also refused to play during a friendly with Brazil  earlier this month.  A thriller outside of Saint Petersburg where a short  while ago England defeated Tunisia, it's the end of day five in the 2018  World Cup.  After some early missed chances, England's Captain Harry Kane  gave his team an early 1-0 lead, Tunisia leveled it with a penalty, and  that was just before the end of the first half.</p><p> Then as time was draining away, it was Harry Kane again with a dramatic  header -- yes, and to give England the 2-1 victory.  Amanda Davies is in  Moscow -- it's a haunting of a match. </p><p> AMANDA DAVIES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Richard, it was, but it's dangerous  times because England have won their opening match of this World Cup, and  everybody in England has been doing so well in terms of playing down  expectations for this very young, relatively untested England side. </p><p> Now, they've won, you do worry what happens next.  It wasn't the most  convincing performance, it has to be said, but there was some very exciting  moments within the side against a Tunisian team that -- or in their first  World Cup since 2006 and we knew it would sit very deep, defend very deep  in numbers.</p><p> So it was always going to be tough with this England side.  The moment that  you do get excited about is the fact, so in days gone by, a warm one,  England's generally would have settled for that or even worst perhaps  conceded a late goal.</p><p> But these guys kept on pushing, kept going and Harry Kane led by example as  the captain as you said to score the winner in the 91st minute, and you saw  -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> DAVIES:  Just what it meant to him and his manager Gary Southgate, a  massive results early doors. </p><p> QUEST:  Oh, hang on Amanda, it's better to win than lose. </p><p> DAVIES:  Absolutely Richard, but you know, I have been through some downs  and downs.  A little, a few ups.  But more downs as an England -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> DAVIES:  Supporter over the years, and so you know, I am wearing my red  dress, I wore my shirt this morning for breakfast, so we've got to be  realistic about it.  As this is, you know, one of the rare groups, after  this point in the competition has actually gone to plan with the big teams  -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> DAVIES:  Drawing their opening games, Belgium also won earlier today.  So  compared to what we've seen with Brazil, with Argentina, with Germany  losing yesterday, we know that you can't take anything for granted at all  in a World Cup. </p><p> QUEST:  And the beauty of all of this is that the atmosphere is starting to  build.  Whether it'd be the Germany match or even the first match from  Russia and Saudi Arabia right the way through to this match, the atmosphere  is building up as it's supposed to. </p><p> DAVIES:  Yes, it truly is a World Cup.  We're just at the bottom of Red  Square as we've said to you before, and there's a lot of Mexican fans,  there's been some Colombian fans here today.  And remember four years ago,  Richard, you had your flag pole of flags really and you were texting me as  to which flag needed to come out on which day. </p><p> And today, that was really tested, I had a fantastic moment by Saint  Basil's which has been open for the first time after they've taken down all  the stadium from the concert last week.  </p><p> [16:35:00] And there were three fans, there was a Mexican and Argentinean  and a Spaniard having a photo taken. </p><p> And then they saw a Colombian and said, come on over, and then there was a  Peruvian who joined the party and then there was some Moroccan fans who  joined the party and a German and a Swedish fan, and it was really a  fantastic moment in front of Saint Basil's, seeing everybody in their shirt  with their flags and it is what you would hope a World Cup would turn out  to be. </p><p> QUEST:  And be assured, Miss Davies, that your vexillology knowledge will  be required before we are finished, because the flags return, the flags  return when the economic World Cup returns once we get into the knockout  rounds which comes later.</p><p> So you may not rest easy, you'll be up all night studying flags, good to  see you.</p><p> DAVIES:  I will, bye-bye. </p><p> QUEST:  Sorted that out.  Beyonce and Jay-Z say they don't care about the  music industry's obsession with streaming numbers. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> (MUSIC) </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Plenty stuff, there it is, streaming service and the streaming  business, we're going to see -- discuss what it says about the future of  Tidal streaming service.  That they bring out a new album, maybe it's  exclusive to them and then give it to everybody else -- after the break. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Beyonce and Jay z dropped the surprise album over the weekend, it  wasn't expected.  It managed to get the whole world talking about their  streaming service Tidal once again.</p><p> Fans were sent rushing to the app because it was only app -- it was the  only way to hear the album at first.  Now Beyonce and Jay z have given it  to the mega streaming rival Spotify, Apple and Amazon. </p><p> And speaking of Spotify, Beyonce has some choice words about the music  business and its obsession with streaming numbers.  Listen carefully. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> (MUSIC) </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Savory stuff, Larry Miller is here thankfully.  Help us to  understand it, director of music business at the NYU Steinhardt School.   We'll get on to the obsession with streaming numbers in a moment.</p><p> But being weird to surprisingly release your own material on your own  streaming service that you've got an interest in and then given away to the  competition the next day. </p><p> LARRY MILLER, DIRECTOR OF MUSIC BUSINESS, NYU STEINHARDT SCHOOL:  Well,  true enough.  And if we go back to not so long ago when \"Lemonade\" dropped,  of course that dropped on an \"Hbo\" special, but it was also exclusively  available on Tidal for a short period of time. </p><p> [16:40:00] QUEST:  It was exclusive for a day. </p><p> MILLER:  Yes, right, that's very short. </p><p> QUEST:  That's very short. </p><p> MILLER:  That's very short indeed.  But I think that streaming has evolved  and the music industry has evolved and Spotify have about $180 million  subscribers and Apple have another $40 million or so, and Amazon have many  and there are other places people go to stream music.</p><p> QUEST:  Right, but if you are Beyonce and Jay z, you're not worried about  the money necessarily. </p><p> MILLER:  Right.  </p><p> QUEST:  And if you are committed to your Tidal streaming service, you're  prepared to take the punishment that will come by insisting it's only  there.  So why give it away? </p><p> MILLER:  Well, it's important to be where the eyeballs are and air balls  are.  And any artist wants to be able to gather attention around their  latest music -- </p><p> QUEST:  But you can't have both, Larry, you can't -- I mean, what I'm  trying to say is it suggests a lack of commitment to Tidal that they would  have done it so quickly -- </p><p> MILLER:  Well -- </p><p> QUEST:  Not even seven days. </p><p> MILLER:  Right, not even seven days.  And so in today's tension economy,  who knows what we'll be thinking about a week from now.  And so right now,  while attention is riveted on Beyonce and Jay z and that amazing video they  chose to make some music available a day later. </p><p> QUEST:  The louver, they got access to the louver -- </p><p> MILLER:  Amazing -- </p><p> QUEST:  For this video which is extraordinary, which is gratifying in a  sense to see the amount of money and the amount of effort and care on  production values that are put into these, some things, even though sort of  extreme things as you say, here today, gone tomorrow. </p><p> MILLER:  Fair enough, and so it's incumbent upon artists and the people who  they work with today to be able to drive attention by releasing music and  video and other things in other to maintain attention for as long as  possible.</p><p> QUEST:  OK, so as to Beyonce's somewhat vulgar references to streaming and  let me -- and then Spotify, you're right, it's a numbers game.  I mean, I'm  glad you're -- we've got -- the music business expert here, it's a numbers  game and Spotify has got the numbers, 175 million. </p><p> MILLER:  It is. </p><p> QUEST:  Right, as anybody else, I mean, if you want to be heard, you've got  to go there. </p><p> MILLER:  Yes, you need to be aware that people are and let's not forget,  they are in the middle of what I believe is a gigantic sold-out stadium -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> MILLER:  For -- they just finished playing in the big football stadium in  London -- </p><p> QUEST:  They did, Wembley.  Quick final question, can we say that Spotify  is now too big to fail? </p><p> MILLER:  I think it's hard to say in this day and age whether anything  really is too big to fail, but they are the leader in a growing and super  important segment of the music business that now accounts for two-thirds of  the revenue in the country. </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you sir, thank you. </p><p> MILLER:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p> QUEST:  As we continue tonight, you want to stay on top of the day's  business news and headlines in just 90 seconds and try our daily briefing  podcast, it's updated twice a day before and after the bell rings on Wall  Street, (INAUDIBLE) or Google for CNN flash briefing, just try it, see what  you get, and if it doesn't work, e-mail me.</p><p> When we return, Britain's Brexit blues are starting a report, claims the  U.K. is about to see its lowest growth if the financial crisis and things  aren't going to get much better any time soon. </p><p> [16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  So in the pubs of London where it is still time to get the last  order of drinks, and I suspect the England victory is dominating, but once  the thrilling World Cup win sort of dissipates, the U.K. will come back to  earth.</p><p> The British Chamber of Commerce is now predicting it will be the weakest  year of growth for the U.K. economy in almost a decade.  Adam Marshall is  the Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, good to see you,  Adam, thank you for taking time tonight. </p><p> I hope you saw the final results, you saw the game before popping into  Australia's to join us.  But it is sobering, your numbers, I mean, it  doesn't show complete collapse of destitution, but it does show sub-par  growth for the foreseeable future.</p><p> ADAM MARSHALL, DIRECTOR GENERAL, BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE:  I think  that's right, Richard, we are looking at about 1.3 percent growth this  year, 1.4 next year and 1.6 in 2020.  Those are not the sorts of numbers  that really blow the doors off when it comes to a major advanced economy. </p><p> And I think what we'd like to see is two things, one obviously, firms want  to see clarity on Brexit as that debate rumbles on terminally.  And I think  in the U.K., there's also a sense that we have other things to get on with  as well to make conditions great for business.</p><p> And there's quite -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> MARSHALL:  A lot that the government needs to do here at home as well. </p><p> QUEST:  Is there -- is this lone number, is it predicated on the  uncertainty on what happens or is there a general view now within the BCC  and you're an economist, that whatever happens immediately after Brexit,  growth will be lower, even in best case scenario, the U.K. will not be as  well off as it was within the EU. </p><p> MARSHALL:  Well, the U.K. will certainly see slower growth that it might  have done had the country not gone down this route at least in the very  short term, that is what we are forecasting.  But I think there are some  other factors that work here as well. </p><p> Obviously, some of the global trade skirmishes that we've been seeing in  recent weeks, unsettled businesses here in the U.K. about their future  prospects.  So anything that happens between the U.S. and China for  example, they may sneeze but the U.K. may very well catch cold as well.</p><p> Same thing about input prices and oil prices -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> MARSHALL:  Which have been going up for a lot of U.K. companies too. </p><p> QUEST:  And on this question of future growth, obviously, you would have  preferred -- I mean, I know the BCC, it would have preferred a single  market access.  But if you can't get single market access, what is your  preferred option for Customs Union and the way forward especially now we  seem to be at that essential moment when the negotiation has to decide  which way to go. </p><p> MARSHALL:  Well, our firms are not much interested in the chronology(ph)  about this.  They see a lot of labels around Customs Union and single  market.  And what they say to us is they want answers on practical  questions.  Who do I pay tax to? Who can I hire? How long can they stay in  my business? </p><p>Who is my regulator going to be? And those sorts of practical questions are  what really are driving a lot of business considerations around this.  You  could call the rapport(ph), whatever you want to, but businesses want  clarity on their trading conditions and they need to see that with some  urgency over the next few months. </p><p> QUEST:  OK, so we've had the white paper recently from the -- well, we had  the agreement back in March, we've had a white paper, we've got the current  disarray one might arguably say in parliament.  You just saw today  obviously, that the lords says -- once again voted that it should take  primacy if there's no deal. </p><p> Something that the Commons is going to have to look back at.  I mean, yes,  I guess I'm taking you into the chronology of the Brexit process and what  you're telling me is it's not very helpful. </p><p> MARSHALL:  It's not, in fact, a lot of firms around the country who say  look, they're watching and waiting, but what they need is something  concrete upon which they can act -- </p><p> QUEST:  They're not going to get it I think --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> I've got news for you, that's exactly -- I mean, and that's the dirty  secret here isn't it? They're not going to get it and even once the  agreement is signed, there's still going to be a level of uncertainty that  will be damaging to your members.  Can you accept that? </p><p> MARSHALL:  No, I think businesses know that there's going to be uncertainty  for some time to come, a very few pundits have said to us, well, once you  negotiate with the European Union, you negotiate with the European Union  forever. </p><p> It's very likely to be the case that those negotiations will be ongoing for  a long time.  But businesses do need a degree of certainty here, Richard,  they do need something to work off of, and I think their biggest dismay,  their biggest opprobrium is actually for the U.K. politicians, they can't  agree on a route forward to go into that negotiating room.</p><p> [16:50:00] Because what we know in business is you go into a negotiation  with a clear position and that's what we need our government to do.</p><p> QUEST:  Right, let's just talk about these, the strength at the moment of  the U.K. economy.  All right, unemployment is down and there could be a  labor shortage, but wage inflation is starting to pick up again.  Now, the  Bank of England would like to start raising rates because inflation has  started to move up, but it can't because of their -- I mean, all roads lead  back to Brexit because of the uncertainty. </p><p> But the economy itself is fundamentally robust. </p><p> MARSHALL:  Yes, there's some strength in the economy, it's been threading  water though as the way we like to put it.  It's not sinking, but it is  threading water.  We're not seeing the kind of growth we'd want to see.</p><p> These are the interest rates we're forecasting one rise over the coming  months and perhaps one more in the period until 2020.  But even the window  for those minimal source of rise to 75 or a 100 basis points is starting to  close.  Because as you rightly say, uncertainty is going to mean the bank  is going to want to keep conditions as smooth as possible for business.</p><p> So we don't see a very strong case for significant rate rises in the near  future.</p><p> QUEST:  You'll forgive me if I don't say I'm sorry to hear that, I mean,  got a U.K. mortgage, I'm rather glad that it might be a little bit longer  to enjoy the good times, good to see you sir, thank you. </p><p> MARSHALL:  And you, Richard.</p><p> QUEST:  We'll talk more about this in detail as the process goes on, good  to have you.  The games industry is taking in $100 billion, that's right,  $100 billion a year.  The World Health Organization is now warning it could  be triggering(ph) a new public health concern. </p><p> It's called gaming disorder and it's just been listed as a mental health  condition.  It describes compulsive players who just plays from similar to  those of gambling addicts.  The WHO says it applies to behavior lasting 12  months or more.</p><p> Joining me now is the co-founder of a rehab center for internet and video  gaming addiction is Hilarie Cash, she joins me from reSTART which is live  from Seattle in Washington.  Were you surprised that it's taken so long to  get the WHO to recognize gaming as a gaming disorder. </p><p> HILARIE CASH, CO-FOUNDER, RESTART:  Not really, I -- you know, this whole  phenomenon has taken the world by storm and actually moving very quickly.   And research, you know, they're going to make their decisions based on the  research findings.  And research is by its nature rather slow. </p><p> So I think it's not -- but I think I'm just glad it's finally here. </p><p> QUEST:  What are the symptoms of gaming disorder? How does somebody  recognize when they've got it? </p><p> CASH:  I think the best way to think about it is that when you are out of  control and you are gaming in spite of its negative consequences, you've  got a problem.</p><p> QUEST:  And the treatment for it, how far does it accord to the other  traditional addictions? Obviously, drugs, alcohol, gambling, overspending,  all the others.  Does it follow the same model for treatment, whether it'd  be the 12-step model or otherwise? </p><p> CASH:  Well, I can tell you that our model of treatment is to be very  holistic in what we're trying to do.  So we are -- the adults as well as  the adolescents tries spending at least two months free of all screens, and  the idea is that they need that time to -- for their brains to come back to  normal functioning, they need that time to get their health back, they  usually are chronically sleep deprived, unfit and they've been eating very  poorly for a long time. </p><p> So they're getting their health back, they're developing skills that they  really are going to need if they're going to be functional young adults.   And they're getting a plan together for how they're going to abuse digital  technology again in a sustainable and healthy way. </p><p> After that two months period, there's been if they choose and about 80  percent of them do choose, you go on to the second phase of the program,  that's the phase where they're now for the adults living in apartments  together in -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> CASH:  In small groups, they're getting part-time work and they're just  starting to live life like adults need to live life -- </p><p> QUEST:  OK, so final question, with the other addictions, alcohol, drugs  and the like, the general view is total abstinence.  What is too many, a  thousand, never enough.  With gaming addiction or gaming disorder, do you  believe that you can't do it at all or do you believe there's a manageable  way you can do it. </p><p> CASH:  Well, I think there's a manageable way you can use a digital  technology.  </p><p> [16:55:00] I think if you're gaming addict, you're really getting on thin  ice if you try to go back to gaming and chances are very high that you will  relapse.  So we ask the guys when they come into program and are developing  what we call the life balance friend -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> CASH:  To think through -- what are their bottom lines and those bottom  lines almost always are going to include video games. </p><p> QUEST:  Good to talk to you, thank you, I appreciate your time tonight,  thank you.  We will have a different profitable moment after the break,  this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS live from New York. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, it is lovely in an era where we are  talking about the misery and mayhem that we're able to turn our attention  to something much more pleasant.  Weddings within the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS  team who makes no apology for showing you the very best that we have got. </p><p> Our senior producer John and his new bride Ali(ph), yes, that's the two at  the front, and the rest are the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS team that all sort of  -- I think the director summed it up rather well.  I think -- well, she  says you all scrubbed up rather nicely over the weekend. </p><p> And our technical director Rick Flair(ph) and his new wife Emily, yes, they  also scrubbed up rather nicely on the way to and from their ceremony.  So  we take this opportunity because it's only right and proper that we  remember this program that we bring to you every night with love and  privilege is made by people behind the cameras and they actually put it  together. </p><p> And today, four of them have enjoyed weddings.  And that is QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York.  Whatever you're up  to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.  Congratulations to all my  colleagues. </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It has pulled up quite considerably from the  opening of force, but PSE giving the closing bell.  So, we have got one  wimpy one and one okay one, but trading is over.  It is Monday, 18th of  June.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tonight, two weeks to save her coalition.  German stocks down heavily after  Angela Merkel gets an ultimatum from her own partners.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Audi's Chief Executive is under arrest.  Dieselgate is rumbling on and  Beyonce's new album has some shade for Spotify.  You can hear it now,  ironically, not exclusively on Spotify.  </p><p> I am Richard Quest, live from the world's financial capital, New York City  where it's mixing hot here, but where I still mean business.  </p><p> Good evening, Angela Merkel is facing a moment of reckoning.  She is being  given two weeks to save her coalition and resolve the immigration debate  that threatens to bring down Germany's fragile government.  </p><p> The Chancellor has been given an ultimatum -- overhaul Germany's migration  policies or face a new rebellion from coalition partners.  Facing his own  migration debate in the United States, President Trump seized on Mrs.  Merkel's position to launch an attack on Twitter.  He claims the migration  issue has caused the people of Germany to turn against their leader.   Investors seem concerned by the political turmoil.  </p><p> The Xetra DAX fell one percent on Monday, markets are unlikely to be  soothed by the words of the Chancellor's chief antagonist.  The CDU's party  leader warns the crisis won't be over any time soon.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> HORST SEEHOFER, FEDERAL MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR:  (Through an  interpreter).  It is ridiculous to say now to determine public that is all  about those two weeks and then after that, it will all be wonderful.  </p><p> I repeated it to the Board gathered today.  I warn you that we are not out  of the woods yet, not at all.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Atika Shubert joins me now with the latest from Berlin.  Two weeks  -- now before we get to what happens in that two weeks, let's first of all  analyze the compromise that she has agreed to just to get the breathing  space for a proper negotiation.  </p><p> ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, well,  basically, you heard there from Horst Seehofer that of course is the  Interior Minister.  He is also the leader of the Bavaria sister party, the  Christian Social Union and he was threatening to essentially break up the  coalition government unless he was allowed to unveil the 63-point plan to  reduce migration, specifically, he wanted to reject the asylum seekers at  the border if they had already applied for asylum in other EU countries,  and that is where Merkel drew the line.  </p><p> She said, \"Listen, I can't accept that one point in your plan.  Give me two  weeks to find an alternate solution by brokering bilateral agreements.\"   And that is where we stand now.  So, she has to try and figure out those  deals with other EU nations come back on July 1st, report back to her party  and say, \"This is how I have resolved it.\"  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, but what is the core issue here?  I mean, I know it is  complex that she has to do it, but the agreement to allow for instance  migrants to stay in the country where they have arrived.  What is the  difference between her and her coalition partner?  </p><p> SHUBERT:  Well, the difference is essentially that of as you know, in the  EU, if you're applying for asylum, you're supposed to apply in the country  where you enter.  Unfortunately, this means that you get a disproportionate  number of asylum seekers in Italy, Greece and those external countries.  </p><p>Germany did take in about a million refugees during the 2015 crisis and  that as far as Seehofer and Merkel's critics are concerned is too many.   So, what they want to do is reduce the number by then saying, \"If you've  already applied in Italy, Greece or somewhere else, you can't come here to  Germany.\"  And then push them back.  </p><p> Now, Merkel is saying that's a violation of the EU principle of freedom of  movement and that Germany can't do that automatically.  It needs to broker  some sort of a deal if not with all of the EU, then bilateral agreements  with different EU partners.  That's the difference there.  </p><p> So, she has basically bought herself some time to try and broker those  agreements, and maybe stave off any political crisis at home.  </p><p> QUEST:  Is it likely though that the CSU would promote this to a full blown  crisis to the point where it would endanger the coalition and Merkel's  position?  </p><p> SHUBERT:  Well, that's the key question.  I mean, the CSU is looking at  Bavaria local elections in October, that's probably one reason they have  taken this up a notch to such high drama, but the reality is, if they broke  up the coalition, then the CDU, the Christian Democrats could field their  own candidates in Bavaria and it could end up hurting the CSU in the long  run.  </p><p> [16:05:12]  </p><p> SHUBERT:  Also, as much as the general public wants to see tougher  immigration laws, they don't want to see another round of elections coming  up.  So, it could work out that the CSU says, \"Listen, we have proven our  point, now we will just back down,\" but we'll know better in about two  weeks, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  Atika Shubert in Berlin.  Elmar Brok is a member of the European  Parliament -- Parliament of the House and a close ally of Chancellor  Merkel, joins me now from Verl in Germany.  Good to see you, sir.  Thank  you.  </p><p> How likely is it how that a solution can be found in the two weeks  breathing speace that Chancellor Merkel has been given, bearing in mind,  she is going to have to get a green light from the other parties, the other  countries in Europe?  </p><p> ELMAR BROK, MEMBER, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:  Look at the party (ph) this  morning and there was a very strong support from all the leaders of our  party and the thing she was pressing (ph), that was the European solution.   And (ph) now that per month, 95 percent less migration in (ph) countries  than we had October 2015.  The great success story and many other measures  were taken, and here is a small question around -- around France about was  the close with their regional elections and I believe that that (inaudible)  and Mrs. Merkel will talk to the neighboring countries because she says if  she does not do that without an agreement with our neighboring countries,  we will (ph) -- these measures will have no effect.  </p><p> QUEST:  All right, is in your view -- I mean, it may not be nice or  pleasant to say this, but is the German coalition in danger over this  issue?  </p><p> BROK:  Look, you can never know how far people go, but (inaudible) on that  with interest (inaudible) breakdown, nothing would be delivered.  And also  about (inaudible) success (inaudible) for the elections.  The only  (inaudible) would be the (inaudible) party and therefore, I believe that if  some things were to be pushed forward, but that at the end of the day,  government will stable (inaudible) of the Bavaria Party in their own  elections.  </p><p> QUEST:  Elmar Brok, thank you.  We will keep it short because we have a  poor connection tonight, so we will talk to you hopefully again in the  future about this, but thank you for joining us in this evening.  </p><p> Now, we say with Germany, there was no shortage of drama in the country  today after authorities arrested the Chief Executive of Audi, one of the  country's biggest auto makers.  Rupert Stadler was taken into custody.   Investigators are worried he could influence witnesses related to the  emission scandal.  </p><p> Shares in Audi's parent company, Volkswagen, which has already paid tens of  billions of Euros in fines and fees because of the emission scandal fell  sharply on the news.  Anna Stewart is in London.  What's he been arrested  for?  </p><p> ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  So, this is an investigation, a criminal  investigation of Audi and it involves the alleged fraud by some 20 former  and current employees and one of those is Rupert Stadler.  He is being  investigated.  </p><p> Now, he was arrested, Richard.  He is being detained because of the risk of  evidence tampering or influencing other witnesses, other managers from Audi  over the scandal, so that is why he is being detained today.  </p><p> We knew that his apartment was raided last week and today, the Volkswagen  supervisory board were meeting to discuss this amongst other things, so  everyone is on tenterhooks wondering whether or not he will be forced to  tender his resignation.  </p><p> QUEST:  Okay, so let's be clear about this, the emissions scandal related  to Volkswagen cars, where does the emission scandal fit into the whole Audi  question?  </p><p> STEWART:  Well, Audi as a subsidiary of BW is also part of the emissions  diesel scandal.  It also had cars that were fitted with cheating devices  like Volkswagen, but there is a separate investigation that has also linked  Volkswagen and watched those CEOs and managers know.  </p><p> What they want to know here, Richard is who knew what when and what did  they do about it?  Was it transparent?  Many shareholders have brought this  up in separate lawsuits.  I mean, there are numerous lawsuits around this  saying there wasn't enough transparency from the Board on how big the  liabilities would be.  </p><p> As you said, tens of billions of dollars.  </p><p> QUEST:  All right, so that's already been paid, but the moment somebody  gets locked up and I am trying to remember how many of the people have been  locked up in this case, and I am not sure there have been any, but the  moment somebody gets locked up on allegation of -- or potential allegation  of witness tampering, then we're moving into a different area, a much more  serious area of criminality in that sense.  </p><p> STEWART:  Absolutely, I think it would be much harder to really dodge this  bullet as a CEO.  The Board has been incredibly supportive of Rupert  Stadler throughout, his being in the company since 1990, and he has faced  many calls for his resignation over the last couple of years.  </p><p> [00:05:12]  </p><p> STEWART:  Particularly, actually from minority shareholders, but the Board  has supported him every step of the way, and actually last year, despite  what he has caused, they actually extended his contract by five years.  </p><p> But as you say, bringing someone under arrest changes the story entirely,  so everyone is watching to see what will happen in the next sort of 12  hours.  </p><p> QUEST:  Anna Stewart, thank you for putting that clearly into perspective  for us.  Thank you.  </p><p> Now, stocks are down almost everywhere you choose to look.  In fact, there  was -- the Dow opened lower and although it recovered, it really was a  fairly sharp fall.  Look at the grid and you will see.  The Dow was off in  its worse point down about 260 to 270 points, so it did come back quite a  lot.  </p><p> But still close of 133 and failed to hold the 25,000 mark.  Similarly,  losses -- percentage-wise, much less for the NASDAQ and indeed, the fan  stocks for most of the day were actually higher.  But, that misery could be  seen of what we saw or we had just been talking about, not only with Angela  Merkel, but Audi can certainly be seen here with the Xetra DAX which is off  1.3 percent and indeed, over the whole market, if you look at the global  markets, you've got the US, you've got Europe, you've got Asia.  </p><p> It was the Xetra DAX, which is the one that has the biggest fallout, the  political fallout for Angela Merkel.  US stocks were also lower, it's the  trade wars that were worrying those.  Paul La Monica is with us.  And Paul,  as we look at this graph over here, we can see clearly, we were down about  252 to 260 odd points at the open.  I mean, there were several attempts to  claw back but the day was still down quite sharply.  </p><p> PAUL LA MONICA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, we couldn't get there.  We  obviously still had a triple digit loss and this is a similar pattern what  happened on Friday.  It looked as if the market was really going to fall  very sharply, things looked very bleak and then we recovered by the end of  the day.  </p><p> I am getting sense from talking to people that there still is nervousness  obviously about a potential trade war with China and just about every other  major country in the world -- with them and the US, but no one seems to be  panicking yet.  I think there is still this notion that the cooler heads  may eventually prevail, that this is just tough bluster by President Trump  et cetera.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, so there was an article in \"The Times\" over the weekend that  basically said, in the business section, why the trade war everybody is  saying Armageddon is dreadful, it will be awful, but there is no evidence  of that in the market.  </p><p> And Peter Tuchman at the exchange was saying to me today, look, there is  not the evidence of it yet in the market because the economy is strong.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  The economy is still strong, Richard.  Earnings growth for the  second quarter is expected to be extremely robust.  There's talk about  analysts projecting almost 20 percent profit growth year over year.  The  question is going to be when do companies start talking about the  nervousness coming into play for the rest of this year and next year.  </p><p> You've got the Atlanta Fed, President Raphael Bostic making a speech today  where he talked about how earlier this year, he was incredibly optimistic  because of the tax cuts, and now he is getting a sense that he is a little  bit more worried about the environment going forward because people are  telling him that yes, all of these trade bluster could have an impact on  their profits going forward.  </p><p> People are going to be a little bit more skittish.  They may not buy as  much as stuff, both corporations and consumers and I think that's a  legitimate concern going forward.  </p><p> QUEST:  It's interesting when we look at it.  It's good to see -- didn't  you say, as we look at the market, it has tried to rally, and it did to a  certain extent, but could not do it.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  At least not for the Dow, but the NASDAQ did finish positive.   You've got people still loving those companies like Facebook and Google and  Netflix, Amazon.  They seem to be resistant to all of these macro concerns.  </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you.  Thank you.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Thank you.  </p><p> QUEST:  When we return, President Trump is looking beyond his borders with  dominance and out into the universe -- we will look for his plans for a  Space Force, what that actually means, and Jay-Z and Beyonce remind the  world they have their own streaming service and then promptly, we get all  the results upon arrival.  Go figure.  </p><p> [16:15:00]  </p><p> QUEST:  Now, I do need to just correct one or two minor matters.  We showed  you all the market numbers earlier, and I am afraid, I think that the  machine must have frozen.  The top line, the US market shows the Dow, we  had it down 113 points, it's not 103 at the close, but the important thing  which Paul La Monica quite rightly points out, the NASDAQ actually did eke  out a small gain for the session.  </p><p> So, just to correct.  In case you were a little bit concerned that it  didn't look like we've got it exactly right.  We didn't get it right, but  we have got it right now.  </p><p> Google is betting a half a million dollars on China and that's despite  Google being blocked mostly by Beijing.  Clare Sebastian is here.  Who are  they buying and how much?  </p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  They are buying just under 1 percent  of jd.com for $550 million in cash, Richard, so obviously, this is a big  foray into China for Google.  They have basically not been operating in  terms of their search maps, e-mails, YouTube entirely since 2010, but  clearly, they haven't given up on the country.  </p><p> We have seen little moves in this direction.  They have got two apps in the  country.  They have got translation and they have got file management.   They have visiting since -- which I was there back in November.  They have  opened an AI center there, so I think this is more of the same  (inaudible)...  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> QUEST:  Remind us why they are not there as Google.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Right, because of the Chinese's government's laws on  censorship.  They basically couldn't comply ethically with the rules there  and they left in 2010.  </p><p> QUEST:  And they pulled out.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  They pulled out despite the fact that there are 730 million  Internet users in China, Richard, more than twice the US's entire  population, they still pulled out.  But this is something they kind of  ignored -- the size and scale of this market.  But it is important for  jd.com as well.  </p><p> QUEST:  Why?  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Because jd.com just like Alibaba, you've seen them you know,  doing road shows in the US and beyond.  They want to expand outside of  China, that's really important for them because the market there, even  though it is huge isn't growing at the same rate as it was.  So, there is  room for growth.  It seems to be international, South East Asia, Europe,  the US -- all of these areas jd.com will be able to access through the  steel.  Its products will be on Google Shopping and there are more what  they call retail solutions on the guard...  </p><p> QUEST:  But what does jd.com do in the EU?  We think of jd.com like  Alibaba, as just being China's version of Amazon?  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Actually, jd.com is even more China's version of Amazon and  Alibaba is because it has the logistics network.  I've got a video I think  of one of their fully automated warehouses.  They do what Amazon does.   They have their own logistics there.  They do two-hour delivery in 50-plus  cities around China.  </p><p> So, they really do the kind of -- the supply chain that is crucial to e- commerce, and I think that's what Google is so interested in here.  They  haven't cracked the e-commerce yet.  </p><p> QUEST:  Thanks.  Good.  Thank you.  Clare Sebastian.  Big tech firms like  Google aren't the only ones working in this more complex environment.  John  Stankey, the new head of our parent company, WarnerMedia tells \"New Day\"  that everything in the entire economy is more difficult now.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p> JOHN STANKEY, CEO, WARNERMEDIA:  I think everything in the industry right  now is probably more complex and more difficult than it has ever been, and  I think if you were sitting over at Facebook today and asking about what  it's like to run their business, the transparency dynamic that any company  has to run under and the volatility that it brings in the decision making,  that's just part of industry today and I don't think it's unique to our  circumstances.  I think it's just broad scale across the economy right now.  </p><p> ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN HOST:  So, for all of our viewers who are watching,  they want to know what this means for them, are there costs going up?  What  else -- how will this affect them?  </p><p> STANKEY:  Contrary to what the government alleged, no.  Our goal here is  actually to innovate on product and you know, for me, personally, why I am  excited to be here, I have always been happiest in my career when I get to  build things and do unique things and do things that are different.  </p><p> And our goal here is to invest in this business and our goal is to do it in  a way that provides for platforms and capabilities that are consistent with  where technology is taking things.  And you know, a classic example might  be here at CNN.  </p><p> [16:20:11]  </p><p> STANKEY:  How can we broaden the distribution of the great content you guys  build every day?  How can we make it more readily available and the push  lifestyle that everybody leads and I think there are some very exciting  things to do in that regard.  </p><p> So, it's about innovating, it's about building new product, it's about  investing heavier in content.  It's certainly not about going out and just  trying to think about we want to raise prices on content for what other  people buy.  </p><p> BRIAN STELTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  I think that's interesting because there  have been some concerns in the cable industry that we are in a period of  decline or shrinkage as opposed to growth and investment?  And you're  saying in places like HBO, there is more money that should be spent?  </p><p> STANKEY:  Look, I think that the model as we know it today, you know,  standard linear television is a very immature model.  Standard linear  television in the form how ads are supported in it.  </p><p> But there is an opportunity to innovate in that regard, not only with how  the content is configured, but to think about how advertising supports that  content, and that's why we established the advertising entity with an AT&amp;T  that is being led by Brian Lesser.  </p><p> The purpose of that is to start building the new ad formats and the more  targeted advertising.  They can lower ad loads and still monetize content  the way where it remains affordable for the customer.  </p><p> So, that's the kind of innovation we are going to be working on.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> QUEST:  Thank you.  The CEO of Warner Media, my boss.  President Trump has  ordered the creation of a Space Force, calling it the sixth branch of the  Armed Forces.  Now, the appropriate name, Barbara Starr, joins me from the  Pentagon.  </p><p> All right, a Space Force will do what?  </p><p> BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  I haven't actually thought  about that, Richard, until you mentioned it.  Well, you know, I thought I  would try not to make the \"Star Wars,\" \"Star Trek,\" \"Battlestar Galactica\"  jokes, but let me have a go at it.  </p><p> I mean, you know, this is not a brand new idea.  It's something the  Pentagon has long been involved in and trying to make sure that its  satellites in space, the things that it relies in for war fighting are safe  and secure from adversaries, and that the US can dominate in space.  </p><p> So, we already know that some parts of the military pay an awful lot of  attention to this, especially the US Air Force.  </p><p> The President has for some time now talked about he wants a separate Space  Force.  Not getting total support from the Pentagon about all of that  because there is a lot of worry, it's just going to wind up being more  bureaucracy, but here is a bit of today when the President announced this,  a bit of his vision from the White House.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This time, we will do more  than plant our flag and leave our footprints, we will establish a long term  presence, expand our economy and build the foundation for the eventual  mission to Mars, which is actually going to happen very quickly.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> STARR:  Well, going to Mars quickly, we will see, as with all things in the  United States government.  It is going to depend on Congress' funding all  of these ideas that the President has, but let's look at a very practical  task ahead.  One of the biggest things in space for the US military for  example is to make sure its GPS satellites -- global positioning satellites  -- are always safe and secure because if you have an adversary trying to  take those out somehow with some sort of attack, that would not just  devastate US war fighting capabilities around the world, it would devastate  communications around the world.  </p><p> So, it gives you an idea of how much it is a problem, how much it is an  issue, but is the President's solution the one that Pentagon wants, not  exactly clear just yet that it is, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  Okay, so Barbara, with all of this, I guess, you know for a  President that loves hype, obviously this has been in the works for some  time, what is that gap between hype and reality to fruition and execution?  </p><p> STARR:  Well, for people, for top commanders in the US military, their  question starts with if there is something out there that we are not doing  to defend and protect Americans in that space environment, is there  something more we should be doing?  </p><p> A lot of money, time and attention is being paid to the very question --  advanced defensive capabilities, defensive information attacks all of that,  the key question I think, Richard, Congress wants to see something happen,  but there may be a very limited appetite for an entire new branch of the US  military.  </p><p> QUEST:  Our own shining star bright and comets skating and great to tell us  the story, Barbara, good to see you as always, thank you.  </p><p> STARR:  Thanks.  </p><p> QUEST:  Barbara Starr at the Pentagon.  Now, from space to slightly at  lower altitude, but we all get to fly anyway where Lufthansa, now, we know  Norwegian has received already two bids and rejected them from IAG -- the  owners of BA et cetera.  </p><p> [16:25:16]  </p><p> QUEST:  Lufthansa is reporting they have now been in contact with Norwegian  Air Shuttle as well.  So, you have Lufthansa and British Airways and IAG  interested in buying Europe's third biggest aircraft low cost group.  Both  have budget players in play.  </p><p> I wanted to look at the destination board and we are going to show you  exactly why this is so fascinating because if you look for example at what  Lufthansa already owns at the moment, you will see the complexity.  </p><p> Now, you've obviously got in the Lufthansa group, Lufthansa the German,  Swiss the Swiss Airline, you've got CityLine which is the regional;  Edelweiss, the low cost; German Wings and Euro Wings and your Austrian --  they are the main components that Lufthansa already owns within it.  </p><p> It's already got as well minority stakes in the Aerologic and Sun Express,  so Lufthansa on the one side.  Now, you've got AIG and if you look at the  airlines AIG has, you'll see exactly how significant that is going to be.  </p><p> BA, Iberia and Aer Lingus, Vueling and Level, they are the majorities  already that they have got.  They are the big carriers that they have got.   The minority stakes that -- this is the key one, the key one here, there.   Already got 4 percent of Norwegian, nearly 5 percent.  </p><p> So, on the both hands, you have Lufthansa and you have IAG, two of the  largest groups in the world now both seemingly doing battle trying to get  Norwegian.  I can tell you from within the industry, the view is Lufthansa  may just have the upper hand in all of this if Carsten Spohr decides to go  for the full bid, may indeed.  </p><p> But Willie Walsh is not going to give up easily, neither Chief Execs,  neither Spohr, nor Walsh is prepared to overbid for an airline that they  see is already in trouble.  </p><p> We will have more after the break.  </p><p> Hello, I am Richard Quest, there is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a  moment.  When Beyonce and Jay-Z set up for a big weekend on their streaming  service and how title's rivals are catching up and arguably, the two of  them shot themselves in their own fight for bid.  </p><p> And the World Health Organization now shows that video game addiction is  real.  I will speak to the founder of a rehab center for gamers.  As we  continue, you are watching CNN and here, the facts always come first.  </p><p> President Trump is again falsely shaming his political opponents, the  Democrats for his own policy on immigration which resulted in family  separation at the borders.  In remarks earlier today, President Trump said  the US would not become a migrant camp for refugee holding facility.  </p><p> [16:30:16]  Meanwhile, the new CNN poll shows most Republicans approve of  the policies which meant more parents and children being separated at the  border.  Overall, two-thirds of Americans disapprove, the president's  approval rating is now at 39 percent. </p><p> Chancellor Merkel of Germany has been given two weeks to reach an agreement  with the EU on a new immigration policy that both members of our coalition  government can support.  The CSU Party, her partners wants a deal to ban  migrants who have already applied for asylum elsewhere from entering  Germany.</p><p>CSU says if there's no deal, it will unilaterally move forward with the  plan.  In Britain, the Prime Minister Theresa May has suffered a fresh  defeat of her Brexit plans.  The House of Lords voted to give parliament  the final say on what happens in the event her government fails to reach an  exit deal with the EU. </p><p> The legislation is to be debated in the House of Commons on Wednesday.   Croatia's Nikola Kalinic has been sent home from the World Cup after he  refused to come on as a substitute.  The striker said he couldn't play  against Nigeria because of a back problem. </p><p> His coach pointed out he also refused to play during a friendly with Brazil  earlier this month.  A thriller outside of Saint Petersburg where a short  while ago England defeated Tunisia, it's the end of day five in the 2018  World Cup.  After some early missed chances, England's Captain Harry Kane  gave his team an early 1-0 lead, Tunisia leveled it with a penalty, and  that was just before the end of the first half.</p><p> Then as time was draining away, it was Harry Kane again with a dramatic  header -- yes, and to give England the 2-1 victory.  Amanda Davies is in  Moscow -- it's a haunting of a match. </p><p> AMANDA DAVIES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Richard, it was, but it's dangerous  times because England have won their opening match of this World Cup, and  everybody in England has been doing so well in terms of playing down  expectations for this very young, relatively untested England side. </p><p> Now, they've won, you do worry what happens next.  It wasn't the most  convincing performance, it has to be said, but there was some very exciting  moments within the side against a Tunisian team that -- or in their first  World Cup since 2006 and we knew it would sit very deep, defend very deep  in numbers.</p><p> So it was always going to be tough with this England side.  The moment that  you do get excited about is the fact, so in days gone by, a warm one,  England's generally would have settled for that or even worst perhaps  conceded a late goal.</p><p> But these guys kept on pushing, kept going and Harry Kane led by example as  the captain as you said to score the winner in the 91st minute, and you saw  -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> DAVIES:  Just what it meant to him and his manager Gary Southgate, a  massive results early doors. </p><p> QUEST:  Oh, hang on Amanda, it's better to win than lose. </p><p> DAVIES:  Absolutely Richard, but you know, I have been through some downs  and downs.  A little, a few ups.  But more downs as an England -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> DAVIES:  Supporter over the years, and so you know, I am wearing my red  dress, I wore my shirt this morning for breakfast, so we've got to be  realistic about it.  As this is, you know, one of the rare groups, after  this point in the competition has actually gone to plan with the big teams  -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> DAVIES:  Drawing their opening games, Belgium also won earlier today.  So  compared to what we've seen with Brazil, with Argentina, with Germany  losing yesterday, we know that you can't take anything for granted at all  in a World Cup. </p><p> QUEST:  And the beauty of all of this is that the atmosphere is starting to  build.  Whether it'd be the Germany match or even the first match from  Russia and Saudi Arabia right the way through to this match, the atmosphere  is building up as it's supposed to. </p><p> DAVIES:  Yes, it truly is a World Cup.  We're just at the bottom of Red  Square as we've said to you before, and there's a lot of Mexican fans,  there's been some Colombian fans here today.  And remember four years ago,  Richard, you had your flag pole of flags really and you were texting me as  to which flag needed to come out on which day. </p><p> And today, that was really tested, I had a fantastic moment by Saint  Basil's which has been open for the first time after they've taken down all  the stadium from the concert last week.  </p><p> [16:35:00] And there were three fans, there was a Mexican and Argentinean  and a Spaniard having a photo taken. </p><p> And then they saw a Colombian and said, come on over, and then there was a  Peruvian who joined the party and then there was some Moroccan fans who  joined the party and a German and a Swedish fan, and it was really a  fantastic moment in front of Saint Basil's, seeing everybody in their shirt  with their flags and it is what you would hope a World Cup would turn out  to be. </p><p> QUEST:  And be assured, Miss Davies, that your vexillology knowledge will  be required before we are finished, because the flags return, the flags  return when the economic World Cup returns once we get into the knockout  rounds which comes later.</p><p> So you may not rest easy, you'll be up all night studying flags, good to  see you.</p><p> DAVIES:  I will, bye-bye. </p><p> QUEST:  Sorted that out.  Beyonce and Jay-Z say they don't care about the  music industry's obsession with streaming numbers. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> (MUSIC) </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Plenty stuff, there it is, streaming service and the streaming  business, we're going to see -- discuss what it says about the future of  Tidal streaming service.  That they bring out a new album, maybe it's  exclusive to them and then give it to everybody else -- after the break. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Beyonce and Jay z dropped the surprise album over the weekend, it  wasn't expected.  It managed to get the whole world talking about their  streaming service Tidal once again.</p><p> Fans were sent rushing to the app because it was only app -- it was the  only way to hear the album at first.  Now Beyonce and Jay z have given it  to the mega streaming rival Spotify, Apple and Amazon. </p><p> And speaking of Spotify, Beyonce has some choice words about the music  business and its obsession with streaming numbers.  Listen carefully. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> (MUSIC) </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Savory stuff, Larry Miller is here thankfully.  Help us to  understand it, director of music business at the NYU Steinhardt School.   We'll get on to the obsession with streaming numbers in a moment.</p><p> But being weird to surprisingly release your own material on your own  streaming service that you've got an interest in and then given away to the  competition the next day. </p><p> LARRY MILLER, DIRECTOR OF MUSIC BUSINESS, NYU STEINHARDT SCHOOL:  Well,  true enough.  And if we go back to not so long ago when \"Lemonade\" dropped,  of course that dropped on an \"Hbo\" special, but it was also exclusively  available on Tidal for a short period of time. </p><p> [16:40:00] QUEST:  It was exclusive for a day. </p><p> MILLER:  Yes, right, that's very short. </p><p> QUEST:  That's very short. </p><p> MILLER:  That's very short indeed.  But I think that streaming has evolved  and the music industry has evolved and Spotify have about $180 million  subscribers and Apple have another $40 million or so, and Amazon have many  and there are other places people go to stream music.</p><p> QUEST:  Right, but if you are Beyonce and Jay z, you're not worried about  the money necessarily. </p><p> MILLER:  Right.  </p><p> QUEST:  And if you are committed to your Tidal streaming service, you're  prepared to take the punishment that will come by insisting it's only  there.  So why give it away? </p><p> MILLER:  Well, it's important to be where the eyeballs are and air balls  are.  And any artist wants to be able to gather attention around their  latest music -- </p><p> QUEST:  But you can't have both, Larry, you can't -- I mean, what I'm  trying to say is it suggests a lack of commitment to Tidal that they would  have done it so quickly -- </p><p> MILLER:  Well -- </p><p> QUEST:  Not even seven days. </p><p> MILLER:  Right, not even seven days.  And so in today's tension economy,  who knows what we'll be thinking about a week from now.  And so right now,  while attention is riveted on Beyonce and Jay z and that amazing video they  chose to make some music available a day later. </p><p> QUEST:  The louver, they got access to the louver -- </p><p> MILLER:  Amazing -- </p><p> QUEST:  For this video which is extraordinary, which is gratifying in a  sense to see the amount of money and the amount of effort and care on  production values that are put into these, some things, even though sort of  extreme things as you say, here today, gone tomorrow. </p><p> MILLER:  Fair enough, and so it's incumbent upon artists and the people who  they work with today to be able to drive attention by releasing music and  video and other things in other to maintain attention for as long as  possible.</p><p> QUEST:  OK, so as to Beyonce's somewhat vulgar references to streaming and  let me -- and then Spotify, you're right, it's a numbers game.  I mean, I'm  glad you're -- we've got -- the music business expert here, it's a numbers  game and Spotify has got the numbers, 175 million. </p><p> MILLER:  It is. </p><p> QUEST:  Right, as anybody else, I mean, if you want to be heard, you've got  to go there. </p><p> MILLER:  Yes, you need to be aware that people are and let's not forget,  they are in the middle of what I believe is a gigantic sold-out stadium -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> MILLER:  For -- they just finished playing in the big football stadium in  London -- </p><p> QUEST:  They did, Wembley.  Quick final question, can we say that Spotify  is now too big to fail? </p><p> MILLER:  I think it's hard to say in this day and age whether anything  really is too big to fail, but they are the leader in a growing and super  important segment of the music business that now accounts for two-thirds of  the revenue in the country. </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you sir, thank you. </p><p> MILLER:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p> QUEST:  As we continue tonight, you want to stay on top of the day's  business news and headlines in just 90 seconds and try our daily briefing  podcast, it's updated twice a day before and after the bell rings on Wall  Street, (INAUDIBLE) or Google for CNN flash briefing, just try it, see what  you get, and if it doesn't work, e-mail me.</p><p> When we return, Britain's Brexit blues are starting a report, claims the  U.K. is about to see its lowest growth if the financial crisis and things  aren't going to get much better any time soon. </p><p> [16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  So in the pubs of London where it is still time to get the last  order of drinks, and I suspect the England victory is dominating, but once  the thrilling World Cup win sort of dissipates, the U.K. will come back to  earth.</p><p> The British Chamber of Commerce is now predicting it will be the weakest  year of growth for the U.K. economy in almost a decade.  Adam Marshall is  the Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, good to see you,  Adam, thank you for taking time tonight. </p><p> I hope you saw the final results, you saw the game before popping into  Australia's to join us.  But it is sobering, your numbers, I mean, it  doesn't show complete collapse of destitution, but it does show sub-par  growth for the foreseeable future.</p><p> ADAM MARSHALL, DIRECTOR GENERAL, BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE:  I think  that's right, Richard, we are looking at about 1.3 percent growth this  year, 1.4 next year and 1.6 in 2020.  Those are not the sorts of numbers  that really blow the doors off when it comes to a major advanced economy. </p><p> And I think what we'd like to see is two things, one obviously, firms want  to see clarity on Brexit as that debate rumbles on terminally.  And I think  in the U.K., there's also a sense that we have other things to get on with  as well to make conditions great for business.</p><p> And there's quite -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> MARSHALL:  A lot that the government needs to do here at home as well. </p><p> QUEST:  Is there -- is this lone number, is it predicated on the  uncertainty on what happens or is there a general view now within the BCC  and you're an economist, that whatever happens immediately after Brexit,  growth will be lower, even in best case scenario, the U.K. will not be as  well off as it was within the EU. </p><p> MARSHALL:  Well, the U.K. will certainly see slower growth that it might  have done had the country not gone down this route at least in the very  short term, that is what we are forecasting.  But I think there are some  other factors that work here as well. </p><p> Obviously, some of the global trade skirmishes that we've been seeing in  recent weeks, unsettled businesses here in the U.K. about their future  prospects.  So anything that happens between the U.S. and China for  example, they may sneeze but the U.K. may very well catch cold as well.</p><p> Same thing about input prices and oil prices -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> MARSHALL:  Which have been going up for a lot of U.K. companies too. </p><p> QUEST:  And on this question of future growth, obviously, you would have  preferred -- I mean, I know the BCC, it would have preferred a single  market access.  But if you can't get single market access, what is your  preferred option for Customs Union and the way forward especially now we  seem to be at that essential moment when the negotiation has to decide  which way to go. </p><p> MARSHALL:  Well, our firms are not much interested in the chronology(ph)  about this.  They see a lot of labels around Customs Union and single  market.  And what they say to us is they want answers on practical  questions.  Who do I pay tax to? Who can I hire? How long can they stay in  my business? </p><p>Who is my regulator going to be? And those sorts of practical questions are  what really are driving a lot of business considerations around this.  You  could call the rapport(ph), whatever you want to, but businesses want  clarity on their trading conditions and they need to see that with some  urgency over the next few months. </p><p> QUEST:  OK, so we've had the white paper recently from the -- well, we had  the agreement back in March, we've had a white paper, we've got the current  disarray one might arguably say in parliament.  You just saw today  obviously, that the lords says -- once again voted that it should take  primacy if there's no deal. </p><p> Something that the Commons is going to have to look back at.  I mean, yes,  I guess I'm taking you into the chronology of the Brexit process and what  you're telling me is it's not very helpful. </p><p> MARSHALL:  It's not, in fact, a lot of firms around the country who say  look, they're watching and waiting, but what they need is something  concrete upon which they can act -- </p><p> QUEST:  They're not going to get it I think --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> I've got news for you, that's exactly -- I mean, and that's the dirty  secret here isn't it? They're not going to get it and even once the  agreement is signed, there's still going to be a level of uncertainty that  will be damaging to your members.  Can you accept that? </p><p> MARSHALL:  No, I think businesses know that there's going to be uncertainty  for some time to come, a very few pundits have said to us, well, once you  negotiate with the European Union, you negotiate with the European Union  forever. </p><p> It's very likely to be the case that those negotiations will be ongoing for  a long time.  But businesses do need a degree of certainty here, Richard,  they do need something to work off of, and I think their biggest dismay,  their biggest opprobrium is actually for the U.K. politicians, they can't  agree on a route forward to go into that negotiating room.</p><p> [16:50:00] Because what we know in business is you go into a negotiation  with a clear position and that's what we need our government to do.</p><p> QUEST:  Right, let's just talk about these, the strength at the moment of  the U.K. economy.  All right, unemployment is down and there could be a  labor shortage, but wage inflation is starting to pick up again.  Now, the  Bank of England would like to start raising rates because inflation has  started to move up, but it can't because of their -- I mean, all roads lead  back to Brexit because of the uncertainty. </p><p> But the economy itself is fundamentally robust. </p><p> MARSHALL:  Yes, there's some strength in the economy, it's been threading  water though as the way we like to put it.  It's not sinking, but it is  threading water.  We're not seeing the kind of growth we'd want to see.</p><p> These are the interest rates we're forecasting one rise over the coming  months and perhaps one more in the period until 2020.  But even the window  for those minimal source of rise to 75 or a 100 basis points is starting to  close.  Because as you rightly say, uncertainty is going to mean the bank  is going to want to keep conditions as smooth as possible for business.</p><p> So we don't see a very strong case for significant rate rises in the near  future.</p><p> QUEST:  You'll forgive me if I don't say I'm sorry to hear that, I mean,  got a U.K. mortgage, I'm rather glad that it might be a little bit longer  to enjoy the good times, good to see you sir, thank you. </p><p> MARSHALL:  And you, Richard.</p><p> QUEST:  We'll talk more about this in detail as the process goes on, good  to have you.  The games industry is taking in $100 billion, that's right,  $100 billion a year.  The World Health Organization is now warning it could  be triggering(ph) a new public health concern. </p><p> It's called gaming disorder and it's just been listed as a mental health  condition.  It describes compulsive players who just plays from similar to  those of gambling addicts.  The WHO says it applies to behavior lasting 12  months or more.</p><p> Joining me now is the co-founder of a rehab center for internet and video  gaming addiction is Hilarie Cash, she joins me from reSTART which is live  from Seattle in Washington.  Were you surprised that it's taken so long to  get the WHO to recognize gaming as a gaming disorder. </p><p> HILARIE CASH, CO-FOUNDER, RESTART:  Not really, I -- you know, this whole  phenomenon has taken the world by storm and actually moving very quickly.   And research, you know, they're going to make their decisions based on the  research findings.  And research is by its nature rather slow. </p><p> So I think it's not -- but I think I'm just glad it's finally here. </p><p> QUEST:  What are the symptoms of gaming disorder? How does somebody  recognize when they've got it? </p><p> CASH:  I think the best way to think about it is that when you are out of  control and you are gaming in spite of its negative consequences, you've  got a problem.</p><p> QUEST:  And the treatment for it, how far does it accord to the other  traditional addictions? Obviously, drugs, alcohol, gambling, overspending,  all the others.  Does it follow the same model for treatment, whether it'd  be the 12-step model or otherwise? </p><p> CASH:  Well, I can tell you that our model of treatment is to be very  holistic in what we're trying to do.  So we are -- the adults as well as  the adolescents tries spending at least two months free of all screens, and  the idea is that they need that time to -- for their brains to come back to  normal functioning, they need that time to get their health back, they  usually are chronically sleep deprived, unfit and they've been eating very  poorly for a long time. </p><p> So they're getting their health back, they're developing skills that they  really are going to need if they're going to be functional young adults.   And they're getting a plan together for how they're going to abuse digital  technology again in a sustainable and healthy way. </p><p> After that two months period, there's been if they choose and about 80  percent of them do choose, you go on to the second phase of the program,  that's the phase where they're now for the adults living in apartments  together in -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> CASH:  In small groups, they're getting part-time work and they're just  starting to live life like adults need to live life -- </p><p> QUEST:  OK, so final question, with the other addictions, alcohol, drugs  and the like, the general view is total abstinence.  What is too many, a  thousand, never enough.  With gaming addiction or gaming disorder, do you  believe that you can't do it at all or do you believe there's a manageable  way you can do it. </p><p> CASH:  Well, I think there's a manageable way you can use a digital  technology.  </p><p> [16:55:00] I think if you're gaming addict, you're really getting on thin  ice if you try to go back to gaming and chances are very high that you will  relapse.  So we ask the guys when they come into program and are developing  what we call the life balance friend -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> CASH:  To think through -- what are their bottom lines and those bottom  lines almost always are going to include video games. </p><p> QUEST:  Good to talk to you, thank you, I appreciate your time tonight,  thank you.  We will have a different profitable moment after the break,  this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS live from New York. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, it is lovely in an era where we are  talking about the misery and mayhem that we're able to turn our attention  to something much more pleasant.  Weddings within the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS  team who makes no apology for showing you the very best that we have got. </p><p> Our senior producer John and his new bride Ali(ph), yes, that's the two at  the front, and the rest are the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS team that all sort of  -- I think the director summed it up rather well.  I think -- well, she  says you all scrubbed up rather nicely over the weekend. </p><p> And our technical director Rick Flair(ph) and his new wife Emily, yes, they  also scrubbed up rather nicely on the way to and from their ceremony.  So  we take this opportunity because it's only right and proper that we  remember this program that we bring to you every night with love and  privilege is made by people behind the cameras and they actually put it  together. </p><p> And today, four of them have enjoyed weddings.  And that is QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York.  Whatever you're up  to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.

It has pulled up quite considerably from the  opening of force, but PSE giving the closing bell.  So, we have got one  wimpy one and one okay one, but trading is over.  It is Monday, 18th of  June.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tonight, two weeks to save her coalition.  German stocks down heavily after  Angela Merkel gets an ultimatum from her own partners.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Audi's Chief Executive is under arrest.  Dieselgate is rumbling on and  Beyonce's new album has some shade for Spotify.  You can hear it now,  ironically, not exclusively on Spotify.  </p><p> I am Richard Quest, live from the world's financial capital, New York City  where it's mixing hot here, but where I still mean business.  </p><p> Good evening, Angela Merkel is facing a moment of reckoning.  She is being  given two weeks to save her coalition and resolve the immigration debate  that threatens to bring down Germany's fragile government.  </p><p> The Chancellor has been given an ultimatum -- overhaul Germany's migration  policies or face a new rebellion from coalition partners.  Facing his own  migration debate in the United States, President Trump seized on Mrs.  Merkel's position to launch an attack on Twitter.  He claims the migration  issue has caused the people of Germany to turn against their leader.   Investors seem concerned by the political turmoil.  </p><p> The Xetra DAX fell one percent on Monday, markets are unlikely to be  soothed by the words of the Chancellor's chief antagonist.  The CDU's party  leader warns the crisis won't be over any time soon.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> HORST SEEHOFER, FEDERAL MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR:  (Through an  interpreter).  It is ridiculous to say now to determine public that is all  about those two weeks and then after that, it will all be wonderful.  </p><p> I repeated it to the Board gathered today.  I warn you that we are not out  of the woods yet, not at all.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Atika Shubert joins me now with the latest from Berlin.  Two weeks  -- now before we get to what happens in that two weeks, let's first of all  analyze the compromise that she has agreed to just to get the breathing  space for a proper negotiation.  </p><p> ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, well,  basically, you heard there from Horst Seehofer that of course is the  Interior Minister.  He is also the leader of the Bavaria sister party, the  Christian Social Union and he was threatening to essentially break up the  coalition government unless he was allowed to unveil the 63-point plan to  reduce migration, specifically, he wanted to reject the asylum seekers at  the border if they had already applied for asylum in other EU countries,  and that is where Merkel drew the line.  </p><p> She said, \"Listen, I can't accept that one point in your plan.  Give me two  weeks to find an alternate solution by brokering bilateral agreements.\"   And that is where we stand now.  So, she has to try and figure out those  deals with other EU nations come back on July 1st, report back to her party  and say, \"This is how I have resolved it.\"  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, but what is the core issue here?  I mean, I know it is  complex that she has to do it, but the agreement to allow for instance  migrants to stay in the country where they have arrived.  What is the  difference between her and her coalition partner?  </p><p> SHUBERT:  Well, the difference is essentially that of as you know, in the  EU, if you're applying for asylum, you're supposed to apply in the country  where you enter.  Unfortunately, this means that you get a disproportionate  number of asylum seekers in Italy, Greece and those external countries.  </p><p> Germany did take in about a million refugees during the 2015 crisis and  that as far as Seehofer and Merkel's critics are concerned is too many.   So, what they want to do is reduce the number by then saying, \"If you've  already applied in Italy, Greece or somewhere else, you can't come here to  Germany.\"  And then push them back.  </p><p> Now, Merkel is saying that's a violation of the EU principle of freedom of  movement and that Germany can't do that automatically.  It needs to broker  some sort of a deal if not with all of the EU, then bilateral agreements  with different EU partners.  That's the difference there.  </p><p> So, she has basically bought herself some time to try and broker those  agreements, and maybe stave off any political crisis at home.  </p><p> QUEST:  Is it likely though that the CSU would promote this to a full blown  crisis to the point where it would endanger the coalition and Merkel's  position?  </p><p> SHUBERT:  Well, that's the key question.  I mean, the CSU is looking at  Bavaria local elections in October, that's probably one reason they have  taken this up a notch to such high drama, but the reality is, if they broke  up the coalition, then the CDU, the Christian Democrats could field their  own candidates in Bavaria and it could end up hurting the CSU in the long  run.  </p><p> [16:05:12]  </p><p> SHUBERT:  Also, as much as the general public wants to see tougher  immigration laws, they don't want to see another round of elections coming  up.  So, it could work out that the CSU says, \"Listen, we have proven our  point, now we will just back down,\" but we'll know better in about two  weeks, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  Atika Shubert in Berlin.  Elmar Brok is a member of the European  Parliament -- Parliament of the House and a close ally of Chancellor  Merkel, joins me now from Verl in Germany.  Good to see you, sir.  Thank  you.  </p><p> How likely is it how that a solution can be found in the two weeks  breathing speace that Chancellor Merkel has been given, bearing in mind,  she is going to have to get a green light from the other parties, the other  countries in Europe?  </p><p> ELMAR BROK, MEMBER, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:  Look at the party (ph) this  morning and there was a very strong support from all the leaders of our  party and the thing she was pressing (ph), that was the European solution.   And (ph) now that per month, 95 percent less migration in (ph) countries  than we had October 2015.  The great success story and many other measures  were taken, and here is a small question around -- around France about was  the close with their regional elections and I believe that that (inaudible)  and Mrs. Merkel will talk to the neighboring countries because she says if  she does not do that without an agreement with our neighboring countries,  we will (ph) -- these measures will have no effect.  </p><p> QUEST:  All right, is in your view -- I mean, it may not be nice or  pleasant to say this, but is the German coalition in danger over this  issue?  </p><p> BROK:  Look, you can never know how far people go, but (inaudible) on that  with interest (inaudible) breakdown, nothing would be delivered.  And also  about (inaudible) success (inaudible) for the elections.  The only  (inaudible) would be the (inaudible) party and therefore, I believe that if  some things were to be pushed forward, but that at the end of the day,  government will stable (inaudible) of the Bavaria Party in their own  elections.  </p><p> QUEST:  Elmar Brok, thank you.  We will keep it short because we have a  poor connection tonight, so we will talk to you hopefully again in the  future about this, but thank you for joining us in this evening.  </p><p> Now, we say with Germany, there was no shortage of drama in the country  today after authorities arrested the Chief Executive of Audi, one of the  country's biggest auto makers.  Rupert Stadler was taken into custody.   Investigators are worried he could influence witnesses related to the  emission scandal.  </p><p> Shares in Audi's parent company, Volkswagen, which has already paid tens of  billions of Euros in fines and fees because of the emission scandal fell  sharply on the news.  Anna Stewart is in London.  What's he been arrested  for?  </p><p> ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  So, this is an investigation, a criminal  investigation of Audi and it involves the alleged fraud by some 20 former  and current employees and one of those is Rupert Stadler.  He is being  investigated.  </p><p> Now, he was arrested, Richard.  He is being detained because of the risk of  evidence tampering or influencing other witnesses, other managers from Audi  over the scandal, so that is why he is being detained today.  </p><p> We knew that his apartment was raided last week and today, the Volkswagen  supervisory board were meeting to discuss this amongst other things, so  everyone is on tenterhooks wondering whether or not he will be forced to  tender his resignation.  </p><p> QUEST:  Okay, so let's be clear about this, the emissions scandal related  to Volkswagen cars, where does the emission scandal fit into the whole Audi  question?  </p><p> STEWART:  Well, Audi as a subsidiary of BW is also part of the emissions  diesel scandal.  It also had cars that were fitted with cheating devices  like Volkswagen, but there is a separate investigation that has also linked  Volkswagen and watched those CEOs and managers know.  </p><p> What they want to know here, Richard is who knew what when and what did  they do about it?  Was it transparent?  Many shareholders have brought this  up in separate lawsuits.  I mean, there are numerous lawsuits around this  saying there wasn't enough transparency from the Board on how big the  liabilities would be.  </p><p> As you said, tens of billions of dollars.  </p><p> QUEST:  All right, so that's already been paid, but the moment somebody  gets locked up and I am trying to remember how many of the people have been  locked up in this case, and I am not sure there have been any, but the  moment somebody gets locked up on allegation of -- or potential allegation  of witness tampering, then we're moving into a different area, a much more  serious area of criminality in that sense.  </p><p> STEWART:  Absolutely, I think it would be much harder to really dodge this  bullet as a CEO.  The Board has been incredibly supportive of Rupert  Stadler throughout, his being in the company since 1990, and he has faced  many calls for his resignation over the last couple of years.  </p><p> [00:05:12]  </p><p> STEWART:  Particularly, actually from minority shareholders, but the Board  has supported him every step of the way, and actually last year, despite  what he has caused, they actually extended his contract by five years.  </p><p> But as you say, bringing someone under arrest changes the story entirely,  so everyone is watching to see what will happen in the next sort of 12  hours.  </p><p> QUEST:  Anna Stewart, thank you for putting that clearly into perspective  for us.  Thank you.  </p><p> Now, stocks are down almost everywhere you choose to look.  In fact, there  was -- the Dow opened lower and although it recovered, it really was a  fairly sharp fall.  Look at the grid and you will see.  The Dow was off in  its worse point down about 260 to 270 points, so it did come back quite a  lot.  </p><p> But still close of 133 and failed to hold the 25,000 mark.  Similarly,  losses -- percentage-wise, much less for the NASDAQ and indeed, the fan  stocks for most of the day were actually higher.  But, that misery could be  seen of what we saw or we had just been talking about, not only with Angela  Merkel, but Audi can certainly be seen here with the Xetra DAX which is off  1.3 percent and indeed, over the whole market, if you look at the global  markets, you've got the US, you've got Europe, you've got Asia.  </p><p> It was the Xetra DAX, which is the one that has the biggest fallout, the  political fallout for Angela Merkel.  US stocks were also lower, it's the  trade wars that were worrying those.  Paul La Monica is with us.  And Paul,  as we look at this graph over here, we can see clearly, we were down about  252 to 260 odd points at the open.  I mean, there were several attempts to  claw back but the day was still down quite sharply.  </p><p> PAUL LA MONICA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, we couldn't get there.  We  obviously still had a triple digit loss and this is a similar pattern what  happened on Friday.  It looked as if the market was really going to fall  very sharply, things looked very bleak and then we recovered by the end of  the day.  </p><p> I am getting sense from talking to people that there still is nervousness  obviously about a potential trade war with China and just about every other  major country in the world -- with them and the US, but no one seems to be  panicking yet.  I think there is still this notion that the cooler heads  may eventually prevail, that this is just tough bluster by President Trump  et cetera.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, so there was an article in \"The Times\" over the weekend that  basically said, in the business section, why the trade war everybody is  saying Armageddon is dreadful, it will be awful, but there is no evidence  of that in the market.  </p><p> And Peter Tuchman at the exchange was saying to me today, look, there is  not the evidence of it yet in the market because the economy is strong.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  The economy is still strong, Richard.  Earnings growth for the  second quarter is expected to be extremely robust.  There's talk about  analysts projecting almost 20 percent profit growth year over year.  The  question is going to be when do companies start talking about the  nervousness coming into play for the rest of this year and next year.  </p><p> You've got the Atlanta Fed, President Raphael Bostic making a speech today  where he talked about how earlier this year, he was incredibly optimistic  because of the tax cuts, and now he is getting a sense that he is a little  bit more worried about the environment going forward because people are  telling him that yes, all of these trade bluster could have an impact on  their profits going forward.  </p><p> People are going to be a little bit more skittish.  They may not buy as  much as stuff, both corporations and consumers and I think that's a  legitimate concern going forward.  </p><p> QUEST:  It's interesting when we look at it.  It's good to see -- didn't  you say, as we look at the market, it has tried to rally, and it did to a  certain extent, but could not do it.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  At least not for the Dow, but the NASDAQ did finish positive.   You've got people still loving those companies like Facebook and Google and  Netflix, Amazon.  They seem to be resistant to all of these macro concerns.  </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you.  Thank you.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Thank you.  </p><p> QUEST:  When we return, President Trump is looking beyond his borders with  dominance and out into the universe -- we will look for his plans for a  Space Force, what that actually means, and Jay-Z and Beyonce remind the  world they have their own streaming service and then promptly, we get all  the results upon arrival.  Go figure.  </p><p> [16:15:00]  </p><p> QUEST:  Now, I do need to just correct one or two minor matters.  We showed  you all the market numbers earlier, and I am afraid, I think that the  machine must have frozen.  The top line, the US market shows the Dow, we  had it down 113 points, it's not 103 at the close, but the important thing  which Paul La Monica quite rightly points out, the NASDAQ actually did eke  out a small gain for the session.  </p><p> So, just to correct.  In case you were a little bit concerned that it  didn't look like we've got it exactly right.  We didn't get it right, but  we have got it right now.  </p><p>Google is betting a half a million dollars on China and that's despite  Google being blocked mostly by Beijing.  Clare Sebastian is here.  Who are  they buying and how much?  </p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  They are buying just under 1 percent  of jd.com for $550 million in cash, Richard, so obviously, this is a big  foray into China for Google.  They have basically not been operating in  terms of their search maps, e-mails, YouTube entirely since 2010, but  clearly, they haven't given up on the country.  </p><p> We have seen little moves in this direction.  They have got two apps in the  country.  They have got translation and they have got file management.   They have visiting since -- which I was there back in November.  They have  opened an AI center there, so I think this is more of the same  (inaudible)...  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> QUEST:  Remind us why they are not there as Google.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Right, because of the Chinese's government's laws on  censorship.  They basically couldn't comply ethically with the rules there  and they left in 2010.  </p><p> QUEST:  And they pulled out.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  They pulled out despite the fact that there are 730 million  Internet users in China, Richard, more than twice the US's entire  population, they still pulled out.  But this is something they kind of  ignored -- the size and scale of this market.  But it is important for  jd.com as well.  </p><p> QUEST:  Why?  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Because jd.com just like Alibaba, you've seen them you know,  doing road shows in the US and beyond.  They want to expand outside of  China, that's really important for them because the market there, even  though it is huge isn't growing at the same rate as it was.  So, there is  room for growth.  It seems to be international, South East Asia, Europe,  the US -- all of these areas jd.com will be able to access through the  steel.  Its products will be on Google Shopping and there are more what  they call retail solutions on the guard...  </p><p> QUEST:  But what does jd.com do in the EU?  We think of jd.com like  Alibaba, as just being China's version of Amazon?  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Actually, jd.com is even more China's version of Amazon and  Alibaba is because it has the logistics network.  I've got a video I think  of one of their fully automated warehouses.  They do what Amazon does.   They have their own logistics there.  They do two-hour delivery in 50-plus  cities around China.  </p><p> So, they really do the kind of -- the supply chain that is crucial to e- commerce, and I think that's what Google is so interested in here.  They  haven't cracked the e-commerce yet.  </p><p> QUEST:  Thanks.  Good.  Thank you.  Clare Sebastian.  Big tech firms like  Google aren't the only ones working in this more complex environment.  John  Stankey, the new head of our parent company, WarnerMedia tells \"New Day\"  that everything in the entire economy is more difficult now.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p> JOHN STANKEY, CEO, WARNERMEDIA:  I think everything in the industry right  now is probably more complex and more difficult than it has ever been, and  I think if you were sitting over at Facebook today and asking about what  it's like to run their business, the transparency dynamic that any company  has to run under and the volatility that it brings in the decision making,  that's just part of industry today and I don't think it's unique to our  circumstances.  I think it's just broad scale across the economy right now.  </p><p> ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN HOST:  So, for all of our viewers who are watching,  they want to know what this means for them, are there costs going up?  What  else -- how will this affect them?  </p><p> STANKEY:  Contrary to what the government alleged, no.  Our goal here is  actually to innovate on product and you know, for me, personally, why I am  excited to be here, I have always been happiest in my career when I get to  build things and do unique things and do things that are different.  </p><p> And our goal here is to invest in this business and our goal is to do it in  a way that provides for platforms and capabilities that are consistent with  where technology is taking things.  And you know, a classic example might  be here at CNN.  </p><p> [16:20:11]  </p><p> STANKEY:  How can we broaden the distribution of the great content you guys  build every day?  How can we make it more readily available and the push  lifestyle that everybody leads and I think there are some very exciting  things to do in that regard.  </p><p> So, it's about innovating, it's about building new product, it's about  investing heavier in content.  It's certainly not about going out and just  trying to think about we want to raise prices on content for what other  people buy.  </p><p> BRIAN STELTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  I think that's interesting because there  have been some concerns in the cable industry that we are in a period of  decline or shrinkage as opposed to growth and investment?  And you're  saying in places like HBO, there is more money that should be spent?  </p><p> STANKEY:  Look, I think that the model as we know it today, you know,  standard linear television is a very immature model.  Standard linear  television in the form how ads are supported in it.  </p><p> But there is an opportunity to innovate in that regard, not only with how  the content is configured, but to think about how advertising supports that  content, and that's why we established the advertising entity with an AT&amp;T  that is being led by Brian Lesser.  </p><p> The purpose of that is to start building the new ad formats and the more  targeted advertising.  They can lower ad loads and still monetize content  the way where it remains affordable for the customer.  </p><p> So, that's the kind of innovation we are going to be working on.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> QUEST:  Thank you.  The CEO of Warner Media, my boss.  President Trump has  ordered the creation of a Space Force, calling it the sixth branch of the  Armed Forces.  Now, the appropriate name, Barbara Starr, joins me from the  Pentagon.  </p><p> All right, a Space Force will do what?  </p><p> BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  I haven't actually thought  about that, Richard, until you mentioned it.  Well, you know, I thought I  would try not to make the \"Star Wars,\" \"Star Trek,\" \"Battlestar Galactica\"  jokes, but let me have a go at it.  </p><p> I mean, you know, this is not a brand new idea.  It's something the  Pentagon has long been involved in and trying to make sure that its  satellites in space, the things that it relies in for war fighting are safe  and secure from adversaries, and that the US can dominate in space.  </p><p> So, we already know that some parts of the military pay an awful lot of  attention to this, especially the US Air Force.  </p><p> The President has for some time now talked about he wants a separate Space  Force.  Not getting total support from the Pentagon about all of that  because there is a lot of worry, it's just going to wind up being more  bureaucracy, but here is a bit of today when the President announced this,  a bit of his vision from the White House.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This time, we will do more  than plant our flag and leave our footprints, we will establish a long term  presence, expand our economy and build the foundation for the eventual  mission to Mars, which is actually going to happen very quickly.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> STARR:  Well, going to Mars quickly, we will see, as with all things in the  United States government.  It is going to depend on Congress' funding all  of these ideas that the President has, but let's look at a very practical  task ahead.  One of the biggest things in space for the US military for  example is to make sure its GPS satellites -- global positioning satellites  -- are always safe and secure because if you have an adversary trying to  take those out somehow with some sort of attack, that would not just  devastate US war fighting capabilities around the world, it would devastate  communications around the world.  </p><p> So, it gives you an idea of how much it is a problem, how much it is an  issue, but is the President's solution the one that Pentagon wants, not  exactly clear just yet that it is, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  Okay, so Barbara, with all of this, I guess, you know for a  President that loves hype, obviously this has been in the works for some  time, what is that gap between hype and reality to fruition and execution?  </p><p> STARR:  Well, for people, for top commanders in the US military, their  question starts with if there is something out there that we are not doing  to defend and protect Americans in that space environment, is there  something more we should be doing?  </p><p> A lot of money, time and attention is being paid to the very question --  advanced defensive capabilities, defensive information attacks all of that,  the key question I think, Richard, Congress wants to see something happen,  but there may be a very limited appetite for an entire new branch of the US  military.  </p><p> QUEST:  Our own shining star bright and comets skating and great to tell us  the story, Barbara, good to see you as always, thank you.  </p><p> STARR:  Thanks.  </p><p> QUEST:  Barbara Starr at the Pentagon.  Now, from space to slightly at  lower altitude, but we all get to fly anyway where Lufthansa, now, we know  Norwegian has received already two bids and rejected them from IAG -- the  owners of BA et cetera.  </p><p> [16:25:16]  </p><p> QUEST:  Lufthansa is reporting they have now been in contact with Norwegian  Air Shuttle as well.  So, you have Lufthansa and British Airways and IAG  interested in buying Europe's third biggest aircraft low cost group.  Both  have budget players in play.  </p><p> I wanted to look at the destination board and we are going to show you  exactly why this is so fascinating because if you look for example at what  Lufthansa already owns at the moment, you will see the complexity.  </p><p> Now, you've obviously got in the Lufthansa group, Lufthansa the German,  Swiss the Swiss Airline, you've got CityLine which is the regional;  Edelweiss, the low cost; German Wings and Euro Wings and your Austrian --  they are the main components that Lufthansa already owns within it.  </p><p> It's already got as well minority stakes in the Aerologic and Sun Express,  so Lufthansa on the one side.  Now, you've got AIG and if you look at the  airlines AIG has, you'll see exactly how significant that is going to be.  </p><p> BA, Iberia and Aer Lingus, Vueling and Level, they are the majorities  already that they have got.  They are the big carriers that they have got.   The minority stakes that -- this is the key one, the key one here, there.   Already got 4 percent of Norwegian, nearly 5 percent.  </p><p> So, on the both hands, you have Lufthansa and you have IAG, two of the  largest groups in the world now both seemingly doing battle trying to get  Norwegian.  I can tell you from within the industry, the view is Lufthansa  may just have the upper hand in all of this if Carsten Spohr decides to go  for the full bid, may indeed.  </p><p> But Willie Walsh is not going to give up easily, neither Chief Execs,  neither Spohr, nor Walsh is prepared to overbid for an airline that they  see is already in trouble.  </p><p> We will have more after the break.  </p><p> Hello, I am Richard Quest, there is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a  moment.  When Beyonce and Jay-Z set up for a big weekend on their streaming  service and how title's rivals are catching up and arguably, the two of  them shot themselves in their own fight for bid.  </p><p> And the World Health Organization now shows that video game addiction is  real.  I will speak to the founder of a rehab center for gamers.  As we  continue, you are watching CNN and here, the facts always come first.  </p><p> President Trump is again falsely shaming his political opponents, the  Democrats for his own policy on immigration which resulted in family  separation at the borders.  In remarks earlier today, President Trump said  the US would not become a migrant camp for refugee holding facility.  </p><p> [16:30:16]  Meanwhile, the new CNN poll shows most Republicans approve of  the policies which meant more parents and children being separated at the  border.  Overall, two-thirds of Americans disapprove, the president's  approval rating is now at 39 percent. </p><p> Chancellor Merkel of Germany has been given two weeks to reach an agreement  with the EU on a new immigration policy that both members of our coalition  government can support.  The CSU Party, her partners wants a deal to ban  migrants who have already applied for asylum elsewhere from entering  Germany.</p><p> CSU says if there's no deal, it will unilaterally move forward with the  plan.  In Britain, the Prime Minister Theresa May has suffered a fresh  defeat of her Brexit plans.  The House of Lords voted to give parliament  the final say on what happens in the event her government fails to reach an  exit deal with the EU. </p><p> The legislation is to be debated in the House of Commons on Wednesday.   Croatia's Nikola Kalinic has been sent home from the World Cup after he  refused to come on as a substitute.  The striker said he couldn't play  against Nigeria because of a back problem. </p><p> His coach pointed out he also refused to play during a friendly with Brazil  earlier this month.  A thriller outside of Saint Petersburg where a short  while ago England defeated Tunisia, it's the end of day five in the 2018  World Cup.  After some early missed chances, England's Captain Harry Kane  gave his team an early 1-0 lead, Tunisia leveled it with a penalty, and  that was just before the end of the first half.</p><p> Then as time was draining away, it was Harry Kane again with a dramatic  header -- yes, and to give England the 2-1 victory.  Amanda Davies is in  Moscow -- it's a haunting of a match. </p><p> AMANDA DAVIES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Richard, it was, but it's dangerous  times because England have won their opening match of this World Cup, and  everybody in England has been doing so well in terms of playing down  expectations for this very young, relatively untested England side. </p><p> Now, they've won, you do worry what happens next.  It wasn't the most  convincing performance, it has to be said, but there was some very exciting  moments within the side against a Tunisian team that -- or in their first  World Cup since 2006 and we knew it would sit very deep, defend very deep  in numbers.</p><p> So it was always going to be tough with this England side.  The moment that  you do get excited about is the fact, so in days gone by, a warm one,  England's generally would have settled for that or even worst perhaps  conceded a late goal.</p><p> But these guys kept on pushing, kept going and Harry Kane led by example as  the captain as you said to score the winner in the 91st minute, and you saw  -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> DAVIES:  Just what it meant to him and his manager Gary Southgate, a  massive results early doors. </p><p> QUEST:  Oh, hang on Amanda, it's better to win than lose. </p><p> DAVIES:  Absolutely Richard, but you know, I have been through some downs  and downs.  A little, a few ups.  But more downs as an England -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> DAVIES:  Supporter over the years, and so you know, I am wearing my red  dress, I wore my shirt this morning for breakfast, so we've got to be  realistic about it.  As this is, you know, one of the rare groups, after  this point in the competition has actually gone to plan with the big teams  -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> DAVIES:  Drawing their opening games, Belgium also won earlier today.  So  compared to what we've seen with Brazil, with Argentina, with Germany  losing yesterday, we know that you can't take anything for granted at all  in a World Cup. </p><p> QUEST:  And the beauty of all of this is that the atmosphere is starting to  build.  Whether it'd be the Germany match or even the first match from  Russia and Saudi Arabia right the way through to this match, the atmosphere  is building up as it's supposed to. </p><p> DAVIES:  Yes, it truly is a World Cup.  We're just at the bottom of Red  Square as we've said to you before, and there's a lot of Mexican fans,  there's been some Colombian fans here today.  And remember four years ago,  Richard, you had your flag pole of flags really and you were texting me as  to which flag needed to come out on which day. </p><p> And today, that was really tested, I had a fantastic moment by Saint  Basil's which has been open for the first time after they've taken down all  the stadium from the concert last week.  </p><p> [16:35:00] And there were three fans, there was a Mexican and Argentinean  and a Spaniard having a photo taken. </p><p> And then they saw a Colombian and said, come on over, and then there was a  Peruvian who joined the party and then there was some Moroccan fans who  joined the party and a German and a Swedish fan, and it was really a  fantastic moment in front of Saint Basil's, seeing everybody in their shirt  with their flags and it is what you would hope a World Cup would turn out  to be. </p><p> QUEST:  And be assured, Miss Davies, that your vexillology knowledge will  be required before we are finished, because the flags return, the flags  return when the economic World Cup returns once we get into the knockout  rounds which comes later.</p><p> So you may not rest easy, you'll be up all night studying flags, good to  see you.</p><p> DAVIES:  I will, bye-bye. </p><p> QUEST:  Sorted that out.  Beyonce and Jay-Z say they don't care about the  music industry's obsession with streaming numbers. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> (MUSIC) </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Plenty stuff, there it is, streaming service and the streaming  business, we're going to see -- discuss what it says about the future of  Tidal streaming service.  That they bring out a new album, maybe it's  exclusive to them and then give it to everybody else -- after the break. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Beyonce and Jay z dropped the surprise album over the weekend, it  wasn't expected.  It managed to get the whole world talking about their  streaming service Tidal once again.</p><p> Fans were sent rushing to the app because it was only app -- it was the  only way to hear the album at first.  Now Beyonce and Jay z have given it  to the mega streaming rival Spotify, Apple and Amazon. </p><p> And speaking of Spotify, Beyonce has some choice words about the music  business and its obsession with streaming numbers.  Listen carefully. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> (MUSIC) </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Savory stuff, Larry Miller is here thankfully.  Help us to  understand it, director of music business at the NYU Steinhardt School.   We'll get on to the obsession with streaming numbers in a moment.</p><p> But being weird to surprisingly release your own material on your own  streaming service that you've got an interest in and then given away to the  competition the next day. </p><p> LARRY MILLER, DIRECTOR OF MUSIC BUSINESS, NYU STEINHARDT SCHOOL:  Well,  true enough.  And if we go back to not so long ago when \"Lemonade\" dropped,  of course that dropped on an \"Hbo\" special, but it was also exclusively  available on Tidal for a short period of time. </p><p> [16:40:00] QUEST:  It was exclusive for a day. </p><p> MILLER:  Yes, right, that's very short. </p><p> QUEST:  That's very short. </p><p> MILLER:  That's very short indeed.  But I think that streaming has evolved  and the music industry has evolved and Spotify have about $180 million  subscribers and Apple have another $40 million or so, and Amazon have many  and there are other places people go to stream music.</p><p> QUEST:  Right, but if you are Beyonce and Jay z, you're not worried about  the money necessarily. </p><p> MILLER:  Right.  </p><p> QUEST:  And if you are committed to your Tidal streaming service, you're  prepared to take the punishment that will come by insisting it's only  there.  So why give it away? </p><p> MILLER:  Well, it's important to be where the eyeballs are and air balls  are.  And any artist wants to be able to gather attention around their  latest music -- </p><p> QUEST:  But you can't have both, Larry, you can't -- I mean, what I'm  trying to say is it suggests a lack of commitment to Tidal that they would  have done it so quickly -- </p><p> MILLER:  Well -- </p><p> QUEST:  Not even seven days. </p><p> MILLER:  Right, not even seven days.  And so in today's tension economy,  who knows what we'll be thinking about a week from now.  And so right now,  while attention is riveted on Beyonce and Jay z and that amazing video they  chose to make some music available a day later. </p><p> QUEST:  The louver, they got access to the louver -- </p><p> MILLER:  Amazing -- </p><p> QUEST:  For this video which is extraordinary, which is gratifying in a  sense to see the amount of money and the amount of effort and care on  production values that are put into these, some things, even though sort of  extreme things as you say, here today, gone tomorrow. </p><p> MILLER:  Fair enough, and so it's incumbent upon artists and the people who  they work with today to be able to drive attention by releasing music and  video and other things in other to maintain attention for as long as  possible.</p><p> QUEST:  OK, so as to Beyonce's somewhat vulgar references to streaming and  let me -- and then Spotify, you're right, it's a numbers game.  I mean, I'm  glad you're -- we've got -- the music business expert here, it's a numbers  game and Spotify has got the numbers, 175 million. </p><p> MILLER:  It is. </p><p> QUEST:  Right, as anybody else, I mean, if you want to be heard, you've got  to go there. </p><p> MILLER:  Yes, you need to be aware that people are and let's not forget,  they are in the middle of what I believe is a gigantic sold-out stadium -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> MILLER:  For -- they just finished playing in the big football stadium in  London -- </p><p> QUEST:  They did, Wembley.  Quick final question, can we say that Spotify  is now too big to fail? </p><p> MILLER:  I think it's hard to say in this day and age whether anything  really is too big to fail, but they are the leader in a growing and super  important segment of the music business that now accounts for two-thirds of  the revenue in the country. </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you sir, thank you. </p><p> MILLER:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p> QUEST:  As we continue tonight, you want to stay on top of the day's  business news and headlines in just 90 seconds and try our daily briefing  podcast, it's updated twice a day before and after the bell rings on Wall  Street, (INAUDIBLE) or Google for CNN flash briefing, just try it, see what  you get, and if it doesn't work, e-mail me.</p><p> When we return, Britain's Brexit blues are starting a report, claims the  U.K. is about to see its lowest growth if the financial crisis and things  aren't going to get much better any time soon. </p><p> [16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  So in the pubs of London where it is still time to get the last  order of drinks, and I suspect the England victory is dominating, but once  the thrilling World Cup win sort of dissipates, the U.K. will come back to  earth.</p><p> The British Chamber of Commerce is now predicting it will be the weakest  year of growth for the U.K. economy in almost a decade.  Adam Marshall is  the Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, good to see you,  Adam, thank you for taking time tonight. </p><p> I hope you saw the final results, you saw the game before popping into  Australia's to join us.  But it is sobering, your numbers, I mean, it  doesn't show complete collapse of destitution, but it does show sub-par  growth for the foreseeable future.</p><p> ADAM MARSHALL, DIRECTOR GENERAL, BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE:  I think  that's right, Richard, we are looking at about 1.3 percent growth this  year, 1.4 next year and 1.6 in 2020.  Those are not the sorts of numbers  that really blow the doors off when it comes to a major advanced economy. </p><p> And I think what we'd like to see is two things, one obviously, firms want  to see clarity on Brexit as that debate rumbles on terminally.  And I think  in the U.K., there's also a sense that we have other things to get on with  as well to make conditions great for business.</p><p> And there's quite -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> MARSHALL:  A lot that the government needs to do here at home as well. </p><p> QUEST:  Is there -- is this lone number, is it predicated on the  uncertainty on what happens or is there a general view now within the BCC  and you're an economist, that whatever happens immediately after Brexit,  growth will be lower, even in best case scenario, the U.K. will not be as  well off as it was within the EU. </p><p> MARSHALL:  Well, the U.K. will certainly see slower growth that it might  have done had the country not gone down this route at least in the very  short term, that is what we are forecasting.  But I think there are some  other factors that work here as well. </p><p> Obviously, some of the global trade skirmishes that we've been seeing in  recent weeks, unsettled businesses here in the U.K. about their future  prospects.  So anything that happens between the U.S. and China for  example, they may sneeze but the U.K. may very well catch cold as well.</p><p> Same thing about input prices and oil prices -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> MARSHALL:  Which have been going up for a lot of U.K. companies too. </p><p> QUEST:  And on this question of future growth, obviously, you would have  preferred -- I mean, I know the BCC, it would have preferred a single  market access.  But if you can't get single market access, what is your  preferred option for Customs Union and the way forward especially now we  seem to be at that essential moment when the negotiation has to decide  which way to go. </p><p> MARSHALL:  Well, our firms are not much interested in the chronology(ph)  about this.  They see a lot of labels around Customs Union and single  market.  And what they say to us is they want answers on practical  questions.  Who do I pay tax to? Who can I hire? How long can they stay in  my business? </p><p>Who is my regulator going to be? And those sorts of practical questions are  what really are driving a lot of business considerations around this.  You  could call the rapport(ph), whatever you want to, but businesses want  clarity on their trading conditions and they need to see that with some  urgency over the next few months. </p><p> QUEST:  OK, so we've had the white paper recently from the -- well, we had  the agreement back in March, we've had a white paper, we've got the current  disarray one might arguably say in parliament.  You just saw today  obviously, that the lords says -- once again voted that it should take  primacy if there's no deal. </p><p> Something that the Commons is going to have to look back at.  I mean, yes,  I guess I'm taking you into the chronology of the Brexit process and what  you're telling me is it's not very helpful. </p><p> MARSHALL:  It's not, in fact, a lot of firms around the country who say  look, they're watching and waiting, but what they need is something  concrete upon which they can act -- </p><p> QUEST:  They're not going to get it I think --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> I've got news for you, that's exactly -- I mean, and that's the dirty  secret here isn't it? They're not going to get it and even once the  agreement is signed, there's still going to be a level of uncertainty that  will be damaging to your members.  Can you accept that? </p><p> MARSHALL:  No, I think businesses know that there's going to be uncertainty  for some time to come, a very few pundits have said to us, well, once you  negotiate with the European Union, you negotiate with the European Union  forever. </p><p> It's very likely to be the case that those negotiations will be ongoing for  a long time.  But businesses do need a degree of certainty here, Richard,  they do need something to work off of, and I think their biggest dismay,  their biggest opprobrium is actually for the U.K. politicians, they can't  agree on a route forward to go into that negotiating room.</p><p> [16:50:00] Because what we know in business is you go into a negotiation  with a clear position and that's what we need our government to do.</p><p> QUEST:  Right, let's just talk about these, the strength at the moment of  the U.K. economy.  All right, unemployment is down and there could be a  labor shortage, but wage inflation is starting to pick up again.  Now, the  Bank of England would like to start raising rates because inflation has  started to move up, but it can't because of their -- I mean, all roads lead  back to Brexit because of the uncertainty. </p><p> But the economy itself is fundamentally robust. </p><p> MARSHALL:  Yes, there's some strength in the economy, it's been threading  water though as the way we like to put it.  It's not sinking, but it is  threading water.  We're not seeing the kind of growth we'd want to see.</p><p> These are the interest rates we're forecasting one rise over the coming  months and perhaps one more in the period until 2020.  But even the window  for those minimal source of rise to 75 or a 100 basis points is starting to  close.  Because as you rightly say, uncertainty is going to mean the bank  is going to want to keep conditions as smooth as possible for business.</p><p> So we don't see a very strong case for significant rate rises in the near  future.</p><p> QUEST:  You'll forgive me if I don't say I'm sorry to hear that, I mean,  got a U.K. mortgage, I'm rather glad that it might be a little bit longer  to enjoy the good times, good to see you sir, thank you. </p><p> MARSHALL:  And you, Richard.</p><p> QUEST:  We'll talk more about this in detail as the process goes on, good  to have you.  The games industry is taking in $100 billion, that's right,  $100 billion a year.  The World Health Organization is now warning it could  be triggering(ph) a new public health concern. </p><p> It's called gaming disorder and it's just been listed as a mental health  condition.  It describes compulsive players who just plays from similar to  those of gambling addicts.  The WHO says it applies to behavior lasting 12  months or more.</p><p> Joining me now is the co-founder of a rehab center for internet and video  gaming addiction is Hilarie Cash, she joins me from reSTART which is live  from Seattle in Washington.  Were you surprised that it's taken so long to  get the WHO to recognize gaming as a gaming disorder. </p><p> HILARIE CASH, CO-FOUNDER, RESTART:  Not really, I -- you know, this whole  phenomenon has taken the world by storm and actually moving very quickly.   And research, you know, they're going to make their decisions based on the  research findings.  And research is by its nature rather slow. </p><p> So I think it's not -- but I think I'm just glad it's finally here. </p><p> QUEST:  What are the symptoms of gaming disorder? How does somebody  recognize when they've got it? </p><p> CASH:  I think the best way to think about it is that when you are out of  control and you are gaming in spite of its negative consequences, you've  got a problem.</p><p> QUEST:  And the treatment for it, how far does it accord to the other  traditional addictions? Obviously, drugs, alcohol, gambling, overspending,  all the others.  Does it follow the same model for treatment, whether it'd  be the 12-step model or otherwise? </p><p> CASH:  Well, I can tell you that our model of treatment is to be very  holistic in what we're trying to do.  So we are -- the adults as well as  the adolescents tries spending at least two months free of all screens, and  the idea is that they need that time to -- for their brains to come back to  normal functioning, they need that time to get their health back, they  usually are chronically sleep deprived, unfit and they've been eating very  poorly for a long time. </p><p> So they're getting their health back, they're developing skills that they  really are going to need if they're going to be functional young adults.   And they're getting a plan together for how they're going to abuse digital  technology again in a sustainable and healthy way. </p><p> After that two months period, there's been if they choose and about 80  percent of them do choose, you go on to the second phase of the program,  that's the phase where they're now for the adults living in apartments  together in -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> CASH:  In small groups, they're getting part-time work and they're just  starting to live life like adults need to live life -- </p><p> QUEST:  OK, so final question, with the other addictions, alcohol, drugs  and the like, the general view is total abstinence.  What is too many, a  thousand, never enough.  With gaming addiction or gaming disorder, do you  believe that you can't do it at all or do you believe there's a manageable  way you can do it. </p><p> CASH:  Well, I think there's a manageable way you can use a digital  technology.  </p><p> [16:55:00] I think if you're gaming addict, you're really getting on thin  ice if you try to go back to gaming and chances are very high that you will  relapse.  So we ask the guys when they come into program and are developing  what we call the life balance friend -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> CASH:  To think through -- what are their bottom lines and those bottom  lines almost always are going to include video games. </p><p> QUEST:  Good to talk to you, thank you, I appreciate your time tonight,  thank you.  We will have a different profitable moment after the break,  this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS live from New York. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, it is lovely in an era where we are  talking about the misery and mayhem that we're able to turn our attention  to something much more pleasant.  Weddings within the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS  team who makes no apology for showing you the very best that we have got. </p><p> Our senior producer John and his new bride Ali(ph), yes, that's the two at  the front, and the rest are the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS team that all sort of  -- I think the director summed it up rather well.  I think -- well, she  says you all scrubbed up rather nicely over the weekend. </p><p> And our technical director Rick Flair(ph) and his new wife Emily, yes, they  also scrubbed up rather nicely on the way to and from their ceremony.  So  we take this opportunity because it's only right and proper that we  remember this program that we bring to you every night with love and  privilege is made by people behind the cameras and they actually put it  together. </p><p> And today, four of them have enjoyed weddings.  And that is QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York.  Whatever you're up  to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.  Congratulations to all my  colleagues. </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It has pulled up quite considerably from the  opening of force, but PSE giving the closing bell.  So, we have got one  wimpy one and one okay one, but trading is over.  It is Monday, 18th of  June.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, two weeks to save her coalition.  German stocks down heavily after  Angela Merkel gets an ultimatum from her own partners.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Audi's Chief Executive is under arrest.  Dieselgate is rumbling on and  Beyonce's new album has some shade for Spotify.  You can hear it now,  ironically, not exclusively on Spotify.  </p><p>I am Richard Quest, live from the world's financial capital, New York City  where it's mixing hot here, but where I still mean business.  </p><p>Good evening, Angela Merkel is facing a moment of reckoning.  She is being  given two weeks to save her coalition and resolve the immigration debate  that threatens to bring down Germany's fragile government.  </p><p>The Chancellor has been given an ultimatum -- overhaul Germany's migration  policies or face a new rebellion from coalition partners.  Facing his own  migration debate in the United States, President Trump seized on Mrs.  Merkel's position to launch an attack on Twitter.  He claims the migration  issue has caused the people of Germany to turn against their leader.   Investors seem concerned by the political turmoil.  </p><p>The Xetra DAX fell one percent on Monday, markets are unlikely to be  soothed by the words of the Chancellor's chief antagonist.  The CDU's party  leader warns the crisis won't be over any time soon.  </p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>HORST SEEHOFER, FEDERAL MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR:  (Through an  interpreter).  It is ridiculous to say now to determine public that is all  about those two weeks and then after that, it will all be wonderful.  </p><p>I repeated it to the Board gathered today.  I warn you that we are not out  of the woods yet, not at all.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Atika Shubert joins me now with the latest from Berlin.  Two weeks  -- now before we get to what happens in that two weeks, let's first of all  analyze the compromise that she has agreed to just to get the breathing  space for a proper negotiation.  </p><p>ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, well,  basically, you heard there from Horst Seehofer that of course is the  Interior Minister.  He is also the leader of the Bavaria sister party, the  Christian Social Union and he was threatening to essentially break up the  coalition government unless he was allowed to unveil the 63-point plan to  reduce migration, specifically, he wanted to reject the asylum seekers at  the border if they had already applied for asylum in other EU countries,  and that is where Merkel drew the line.  </p><p>She said, \"Listen, I can't accept that one point in your plan.  Give me two  weeks to find an alternate solution by brokering bilateral agreements.\"   And that is where we stand now.  So, she has to try and figure out those  deals with other EU nations come back on July 1st, report back to her party  and say, \"This is how I have resolved it.\"  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, but what is the core issue here?  I mean, I know it is  complex that she has to do it, but the agreement to allow for instance  migrants to stay in the country where they have arrived.  What is the  difference between her and her coalition partner?  </p><p>SHUBERT:  Well, the difference is essentially that of as you know, in the  EU, if you're applying for asylum, you're supposed to apply in the country  where you enter.  Unfortunately, this means that you get a disproportionate  number of asylum seekers in Italy, Greece and those external countries.  </p><p>Germany did take in about a million refugees during the 2015 crisis and  that as far as Seehofer and Merkel's critics are concerned is too many.   So, what they want to do is reduce the number by then saying, \"If you've  already applied in Italy, Greece or somewhere else, you can't come here to  Germany.\"  And then push them back.  </p><p>Now, Merkel is saying that's a violation of the EU principle of freedom of  movement and that Germany can't do that automatically.  It needs to broker  some sort of a deal if not with all of the EU, then bilateral agreements  with different EU partners.  That's the difference there.  </p><p>So, she has basically bought herself some time to try and broker those  agreements, and maybe stave off any political crisis at home.  </p><p>QUEST:  Is it likely though that the CSU would promote this to a full blown  crisis to the point where it would endanger the coalition and Merkel's  position?  </p><p>SHUBERT:  Well, that's the key question.  I mean, the CSU is looking at  Bavaria local elections in October, that's probably one reason they have  taken this up a notch to such high drama, but the reality is, if they broke  up the coalition, then the CDU, the Christian Democrats could field their  own candidates in Bavaria and it could end up hurting the CSU in the long  run.  </p><p>[16:05:12]  </p><p>SHUBERT:  Also, as much as the general public wants to see tougher  immigration laws, they don't want to see another round of elections coming  up.  So, it could work out that the CSU says, \"Listen, we have proven our  point, now we will just back down,\" but we'll know better in about two  weeks, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  Atika Shubert in Berlin.  Elmar Brok is a member of the European  Parliament -- Parliament of the House and a close ally of Chancellor  Merkel, joins me now from Verl in Germany.  Good to see you, sir.  Thank  you.  </p><p>How likely is it how that a solution can be found in the two weeks  breathing speace that Chancellor Merkel has been given, bearing in mind,  she is going to have to get a green light from the other parties, the other  countries in Europe?  </p><p>ELMAR BROK, MEMBER, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:  Look at the party (ph) this  morning and there was a very strong support from all the leaders of our  party and the thing she was pressing (ph), that was the European solution.   And (ph) now that per month, 95 percent less migration in (ph) countries  than we had October 2015.  The great success story and many other measures  were taken, and here is a small question around -- around France about was  the close with their regional elections and I believe that that (inaudible)  and Mrs. Merkel will talk to the neighboring countries because she says if  she does not do that without an agreement with our neighboring countries,  we will (ph) -- these measures will have no effect.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right, is in your view -- I mean, it may not be nice or  pleasant to say this, but is the German coalition in danger over this  issue?  </p><p>BROK:  Look, you can never know how far people go, but (inaudible) on that  with interest (inaudible) breakdown, nothing would be delivered.  And also  about (inaudible) success (inaudible) for the elections.  The only  (inaudible) would be the (inaudible) party and therefore, I believe that if  some things were to be pushed forward, but that at the end of the day,  government will stable (inaudible) of the Bavaria Party in their own  elections.  </p><p>QUEST:  Elmar Brok, thank you.  We will keep it short because we have a  poor connection tonight, so we will talk to you hopefully again in the  future about this, but thank you for joining us in this evening.  </p><p>Now, we say with Germany, there was no shortage of drama in the country  today after authorities arrested the Chief Executive of Audi, one of the  country's biggest auto makers.  Rupert Stadler was taken into custody.   Investigators are worried he could influence witnesses related to the  emission scandal.  </p><p>Shares in Audi's parent company, Volkswagen, which has already paid tens of  billions of Euros in fines and fees because of the emission scandal fell  sharply on the news.  Anna Stewart is in London.  What's he been arrested  for?  </p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  So, this is an investigation, a criminal  investigation of Audi and it involves the alleged fraud by some 20 former  and current employees and one of those is Rupert Stadler.  He is being  investigated.  </p><p>Now, he was arrested, Richard.  He is being detained because of the risk of  evidence tampering or influencing other witnesses, other managers from Audi  over the scandal, so that is why he is being detained today.  </p><p>We knew that his apartment was raided last week and today, the Volkswagen  supervisory board were meeting to discuss this amongst other things, so  everyone is on tenterhooks wondering whether or not he will be forced to  tender his resignation.  </p><p>QUEST:  Okay, so let's be clear about this, the emissions scandal related  to Volkswagen cars, where does the emission scandal fit into the whole Audi  question?  </p><p>STEWART:  Well, Audi as a subsidiary of BW is also part of the emissions  diesel scandal.  It also had cars that were fitted with cheating devices  like Volkswagen, but there is a separate investigation that has also linked  Volkswagen and watched those CEOs and managers know.  </p><p>What they want to know here, Richard is who knew what when and what did  they do about it?  Was it transparent?  Many shareholders have brought this  up in separate lawsuits.  I mean, there are numerous lawsuits around this  saying there wasn't enough transparency from the Board on how big the  liabilities would be.  </p><p>As you said, tens of billions of dollars.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right, so that's already been paid, but the moment somebody  gets locked up and I am trying to remember how many of the people have been  locked up in this case, and I am not sure there have been any, but the  moment somebody gets locked up on allegation of -- or potential allegation  of witness tampering, then we're moving into a different area, a much more  serious area of criminality in that sense.  </p><p>STEWART:  Absolutely, I think it would be much harder to really dodge this  bullet as a CEO.  The Board has been incredibly supportive of Rupert  Stadler throughout, his being in the company since 1990, and he has faced  many calls for his resignation over the last couple of years.  </p><p>[00:05:12]  </p><p>STEWART:  Particularly, actually from minority shareholders, but the Board  has supported him every step of the way, and actually last year, despite  what he has caused, they actually extended his contract by five years.  </p><p>But as you say, bringing someone under arrest changes the story entirely,  so everyone is watching to see what will happen in the next sort of 12  hours.  </p><p>QUEST:  Anna Stewart, thank you for putting that clearly into perspective  for us.  Thank you.  </p><p>Now, stocks are down almost everywhere you choose to look.  In fact, there  was -- the Dow opened lower and although it recovered, it really was a  fairly sharp fall.  Look at the grid and you will see.  The Dow was off in  its worse point down about 260 to 270 points, so it did come back quite a  lot.  </p><p>But still close of 133 and failed to hold the 25,000 mark.  Similarly,  losses -- percentage-wise, much less for the NASDAQ and indeed, the fan  stocks for most of the day were actually higher.  But, that misery could be  seen of what we saw or we had just been talking about, not only with Angela  Merkel, but Audi can certainly be seen here with the Xetra DAX which is off  1.3 percent and indeed, over the whole market, if you look at the global  markets, you've got the US, you've got Europe, you've got Asia.  </p><p>It was the Xetra DAX, which is the one that has the biggest fallout, the  political fallout for Angela Merkel.  US stocks were also lower, it's the  trade wars that were worrying those.  Paul La Monica is with us.  And Paul,  as we look at this graph over here, we can see clearly, we were down about  252 to 260 odd points at the open.  I mean, there were several attempts to  claw back but the day was still down quite sharply.  </p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, we couldn't get there.  We  obviously still had a triple digit loss and this is a similar pattern what  happened on Friday.  It looked as if the market was really going to fall  very sharply, things looked very bleak and then we recovered by the end of  the day.  </p><p>I am getting sense from talking to people that there still is nervousness  obviously about a potential trade war with China and just about every other  major country in the world -- with them and the US, but no one seems to be  panicking yet.  I think there is still this notion that the cooler heads  may eventually prevail, that this is just tough bluster by President Trump  et cetera.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, so there was an article in \"The Times\" over the weekend that  basically said, in the business section, why the trade war everybody is  saying Armageddon is dreadful, it will be awful, but there is no evidence  of that in the market.  </p><p>And Peter Tuchman at the exchange was saying to me today, look, there is  not the evidence of it yet in the market because the economy is strong.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  The economy is still strong, Richard.  Earnings growth for the  second quarter is expected to be extremely robust.  There's talk about  analysts projecting almost 20 percent profit growth year over year.  The  question is going to be when do companies start talking about the  nervousness coming into play for the rest of this year and next year.  </p><p>You've got the Atlanta Fed, President Raphael Bostic making a speech today  where he talked about how earlier this year, he was incredibly optimistic  because of the tax cuts, and now he is getting a sense that he is a little  bit more worried about the environment going forward because people are  telling him that yes, all of these trade bluster could have an impact on  their profits going forward.  </p><p>People are going to be a little bit more skittish.  They may not buy as  much as stuff, both corporations and consumers and I think that's a  legitimate concern going forward.  </p><p>QUEST:  It's interesting when we look at it.  It's good to see -- didn't  you say, as we look at the market, it has tried to rally, and it did to a  certain extent, but could not do it.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  At least not for the Dow, but the NASDAQ did finish positive.   You've got people still loving those companies like Facebook and Google and  Netflix, Amazon.  They seem to be resistant to all of these macro concerns.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you.  Thank you.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  When we return, President Trump is looking beyond his borders with  dominance and out into the universe -- we will look for his plans for a  Space Force, what that actually means, and Jay-Z and Beyonce remind the  world they have their own streaming service and then promptly, we get all  the results upon arrival.  Go figure.  </p><p>[16:15:00]  </p><p>QUEST:  Now, I do need to just correct one or two minor matters.  We showed  you all the market numbers earlier, and I am afraid, I think that the  machine must have frozen.  The top line, the US market shows the Dow, we  had it down 113 points, it's not 103 at the close, but the important thing  which Paul La Monica quite rightly points out, the NASDAQ actually did eke  out a small gain for the session.  </p><p>So, just to correct.  In case you were a little bit concerned that it  didn't look like we've got it exactly right.  We didn't get it right, but  we have got it right now.  </p><p>Google is betting a half a million dollars on China and that's despite  Google being blocked mostly by Beijing.  Clare Sebastian is here.  Who are  they buying and how much?  </p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  They are buying just under 1 percent  of jd.com for $550 million in cash, Richard, so obviously, this is a big  foray into China for Google.  They have basically not been operating in  terms of their search maps, e-mails, YouTube entirely since 2010, but  clearly, they haven't given up on the country.  </p><p>We have seen little moves in this direction.  They have got two apps in the  country.  They have got translation and they have got file management.   They have visiting since -- which I was there back in November.  They have  opened an AI center there, so I think this is more of the same  (inaudible)...  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>QUEST:  Remind us why they are not there as Google.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Right, because of the Chinese's government's laws on  censorship.  They basically couldn't comply ethically with the rules there  and they left in 2010.  </p><p>QUEST:  And they pulled out.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  They pulled out despite the fact that there are 730 million  Internet users in China, Richard, more than twice the US's entire  population, they still pulled out.  But this is something they kind of  ignored -- the size and scale of this market.  But it is important for  jd.com as well.  </p><p>QUEST:  Why?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Because jd.com just like Alibaba, you've seen them you know,  doing road shows in the US and beyond.  They want to expand outside of  China, that's really important for them because the market there, even  though it is huge isn't growing at the same rate as it was.  So, there is  room for growth.  It seems to be international, South East Asia, Europe,  the US -- all of these areas jd.com will be able to access through the  steel.  Its products will be on Google Shopping and there are more what  they call retail solutions on the guard...  </p><p>QUEST:  But what does jd.com do in the EU?  We think of jd.com like  Alibaba, as just being China's version of Amazon?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Actually, jd.com is even more China's version of Amazon and  Alibaba is because it has the logistics network.  I've got a video I think  of one of their fully automated warehouses.  They do what Amazon does.   They have their own logistics there.  They do two-hour delivery in 50-plus  cities around China.  </p><p>So, they really do the kind of -- the supply chain that is crucial to e- commerce, and I think that's what Google is so interested in here.  They  haven't cracked the e-commerce yet.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thanks.  Good.  Thank you.  Clare Sebastian.  Big tech firms like  Google aren't the only ones working in this more complex environment.  John  Stankey, the new head of our parent company, WarnerMedia tells \"New Day\"  that everything in the entire economy is more difficult now.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>JOHN STANKEY, CEO, WARNERMEDIA:  I think everything in the industry right  now is probably more complex and more difficult than it has ever been, and  I think if you were sitting over at Facebook today and asking about what  it's like to run their business, the transparency dynamic that any company  has to run under and the volatility that it brings in the decision making,  that's just part of industry today and I don't think it's unique to our  circumstances.  I think it's just broad scale across the economy right now.  </p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN HOST:  So, for all of our viewers who are watching,  they want to know what this means for them, are there costs going up?  What  else -- how will this affect them?  </p><p>STANKEY:  Contrary to what the government alleged, no.  Our goal here is  actually to innovate on product and you know, for me, personally, why I am  excited to be here, I have always been happiest in my career when I get to  build things and do unique things and do things that are different.  </p><p>And our goal here is to invest in this business and our goal is to do it in  a way that provides for platforms and capabilities that are consistent with  where technology is taking things.  And you know, a classic example might  be here at CNN.  </p><p>[16:20:11]  </p><p>STANKEY:  How can we broaden the distribution of the great content you guys  build every day?  How can we make it more readily available and the push  lifestyle that everybody leads and I think there are some very exciting  things to do in that regard.  </p><p>So, it's about innovating, it's about building new product, it's about  investing heavier in content.  It's certainly not about going out and just  trying to think about we want to raise prices on content for what other  people buy.  </p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  I think that's interesting because there  have been some concerns in the cable industry that we are in a period of  decline or shrinkage as opposed to growth and investment?  And you're  saying in places like HBO, there is more money that should be spent?  </p><p>STANKEY:  Look, I think that the model as we know it today, you know,  standard linear television is a very immature model.  Standard linear  television in the form how ads are supported in it.  </p><p>But there is an opportunity to innovate in that regard, not only with how  the content is configured, but to think about how advertising supports that  content, and that's why we established the advertising entity with an AT&amp;T  that is being led by Brian Lesser.  </p><p>The purpose of that is to start building the new ad formats and the more  targeted advertising.  They can lower ad loads and still monetize content  the way where it remains affordable for the customer.  </p><p>So, that's the kind of innovation we are going to be working on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you.  The CEO of Warner Media, my boss.  President Trump has  ordered the creation of a Space Force, calling it the sixth branch of the  Armed Forces.  Now, the appropriate name, Barbara Starr, joins me from the  Pentagon.  </p><p>All right, a Space Force will do what?  </p><p>BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  I haven't actually thought  about that, Richard, until you mentioned it.  Well, you know, I thought I  would try not to make the \"Star Wars,\" \"Star Trek,\" \"Battlestar Galactica\"  jokes, but let me have a go at it.  </p><p>I mean, you know, this is not a brand new idea.  It's something the  Pentagon has long been involved in and trying to make sure that its  satellites in space, the things that it relies in for war fighting are safe  and secure from adversaries, and that the US can dominate in space.  </p><p>So, we already know that some parts of the military pay an awful lot of  attention to this, especially the US Air Force.  </p><p>The President has for some time now talked about he wants a separate Space  Force.  Not getting total support from the Pentagon about all of that  because there is a lot of worry, it's just going to wind up being more  bureaucracy, but here is a bit of today when the President announced this,  a bit of his vision from the White House.  </p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This time, we will do more  than plant our flag and leave our footprints, we will establish a long term  presence, expand our economy and build the foundation for the eventual  mission to Mars, which is actually going to happen very quickly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>STARR:  Well, going to Mars quickly, we will see, as with all things in the  United States government.  It is going to depend on Congress' funding all  of these ideas that the President has, but let's look at a very practical  task ahead.  One of the biggest things in space for the US military for  example is to make sure its GPS satellites -- global positioning satellites  -- are always safe and secure because if you have an adversary trying to  take those out somehow with some sort of attack, that would not just  devastate US war fighting capabilities around the world, it would devastate  communications around the world.  </p><p>So, it gives you an idea of how much it is a problem, how much it is an  issue, but is the President's solution the one that Pentagon wants, not  exactly clear just yet that it is, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  Okay, so Barbara, with all of this, I guess, you know for a  President that loves hype, obviously this has been in the works for some  time, what is that gap between hype and reality to fruition and execution?  </p><p>STARR:  Well, for people, for top commanders in the US military, their  question starts with if there is something out there that we are not doing  to defend and protect Americans in that space environment, is there  something more we should be doing?  </p><p>A lot of money, time and attention is being paid to the very question --  advanced defensive capabilities, defensive information attacks all of that,  the key question I think, Richard, Congress wants to see something happen,  but there may be a very limited appetite for an entire new branch of the US  military.  </p><p>QUEST:  Our own shining star bright and comets skating and great to tell us  the story, Barbara, good to see you as always, thank you.  </p><p>STARR:  Thanks.  </p><p>QUEST:  Barbara Starr at the Pentagon.  Now, from space to slightly at  lower altitude, but we all get to fly anyway where Lufthansa, now, we know  Norwegian has received already two bids and rejected them from IAG -- the  owners of BA et cetera.  </p><p>[16:25:16]  </p><p>QUEST:  Lufthansa is reporting they have now been in contact with Norwegian  Air Shuttle as well.  So, you have Lufthansa and British Airways and IAG  interested in buying Europe's third biggest aircraft low cost group.  Both  have budget players in play.  </p><p>I wanted to look at the destination board and we are going to show you  exactly why this is so fascinating because if you look for example at what  Lufthansa already owns at the moment, you will see the complexity.  </p><p>Now, you've obviously got in the Lufthansa group, Lufthansa the German,  Swiss the Swiss Airline, you've got CityLine which is the regional;  Edelweiss, the low cost; German Wings and Euro Wings and your Austrian --  they are the main components that Lufthansa already owns within it.  </p><p>It's already got as well minority stakes in the Aerologic and Sun Express,  so Lufthansa on the one side.  Now, you've got AIG and if you look at the  airlines AIG has, you'll see exactly how significant that is going to be.  </p><p>BA, Iberia and Aer Lingus, Vueling and Level, they are the majorities  already that they have got.  They are the big carriers that they have got.   The minority stakes that -- this is the key one, the key one here, there.   Already got 4 percent of Norwegian, nearly 5 percent.  </p><p>So, on the both hands, you have Lufthansa and you have IAG, two of the  largest groups in the world now both seemingly doing battle trying to get  Norwegian.  I can tell you from within the industry, the view is Lufthansa  may just have the upper hand in all of this if Carsten Spohr decides to go  for the full bid, may indeed.  </p><p>But Willie Walsh is not going to give up easily, neither Chief Execs,  neither Spohr, nor Walsh is prepared to overbid for an airline that they  see is already in trouble.  </p><p>We will have more after the break.  </p><p>Hello, I am Richard Quest, there is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a  moment.  When Beyonce and Jay-Z set up for a big weekend on their streaming  service and how title's rivals are catching up and arguably, the two of  them shot themselves in their own fight for bid.  </p><p>And the World Health Organization now shows that video game addiction is  real.  I will speak to the founder of a rehab center for gamers.  As we  continue, you are watching CNN and here, the facts always come first.  </p><p>President Trump is again falsely shaming his political opponents, the  Democrats for his own policy on immigration which resulted in family  separation at the borders.  In remarks earlier today, President Trump said  the US would not become a migrant camp for refugee holding facility.  </p><p>[16:30:16]  Meanwhile, the new CNN poll shows most Republicans approve of  the policies which meant more parents and children being separated at the  border.  Overall, two-thirds of Americans disapprove, the president's  approval rating is now at 39 percent. </p><p>Chancellor Merkel of Germany has been given two weeks to reach an agreement  with the EU on a new immigration policy that both members of our coalition  government can support.  The CSU Party, her partners wants a deal to ban  migrants who have already applied for asylum elsewhere from entering  Germany.</p><p>CSU says if there's no deal, it will unilaterally move forward with the  plan.  In Britain, the Prime Minister Theresa May has suffered a fresh  defeat of her Brexit plans.  The House of Lords voted to give parliament  the final say on what happens in the event her government fails to reach an  exit deal with the EU. </p><p>The legislation is to be debated in the House of Commons on Wednesday.   Croatia's Nikola Kalinic has been sent home from the World Cup after he  refused to come on as a substitute.  The striker said he couldn't play  against Nigeria because of a back problem. </p><p>His coach pointed out he also refused to play during a friendly with Brazil  earlier this month.  A thriller outside of Saint Petersburg where a short  while ago England defeated Tunisia, it's the end of day five in the 2018  World Cup.  After some early missed chances, England's Captain Harry Kane  gave his team an early 1-0 lead, Tunisia leveled it with a penalty, and  that was just before the end of the first half.</p><p>Then as time was draining away, it was Harry Kane again with a dramatic  header -- yes, and to give England the 2-1 victory.  Amanda Davies is in  Moscow -- it's a haunting of a match. </p><p>AMANDA DAVIES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Richard, it was, but it's dangerous  times because England have won their opening match of this World Cup, and  everybody in England has been doing so well in terms of playing down  expectations for this very young, relatively untested England side. </p><p>Now, they've won, you do worry what happens next.  It wasn't the most  convincing performance, it has to be said, but there was some very exciting  moments within the side against a Tunisian team that -- or in their first  World Cup since 2006 and we knew it would sit very deep, defend very deep  in numbers.</p><p>So it was always going to be tough with this England side.  The moment that  you do get excited about is the fact, so in days gone by, a warm one,  England's generally would have settled for that or even worst perhaps  conceded a late goal.</p><p>But these guys kept on pushing, kept going and Harry Kane led by example as  the captain as you said to score the winner in the 91st minute, and you saw  -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>DAVIES:  Just what it meant to him and his manager Gary Southgate, a  massive results early doors. </p><p>QUEST:  Oh, hang on Amanda, it's better to win than lose. </p><p>DAVIES:  Absolutely Richard, but you know, I have been through some downs  and downs.  A little, a few ups.  But more downs as an England -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>DAVIES:  Supporter over the years, and so you know, I am wearing my red  dress, I wore my shirt this morning for breakfast, so we've got to be  realistic about it.  As this is, you know, one of the rare groups, after  this point in the competition has actually gone to plan with the big teams  -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>DAVIES:  Drawing their opening games, Belgium also won earlier today.  So  compared to what we've seen with Brazil, with Argentina, with Germany  losing yesterday, we know that you can't take anything for granted at all  in a World Cup. </p><p>QUEST:  And the beauty of all of this is that the atmosphere is starting to  build.  Whether it'd be the Germany match or even the first match from  Russia and Saudi Arabia right the way through to this match, the atmosphere  is building up as it's supposed to. </p><p>DAVIES:  Yes, it truly is a World Cup.  We're just at the bottom of Red  Square as we've said to you before, and there's a lot of Mexican fans,  there's been some Colombian fans here today.  And remember four years ago,  Richard, you had your flag pole of flags really and you were texting me as  to which flag needed to come out on which day. </p><p>And today, that was really tested, I had a fantastic moment by Saint  Basil's which has been open for the first time after they've taken down all  the stadium from the concert last week.  </p><p>[16:35:00] And there were three fans, there was a Mexican and Argentinean  and a Spaniard having a photo taken. </p><p>And then they saw a Colombian and said, come on over, and then there was a  Peruvian who joined the party and then there was some Moroccan fans who  joined the party and a German and a Swedish fan, and it was really a  fantastic moment in front of Saint Basil's, seeing everybody in their shirt  with their flags and it is what you would hope a World Cup would turn out  to be. </p><p>QUEST:  And be assured, Miss Davies, that your vexillology knowledge will  be required before we are finished, because the flags return, the flags  return when the economic World Cup returns once we get into the knockout  rounds which comes later.</p><p>So you may not rest easy, you'll be up all night studying flags, good to  see you.</p><p>DAVIES:  I will, bye-bye. </p><p>QUEST:  Sorted that out.  Beyonce and Jay-Z say they don't care about the  music industry's obsession with streaming numbers. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Plenty stuff, there it is, streaming service and the streaming  business, we're going to see -- discuss what it says about the future of  Tidal streaming service.  That they bring out a new album, maybe it's  exclusive to them and then give it to everybody else -- after the break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Beyonce and Jay z dropped the surprise album over the weekend, it  wasn't expected.  It managed to get the whole world talking about their  streaming service Tidal once again.</p><p>Fans were sent rushing to the app because it was only app -- it was the  only way to hear the album at first.  Now Beyonce and Jay z have given it  to the mega streaming rival Spotify, Apple and Amazon. </p><p>And speaking of Spotify, Beyonce has some choice words about the music  business and its obsession with streaming numbers.  Listen carefully. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Savory stuff, Larry Miller is here thankfully.  Help us to  understand it, director of music business at the NYU Steinhardt School.   We'll get on to the obsession with streaming numbers in a moment.</p><p>But being weird to surprisingly release your own material on your own  streaming service that you've got an interest in and then given away to the  competition the next day. </p><p>LARRY MILLER, DIRECTOR OF MUSIC BUSINESS, NYU STEINHARDT SCHOOL:  Well,  true enough.  And if we go back to not so long ago when \"Lemonade\" dropped,  of course that dropped on an \"Hbo\" special, but it was also exclusively  available on Tidal for a short period of time. </p><p>[16:40:00] QUEST:  It was exclusive for a day. </p><p>MILLER:  Yes, right, that's very short. </p><p>QUEST:  That's very short. </p><p>MILLER:  That's very short indeed.  But I think that streaming has evolved  and the music industry has evolved and Spotify have about $180 million  subscribers and Apple have another $40 million or so, and Amazon have many  and there are other places people go to stream music.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, but if you are Beyonce and Jay z, you're not worried about  the money necessarily. </p><p>MILLER:  Right.  </p><p>QUEST:  And if you are committed to your Tidal streaming service, you're  prepared to take the punishment that will come by insisting it's only  there.  So why give it away? </p><p>MILLER:  Well, it's important to be where the eyeballs are and air balls  are.  And any artist wants to be able to gather attention around their  latest music -- </p><p>QUEST:  But you can't have both, Larry, you can't -- I mean, what I'm  trying to say is it suggests a lack of commitment to Tidal that they would  have done it so quickly -- </p><p>MILLER:  Well -- </p><p>QUEST:  Not even seven days. </p><p>MILLER:  Right, not even seven days.  And so in today's tension economy,  who knows what we'll be thinking about a week from now.  And so right now,  while attention is riveted on Beyonce and Jay z and that amazing video they  chose to make some music available a day later. </p><p>QUEST:  The louver, they got access to the louver -- </p><p>MILLER:  Amazing -- </p><p>QUEST:  For this video which is extraordinary, which is gratifying in a  sense to see the amount of money and the amount of effort and care on  production values that are put into these, some things, even though sort of  extreme things as you say, here today, gone tomorrow. </p><p>MILLER:  Fair enough, and so it's incumbent upon artists and the people who  they work with today to be able to drive attention by releasing music and  video and other things in other to maintain attention for as long as  possible.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, so as to Beyonce's somewhat vulgar references to streaming and  let me -- and then Spotify, you're right, it's a numbers game.  I mean, I'm  glad you're -- we've got -- the music business expert here, it's a numbers  game and Spotify has got the numbers, 175 million. </p><p>MILLER:  It is. </p><p>QUEST:  Right, as anybody else, I mean, if you want to be heard, you've got  to go there. </p><p>MILLER:  Yes, you need to be aware that people are and let's not forget,  they are in the middle of what I believe is a gigantic sold-out stadium -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>MILLER:  For -- they just finished playing in the big football stadium in  London -- </p><p>QUEST:  They did, Wembley.  Quick final question, can we say that Spotify  is now too big to fail? </p><p>MILLER:  I think it's hard to say in this day and age whether anything  really is too big to fail, but they are the leader in a growing and super  important segment of the music business that now accounts for two-thirds of  the revenue in the country. </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you sir, thank you. </p><p>MILLER:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>QUEST:  As we continue tonight, you want to stay on top of the day's  business news and headlines in just 90 seconds and try our daily briefing  podcast, it's updated twice a day before and after the bell rings on Wall  Street, (INAUDIBLE) or Google for CNN flash briefing, just try it, see what  you get, and if it doesn't work, e-mail me.</p><p>When we return, Britain's Brexit blues are starting a report, claims the  U.K. is about to see its lowest growth if the financial crisis and things  aren't going to get much better any time soon. </p><p>[16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  So in the pubs of London where it is still time to get the last  order of drinks, and I suspect the England victory is dominating, but once  the thrilling World Cup win sort of dissipates, the U.K. will come back to  earth.</p><p>The British Chamber of Commerce is now predicting it will be the weakest  year of growth for the U.K. economy in almost a decade.  Adam Marshall is  the Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, good to see you,  Adam, thank you for taking time tonight. </p><p>I hope you saw the final results, you saw the game before popping into  Australia's to join us.  But it is sobering, your numbers, I mean, it  doesn't show complete collapse of destitution, but it does show sub-par  growth for the foreseeable future.</p><p>ADAM MARSHALL, DIRECTOR GENERAL, BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE:  I think  that's right, Richard, we are looking at about 1.3 percent growth this  year, 1.4 next year and 1.6 in 2020.  Those are not the sorts of numbers  that really blow the doors off when it comes to a major advanced economy. </p><p>And I think what we'd like to see is two things, one obviously, firms want  to see clarity on Brexit as that debate rumbles on terminally.  And I think  in the U.K., there's also a sense that we have other things to get on with  as well to make conditions great for business.</p><p>And there's quite -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>MARSHALL:  A lot that the government needs to do here at home as well. </p><p>QUEST:  Is there -- is this lone number, is it predicated on the  uncertainty on what happens or is there a general view now within the BCC  and you're an economist, that whatever happens immediately after Brexit,  growth will be lower, even in best case scenario, the U.K. will not be as  well off as it was within the EU. </p><p>MARSHALL:  Well, the U.K. will certainly see slower growth that it might  have done had the country not gone down this route at least in the very  short term, that is what we are forecasting.  But I think there are some  other factors that work here as well. </p><p>Obviously, some of the global trade skirmishes that we've been seeing in  recent weeks, unsettled businesses here in the U.K. about their future  prospects.  So anything that happens between the U.S. and China for  example, they may sneeze but the U.K. may very well catch cold as well.</p><p>Same thing about input prices and oil prices -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>MARSHALL:  Which have been going up for a lot of U.K. companies too. </p><p>QUEST:  And on this question of future growth, obviously, you would have  preferred -- I mean, I know the BCC, it would have preferred a single  market access.  But if you can't get single market access, what is your  preferred option for Customs Union and the way forward especially now we  seem to be at that essential moment when the negotiation has to decide  which way to go. </p><p>MARSHALL:  Well, our firms are not much interested in the chronology(ph)  about this.  They see a lot of labels around Customs Union and single  market.  And what they say to us is they want answers on practical  questions.  Who do I pay tax to? Who can I hire? How long can they stay in  my business? </p><p>Who is my regulator going to be? And those sorts of practical questions are  what really are driving a lot of business considerations around this.  You  could call the rapport(ph), whatever you want to, but businesses want  clarity on their trading conditions and they need to see that with some  urgency over the next few months. </p><p>QUEST:  OK, so we've had the white paper recently from the -- well, we had  the agreement back in March, we've had a white paper, we've got the current  disarray one might arguably say in parliament.  You just saw today  obviously, that the lords says -- once again voted that it should take  primacy if there's no deal. </p><p>Something that the Commons is going to have to look back at.  I mean, yes,  I guess I'm taking you into the chronology of the Brexit process and what  you're telling me is it's not very helpful. </p><p>MARSHALL:  It's not, in fact, a lot of firms around the country who say  look, they're watching and waiting, but what they need is something  concrete upon which they can act -- </p><p>QUEST:  They're not going to get it I think --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>I've got news for you, that's exactly -- I mean, and that's the dirty  secret here isn't it? They're not going to get it and even once the  agreement is signed, there's still going to be a level of uncertainty that  will be damaging to your members.  Can you accept that? </p><p>MARSHALL:  No, I think businesses know that there's going to be uncertainty  for some time to come, a very few pundits have said to us, well, once you  negotiate with the European Union, you negotiate with the European Union  forever. </p><p>It's very likely to be the case that those negotiations will be ongoing for  a long time.  But businesses do need a degree of certainty here, Richard,  they do need something to work off of, and I think their biggest dismay,  their biggest opprobrium is actually for the U.K. politicians, they can't  agree on a route forward to go into that negotiating room.</p><p>[16:50:00] Because what we know in business is you go into a negotiation  with a clear position and that's what we need our government to do.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, let's just talk about these, the strength at the moment of  the U.K. economy.  All right, unemployment is down and there could be a  labor shortage, but wage inflation is starting to pick up again.  Now, the  Bank of England would like to start raising rates because inflation has  started to move up, but it can't because of their -- I mean, all roads lead  back to Brexit because of the uncertainty. </p><p>But the economy itself is fundamentally robust. </p><p>MARSHALL:  Yes, there's some strength in the economy, it's been threading  water though as the way we like to put it.  It's not sinking, but it is  threading water.  We're not seeing the kind of growth we'd want to see.</p><p>These are the interest rates we're forecasting one rise over the coming  months and perhaps one more in the period until 2020.  But even the window  for those minimal source of rise to 75 or a 100 basis points is starting to  close.  Because as you rightly say, uncertainty is going to mean the bank  is going to want to keep conditions as smooth as possible for business.</p><p>So we don't see a very strong case for significant rate rises in the near  future.</p><p>QUEST:  You'll forgive me if I don't say I'm sorry to hear that, I mean,  got a U.K. mortgage, I'm rather glad that it might be a little bit longer  to enjoy the good times, good to see you sir, thank you. </p><p>MARSHALL:  And you, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  We'll talk more about this in detail as the process goes on, good  to have you.  The games industry is taking in $100 billion, that's right,  $100 billion a year.  The World Health Organization is now warning it could  be triggering(ph) a new public health concern. </p><p>It's called gaming disorder and it's just been listed as a mental health  condition.  It describes compulsive players who just plays from similar to  those of gambling addicts.  The WHO says it applies to behavior lasting 12  months or more.</p><p>Joining me now is the co-founder of a rehab center for internet and video  gaming addiction is Hilarie Cash, she joins me from reSTART which is live  from Seattle in Washington.  Were you surprised that it's taken so long to  get the WHO to recognize gaming as a gaming disorder. </p><p>HILARIE CASH, CO-FOUNDER, RESTART:  Not really, I -- you know, this whole  phenomenon has taken the world by storm and actually moving very quickly.   And research, you know, they're going to make their decisions based on the  research findings.  And research is by its nature rather slow. </p><p>So I think it's not -- but I think I'm just glad it's finally here. </p><p>QUEST:  What are the symptoms of gaming disorder? How does somebody  recognize when they've got it? </p><p>CASH:  I think the best way to think about it is that when you are out of  control and you are gaming in spite of its negative consequences, you've  got a problem.</p><p>QUEST:  And the treatment for it, how far does it accord to the other  traditional addictions? Obviously, drugs, alcohol, gambling, overspending,  all the others.  Does it follow the same model for treatment, whether it'd  be the 12-step model or otherwise? </p><p>CASH:  Well, I can tell you that our model of treatment is to be very  holistic in what we're trying to do.  So we are -- the adults as well as  the adolescents tries spending at least two months free of all screens, and  the idea is that they need that time to -- for their brains to come back to  normal functioning, they need that time to get their health back, they  usually are chronically sleep deprived, unfit and they've been eating very  poorly for a long time. </p><p>So they're getting their health back, they're developing skills that they  really are going to need if they're going to be functional young adults.   And they're getting a plan together for how they're going to abuse digital  technology again in a sustainable and healthy way. </p><p>After that two months period, there's been if they choose and about 80  percent of them do choose, you go on to the second phase of the program,  that's the phase where they're now for the adults living in apartments  together in -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>CASH:  In small groups, they're getting part-time work and they're just  starting to live life like adults need to live life -- </p><p>QUEST:  OK, so final question, with the other addictions, alcohol, drugs  and the like, the general view is total abstinence.  What is too many, a  thousand, never enough.  With gaming addiction or gaming disorder, do you  believe that you can't do it at all or do you believe there's a manageable  way you can do it. </p><p>CASH:  Well, I think there's a manageable way you can use a digital  technology.  </p><p>[16:55:00] I think if you're gaming addict, you're really getting on thin  ice if you try to go back to gaming and chances are very high that you will  relapse.  So we ask the guys when they come into program and are developing  what we call the life balance friend -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>CASH:  To think through -- what are their bottom lines and those bottom  lines almost always are going to include video games. </p><p>QUEST:  Good to talk to you, thank you, I appreciate your time tonight,  thank you.  We will have a different profitable moment after the break,  this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS live from New York. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, it is lovely in an era where we are  talking about the misery and mayhem that we're able to turn our attention  to something much more pleasant.  Weddings within the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS  team who makes no apology for showing you the very best that we have got. </p><p>Our senior producer John and his new bride Ali(ph), yes, that's the two at  the front, and the rest are the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS team that all sort of  -- I think the director summed it up rather well.  I think -- well, she  says you all scrubbed up rather nicely over the weekend. </p><p>And our technical director Rick Flair(ph) and his new wife Emily, yes, they  also scrubbed up rather nicely on the way to and from their ceremony.  So  we take this opportunity because it's only right and proper that we  remember this program that we bring to you every night with love and  privilege is made by people behind the cameras and they actually put it  together. </p><p>And today, four of them have enjoyed weddings.  And that is QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York.  Whatever you're up  to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.  Congratulations to all my  colleagues. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It has pulled up quite considerably from the  opening of force, but PSE giving the closing bell.  So, we have got one  wimpy one and one okay one, but trading is over.  It is Monday, 18th of  June.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, two weeks to save her coalition.  German stocks down heavily after  Angela Merkel gets an ultimatum from her own partners.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Audi's Chief Executive is under arrest.  Dieselgate is rumbling on and  Beyonce's new album has some shade for Spotify.  You can hear it now,  ironically, not exclusively on Spotify.  </p><p>I am Richard Quest, live from the world's financial capital, New York City  where it's mixing hot here, but where I still mean business.  </p><p>Good evening, Angela Merkel is facing a moment of reckoning.  She is being  given two weeks to save her coalition and resolve the immigration debate  that threatens to bring down Germany's fragile government.  </p><p>The Chancellor has been given an ultimatum -- overhaul Germany's migration  policies or face a new rebellion from coalition partners.  Facing his own  migration debate in the United States, President Trump seized on Mrs.  Merkel's position to launch an attack on Twitter.  He claims the migration  issue has caused the people of Germany to turn against their leader.   Investors seem concerned by the political turmoil.  </p><p>The Xetra DAX fell one percent on Monday, markets are unlikely to be  soothed by the words of the Chancellor's chief antagonist.  The CDU's party  leader warns the crisis won't be over any time soon.  </p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>HORST SEEHOFER, FEDERAL MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR:  (Through an  interpreter).  It is ridiculous to say now to determine public that is all  about those two weeks and then after that, it will all be wonderful.  </p><p>I repeated it to the Board gathered today.  I warn you that we are not out  of the woods yet, not at all.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Atika Shubert joins me now with the latest from Berlin.  Two weeks  -- now before we get to what happens in that two weeks, let's first of all  analyze the compromise that she has agreed to just to get the breathing  space for a proper negotiation.  </p><p>ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, well,  basically, you heard there from Horst Seehofer that of course is the  Interior Minister.  He is also the leader of the Bavaria sister party, the  Christian Social Union and he was threatening to essentially break up the  coalition government unless he was allowed to unveil the 63-point plan to  reduce migration, specifically, he wanted to reject the asylum seekers at  the border if they had already applied for asylum in other EU countries,  and that is where Merkel drew the line.  </p><p>She said, \"Listen, I can't accept that one point in your plan.  Give me two  weeks to find an alternate solution by brokering bilateral agreements.\"   And that is where we stand now.  So, she has to try and figure out those  deals with other EU nations come back on July 1st, report back to her party  and say, \"This is how I have resolved it.\"  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, but what is the core issue here?  I mean, I know it is  complex that she has to do it, but the agreement to allow for instance  migrants to stay in the country where they have arrived.  What is the  difference between her and her coalition partner?  </p><p>SHUBERT:  Well, the difference is essentially that of as you know, in the  EU, if you're applying for asylum, you're supposed to apply in the country  where you enter.  Unfortunately, this means that you get a disproportionate  number of asylum seekers in Italy, Greece and those external countries.  </p><p>Germany did take in about a million refugees during the 2015 crisis and  that as far as Seehofer and Merkel's critics are concerned is too many.   So, what they want to do is reduce the number by then saying, \"If you've  already applied in Italy, Greece or somewhere else, you can't come here to  Germany.\"  And then push them back.  </p><p>Now, Merkel is saying that's a violation of the EU principle of freedom of  movement and that Germany can't do that automatically.  It needs to broker  some sort of a deal if not with all of the EU, then bilateral agreements  with different EU partners.  That's the difference there.  </p><p>So, she has basically bought herself some time to try and broker those  agreements, and maybe stave off any political crisis at home.  </p><p>QUEST:  Is it likely though that the CSU would promote this to a full blown  crisis to the point where it would endanger the coalition and Merkel's  position?  </p><p>SHUBERT:  Well, that's the key question.  I mean, the CSU is looking at  Bavaria local elections in October, that's probably one reason they have  taken this up a notch to such high drama, but the reality is, if they broke  up the coalition, then the CDU, the Christian Democrats could field their  own candidates in Bavaria and it could end up hurting the CSU in the long  run.  </p><p>[16:05:12]  </p><p>SHUBERT:  Also, as much as the general public wants to see tougher  immigration laws, they don't want to see another round of elections coming  up.  So, it could work out that the CSU says, \"Listen, we have proven our  point, now we will just back down,\" but we'll know better in about two  weeks, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  Atika Shubert in Berlin.  Elmar Brok is a member of the European  Parliament -- Parliament of the House and a close ally of Chancellor  Merkel, joins me now from Verl in Germany.  Good to see you, sir.  Thank  you.  </p><p>How likely is it how that a solution can be found in the two weeks  breathing speace that Chancellor Merkel has been given, bearing in mind,  she is going to have to get a green light from the other parties, the other  countries in Europe?  </p><p>ELMAR BROK, MEMBER, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:  Look at the party (ph) this  morning and there was a very strong support from all the leaders of our  party and the thing she was pressing (ph), that was the European solution.   And (ph) now that per month, 95 percent less migration in (ph) countries  than we had October 2015.  The great success story and many other measures  were taken, and here is a small question around -- around France about was  the close with their regional elections and I believe that that (inaudible)  and Mrs. Merkel will talk to the neighboring countries because she says if  she does not do that without an agreement with our neighboring countries,  we will (ph) -- these measures will have no effect.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right, is in your view -- I mean, it may not be nice or  pleasant to say this, but is the German coalition in danger over this  issue?  </p><p>BROK:  Look, you can never know how far people go, but (inaudible) on that  with interest (inaudible) breakdown, nothing would be delivered.  And also  about (inaudible) success (inaudible) for the elections.  The only  (inaudible) would be the (inaudible) party and therefore, I believe that if  some things were to be pushed forward, but that at the end of the day,  government will stable (inaudible) of the Bavaria Party in their own  elections.  </p><p>QUEST:  Elmar Brok, thank you.  We will keep it short because we have a  poor connection tonight, so we will talk to you hopefully again in the  future about this, but thank you for joining us in this evening.  </p><p>Now, we say with Germany, there was no shortage of drama in the country  today after authorities arrested the Chief Executive of Audi, one of the  country's biggest auto makers.  Rupert Stadler was taken into custody.   Investigators are worried he could influence witnesses related to the  emission scandal.  </p><p>Shares in Audi's parent company, Volkswagen, which has already paid tens of  billions of Euros in fines and fees because of the emission scandal fell  sharply on the news.  Anna Stewart is in London.  What's he been arrested  for?  </p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  So, this is an investigation, a criminal  investigation of Audi and it involves the alleged fraud by some 20 former  and current employees and one of those is Rupert Stadler.  He is being  investigated.  </p><p>Now, he was arrested, Richard.  He is being detained because of the risk of  evidence tampering or influencing other witnesses, other managers from Audi  over the scandal, so that is why he is being detained today.  </p><p>We knew that his apartment was raided last week and today, the Volkswagen  supervisory board were meeting to discuss this amongst other things, so  everyone is on tenterhooks wondering whether or not he will be forced to  tender his resignation.  </p><p>QUEST:  Okay, so let's be clear about this, the emissions scandal related  to Volkswagen cars, where does the emission scandal fit into the whole Audi  question?  </p><p>STEWART:  Well, Audi as a subsidiary of BW is also part of the emissions  diesel scandal.  It also had cars that were fitted with cheating devices  like Volkswagen, but there is a separate investigation that has also linked  Volkswagen and watched those CEOs and managers know.  </p><p>What they want to know here, Richard is who knew what when and what did  they do about it?  Was it transparent?  Many shareholders have brought this  up in separate lawsuits.  I mean, there are numerous lawsuits around this  saying there wasn't enough transparency from the Board on how big the  liabilities would be.  </p><p>As you said, tens of billions of dollars.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right, so that's already been paid, but the moment somebody  gets locked up and I am trying to remember how many of the people have been  locked up in this case, and I am not sure there have been any, but the  moment somebody gets locked up on allegation of -- or potential allegation  of witness tampering, then we're moving into a different area, a much more  serious area of criminality in that sense.  </p><p>STEWART:  Absolutely, I think it would be much harder to really dodge this  bullet as a CEO.  The Board has been incredibly supportive of Rupert  Stadler throughout, his being in the company since 1990, and he has faced  many calls for his resignation over the last couple of years.  </p><p>[00:05:12]  </p><p>STEWART:  Particularly, actually from minority shareholders, but the Board  has supported him every step of the way, and actually last year, despite  what he has caused, they actually extended his contract by five years.  </p><p>But as you say, bringing someone under arrest changes the story entirely,  so everyone is watching to see what will happen in the next sort of 12  hours.  </p><p>QUEST:  Anna Stewart, thank you for putting that clearly into perspective  for us.  Thank you.  </p><p>Now, stocks are down almost everywhere you choose to look.  In fact, there  was -- the Dow opened lower and although it recovered, it really was a  fairly sharp fall.  Look at the grid and you will see.  The Dow was off in  its worse point down about 260 to 270 points, so it did come back quite a  lot.  </p><p>But still close of 133 and failed to hold the 25,000 mark.  Similarly,  losses -- percentage-wise, much less for the NASDAQ and indeed, the fan  stocks for most of the day were actually higher.  But, that misery could be  seen of what we saw or we had just been talking about, not only with Angela  Merkel, but Audi can certainly be seen here with the Xetra DAX which is off  1.3 percent and indeed, over the whole market, if you look at the global  markets, you've got the US, you've got Europe, you've got Asia.  </p><p>It was the Xetra DAX, which is the one that has the biggest fallout, the  political fallout for Angela Merkel.  US stocks were also lower, it's the  trade wars that were worrying those.  Paul La Monica is with us.  And Paul,  as we look at this graph over here, we can see clearly, we were down about  252 to 260 odd points at the open.  I mean, there were several attempts to  claw back but the day was still down quite sharply.  </p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, we couldn't get there.  We  obviously still had a triple digit loss and this is a similar pattern what  happened on Friday.  It looked as if the market was really going to fall  very sharply, things looked very bleak and then we recovered by the end of  the day.  </p><p>I am getting sense from talking to people that there still is nervousness  obviously about a potential trade war with China and just about every other  major country in the world -- with them and the US, but no one seems to be  panicking yet.  I think there is still this notion that the cooler heads  may eventually prevail, that this is just tough bluster by President Trump  et cetera.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, so there was an article in \"The Times\" over the weekend that  basically said, in the business section, why the trade war everybody is  saying Armageddon is dreadful, it will be awful, but there is no evidence  of that in the market.  </p><p>And Peter Tuchman at the exchange was saying to me today, look, there is  not the evidence of it yet in the market because the economy is strong.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  The economy is still strong, Richard.  Earnings growth for the  second quarter is expected to be extremely robust.  There's talk about  analysts projecting almost 20 percent profit growth year over year.  The  question is going to be when do companies start talking about the  nervousness coming into play for the rest of this year and next year.  </p><p>You've got the Atlanta Fed, President Raphael Bostic making a speech today  where he talked about how earlier this year, he was incredibly optimistic  because of the tax cuts, and now he is getting a sense that he is a little  bit more worried about the environment going forward because people are  telling him that yes, all of these trade bluster could have an impact on  their profits going forward.  </p><p>People are going to be a little bit more skittish.  They may not buy as  much as stuff, both corporations and consumers and I think that's a  legitimate concern going forward.  </p><p>QUEST:  It's interesting when we look at it.  It's good to see -- didn't  you say, as we look at the market, it has tried to rally, and it did to a  certain extent, but could not do it.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  At least not for the Dow, but the NASDAQ did finish positive.   You've got people still loving those companies like Facebook and Google and  Netflix, Amazon.  They seem to be resistant to all of these macro concerns.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you.  Thank you.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  When we return, President Trump is looking beyond his borders with  dominance and out into the universe -- we will look for his plans for a  Space Force, what that actually means, and Jay-Z and Beyonce remind the  world they have their own streaming service and then promptly, we get all  the results upon arrival.  Go figure.  </p><p>[16:15:00]  </p><p>QUEST:  Now, I do need to just correct one or two minor matters.  We showed  you all the market numbers earlier, and I am afraid, I think that the  machine must have frozen.  The top line, the US market shows the Dow, we  had it down 113 points, it's not 103 at the close, but the important thing  which Paul La Monica quite rightly points out, the NASDAQ actually did eke  out a small gain for the session.  </p><p>So, just to correct.  In case you were a little bit concerned that it  didn't look like we've got it exactly right.  We didn't get it right, but  we have got it right now.  </p><p>Google is betting a half a million dollars on China and that's despite  Google being blocked mostly by Beijing.  Clare Sebastian is here.  Who are  they buying and how much?  </p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  They are buying just under 1 percent  of jd.com for $550 million in cash, Richard, so obviously, this is a big  foray into China for Google.  They have basically not been operating in  terms of their search maps, e-mails, YouTube entirely since 2010, but  clearly, they haven't given up on the country.  </p><p>We have seen little moves in this direction.  They have got two apps in the  country.  They have got translation and they have got file management.   They have visiting since -- which I was there back in November.  They have  opened an AI center there, so I think this is more of the same  (inaudible)...  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>QUEST:  Remind us why they are not there as Google.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Right, because of the Chinese's government's laws on  censorship.  They basically couldn't comply ethically with the rules there  and they left in 2010.  </p><p>QUEST:  And they pulled out.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  They pulled out despite the fact that there are 730 million  Internet users in China, Richard, more than twice the US's entire  population, they still pulled out.  But this is something they kind of  ignored -- the size and scale of this market.  But it is important for  jd.com as well.  </p><p>QUEST:  Why?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Because jd.com just like Alibaba, you've seen them you know,  doing road shows in the US and beyond.  They want to expand outside of  China, that's really important for them because the market there, even  though it is huge isn't growing at the same rate as it was.  So, there is  room for growth.  It seems to be international, South East Asia, Europe,  the US -- all of these areas jd.com will be able to access through the  steel.  Its products will be on Google Shopping and there are more what  they call retail solutions on the guard...  </p><p>QUEST:  But what does jd.com do in the EU?  We think of jd.com like  Alibaba, as just being China's version of Amazon?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Actually, jd.com is even more China's version of Amazon and  Alibaba is because it has the logistics network.  I've got a video I think  of one of their fully automated warehouses.  They do what Amazon does.   They have their own logistics there.  They do two-hour delivery in 50-plus  cities around China.  </p><p>So, they really do the kind of -- the supply chain that is crucial to e- commerce, and I think that's what Google is so interested in here.  They  haven't cracked the e-commerce yet.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thanks.  Good.  Thank you.  Clare Sebastian.  Big tech firms like  Google aren't the only ones working in this more complex environment.  John  Stankey, the new head of our parent company, WarnerMedia tells \"New Day\"  that everything in the entire economy is more difficult now.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>JOHN STANKEY, CEO, WARNERMEDIA:  I think everything in the industry right  now is probably more complex and more difficult than it has ever been, and  I think if you were sitting over at Facebook today and asking about what  it's like to run their business, the transparency dynamic that any company  has to run under and the volatility that it brings in the decision making,  that's just part of industry today and I don't think it's unique to our  circumstances.  I think it's just broad scale across the economy right now.  </p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN HOST:  So, for all of our viewers who are watching,  they want to know what this means for them, are there costs going up?  What  else -- how will this affect them?  </p><p>STANKEY:  Contrary to what the government alleged, no.  Our goal here is  actually to innovate on product and you know, for me, personally, why I am  excited to be here, I have always been happiest in my career when I get to  build things and do unique things and do things that are different.  </p><p>And our goal here is to invest in this business and our goal is to do it in  a way that provides for platforms and capabilities that are consistent with  where technology is taking things.  And you know, a classic example might  be here at CNN.  </p><p>[16:20:11]  </p><p>STANKEY:  How can we broaden the distribution of the great content you guys  build every day?  How can we make it more readily available and the push  lifestyle that everybody leads and I think there are some very exciting  things to do in that regard.  </p><p>So, it's about innovating, it's about building new product, it's about  investing heavier in content.  It's certainly not about going out and just  trying to think about we want to raise prices on content for what other  people buy.  </p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  I think that's interesting because there  have been some concerns in the cable industry that we are in a period of  decline or shrinkage as opposed to growth and investment?  And you're  saying in places like HBO, there is more money that should be spent?  </p><p>STANKEY:  Look, I think that the model as we know it today, you know,  standard linear television is a very immature model.  Standard linear  television in the form how ads are supported in it.  </p><p>But there is an opportunity to innovate in that regard, not only with how  the content is configured, but to think about how advertising supports that  content, and that's why we established the advertising entity with an AT&amp;T  that is being led by Brian Lesser.  </p><p>The purpose of that is to start building the new ad formats and the more  targeted advertising.  They can lower ad loads and still monetize content  the way where it remains affordable for the customer.  </p><p>So, that's the kind of innovation we are going to be working on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you.  The CEO of Warner Media, my boss.  President Trump has  ordered the creation of a Space Force, calling it the sixth branch of the  Armed Forces.  Now, the appropriate name, Barbara Starr, joins me from the  Pentagon.  </p><p>All right, a Space Force will do what?  </p><p>BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  I haven't actually thought  about that, Richard, until you mentioned it.  Well, you know, I thought I  would try not to make the \"Star Wars,\" \"Star Trek,\" \"Battlestar Galactica\"  jokes, but let me have a go at it.  </p><p>I mean, you know, this is not a brand new idea.  It's something the  Pentagon has long been involved in and trying to make sure that its  satellites in space, the things that it relies in for war fighting are safe  and secure from adversaries, and that the US can dominate in space.  </p><p>So, we already know that some parts of the military pay an awful lot of  attention to this, especially the US Air Force.  </p><p>The President has for some time now talked about he wants a separate Space  Force.  Not getting total support from the Pentagon about all of that  because there is a lot of worry, it's just going to wind up being more  bureaucracy, but here is a bit of today when the President announced this,  a bit of his vision from the White House.  </p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This time, we will do more  than plant our flag and leave our footprints, we will establish a long term  presence, expand our economy and build the foundation for the eventual  mission to Mars, which is actually going to happen very quickly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>STARR:  Well, going to Mars quickly, we will see, as with all things in the  United States government.  It is going to depend on Congress' funding all  of these ideas that the President has, but let's look at a very practical  task ahead.  One of the biggest things in space for the US military for  example is to make sure its GPS satellites -- global positioning satellites  -- are always safe and secure because if you have an adversary trying to  take those out somehow with some sort of attack, that would not just  devastate US war fighting capabilities around the world, it would devastate  communications around the world.  </p><p>So, it gives you an idea of how much it is a problem, how much it is an  issue, but is the President's solution the one that Pentagon wants, not  exactly clear just yet that it is, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  Okay, so Barbara, with all of this, I guess, you know for a  President that loves hype, obviously this has been in the works for some  time, what is that gap between hype and reality to fruition and execution?  </p><p>STARR:  Well, for people, for top commanders in the US military, their  question starts with if there is something out there that we are not doing  to defend and protect Americans in that space environment, is there  something more we should be doing?  </p><p>A lot of money, time and attention is being paid to the very question --  advanced defensive capabilities, defensive information attacks all of that,  the key question I think, Richard, Congress wants to see something happen,  but there may be a very limited appetite for an entire new branch of the US  military.  </p><p>QUEST:  Our own shining star bright and comets skating and great to tell us  the story, Barbara, good to see you as always, thank you.  </p><p>STARR:  Thanks.  </p><p>QUEST:  Barbara Starr at the Pentagon.  Now, from space to slightly at  lower altitude, but we all get to fly anyway where Lufthansa, now, we know  Norwegian has received already two bids and rejected them from IAG -- the  owners of BA et cetera.  </p><p>[16:25:16]  </p><p>QUEST:  Lufthansa is reporting they have now been in contact with Norwegian  Air Shuttle as well.  So, you have Lufthansa and British Airways and IAG  interested in buying Europe's third biggest aircraft low cost group.  Both  have budget players in play.  </p><p>I wanted to look at the destination board and we are going to show you  exactly why this is so fascinating because if you look for example at what  Lufthansa already owns at the moment, you will see the complexity.  </p><p>Now, you've obviously got in the Lufthansa group, Lufthansa the German,  Swiss the Swiss Airline, you've got CityLine which is the regional;  Edelweiss, the low cost; German Wings and Euro Wings and your Austrian --  they are the main components that Lufthansa already owns within it.  </p><p>It's already got as well minority stakes in the Aerologic and Sun Express,  so Lufthansa on the one side.  Now, you've got AIG and if you look at the  airlines AIG has, you'll see exactly how significant that is going to be.  </p><p>BA, Iberia and Aer Lingus, Vueling and Level, they are the majorities  already that they have got.  They are the big carriers that they have got.   The minority stakes that -- this is the key one, the key one here, there.   Already got 4 percent of Norwegian, nearly 5 percent.  </p><p>So, on the both hands, you have Lufthansa and you have IAG, two of the  largest groups in the world now both seemingly doing battle trying to get  Norwegian.  I can tell you from within the industry, the view is Lufthansa  may just have the upper hand in all of this if Carsten Spohr decides to go  for the full bid, may indeed.  </p><p>But Willie Walsh is not going to give up easily, neither Chief Execs,  neither Spohr, nor Walsh is prepared to overbid for an airline that they  see is already in trouble.  </p><p>We will have more after the break.  </p><p>Hello, I am Richard Quest, there is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a  moment.  When Beyonce and Jay-Z set up for a big weekend on their streaming  service and how title's rivals are catching up and arguably, the two of  them shot themselves in their own fight for bid.  </p><p>And the World Health Organization now shows that video game addiction is  real.  I will speak to the founder of a rehab center for gamers.  As we  continue, you are watching CNN and here, the facts always come first.  </p><p>President Trump is again falsely shaming his political opponents, the  Democrats for his own policy on immigration which resulted in family  separation at the borders.  In remarks earlier today, President Trump said  the US would not become a migrant camp for refugee holding facility.  </p><p>[16:30:16]  Meanwhile, the new CNN poll shows most Republicans approve of  the policies which meant more parents and children being separated at the  border.  Overall, two-thirds of Americans disapprove, the president's  approval rating is now at 39 percent. </p><p>Chancellor Merkel of Germany has been given two weeks to reach an agreement  with the EU on a new immigration policy that both members of our coalition  government can support.  The CSU Party, her partners wants a deal to ban  migrants who have already applied for asylum elsewhere from entering  Germany.</p><p>CSU says if there's no deal, it will unilaterally move forward with the  plan.  In Britain, the Prime Minister Theresa May has suffered a fresh  defeat of her Brexit plans.  The House of Lords voted to give parliament  the final say on what happens in the event her government fails to reach an  exit deal with the EU. </p><p>The legislation is to be debated in the House of Commons on Wednesday.   Croatia's Nikola Kalinic has been sent home from the World Cup after he  refused to come on as a substitute.  The striker said he couldn't play  against Nigeria because of a back problem. </p><p>His coach pointed out he also refused to play during a friendly with Brazil  earlier this month.  A thriller outside of Saint Petersburg where a short  while ago England defeated Tunisia, it's the end of day five in the 2018  World Cup.  After some early missed chances, England's Captain Harry Kane  gave his team an early 1-0 lead, Tunisia leveled it with a penalty, and  that was just before the end of the first half.</p><p>Then as time was draining away, it was Harry Kane again with a dramatic  header -- yes, and to give England the 2-1 victory.  Amanda Davies is in  Moscow -- it's a haunting of a match. </p><p>AMANDA DAVIES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Richard, it was, but it's dangerous  times because England have won their opening match of this World Cup, and  everybody in England has been doing so well in terms of playing down  expectations for this very young, relatively untested England side. </p><p>Now, they've won, you do worry what happens next.  It wasn't the most  convincing performance, it has to be said, but there was some very exciting  moments within the side against a Tunisian team that -- or in their first  World Cup since 2006 and we knew it would sit very deep, defend very deep  in numbers.</p><p>So it was always going to be tough with this England side.  The moment that  you do get excited about is the fact, so in days gone by, a warm one,  England's generally would have settled for that or even worst perhaps  conceded a late goal.</p><p>But these guys kept on pushing, kept going and Harry Kane led by example as  the captain as you said to score the winner in the 91st minute, and you saw  -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>DAVIES:  Just what it meant to him and his manager Gary Southgate, a  massive results early doors. </p><p>QUEST:  Oh, hang on Amanda, it's better to win than lose. </p><p>DAVIES:  Absolutely Richard, but you know, I have been through some downs  and downs.  A little, a few ups.  But more downs as an England -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>DAVIES:  Supporter over the years, and so you know, I am wearing my red  dress, I wore my shirt this morning for breakfast, so we've got to be  realistic about it.  As this is, you know, one of the rare groups, after  this point in the competition has actually gone to plan with the big teams  -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>DAVIES:  Drawing their opening games, Belgium also won earlier today.  So  compared to what we've seen with Brazil, with Argentina, with Germany  losing yesterday, we know that you can't take anything for granted at all  in a World Cup. </p><p>QUEST:  And the beauty of all of this is that the atmosphere is starting to  build.  Whether it'd be the Germany match or even the first match from  Russia and Saudi Arabia right the way through to this match, the atmosphere  is building up as it's supposed to. </p><p>DAVIES:  Yes, it truly is a World Cup.  We're just at the bottom of Red  Square as we've said to you before, and there's a lot of Mexican fans,  there's been some Colombian fans here today.  And remember four years ago,  Richard, you had your flag pole of flags really and you were texting me as  to which flag needed to come out on which day. </p><p>And today, that was really tested, I had a fantastic moment by Saint  Basil's which has been open for the first time after they've taken down all  the stadium from the concert last week.  </p><p>[16:35:00] And there were three fans, there was a Mexican and Argentinean  and a Spaniard having a photo taken. </p><p>And then they saw a Colombian and said, come on over, and then there was a  Peruvian who joined the party and then there was some Moroccan fans who  joined the party and a German and a Swedish fan, and it was really a  fantastic moment in front of Saint Basil's, seeing everybody in their shirt  with their flags and it is what you would hope a World Cup would turn out  to be. </p><p>QUEST:  And be assured, Miss Davies, that your vexillology knowledge will  be required before we are finished, because the flags return, the flags  return when the economic World Cup returns once we get into the knockout  rounds which comes later.</p><p>So you may not rest easy, you'll be up all night studying flags, good to  see you.</p><p>DAVIES:  I will, bye-bye. </p><p>QUEST:  Sorted that out.  Beyonce and Jay-Z say they don't care about the  music industry's obsession with streaming numbers. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Plenty stuff, there it is, streaming service and the streaming  business, we're going to see -- discuss what it says about the future of  Tidal streaming service.  That they bring out a new album, maybe it's  exclusive to them and then give it to everybody else -- after the break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Beyonce and Jay z dropped the surprise album over the weekend, it  wasn't expected.  It managed to get the whole world talking about their  streaming service Tidal once again.</p><p>Fans were sent rushing to the app because it was only app -- it was the  only way to hear the album at first.  Now Beyonce and Jay z have given it  to the mega streaming rival Spotify, Apple and Amazon. </p><p>And speaking of Spotify, Beyonce has some choice words about the music  business and its obsession with streaming numbers.  Listen carefully. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Savory stuff, Larry Miller is here thankfully.  Help us to  understand it, director of music business at the NYU Steinhardt School.   We'll get on to the obsession with streaming numbers in a moment.</p><p>But being weird to surprisingly release your own material on your own  streaming service that you've got an interest in and then given away to the  competition the next day. </p><p>LARRY MILLER, DIRECTOR OF MUSIC BUSINESS, NYU STEINHARDT SCHOOL:  Well,  true enough.  And if we go back to not so long ago when \"Lemonade\" dropped,  of course that dropped on an \"Hbo\" special, but it was also exclusively  available on Tidal for a short period of time. </p><p>[16:40:00] QUEST:  It was exclusive for a day. </p><p>MILLER:  Yes, right, that's very short. </p><p>QUEST:  That's very short. </p><p>MILLER:  That's very short indeed.  But I think that streaming has evolved  and the music industry has evolved and Spotify have about $180 million  subscribers and Apple have another $40 million or so, and Amazon have many  and there are other places people go to stream music.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, but if you are Beyonce and Jay z, you're not worried about  the money necessarily. </p><p>MILLER:  Right.  </p><p>QUEST:  And if you are committed to your Tidal streaming service, you're  prepared to take the punishment that will come by insisting it's only  there.  So why give it away? </p><p>MILLER:  Well, it's important to be where the eyeballs are and air balls  are.  And any artist wants to be able to gather attention around their  latest music -- </p><p>QUEST:  But you can't have both, Larry, you can't -- I mean, what I'm  trying to say is it suggests a lack of commitment to Tidal that they would  have done it so quickly -- </p><p>MILLER:  Well -- </p><p>QUEST:  Not even seven days. </p><p>MILLER:  Right, not even seven days.  And so in today's tension economy,  who knows what we'll be thinking about a week from now.  And so right now,  while attention is riveted on Beyonce and Jay z and that amazing video they  chose to make some music available a day later. </p><p>QUEST:  The louver, they got access to the louver -- </p><p>MILLER:  Amazing -- </p><p>QUEST:  For this video which is extraordinary, which is gratifying in a  sense to see the amount of money and the amount of effort and care on  production values that are put into these, some things, even though sort of  extreme things as you say, here today, gone tomorrow. </p><p>MILLER:  Fair enough, and so it's incumbent upon artists and the people who  they work with today to be able to drive attention by releasing music and  video and other things in other to maintain attention for as long as  possible.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, so as to Beyonce's somewhat vulgar references to streaming and  let me -- and then Spotify, you're right, it's a numbers game.  I mean, I'm  glad you're -- we've got -- the music business expert here, it's a numbers  game and Spotify has got the numbers, 175 million. </p><p>MILLER:  It is. </p><p>QUEST:  Right, as anybody else, I mean, if you want to be heard, you've got  to go there. </p><p>MILLER:  Yes, you need to be aware that people are and let's not forget,  they are in the middle of what I believe is a gigantic sold-out stadium -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>MILLER:  For -- they just finished playing in the big football stadium in  London -- </p><p>QUEST:  They did, Wembley.  Quick final question, can we say that Spotify  is now too big to fail? </p><p>MILLER:  I think it's hard to say in this day and age whether anything  really is too big to fail, but they are the leader in a growing and super  important segment of the music business that now accounts for two-thirds of  the revenue in the country. </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you sir, thank you. </p><p>MILLER:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>QUEST:  As we continue tonight, you want to stay on top of the day's  business news and headlines in just 90 seconds and try our daily briefing  podcast, it's updated twice a day before and after the bell rings on Wall  Street, (INAUDIBLE) or Google for CNN flash briefing, just try it, see what  you get, and if it doesn't work, e-mail me.</p><p>When we return, Britain's Brexit blues are starting a report, claims the  U.K. is about to see its lowest growth if the financial crisis and things  aren't going to get much better any time soon. </p><p>[16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  So in the pubs of London where it is still time to get the last  order of drinks, and I suspect the England victory is dominating, but once  the thrilling World Cup win sort of dissipates, the U.K. will come back to  earth.</p><p>The British Chamber of Commerce is now predicting it will be the weakest  year of growth for the U.K. economy in almost a decade.  Adam Marshall is  the Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, good to see you,  Adam, thank you for taking time tonight. </p><p>I hope you saw the final results, you saw the game before popping into  Australia's to join us.  But it is sobering, your numbers, I mean, it  doesn't show complete collapse of destitution, but it does show sub-par  growth for the foreseeable future.</p><p>ADAM MARSHALL, DIRECTOR GENERAL, BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE:  I think  that's right, Richard, we are looking at about 1.3 percent growth this  year, 1.4 next year and 1.6 in 2020.  Those are not the sorts of numbers  that really blow the doors off when it comes to a major advanced economy. </p><p>And I think what we'd like to see is two things, one obviously, firms want  to see clarity on Brexit as that debate rumbles on terminally.  And I think  in the U.K., there's also a sense that we have other things to get on with  as well to make conditions great for business.</p><p>And there's quite -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>MARSHALL:  A lot that the government needs to do here at home as well. </p><p>QUEST:  Is there -- is this lone number, is it predicated on the  uncertainty on what happens or is there a general view now within the BCC  and you're an economist, that whatever happens immediately after Brexit,  growth will be lower, even in best case scenario, the U.K. will not be as  well off as it was within the EU. </p><p>MARSHALL:  Well, the U.K. will certainly see slower growth that it might  have done had the country not gone down this route at least in the very  short term, that is what we are forecasting.  But I think there are some  other factors that work here as well. </p><p>Obviously, some of the global trade skirmishes that we've been seeing in  recent weeks, unsettled businesses here in the U.K. about their future  prospects.  So anything that happens between the U.S. and China for  example, they may sneeze but the U.K. may very well catch cold as well.</p><p>Same thing about input prices and oil prices -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>MARSHALL:  Which have been going up for a lot of U.K. companies too. </p><p>QUEST:  And on this question of future growth, obviously, you would have  preferred -- I mean, I know the BCC, it would have preferred a single  market access.  But if you can't get single market access, what is your  preferred option for Customs Union and the way forward especially now we  seem to be at that essential moment when the negotiation has to decide  which way to go. </p><p>MARSHALL:  Well, our firms are not much interested in the chronology(ph)  about this.  They see a lot of labels around Customs Union and single  market.  And what they say to us is they want answers on practical  questions.  Who do I pay tax to? Who can I hire? How long can they stay in  my business? </p><p>Who is my regulator going to be? And those sorts of practical questions are  what really are driving a lot of business considerations around this.  You  could call the rapport(ph), whatever you want to, but businesses want  clarity on their trading conditions and they need to see that with some  urgency over the next few months. </p><p>QUEST:  OK, so we've had the white paper recently from the -- well, we had  the agreement back in March, we've had a white paper, we've got the current  disarray one might arguably say in parliament.  You just saw today  obviously, that the lords says -- once again voted that it should take  primacy if there's no deal. </p><p>Something that the Commons is going to have to look back at.  I mean, yes,  I guess I'm taking you into the chronology of the Brexit process and what  you're telling me is it's not very helpful. </p><p>MARSHALL:  It's not, in fact, a lot of firms around the country who say  look, they're watching and waiting, but what they need is something  concrete upon which they can act -- </p><p>QUEST:  They're not going to get it I think --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>I've got news for you, that's exactly -- I mean, and that's the dirty  secret here isn't it? They're not going to get it and even once the  agreement is signed, there's still going to be a level of uncertainty that  will be damaging to your members.  Can you accept that? </p><p>MARSHALL:  No, I think businesses know that there's going to be uncertainty  for some time to come, a very few pundits have said to us, well, once you  negotiate with the European Union, you negotiate with the European Union  forever. </p><p>It's very likely to be the case that those negotiations will be ongoing for  a long time.  But businesses do need a degree of certainty here, Richard,  they do need something to work off of, and I think their biggest dismay,  their biggest opprobrium is actually for the U.K. politicians, they can't  agree on a route forward to go into that negotiating room.</p><p>[16:50:00] Because what we know in business is you go into a negotiation  with a clear position and that's what we need our government to do.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, let's just talk about these, the strength at the moment of  the U.K. economy.  All right, unemployment is down and there could be a  labor shortage, but wage inflation is starting to pick up again.  Now, the  Bank of England would like to start raising rates because inflation has  started to move up, but it can't because of their -- I mean, all roads lead  back to Brexit because of the uncertainty. </p><p>But the economy itself is fundamentally robust. </p><p>MARSHALL:  Yes, there's some strength in the economy, it's been threading  water though as the way we like to put it.  It's not sinking, but it is  threading water.  We're not seeing the kind of growth we'd want to see.</p><p>These are the interest rates we're forecasting one rise over the coming  months and perhaps one more in the period until 2020.  But even the window  for those minimal source of rise to 75 or a 100 basis points is starting to  close.  Because as you rightly say, uncertainty is going to mean the bank  is going to want to keep conditions as smooth as possible for business.</p><p>So we don't see a very strong case for significant rate rises in the near  future.</p><p>QUEST:  You'll forgive me if I don't say I'm sorry to hear that, I mean,  got a U.K. mortgage, I'm rather glad that it might be a little bit longer  to enjoy the good times, good to see you sir, thank you. </p><p>MARSHALL:  And you, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  We'll talk more about this in detail as the process goes on, good  to have you.  The games industry is taking in $100 billion, that's right,  $100 billion a year.  The World Health Organization is now warning it could  be triggering(ph) a new public health concern. </p><p>It's called gaming disorder and it's just been listed as a mental health  condition.  It describes compulsive players who just plays from similar to  those of gambling addicts.  The WHO says it applies to behavior lasting 12  months or more.</p><p>Joining me now is the co-founder of a rehab center for internet and video  gaming addiction is Hilarie Cash, she joins me from reSTART which is live  from Seattle in Washington.  Were you surprised that it's taken so long to  get the WHO to recognize gaming as a gaming disorder. </p><p>HILARIE CASH, CO-FOUNDER, RESTART:  Not really, I -- you know, this whole  phenomenon has taken the world by storm and actually moving very quickly.   And research, you know, they're going to make their decisions based on the  research findings.  And research is by its nature rather slow. </p><p>So I think it's not -- but I think I'm just glad it's finally here. </p><p>QUEST:  What are the symptoms of gaming disorder? How does somebody  recognize when they've got it? </p><p>CASH:  I think the best way to think about it is that when you are out of  control and you are gaming in spite of its negative consequences, you've  got a problem.</p><p>QUEST:  And the treatment for it, how far does it accord to the other  traditional addictions? Obviously, drugs, alcohol, gambling, overspending,  all the others.  Does it follow the same model for treatment, whether it'd  be the 12-step model or otherwise? </p><p>CASH:  Well, I can tell you that our model of treatment is to be very  holistic in what we're trying to do.  So we are -- the adults as well as  the adolescents tries spending at least two months free of all screens, and  the idea is that they need that time to -- for their brains to come back to  normal functioning, they need that time to get their health back, they  usually are chronically sleep deprived, unfit and they've been eating very  poorly for a long time. </p><p>So they're getting their health back, they're developing skills that they  really are going to need if they're going to be functional young adults.   And they're getting a plan together for how they're going to abuse digital  technology again in a sustainable and healthy way. </p><p>After that two months period, there's been if they choose and about 80  percent of them do choose, you go on to the second phase of the program,  that's the phase where they're now for the adults living in apartments  together in -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>CASH:  In small groups, they're getting part-time work and they're just  starting to live life like adults need to live life -- </p><p>QUEST:  OK, so final question, with the other addictions, alcohol, drugs  and the like, the general view is total abstinence.  What is too many, a  thousand, never enough.  With gaming addiction or gaming disorder, do you  believe that you can't do it at all or do you believe there's a manageable  way you can do it. </p><p>CASH:  Well, I think there's a manageable way you can use a digital  technology.  </p><p>[16:55:00] I think if you're gaming addict, you're really getting on thin  ice if you try to go back to gaming and chances are very high that you will  relapse.  So we ask the guys when they come into program and are developing  what we call the life balance friend -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>CASH:  To think through -- what are their bottom lines and those bottom  lines almost always are going to include video games. </p><p>QUEST:  Good to talk to you, thank you, I appreciate your time tonight,  thank you.  We will have a different profitable moment after the break,  this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS live from New York. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, it is lovely in an era where we are  talking about the misery and mayhem that we're able to turn our attention  to something much more pleasant.  Weddings within the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS  team who makes no apology for showing you the very best that we have got. </p><p>Our senior producer John and his new bride Ali(ph), yes, that's the two at  the front, and the rest are the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS team that all sort of  -- I think the director summed it up rather well.  I think -- well, she  says you all scrubbed up rather nicely over the weekend. </p><p>And our technical director Rick Flair(ph) and his new wife Emily, yes, they  also scrubbed up rather nicely on the way to and from their ceremony.  So  we take this opportunity because it's only right and proper that we  remember this program that we bring to you every night with love and  privilege is made by people behind the cameras and they actually put it  together. </p><p>And today, four of them have enjoyed weddings.  And that is QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York.  Whatever you're up  to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.  Congratulations to all my  colleagues. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

The justice ministry could not be reached for comment.<br/> Barley has summoned Facebook for talks at the justice ministry. She did not say when the meeting would take place. She also said it was unacceptable that social media users \"are spied on in order to be targeted with election ads or bombarded with hate messages against political rivals\".<br/> Clear rules were needed to prevent such misuse of user data, which poses a threat to democracy, she said in the newspaper report.<br/> Facebook has been rocked this week by a whistleblower who said Cambridge Analytica, which Trump hired for the 2016 campaign, improperly accessed information on Facebook users to build detailed profiles on American voters.<br/> The revelation has knocked nearly $50 billion off Facebook's stock market value in two days and hit the shares of Twitter and Snap over fears that a failure by big tech firms to protect personal data could deter advertisers and users and invite tougher regulation.<br/> A former Facebook operations manager told a British parliamentary committee on Wednesday that data harvesting of member profiles by outside software developers was once routine and that the company took years to clamp down on the practice.<br/> Facebook declined to comment directly on the testimony of the ex-employee, Sandy Parakilas. In announcing the suspension of Cambridge Analytica and related researchers from Facebook late last week, it said it now requires app developers to justify any data they collect and how they are going to use it<br/> \"In the past five years, we have made significant improvements in our ability to detect and prevent violations by app developers,\" Facebook said.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10433373</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXW-J6B1-DYDW-72JY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"395\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 22, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Unemployment is low. Compared with their American counterparts, German employees work on average 400 hours less a year, enjoy long holiday breaks and a strong safety net. What accounts for all this good luck? Many point to the country's \"social market economy\" system, the soziale Marktwirtschaft.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The term was first coined by the German economist Alfred M\\xFCller-Armack in 1947 after the end of World War II. It was a time when the Allied military command rationed food and goods, enforced price and wage regulations, and cigarettes were a real substitute for currency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Soon Ludwig Erhard started to use the phrase to describe his ideas for Germany's post-war economy. And though at the end of the war, Erhard was nearly 50 and had never held any political office what he said mattered, because he became economy minister of West Germany in 1949. It was a position he held until 1963.</p><p>Getting West Germany working again after the war was more important than simply making products or money. Getting people into jobs brought about social peace at a difficult time, and if the country was successful it could fend off communism.</p><p>Other countries like France, Italy and Austria also experienced a boom, but nothing like Germany, and these years have broadly come to be described as a time of miracles. Erhard for his part has been nicknamed the \"father of the German economic miracle\" and often called the \"incarnation of prosperity\" or simply the \"miracle man.\"</p><p>Erhard's sense of fairness</p><p>\"The outstanding economic development of Germany after the Second World War has been significantly influenced by the social market economy,\" J\\xF6rg Rocholl, president of the European School of Management and Technology (ESMT) in Berlin, told DW. \"Its biggest merit is the balance between work and capital in enabling competition. On the one hand, it gives companies the greatest possible freedom. It uses social elements to ensure that those who cannot successfully participate in the economy are socially secure.\"</p><p>In the past 70 years the workings of Germany's social market economy have widened and now encompass more than Erhard imagined. His ideas were something between the extremes of ultraliberal laissez-faire economics and a Marxist socialist - in other words a planned - system. Performance-based competition was the key to it all.</p><p>Basically he wanted a minimally regulated free market economy without day-to-day government interference where supply and demand determined prices, wages and what was produced. He called for private property rights, tough antitrust laws and codetermination, a system that puts worker representatives on company boards in the hope of reaching a consensus on wages, benefits and working conditions.</p><p>Perhaps what Erhard wouldn't recognize today is the country's welfare system. He loved entrepreneurship and always put the \"market\" before the \"social\" in his social market economy and was not in favor of excessive social benefits. He wanted people to work hard and stand on their own as much as possible. Today's current health care, pension and unemployment systems go beyond his ideals.</p><p>A new world order</p><p>J\\xF6rg Rocholl from ESMT notes that the principles of the social market economy are slowly being softened. He criticizes the government for increasingly intervening in pricing and market mechanisms. A perfect example of this is the current discussion around putting a temporary hold on housing rent hikes in Germany. Not only that, but authorities want to set price limits in the future to cushion rising rents.</p><p>\"Any artificial slowing down of the price mechanism like we saw in East Germany leads to a decline in investment and the building infrastructure suffers. In the end, nobody benefits,\" said Rocholl.</p><p>Especially this year when Germans are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent unification of East and West Germany, many people in the former East feel that they have been left behind. It's not hard to imagine how surprised people in East Germany felt when a new economic and social system was imposed on them in 1989. After all, they had lived in a planned socialist system for many decades and have struggled to catch up.</p><p>\"The situation in Eastern Germany is not due to the fact that a market economy is bad, but rather that the East German system was economically finished even before 1989,\" explained Rocholl, referring to secret internal government reports.</p><p>\"Even before the fall of the Berlin Wall in October 1989, Gerhard Sch\\xFCrer, head of the Central Planning Commission of East Germany, had submitted a secret report on the economic situation of the county to the politburo,\" according to Rocholl. \"The report showed the catastrophic state of the production facilities because of worn-out equipment and an enormous need for repairs. In addition, it showed that the country was already so heavily indebted abroad that a state bankruptcy was imminent.\"</p><p>Looking forward</p><p>Despite the challenges of integrating East and West in the past three decades, as a whole the unified Germany has roared ahead economically. Today many countries look at its current success to see what parts they can take from it.</p><p>Erhard called for \"prosperity for all\" and indeed Germany is riding high at the moment despite a slight recent downturn. When things go well, people don't ask questions. From 2005 to 2019, unemployment dropped from 10% to 5%. But the moment things turn sour, the tides will turn on whatever system is in place.</p><p>A recent report on Germany's social market economy published by KfW, the country's state-owned development bank, point out problems facing the county like growing income disparity, poverty, climate change, a stumbling global trade regime, demographic change and dismal progress in digitalization.</p><p>This is a long list. Additionally, many businesses say they need more flexibility, especially when it comes to hiring and firing workers. No one system can be everything to everyone, yet it seems like the social market economy is being attacked on all sides. Should the economy tank as some are predicting, the cries for it to be dismantled will only grow.</p><p>Germany must rise to these enormous challenges. The KfW report hit the nail on the head when it stated \"securing prosperity is a permanent task.\" The government will be called on to bring about more social peace and solutions to some big problems.</p><p>\"In his book 'Prosperity for All,' Erhard wrote that as economy minister, he was not the representative of large commercial enterprises and cartels, but someone who had to promote the well-being of everyone by ensuring competition. Exactly this point is more important today than ever. How do we deal with big, powerful companies like the big tech giants? What kind of competition regulation do we need?\" concluded ESMT's Rocholl.</p><p>To stay on top in a changing world, Germany may need to come up with a new \"economic miracle\" plan.</p><p>Source: DW - Deutsche Welle</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5X-8D61-DXMS-81T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1208\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 3, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp; ECONOMIC INDICATORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D17D</classCode><className>NEWS BRIEFS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0009XVW</classCode><className>WORLD WAR II</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000549</classCode><className>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CYCH</classCode><className>LIBERALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XKG</classCode><className>OUTPUT &amp; DEMAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001772</classCode><className>UNEMPLOYMENT RATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00097YO</classCode><className>WAGE &amp; HOUR LAWS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzkwRDQ1MTExNzNDNEFENTk1Njk0MTg0Rjg0RUQzRkE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTE3QUQwOTA0MUYzNDlCMEFFMjUwRUNDM0RDRkM5QzM</classCode><className>Wage &amp; Hour Laws</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001813</classCode><className>WAGES &amp; SALARIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A1SO</classCode><className>BUSINESS EDUCATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0009J1P</classCode><className>PROPERTY LAW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX121</classCode><className>BERLIN, GERMANY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GC318</classCode><className>GERMANY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>GC346</classCode><className>AUSTRIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

How do you respond to such criticisms? Helen Dixon (HD): The particular individual who is commenting there has a role specifically in public sector enforcement and has no experience in terms of the type of supervision that's being referenced.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I think anyone who understands the complexity of the new law, the novelty of this one-stop shop that's been created with the cooperation and consistency mechanisms, the fact that there are still independent national DPAs, and that the law in the GDPR has to be reconciled with those national laws - and yet also involve EU administrative law in terms of Article 60 [co-operation between national data protection authorities] - would understand that certainly the first time round, there are a lot of issues that need to be worked out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AW: Yet he recently compared Ireland's data protection set-up with Germany's 'go-slow' automotive regulator on the diesel emissions issue. Clearly, he is voicing substantial frustration.</p><p>HD: We produce an annual report that details all of our activities. You can see that there's a huge span of activities, from individual complaint handling to approving binding corporate rules, to conducting larger-scale investigations, to enforcing against the public services card.</p><p>We also receive the annual reports of other data protection authorities. I wonder if anyone were to assess those annual reports, how such a comment ['go-slow'] would stand up to any kind of scrutiny as regards the effectiveness of the data protection regulation.</p><p>Up to the end of 2019, just three cross-border cases involving fines had gone through Article 60. None of those were from Germany. Two were from Malta. One was from Lithuania, where the highest fine of (EURO)62,000 occurred.</p><p>The highest number of concerned data protection authorities involved in decision-making on any of them was three. So there's no particular Ireland story here.</p><p>As for that quote you brought up, that was made in the context of the suggestion that the EU should go down the route of a single digital regulator, that would effectively handle the large cross-border cases in terms of big tech companies - just like the EU Commission does in competition law.</p><p>It's a matter for the Commission to comment on that, but the EU already considered it when it was creating the one-stop shop under the GDPR, so I think there's very little prospect of that happening in the near term. Neither would it be a silver bullet, because if you look at the EU competition cases that are handled by the EU Commission under Margrethe Vestager, the decisions in these big cases don't happen any quicker anyway. They take several years from start to finish.</p><p>AW: So Ireland is not dealing with these big cases too slowly? HD: There's no particular Irish angle on this unless you want to generate a story or get a few headlines. It's true to say that there is a particular focus from the Germans on Facebook. This is apparent in frequent commentary that is reported from them. So that may well be a reason as to why we've been particularly picked out.</p><p>If you look at Germany, there have been none [investigations] of a cross-border nature that have resulted in fines.</p><p>If you look at what was the biggest DPA in Europe last year, the ICO, with 700 staff and a large number of cross-border organisations that they supervise, they have yet to bring one through Article 60. France is the same. And the Netherlands, with organisations like Uber and Netflix.</p><p>The Dutch commissioner says that they're now running at a backlog of six months, and up to five years, in terms of the volumes coming in. Prior to the application of the GDPR, the Dutch did not have a policy of handling every individual complaint. They applied a policy of 'selective to be effective'. But the GDPR has now necessitated that they handle every individual complaint. So again, there's nothing unique with regards to Ireland.</p><p>AW: The Germans also say that Ireland continues to under-resource its data protection authority.</p><p>HD: This office needs to continue to grow. But if you look at the growth that it has had and the effort that was involved in winning the budget to recruit the experts in technology and data protection law that we now have, it couldn't have happened any faster than it has happened. But yes, there has to be continued investment.</p><p>AW: Your office has flagged before that decisions on WhatsApp and Twitter are likely to be the first of the big ones regarding multinational tech companies. But what is the actual timeline for those now? HD: I can't quote timelines any longer, because we simply have to take what's coming at us as it comes at us, and deal as expeditiously as we can, step by step.</p><p>My quoting a timeline is a little bit like a red rag to a bull. It has become counterproductive.</p><p>What I can say to you is that we have resolved and bottomed out a lot of procedural questions that were raised with us that we had to answer to reassure data controllers that their interests were protected in the Article 60 process proposed, and which we also had to answer and resolve for ourselves.</p><p>Step by step, we will circulate draft decisions now that we've resolved the significant procedural issues.</p><p>AW: There is going to be an expectation of substantial fines, especially after the US Federal Trade Commission's $5bn ((EURO)4.5bn) fine on Facebook last year. Are we looking at that scale of a fine? HD: It's only once we've made the decision and found substantive infringements that we can then consider the corrective measures and the quantum of any fine applicable.</p><p>But I will say to you that one thing we have been busy doing in a general sense, not by reference to any particular inquiry, over the last number of months is procuring expert legal external counsel advice on EU competition law. The fining regime under the GDPR is based on competition law. So we have been looking at how fines by the EU Commission have been applied dating back to the 1960s and looking at what's been published by the commission about the methodology that applies.</p><p>But one of the things that has become very clear to us is looking at the deterrent effect of a fine.</p><p>Under the GDPR, deterrence is a particularly important reason why the fines are included. They could have stopped at the corrective measures. But the fines are there to be punitive and give rise to deterrence. And deterrence is based on what's already in the [fine] landscape.</p><p>So when you're looking at that deterrence effect, a very relevant factor in terms of quantum is the level of fines already existing, globally, in the area.</p><p>So if you ask whether the [$5bn] FTC fine is relevant, it is. Just as the fines we've already seen from those existing three decisions in 2019 are relevant. All of that will have to be brought to bear. So there is a relevance because deterrence is based on what's already the landscape and whether you need to move beyond it.</p><p>AW: So you're crossing the Ts and dotting the Is to prepare for the announcement of a fine? HD: Well, a fine is an inevitability at some point. But we've taken the advice not by reference to any particular inquiry. It's just a necessity for us to be armed as a data protection authority.</p><p>AW: That sounds like you're lining a fine up.</p><p>HD: That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying we procured this legal advice in a general sense in order to make sure I'm armed and equipped, and understand how to exercise my obligations.</p><p>AW: On another issue, we're seeing a significant escalation in cameras and facial recognition in public places. In the UK, police are conducting high-profile trials of facial recognition cameras to catch criminals. Do you have any thoughts about this in an Irish context? HD: It is a particularly invasive technology. From a technological point of view, there are all sorts of issues such as false positives and people of colour faring worse in terms of the matching in facial recognition systems. But it is becoming more and more pervasive. The EU recently gave thought to banning it in public places, although now they seem to have retreated from that position.</p><p>But there's no policy or legal position on facial recognition in this jurisdiction. It falls to be regulated largely under the GDPR and by reference to EU case law, in terms of necessity and proportionality.</p><p>It would be helpful if policymakers and lawmakers have a strong view on this and give effect to that in a law.</p><p>Otherwise, it does fall to be dealt with on a case-by-case assessment by data controllers and subsequently by the Irish DPC. I think the bar is going to be very high for any data controller who is using facial recognition systems. There are also issues around the databases and the storing of details of individuals alongside their pho-tographs. So it is an area of significant concern. We haven't seen the same types of projects that we're seeing in Wales and London rolling out here in Ireland, but the technology usually catches up in this jurisdiction. So I've no doubt we will becoming across cases of that type to consider.</p><p>AW: What about the fast growth of domestic cameras and video cameras such as Amazon's Ring doorbell? In the US, Amazon has brokered agreements between 800 police forces and residents for the sharing of footage from their front-door 'smart' video cameras.</p><p>HD: There was an interesting article in the 'New York Times' in the context of the Amazon Ring device and what we're doing to ourselves as societies by installing all of this and inflicting on ourselves a surveillance technology.</p><p>The article demonstrated that Amazon's Ring is useful in securing convictions only in a tiny number of cases, a number that is potentially disproportionate to its downsides. So while people seem keen to invest in this type of home technology, it actually doesn't deliver what they think it does.</p><p>AW: I think the 'New York Times' has also reported that burglaries and property crime have fallen in the same period as sales of such smart home video cameras have risen though.</p><p>HD: That may well be true and is worth considering. For example, the data from the UK, in terms of police using bodyworn cameras in riot situations, is that behaviour improves once people realise that the authorities are using audio and video recording equipment.</p><p>In terms of regulation, there's no law that prevents individuals from buying an Amazon Ring and installing it. But I think it's worth reflecting on all of this for ourselves that we're building fortresses to what end, around ourselves. From a data protection point of view, there is case law in the [CJEU] Rynes case. That was on CCTV technology but very specific to a household implementing CCTV technology. What that said is that a household can avail of the household exemption under the GDPR, provided the CCTV is trained within the perimeter of the house. Typically, Amazon Ring doesn't fall outside of that.</p><p>So it may well not be an issue that's for regulation by the data protection authorities under the GDPR, but that still doesn't mean there aren't things to think about.</p><p/><p>'One of the things that has become</p><p>very clear to us is looking at</p><p>the deterrent effect of a fine'</p><p>HELEN DIXON, DPC</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Concerns: DPC Helen Dixon is wary of technology such as 'smart' front-door cameras.

Coronavirus \u2014 or Covid 19, as it\u2019s just been renamed \u2014 is still playing havoc with supply chains and much else in the region. But there is still a lot else going on. Huawei\u2019s trials in Germany, after its qualified success in the UK in January, are at the top of the agenda. And don\u2019t miss James Crabtree\u2019s column (in Mercedes\u2019 Top 10) for a punchy piece on how Huawei should be received in Asia. Just looking at our top stories this week, it is amazing how many of them concern some element of US-China rivalry and suspicion. Till next week.</emphasis></p><p>The Big Story </p><p>Germany is taking steps to curtail Huawei\u2019s involvement in its 5G telecoms rollout. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s political party is backing a recommendation that only \u201ctrustworthy\u201d equipment suppliers will be permitted to take part in Germany\u2019s 5G rollout, according to\u00a0 this piece \u00a0by the FT\u2019s Guy Chazan in Berlin.</p><p>Trustworthy is defined as fulfilling a \u201cclearly defined security catalogue which excludes the possibility of a foreign state exerting influence on our 5G infrastructure\u201d.

It goes without saying that they withdraw their credit cards, enter their bank details or order on an invoice basis. On the other hand, they hardly worry about the technology behind the payment process. The online economy is currently undergoing massive change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Claire Hughes Johnson observes changes in online usage and buying patterns every day. She is responsible for the operative business of the payment service provider Stripe. The portal \"Der Aktion\u00e4r\" lists Stripe as seventh most valuable, unlisted company in the world with a value of 22.5 billion dollars. The US company is developing the infrastructure for countless payment transactions on the network. If you book a trip with Expedia or extend your Spotify subscription - your payment will be handled by the San Francisco-based company. Nevertheless, Hughes Johnson warns that the business on the net is subject to massive imbalance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">   WORLD:</p><p>   Do you have any cash in your pocket?</p><p>   Claire Hughes Johnson:</p><p>When I come to Germany, and especially to Berlin, then always, of course.</p><p>   What's the matter with you?</p><p>Germany has a completely different payment culture than many other countries. Much more cash is paid than elsewhere, and in many places nothing else is accepted. In many Berlin shops it seems to be hip to accept only cash payments. It's exciting to see how big the differences here are, even within Europe - in Sweden you're sometimes surprised when you want to pay cash, here in Berlin it's the other way round.</p><p>   You used to work for Google, now you work for a payment service provider. Anyone who is so \"digitized\" wouldn't have to leave the house to go shopping?</p><p>I think we're all still a long way from that. At Stripe, we intend to shift more economic activity to the online sector. However, this project is still anything but complete: Only about five percent of the world's economic output today takes place online, and there is still a lot of room for improvement. I often leave my house, and I actually like to do so.</p><p>   Can you even pay online without decrypting and questioning the payment process?</p><p>I do indeed; it's probably some kind of occupational disease. It annoys me far too often how cumbersome and tedious it is to pay something online. This could and should be a lot easier. No wonder most of the economic performance takes place offline, when it's still so much easier to pay cash!</p><p>   In Germany, you only started 2017 after a test phase lasting several years. What makes the German market more complicated than your home market USA?</p><p>We had already talked about the penchant for cash. In the USA, credit cards are the most common payment method for online purchases. Germany is much more complicated here: some want to pay by direct debit, others by invoice and still others by bank transfer.</p><p>   In September, a new payment directive, PSD2 for short, comes into force in Europe. Higher standards should make payment transactions more secure. But it also becomes much more complicated - for example, because customers have to identify themselves several times. Do you welcome this step, or is it a headache?</p><p>Above all, the upcoming new rules on strong customer authentication are intended to make shopping safer - namely by requiring consumers to authenticate themselves twice for many payment transactions. That's great first of all because it reduces online fraud. But of course a second authentication makes paying more complicated again, and some of the shoppers will therefore give up unnervedly. We have recently commissioned a study which concluded that strong customer authentication will lead to additional purchase cancellations of 57 billion euros per year. This is an enormous damage to the European online economy and it is a headache for me. But of course we have been preparing for this for a long time and I think we can help European companies to reduce the negative impact to a minimum.</p><p>   In the USA - from the point of view of \"us Europeans\" - there is much less concern about the regulation of the online world and technology companies. Is that a mistake?</p><p>That's not quite true, because a rethink has been underway for some time now. It is true, of course, that Europe has long been more critical than the US of the effects of the digital revolution and has discussed possible regulatory interventions. But in recent years these discussions have also increasingly arisen there, including demands for the splitting up of tech companies.</p><p>   In your keynote you complain that advertising is the dominant business model on the net. Most Internet users should be well aware of this by now. So why is this dramatic?</p><p>It's not about demonizing advertising, it's about the diversity of business models. The online economy should be as diverse as the offline economy. This would not only make them more robust, but would also help to shift more overall economic activity to the Internet and facilitate access for new businesses. With its services, Stripe makes innovative business models such as complex subscription and marketplace solutions much easier. Again and again I hear from such stripe users that they could not have built their company if we had not made the payment flows controllable for them in the background. This is highly motivating for me to hear, but it also shows that another online economy is possible. And only in this way will it be possible to significantly increase the share of online economic performance above the five percent mark.</p><p>   Looking to Europe again: are you jealous of legal instruments such as the basic data protection regulation in the face of your concerns?</p><p>I do not know whether regulation is always the best way to tackle imbalances. On the contrary, the complex requirements of the basic data protection regulation are probably often easier to implement by large companies with well staffed legal departments than by small and medium-sized enterprises, which may not even have their own legal department. We should not come to the point where regulation - without wanting it - strengthens the big ones and discriminates against the small ones. If, on the other hand, we give these little ones opportunities to realise complex business ideas without having to hire dozens of legal and payment experts, then we give them an advantage in competition with the big ones.</p><p>   Do you as a payment service provider not play in a similar league? After all, Google and Amazon are also among your customers.</p><p>That's right, even the very big tech companies are among our users. But they use the same stripe products and services as the little ones. The competition between them takes place at eye level.</p><p>Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg recently announced a new form of payment and currency - the digital money Libra. Your company has also joined the project. That contradicts your worries, doesn't it?</p><p>It is still too early to even talk about concrete applications for Libra. At Stripe, we support initiatives that make the online economy more accessible and safer for people around the world. Libra has the potential to make it easier for many people to access the world economy. That's why we're excited to explore the potential of the project with the other partners and, above all, to contribute things that will benefit developers and start-ups.</p><p>Note: This article has been translated automatically.</p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Document original</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"ASVWE20190703DWBEHPWIRTSCHAFTCK5T3MSV2TEXT\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14993\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Around 20,000 visitors attract more than 150 speakers and 120 Tech Open Air events to Berlin every year</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DIEWEN-164712503</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIEWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGF-6951-JBK9-20G2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465485</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1243\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Axel Springer SE All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Die Welt (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12658\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>Ausg. 152</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 3, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He told them to picture it stocked with their data broken up into categories like finances, location, relationships, and hobbies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"That is you,\" Mundt said. \"And I promise you this wall knows you better than your wife.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Few listened to Mundt when, a few years ago, he began raising alarms about the data collected by the tech giants. While online services like Facebook and Google did not charge a dime, people paid a high price by giving the companies so many personal details, he argued. And the people had no choice, because the companies had no real competitors.</p><p>But in February, his agency ruled that Facebook had broken the country's law and demanded that it stop automatically sharing data among the services it owns, like Instagram and WhatsApp, or websites that use its \"like\" and \"share\" buttons. It was the first such ruling in Europe, putting in practice ideas that had never fully escaped academic and think tank debates.</p><p>As US regulators and lawmakers intensify their scrutiny of Big Tech, there is a lot of discussion about whether or how they could accuse the companies of violating antitrust law. Often, regulators look to whether a company is causing consumer harm \u2014 a standard that can be hard to prove when a service is free.</p><p>The response from Mundt is simple. The only way to take on Facebook and some of its peers is to attack what they value most: data.</p><p>He argues the companies are so dominant in their core businesses that consumers, if they want to search the Internet or be on social media, have no choice but to share their personal data. The data then strengthen the tech companies' position over rivals even more \u2014 and therefore are anticompetitive, Mundt says.</p><p>The companies have strongly fought against his argument. But it is gaining traction in antitrust circles, as Mundt, who has led Germany's antitrust agency for almost a decade, urges officials in other nations to make the same point.</p><p>After the Facebook ruling, Mundt received calls from regulators and lawyers around the world to discuss the idea. He helped organize a meeting of fellow antitrust officials in Colombia, where they spent four days discussing tech regulation. Joseph Simons, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department antitrust division, were among those attending.</p><p>\"The German authority is way out in front here and in a real sense the leading antitrust authority in the world with respect to these technology issues,\" said Thomas Vinje, partner at the Clifford Chance law firm in Brussels and a veteran of tech industry antitrust battles involving Microsoft and Google.</p><p>Other regulators are looking to build on Germany's approach. The European Commission is in the early stages of an investigation into Facebook, including its use of data, said a person familiar with the inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>Online platforms constantly collect data on users: what is clicked on, how fast a person scrolls past a post, what video a person stops to watch. The information helps a company like Facebook infer characteristics about interests, personal connections, and financial demographics to better target advertising, or train machine-learning algorithms that can be used for future products.</p><p>It is an extraordinarily lucrative business model. Facebook made $55 billion from advertising last year, while Google's ad sales totaled $116 billion.</p><p>What's distressing to regulators is the lack of new competitors, a trend Mundt attributes to a company's access to data and plentiful financial resources. He says Facebook controls more than 95 percent of the social networking market in Germany. Without competition, the social network unfairly forces people to make an all-or-nothing choice between agreeing to unlimited data collection or not using Facebook at all.</p><p>When investigating Facebook, German regulators built a map of the information the company collects. It looked similar to the one Mundt described during his recent speech \u2014 a web of personal information that branched into details about homeownership, life events, politics, and buying behavior.</p><p>Mundt contends that Facebook and other tech giants don't need to be broken up, as Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and others have suggested. Instead, he thinks governments should limit their ability to collect data. The approach can have an effect similar to a breakup by isolating a company's different services.</p><p>\"The business model is to gather and process data, full stop. There is nothing else,\" Mundt said in an interview. \"If they don't have data, they can have 10,000 very intelligent engineers who tell you what you can make out of data, but without the data you don't make anything.\"</p><p>Germany is at the forefront of a deeper realization among regulators and policy makers globally that laws must evolve to keep pace with technological change. Rules that regulate industries like oil or transportation, where dominance is measured in physical goods and price gouging, don't as easily apply to services that are digital, are often free, and rely on people's attention and data more than infrastructure.</p><p>Critics say Germany's aggressive approach stretches the limits of antitrust law and won't stand up to court reviews. Mundt's focus on data is seen by some as overly simplistic and, if adopted widely, will make it harder to offer free services. Because data is shared widely among different businesses and industries, critics say, the attempts to limit its flow will cause unintended consequences and disruptions.</p><p>\"European regulators are using competition policy to pursue objectives that are unrelated to competition,\" said Eline Chivot, a senior policy analyst in Brussels for the Center for Data Innovation, a group funded by a Washington think tank whose board includes representatives from Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. \"It introduces uncertainty.\"</p><p>Facebook is appealing the German decision, arguing that it was transparent with users about how data is collected. The social network argues that its use of data helps improve the service and that German regulators singled it out for practices common across the Internet.</p><p>Even those who support Germany's broader goals question whether its approach will be effective. The February ruling allows Facebook to continue sharing data between Instagram and WhatsApp if it gets users to click a new permission box. Many wonder how effective the ruling will be because most people will sign off without much thought.</p><p>\"It might be that you'll end up in the same place you started,\" said Jason Furman, a senior economic adviser in the Obama administration.</p><p>Furman, a Harvard professor advising the British government on tech regulation, said that rather than relying on antitrust law alone, countries should create a dedicated regulator for the tech industry, to match those covering the banking, health, and transportation sectors of the economy. He said a watchdog with expertise in the field could better review a company's behavior and use of data on a case-by-case basis. He said new laws requiring companies to make some of their data available to rivals also could seed competition.</p><p>In the United States, where antitrust law has a narrower scope than in Europe, experts say Germany's approach won't work because it relies on privacy and consumer protection rules that don't exist in America. But lawmakers and federal regulators in Washington are studying new ways to account for data in regulating the digital economy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-db6f99ec-a10b-11e9-8bee-fd559cadf095</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHH-WH51-JC2G-C2GF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1349\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 8, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Financial technology has existed for practically as long as the financial services industry itself. The telegraph and the transatlantic cable laid in 1866 to connect North America and Europe is a clear example. That technology provided the infrastructure for the first era of major financial globalisation in the late 19th century. And innovations such as the automated teller machine (ATM), credit cards, electronic payments and internet banking have each changed the face of modern banking.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But now we are entering the next phase of the digital age, when the combination of new telecommunications, big data analytics, cryptography and machine learning technologies has the potential to change the whole banking industry in faster and more disruptive ways than ever before.</p><p>As technology gives new entrants better and cheaper ways to compete for core banking business, banks dominant position could be challenged. And indeed, we are already seeing disruptions in the financial services market:</p><p>In the first half of 2018, global investment in fintech reached $57.9 billion across 875 deals, a significant increase from the $38.1 billion invested in the whole of 2017.</p><p>The time span for adopting various banking innovations, such as online or mobile banking, is getting shorter and shorter.</p><p>Many consumers are switching to e-commerce, and more e-retail payments are made from mobile phones. Consumers expect pan-European services that are safe, efficient and easy to use. With the recent launch of TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS), the Eurosystem has laid the groundwork for innovative, customer-friendly retail payment solutions that benefit everyone in Europe. TIPS is a truly domestic market infrastructure for pan-European instant payments with settlement in central bank money within 10 seconds and a price fixed at 0.20 eurocent.</p><p>Technological investment in cash cycles is also strong and helping to make this safe, instant and cheap means of payment resilient. Indeed, on average, cash payments take just over 22 seconds and cost around 24 cent per transaction according to a recent study of retail sector cash payments in Germany.</p><p>Fintechs could make the financial system more diverse and competitive, offering customers better-targeted, faster and cheaper financial services. But fintech could also lead to the emergence of new risks and greater concentration.</p><p>So far, regulators have tolerated or even facilitated these developments. In the EU, for instance, the revision of the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) aims to foster innovation and enhance competition by requiring banks to share account information.</p><p>But to the extent that fintechs are providing core banking services, regulators and central bankers need to monitor their activities in order to follow risk migration.</p><p>Fintech credit: lending in transition</p><p>Fintechs have now moved into core banking services, including the credit business.</p><p>Currently, fintech credit makes up only a very small fraction of overall credit, but it is growing rapidly and could become more dominant in certain market segments. In the United States, for example, 36% of unsecured personal lending was issued by fintechs in 2017.</p><p>Fintech is often associated with small start-ups  technologically innovative firms with agile business models. But huge, globally active technology companies, the so-called big tech companies, are also entering the market. These companies have a competitive advantage because they can leverage their existing customer networks and huge amounts of proprietary data to provide financial services. Moreover, their enormous balance sheets give them the financial capacity to handle credit risks economically on a large scale.</p><p>These comparative advantages of big tech could, in principle, generate benefits for customers. By using predictive algorithms, machine learning and a wider range of data, available from online spending or social media, for example, big tech could become more efficient at lending than traditional banks.</p><p>Moreover, if big tech can speed up loan application processing, reduce transaction costs and improve credit risk assessments, it could increase the overall degree of competition in credit markets.</p><p>And with their increasing market share, these companies could help diversify the sources of credit to the economy, thus fostering investment and growth.</p><p>However, these big tech companies are generally less motivated by the return on their credit activity and more by the access they get to data that let them sell products and services over and above their financial activities.</p><p>Therefore we cant rule out some negative side effects. Not only could large technology companies increase market concentration by exploiting their network externalities, they could also create new risks.</p><p>For example, risks could arise from big techs funding models, which often use a mix of internal and external investors to finance loans or repackage and sell them to third-party investors. Such originate-to-distribute models can lead to information asymmetries, incentive problems and financial instability  as we painfully learned from the mortgage lending that led to the subprime crisis.</p><p>Another type of fintech is the so-called peer-to-peer lender, which offers credit services in a fundamentally different way to banks in that the services are unbundled. Electronic platforms typically match borrowers and investors without taking on balance sheet risks and generate fee revenue rather than net interest.</p><p>Technological innovation may enable lending platforms to become more efficient and more targeted in terms of how they intermediate between borrowers and lenders and thus put pressure on incumbent banks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-139105204</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJ0-B281-JDJN-63TP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"976\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

The law, which has yet to be approved by parliament, would expand the powers of the Federal Cartel Office to regulate companies that dominate the Internet economy. The proposed rules would allow the German antitrust regulator to step in if marketplace platforms use the data they collect from smaller businesses through their site to undercut competitors.    \"It\u2019ll help many middle-sized companies, but above all benefit millions of consumers by helping them gauge digital offers better and take decisions without being influenced,\u201d Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said at a press conference on Sept 9.    The European Union is separately working on similar ways to extend oversight for large Internet platforms, including legislation on so-called \"gatekeeper\u201d platforms that may control how smaller businesses can reach customers. Antitrust regulators are also debating how to handle Internet sites that may favour their own services over rivals, a frequent complaint from app developers, online retailers and search services about companies such as Amazon, Apple and Google.    \"The big platforms use their exclusive positions to keep competition at arms length,\u201d said Matthias Heider, deputy chairman of the economic committee in the lower house of parliament. \"We cannot wait to take action against this market abuse by digital platforms.\u201d    In a case that may have prompted the draft law, Berlin-based home rental platform HomeToGo filed a complaint in 2019 against Google with the European Commission for re-routing traffic from competitors to their own travel offering. It\u2019s still unclear whether the Commission will open a case to investigate Google, a person familiar with the situation said. \u2013 Bloomberg</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43034670397</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T2-8PV1-F07F-82H6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"360\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>TheStar.com.my</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 9, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Most likely tomorrow, Draghi will just confirm that easing is very much on the cards - just not till September.</p><p>And it has not been a good day for carmakers, under pressure from falling sales in China, fading demand in Europe, and the need to finance massive investments in new electric vehicle technology.</p><p> Aston Martin shares have lost almost a quarter of their value at the time of writing, after a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-prepares-to-enter-downing-st-and-name-cabinet-theresa-may-prime-minister-live-news\">warning that its sales forecasts were too positive</url>. </p><p>The beleaguered company made a surprise announcement to the stock market on Wednesday revealing a 22% drop in sales to UK car dealers in the second quarter, and a 28% slump across the rest of Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p><p>And Nissan prompted fears of job losses in its Sunderland plant.

So when Berlin raced to embrace digital technologies to fight COVID-19, some observers took it as a new chapter in the country's economic leadership. If it seemed too good to be true, however, that's because it was. Berlin's efforts are floundering in a sudden, and telling, fashion. </p><p>Even at a time of unprecedented crisis, Germany seems fated to slow down the continent's technological advancement. The early signs had been auspicious. In March, Berlin launched[1] a nationwide hackathon, #WirVsVirus, drawing more than 28,000 participants and generating 1,500 crowdsourced ideas for combating COVID-19. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Germany's equivalent of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, rolled[2] out a symptom tracker app connected to fitness bracelets and smartwatches that racked up 400,000 users, providing RKI with swaths of heart rate, temperature, and activity data to monitor COVID-19 development patterns. Across German society, popular willingness surged to reevaluate the country's stringent and popular data protection rules in favor of solutions to stop the virus in its tracks. The tech euphoria culminated in the launch[3] of the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) initiative, which would seek to use Bluetooth technology to trace human-to-human infection contact via smartphones while also adhering to European-level privacy regulations. The project was announced on April 1 with the support of the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, RKI, and 130 leading European computer scientists. Most importantly, it had the support of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government[4], which even announced it would test the app using troops from the German military. Fronted by Germany's top artificial intelligence cheerleader Hans-Christian Boos, PEPP-PT began to gain momentum, with eight governments announcing support, including France and Italy. But within weeks, it came crashing down. Government funding for hackathon[5] projects has been slow to materialize. RKI's symptom tracker app came under attack[6] from Chaos Computer Club, Germany's influential hacker association, which revealed that the app runs personal data through Big Tech intermediaries and allows German health authorities access to data even after the app is deleted. But the biggest domino[7] to fall was PEPP-PT. An open letter[8] signed by some 300 tech experts viciously criticized the centralized data processing of contract tracing apps. The PEPP-PT app was designed to provide anonymized data to national health authorities with users' consent. For the letter authors, this was 'mission creep' toward greater surveillance. Other critics claimed that PEPP-PT lacked transparency because its founders were unwilling to openly publish their code. Still others questioned the claim that it was truly a pan-European initiative; despite some token additions from France and others, PEPP-PT was essentially a German project. Also, and not least, the cybersecurity proved shoddy; the Federal Office for Information Security, Germany's cyber-authority, said the Android version was riddled with vulnerabilities. The criticism led to an exodus among the app's founding supporters. PEPP-PT's death nail came from Apple, one half of the Big Tech duopoly[9] that controls 99 percent of German smartphone operating systems. Unlike Google, Apple refused to unlock its operating system interface to allow central processing of Bluetooth data. Faced with increasing hurdles, the German government shifted[10] its support away from the centralized PEPP-PT to an as-yet-undetermined decentralized option. Out of the ashes, alternative app projects[11] have taken center stage in the private sector. The latest standout, the Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-3T)\u2014developed by a Swiss-led consortium of techies and civil society\u2014would store data on users' phones, relying on decentralized data storage and processing rather than a central hub. DP-3T has won the support of privacy advocates, and a prototype has been available since April 17 for Android and iOS. But DP-3T's fully decentralized approach is not without its critics\u2014including from within the German government. Health Minister Jens Spahn exasperatedly questioned[12] why tech civil society would prefer a decentralized option that locally processes data through U.S.-developed operating systems and thus privileges American Big Tech in controlling data rather than national health authorities. He is not alone. The decentralized option has increased fears among German tech companies\u2014start-ups and national champions alike\u2014that the COVID-19 crisis will consolidate Germany's dependence on U.S. tech giants. The country's GesundZusammen ('Healthy Together') coalition of start-ups criticized[13] the government for not seizing contact tracing apps as an opportunity to emancipate European tech from Silicon Valley. Germany's own legacy tech giants, Deutsche Telekom and SAP, have embraced similar arguments. The German government has tacitly endorsed their argument, informally tasking those companies with creating a decentralized Stopp Corona app at the end of April. But, even then, the operating systems for such decentralized apps will remain in the hands of the U.S. tech giants. (As one German parliament member dryly noted, SAP and Deutsche Telekom aren't exactly known for their app development prowess, in any case.) Germany's app wars have resurrected familiar tech fault lines. The country's resistance to centralized data storage and processing is a reflection of historical anxieties. Postwar West Germany reacted to the experience of totalitarianism by establishing the principle[14] of 'informational self-determination,' a strict notion of data protection as a human right. Eventually, Germany exported the principle at the European Union level through the General Data Protection Regulation, which, since 2018, has become a de facto global standard. Germany continues to have one of the lowest cloud adoption rates in Europe, owing, in part, to a suspicion of potential data abuse by outsiders, a perception reinforced for many by the U.S. National Security Agency and Cambridge Analytica scandals. Many Germans\u2014not just citizens but businesses and governments\u2014prefer to keep their data physically close, be it in their phones, in on-site servers, or regulated through tough data localization laws. The COVID-19 app wars have also confronted Germany with a vexing paradox of Big Tech. Opting for a decentralized system might be better for privacy in some sense, but it also means relying more heavily on Google or Apple, reinforcing the sense that Europe has sleepwalked through the tech boom of the past decade. Strangely, the EU itself has played little role in Germany's app debates. The European Parliament called[15] for a decentralized option, but member states have split into two camps, with France, Italy, and Britain in favor of a centralized solution and Austria, Switzerland, and Spain backing a decentralized approach. The U-turn toward a decentralized option by the German government will likely prove decisive. But it remains unclear to what extent countries' regulatory frameworks will allow apps developed in Berlin, Bordeaux, and Barcelona to work across the EU. Germany's intense debates about surveillance technology\u2014and the trade-offs it brings in terms of autonomy, privacy, and dignity\u2014may not really be about the current crisis at all but rather the next one. In some instances, contact tracing apps can become general purpose technologies and lead to new forms of discrimination. They could also become backdoors to a social scoring system and other deeper forms of surveillance. Some have called for a task force for coronavirus digital architecture to examine the implications not only of surveillance apps but also blockchain-based immunity passports, fitness symptom monitors, AI-powered triage systems, and social media disinformation monitoring. That might lead to more oversight from Germany's parliament, which has largely been sidelined in the COVID-19 crisis thus far. Largely left out of the discussion in Germany is whether a contact tracing app will work at all. Despite the political rancor and moral ambivalence around contact tracing apps, Germany's political elite still continues to put a lot of faith\u2014at least rhetorically\u2014in them as the bridge to a post-vaccine future. But it isn't even clear yet whether the technology will be effective. The testing that apps rely on abounds with false positive and false negative cases. Meanwhile, 60 to 70 percent of the population must use the nonmandatory apps in order to work, but the public opinion damage done by the polarizing debate around the apps might put that goal in question. A poll[16] by the German broadcaster ZDF revealed that 47 percent of Germans surveyed would be willing to install a social tracing app\u2014but 42 percent would not. Taken together, the debate is bit of a Rorschach test for Germany in the global geotech age, one that reveals the country is obsessed, moralizing, and anxious about getting left behind.It remains to be seen whether Germany\u2014and Europe with it\u2014will do anything about it. Maybe there's an app for that.

He told them to picture it stocked with their data broken up into categories </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">such as finances, location, relationships and hobbies.</p><p>\"That is you,\" Mundt said. \"And I promise you this wall knows you better than your wife.\"</p><p>Few listened to Mundt when, a few years ago, he began raising alarms about the data collected by the tech giants. While online services such as Facebook and Google did not charge a dime, people paid a high price by giving the companies so many personal details, he argued. And the people had no choice, because the companies had no real competitors.</p><p>But in February, his agency ruled that Facebook had broken the country's law and demanded that the company stop automatically sharing data among the services it owns, such as Instagram and WhatsApp, or websites that use its \"like\" and \"share\" buttons. It was the first such ruling in Europe, putting in practice ideas that had never fully escaped academic and think-tank debates.</p><p>As US regulators and lawmakers intensify their scrutiny of big tech, there is a lot of discussion about whether or how they could accuse the companies of violating antitrust law. Often, regulators look to whether a company is causing consumer harm - a standard that can be hard to prove when a service is free.</p><p>The response from Mundt is simple. The only way to take on Facebook and some of its peers is to attack what they value most: data.</p><p>He argues that the companies are so dominant in their core businesses that consumers, if they want to search the internet or be on social media, have no choice but to share their personal data. The data then strengthens the tech companies' position over rivals even more - and therefore is anticompetitive, Mundt says.</p><h> Gaining traction The companies have strongly fought against his argument. But it is gaining traction in antitrust circles, as Mundt, who has led Germany's antitrust agency for almost a decade, urges officials in other nations to make the same point.</h><p>After the Facebook ruling, Mundt received calls from regulators and lawyers around the world to discuss the idea. He helped organise a meeting of fellow antitrust officials in Colombia, where they spent four days discussing tech regulation. Joseph Simons, chairman of the US federal trade commission, and Makan Delrahim, head of the US justice department's antitrust division, were among those attending.</p><p>\"The German authority is way out in front here and in a real sense the leading antitrust authority in the world with respect to these technology issues,\" said Thomas Vinje, a partner at the Clifford Chance law firm in Brussels and a veteran of tech industry antitrust battles involving Microsoft and Google.</p><p>Other regulators are looking to build on Germany's approach. The European Commission is in the early stages of an investigation into Facebook, including its use of data, said a person familiar with the inquiry who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><h>Extraordinarily lucrative </h><p>Online platforms constantly collect data on users: what is clicked on, how fast a person scrolls past a post, what video a person stops to watch. The information helps a company such as Facebook infer characteristics about interests, personal connections and financial demographics to better target advertising, or train machine-learning algorithms that can be used for future products.</p><p>It is an extraordinarily lucrative business model. Facebook made $55 billion from advertising last year, while Google's ad sales totalled $116 billion.</p><p>What's distressing to regulators is the lack of new competitors, a trend Mundt attributes to a company's access to data and plentiful financial resources. He says Facebook controls more than 95 per cent of the social networking market in Germany. Without competition, the social network unfairly forces people to make an all-or-nothing choice between agreeing to unlimited data collection or not using Facebook at all.</p><p>When investigating Facebook, German regulators built a map of the information the company collects. It looked similar to the one Mundt described during his recent speech - a web of personal information that branched into details about home ownership, life events, politics and buying behaviour.</p><p>Mundt contends that Facebook and other tech giants don't need to be broken up, as US senator Elizabeth Warren and others have suggested. Instead, he thinks governments should limit their ability to collect data. The approach can have an effect similar to a breakup by isolating a company's different services.</p><p>\"The business model is to gather and process data, full stop. There is nothing else,\" Mundt said in an interview. \"If they don't have data, they can have 10,000 very intelligent engineers who tell you what you can make out of data, but without the data you don't make anything.\"</p><p>Germany is at the forefront of a deeper realisation among regulators and policy-makers globally that laws must evolve to keep pace with technological change. </p><p>Rules that regulate industries such as oil or transportation, where dominance is measured in physical goods and price gouging, don't as easily apply to services that are digital, are often free and rely on people's attention and data more than infrastructure. - New York Times News Service</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3959763</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKM-DGC1-JC8Y-81D8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"904\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0006QHC</classCode><className>CLIFFORD CHANCE LLP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But many Germans still have reservations about this technology. Now, German industry is urging greater progress, as Sabine Kinkartz reports from Berlin.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Smart devices equipped with voice-controlled virtual assistants are ubiquitous today - and probably featured under many Christmas trees this holiday season. These systems can be prompted to play music, switch the lights and television on, do online shopping, answer manifold questions and much more. In short, they are already making everyday life much easier for us. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But in return, they feed back large quantities of user data to the major tech companies behind these devices. And many of them are even fitted with cameras and facial recognition technology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon, Alibaba, Google, Facebook, Apple and many other big tech companies are busily gathering and processing our data with the help of special software. They analyze consumer preferences to develop user profiles for targeted advertising. Artificial intelligence (AI) is not only used for such marketing purposes, of course, though this is where many consumers are already experiencing what this technology can already do today.</p><p>So far, AI still does not rival human intelligence. But self-learning computers are already capable of processing and analyzing vast quantities of data in short periods of time.</p><p>Everyone is after data</p><p>US tech companies capitalize on our data by selling it or using it to send us targeted advertising. In China, meanwhile, such data is processed with the help of AI and software capable of recognizing facial features and gaits. This is done to control Chinese citizens and force them into conformity.</p><p>Dieter Janecek, a lawmaker in the German parliament and member of the Greens, warns that such technology could \"lead us straight into a total surveillance state.\" Janecek, who cares deeply about Europeans' civil rights, says \"we don't want this to happen here.\" That is why he says Europe must become a real alternative to the US and China and develop AI technology that honors European values.</p><p>Together with numerous other MPs, Janecek contributes to a parliamentary committee on AI that aims to investigate \"the chances and challenges represented by new technologies.\" The committee, which will be disbanded by fall 2020, has already submitted its first interim report on how AI will impact the healthcare sector, the economy and the German state. After this it will look into its effect on the labor market, German media and transport.</p><p>German lawmakers divided over AI</p><p>The commission is deeply divided over whether AI should be welcomed or treated with utmost caution. Members of Germany's environmentalist Greens, socialist Left Party and some center-left Social Democrats are predominately skeptical of this new technology. But Ronja Kemmer of the center-right Christian Democrats worries that such an attitude could hurt Germany, saying that \"if we allow every potential risk or mistake of an AI system to become an obstacle, there will be no innovation.\" Kemmer thinks this could leave Germany playing catch-up. </p><p>One of the biggest bones of contention is the issue of data privacy. Joana Cotar of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party says that Germans \"have a tendency to demonize the gathering and processing of data on principle.\" But, she says, if hospitals were to collect and analyze data to reduce the number of deaths and devise new treatment methods, this would surely be a good thing. That is why she wants Germany's General Data Protection Regulation to be amended. Cotar thinks that Germans should no longer fear giving up personal data provided it is anonymized and pseudonymized.</p><p>World won't wait for Germany</p><p>Social Democratic lawmaker Rene R\u00f6spel, too, highlights the danger of data surveillance and insists that \"AI should serve humanity\" and contribute to sensible societal progress. But what, exactly, does \"sensible\" progress mean? And for how much longer does Germany intend to debate this issue while other nations already move ahead?</p><p>Ronja Kemmer is certain that \"the world will not wait\" for Germany to open up to AI technology. She says other nations are already investing billions in this sector, and that \"we need to get moving fast.\" She believes that AI \"Made in Europe\" could be a success - though she stresses that this depends on scientific and technological progress as well as sustainable business models being developed.</p><p>US and China lead the way</p><p>The US and China are already way ahead of Europe with regard to AI technology. Back in 2016, under President Barack Obama, the US devised its first AI strategy. Each year, the US state invests $1.5 billion (1.3 billion) in AI research and development.</p><p>A study by Germany's Konrad Adenauer Foundation found that the reasons why the US is the global leader in AI stem from the fact that it \"generates the most influential research papers on AI, has some 3,000 doctoral scholars working in this field each year and boasts about 1,400 AI startups and seven of the world's leading tech companies.\" On top of this, the study says that over the past 40 years, US universities, state agencies and companies have developed a close-knit cooperative network.</p><p>China looking to set standards</p><p>But that dominance is waning. In the summer of 2017, the Chinese State Council presented its national AI strategy, which is set out in three stages: catching up with the US by 2020, overtaking it by 2025 and leading the way globally from 2030. China is investing a lot to achieve these goals. Beijing has announced it will provide 16.4 billion to promote the chip industry. The city of Tianjin alone has put aside a fund of 12.8 billion for advancing AI.</p><p>Compared with this, Germany is lagging far behind. In November 2018, the government approved its AI strategy. Some 3 billion are to be made available to implement it, but in the financial planning up to 2023, only 1 billion in subsidies is budgeted for. Debate is continuing over where the rest of the money should come from. Only two of the 100 AI professorships that have been announced have been filled so far.</p><p>Focus on industry?</p><p>This AI strategy is facing criticism from many quarters, including the Federation of German Industries (BDI), which is calling for more budget funds. In a policy paper on artificial intelligence, the BDI also provides recommendations for other steps to take. A central demand made in the paper is for Germany to concentrate on AI applications that are of use to industry and for it to develop its own focus and competence in this area.

But many Germans still have reservations about this technology. Now, German industry is urging greater progress, as Sabine Kinkartz reports from Berlin.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Smart devices equipped with voice-controlled virtual assistants are ubiquitous today - and probably featured under many Christmas trees this holiday season. These systems can be prompted to play music, switch the lights and television on, do online shopping, answer manifold questions and much more. In short, they are already making everyday life much easier for us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But in return, they feed back large quantities of user data to the major tech companies behind these devices. And many of them are even fitted with cameras and facial recognition technology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon, Alibaba, Google, Facebook, Apple and many other big tech companies are busily gathering and processing our data with the help of special software. They analyze consumer preferences to develop user profiles for targeted advertising. Artificial intelligence (AI) is not only used for such marketing purposes, of course, though this is where many consumers are already experiencing what this technology can already do today.</p><p>So far, AI still does not rival human intelligence. But self-learning computers are already capable of processing and analyzing vast quantities of data in short periods of time.</p><p>Everyone is after data</p><p>US tech companies capitalize on our data by selling it or using it to send us targeted advertising. In China, meanwhile, such data is processed with the help of AI and software capable of recognizing facial features and gaits. This is done to control Chinese citizens and force them into conformity.</p><p>Dieter Janecek, a lawmaker in the German parliament and member of the Greens, warns that such technology could \"lead us straight into a total surveillance state.\" Janecek, who cares deeply about Europeans' civil rights, says \"we don't want this to happen here.\" That is why he says Europe must become a real alternative to the US and China and develop AI technology that honors European values.</p><p>Together with numerous other MPs, Janecek contributes to a parliamentary committee on AI that aims to investigate \"the chances and challenges represented by new technologies.\" The committee, which will be disbanded by fall 2020, has already submitted its first interim report on how AI will impact the healthcare sector, the economy and the German state. After this it will look into its effect on the labor market, German media and transport.</p><p>German lawmakers divided over AI</p><p>The commission is deeply divided over whether AI should be welcomed or treated with utmost caution. Members of Germany's environmentalist Greens, socialist Left Party and some center-left Social Democrats are predominately skeptical of this new technology. But Ronja Kemmer of the center-right Christian Democrats worries that such an attitude could hurt Germany, saying that \"if we allow every potential risk or mistake of an AI system to become an obstacle, there will be no innovation.\" Kemmer thinks this could leave Germany playing catch-up.</p><p>One of the biggest bones of contention is the issue of data privacy. Joana Cotar of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party says that Germans \"have a tendency to demonize the gathering and processing of data on principle.\" But, she says, if hospitals were to collect and analyze data to reduce the number of deaths and devise new treatment methods, this would surely be a good thing. That is why she wants Germany's General Data Protection Regulation to be amended. Cotar thinks that Germans should no longer fear giving up personal data provided it is anonymized and pseudonymized.</p><p>World won't wait for Germany</p><p>Social Democratic lawmaker Rene R\\xF6spel, too, highlights the danger of data surveillance and insists that \"AI should serve humanity\" and contribute to sensible societal progress. But what, exactly, does \"sensible\" progress mean? And for how much longer does Germany intend to debate this issue while other nations already move ahead?</p><p>Ronja Kemmer is certain that \"the world will not wait\" for Germany to open up to AI technology. She says other nations are already investing billions in this sector, and that \"we need to get moving fast.\" She believes that AI \"Made in Europe\" could be a success - though she stresses that this depends on scientific and technological progress as well as sustainable business models being developed.</p><p>US and China lead the way</p><p>The US and China are already way ahead of Europe with regard to AI technology. Back in 2016, under President Barack Obama, the US devised its first AI strategy. Each year, the US state invests $1.5 billion (1.3 billion) in AI research and development.</p><p>A study by Germany's Konrad Adenauer Foundation found that the reasons why the US is the global leader in AI stem from the fact that it \"generates the most influential research papers on AI, has some 3,000 doctoral scholars working in this field each year and boasts about 1,400 AI startups and seven of the world's leading tech companies.\" On top of this, the study says that over the past 40 years, US universities, state agencies and companies have developed a close-knit cooperative network.</p><p>China looking to set standards</p><p>But that dominance is waning. In the summer of 2017, the Chinese State Council presented its national AI strategy, which is set out in three stages: catching up with the US by 2020, overtaking it by 2025 and leading the way globally from 2030. China is investing a lot to achieve these goals. Beijing has announced it will provide 16.4 billion to promote the chip industry. The city of Tianjin alone has put aside a fund of 12.8 billion for advancing AI.</p><p>Compared with this, Germany is lagging far behind. In November 2018, the government approved its AI strategy. Some 3 billion are to be made available to implement it, but in the financial planning up to 2023, only 1 billion in subsidies is budgeted for. Debate is continuing over where the rest of the money should come from. Only two of the 100 AI professorships that have been announced have been filled so far.</p><p>Focus on industry?</p><p>This AI strategy is facing criticism from many quarters, including the Federation of German Industries (BDI), which is calling for more budget funds. In a policy paper on artificial intelligence, the BDI also provides recommendations for other steps to take. A central demand made in the paper is for Germany to concentrate on AI applications that are of use to industry and for it to develop its own focus and competence in this area. It says that German industry is already a global leader in the field of intelligent automation, intelligent sensor technology and robotics and that this should be built upon. The paper cites hybrid AI as an example. This field includes models in which human expert knowledge and machine-based learning methods are combined.</p><p>The BDI paper says that US companies dominated in the area of data-driven applications and platforms in the private consumer sector, while China was strong on national security and online trading. \"Germany and Europe will not be able to hold their own against international competition if they focus on the same areas,\" it says.</p><p>Source: DW - Deutsche Welle</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XW4-NBM1-JB5P-J2HV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1211\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 2, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00080KU</classCode><className>AI SYSTEMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The draft Ministerial bill on the 10th amendment of the German Act Against Restraints of Competition[1] ('GWB'), published at the beginning of October, aims at continuing Germany's role as a pioneer in antitrust regulation of digital markets.Regulation of digital markets - the broader context'Divesture', 'Break up', or 'Regulation' of tech players. Political statements and requests on how to deal with 'Tech Giants' from Silicon Valley or China have become more frequent, especially over the last 12 months. According to our global study on regulation of technology markets[2], there were more than 450 political initiatives in the first half of 2019 which supported a tougher regulatory stance on 'Big Tech'. However, so far most of these fairly populistproposals lack implementation.Over the last few years, antitrust law has transformed into a particularly powerful tool against market power in the online market. </p><p>EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager made a name for herself with billions in fines and tax reclaims against companies, especially from Silicon Valley. In the next term Commissioner Vestager will also be given responsibility for the digital sector. This dual role will further strengthen the importance of antitrust law. In Germany, the Federal Cartel Office ('Bundeskartellamt') was no less ambitious and used its competences to deal with online marketplaces and social networks. Thus, it does not come as a surprise that our global study on regulation of technology markets[3] around a quarter of the political initiatives opting for stronger regulation of tech companies.By and large, these proposals have not made it through the discussion stage. However, with the now published draft German 'digital antitrust' bill, Germany is focusing on an actual legislative project to endow the Bundeskartellamt with more competences, placing itself at the forefront of global regulators.Main proposals on regulation of digital markets at a glanceAbout two years after the last revision of the GWB, the German goverment has decided to take the next step towards stronger antitrust regulation of companies with digital business models. Some parts of the current proposals will certainly attract particular attention in Silicon Valley and China. In particular, the German digital antitrust bill provides for, Access rights to 'data relevant for competition', making such data a factor in determining a dominant market position and refusal of access to such data being regarded as an abuse of market power; Stricter antitrust regulation of digital platforms through a mechanism that enables the Bundeskartellamt to not only declare by order that large digital platforms are such with 'paramount significance for competition across the markets', but also to impose stricter antitrust rules on them in a second step; Particular regulation of digital platforms: so called 'intermediaries', e.g. multi-sided digital platforms whose business model it is to collect, aggregate and evaluate data in order to reconcile supply and demand between user groups, will be subject to specific antitrust supervision; Right of intervention against so-called 'tipping' of markets, i.e. the 'overturning' of a market with several suppliers into a monopolistic or highly concentrated market as well as new interim injunction measures that make it easier for the Bundekartellamt to deal with possible violations of antitrust laws in the future; Broader protection against so-called relative market power that - under the new law - will not only protect small and medium-sized enterprises, but apply to any B2B situation where a company is dependent on other market participants. More legal certainty for horizontal cooperations through new rules entitling companies to a decision by the Bundeskartellamt on the legality of a planned cooperation with a competitor (instead of reliance on a self-assessment only) if the companies have a substantial legal and economic interest in such a decision. Over the last years Germany has seen itself as a pioneer of antitrust law regulation of digital markets. As the official title of the now proposed 10th amendment of the GWB shows, the German Government has proposed nothing less than a 'Law digitizing the Act against Restraints of Competition' which - if adopted - will equip the Bundeskartellamt in the area of digital markets with far more tools than most other competition authorities.In the end, it remains to be seen whether Germany's legislative push will result in further fragmentation of regulation or, whether perhaps the German draft will become a blueprint for other European and non-European countries. If Germany, with its ambitious digital antitrust law, succeeds in setting standards for tools being made available to competition authorities and if the Bundeskartellamt manages to make use of them in a reasonable and successful way, Germany may soon belong to the digital avant-garde albeit in regulating big tech companies rather than attracting them. In any event, the proposed bill sets the scene for future antitrust enforcement in digital markets, probably not only in Germany. Companies should be aware of these changes and make sure their antitrust compliance systems are digital avant-garde as well. Germany breaks new ground with this proposed bill. However, it also raises plenty of questions that beg for answers: Unlike many other markets, the online markets are truly global. Big players are represented in almost all markets in the US, Europe and - with a few exceptions in China, South Korea and Japan which often have strong domestic digital companies - also in most Asian countries. That being said, what is the reason for a German rather than a European solution? Wouldn't the European Commission with its ambitious Competition Commissioner Vestager and the newly achieved digital portfolio be better equipped to create a Union 'level playing field'?Conclusion and OutlookOver the last years Germany has seen itself as a pioneer of antitrust law regulation of digital markets.

It's called Frei, he says - the German word for free. \"I like that a lot,\" he says. \"Competition law is a lot about freedom. It's about choice. And this matters a lot to me.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Mundt has led the Bonn-based Bundeskartellamt, Germany's competition watchdog, since 2009.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past decade, he has grown increasingly frustrated with the amount of power the Big Tech companies have accrued because of their mass collection of user data. Most recently, the Bundeskartellamt head had become especially exasperated with Facebook Inc. Specifically, he wanted to put an end to its practice of combining user data collected from its proprietary platforms - Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp - as well as information from third-party websites to build eerily accurate profiles that help advertisers better target users. And he has taken his fight all the way to Germany's highest court.</p><p>In Mr. Mundt's mind, Facebook's arsenal of digital data sources - not just the three largest social-media platforms in the world, but also countless other websites its 2.5 billion users visit that contain tracking codes that share data with Facebook - are unmatched and give the company enormous market power. And the granularity of the personal data the platform is able to accrue has the power to influence user behaviour on a mass scale through advertising.</p><p>Sometimes it's as obvious as an ad for a pair of shoes following you around the internet after you browsed for them on Amazon. But such power can also have serious consequences: Russian entities are suspected to have used Facebook ads to help swing the 2016 U.S. election in Donald Trump's favour. The subsequent Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the company used Facebook users' profile data without their permission to target them with political ads, only enhanced mistrust in unchecked data aggregation.</p><p>As Silicon Valley's data-collection capabilities have deepened over the past decade, plenty of jurisdictions have started scrutinizing the role Facebook and other platforms play in the lives of their citizens.</p><p>But few countries have been as aggressive as Germany not just in calling them out, but in taking action to curb their Big Brother tendencies. While most recent antitrust rulings against data-driven players have focused on financial punishments (including the European Union's 1.5-billion fine against Google last year for anticompetitive behaviour in online search advertising), Mr. Mundt didn't think a mere fine sent a strong enough message. Instead, he wants Facebook to fundamentally change the business model that brings in tens of billions of dollars in ad revenue each year.</p><p>In February, 2019, the Bundeskartellamt announced it would prohibit the social-media company from combining user data from multiple platforms. The case is now before the Bundesgerichtshof, Germany's top court. If he succeeds, Mr. Mundt hopes it will lead to a fairer social internet, one that would give users more freedom and control over how private companies profit from their personal information.</p><p>\"If we want to deal with the market power of these companies and deal with abuse that might be happening,\" he says, \"we have to answer the fundamental question of how to deal with these data issues.\"</p><p>Germany's fight has potentially huge implications not just for Facebook and its Big Data brethren, but for the billions of people who use their platforms every day. And its privacy-first ethos is spreading.</p><p>Here in Canada, federal Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien is fighting for greater powers against data abusers. Canada also just spearheaded a move among global privacy commissions to call for greater collaboration with competition authorities to tackle data protection. Multiple U.S. states are building their own antitrust cases against the Silicon Valley giants, calling out their absolute control over consumers' data (even as the companies themselves claim to face plenty of competition). Facebook's home state of California has begun enforcing strict privacy laws of its own; New York is expected to follow suit.</p><p>Mr. Mundt's home country is still at the vanguard, however. \"Germany is the leading privacy and dataprotection country in the world,\" says Ontario's former privacy commissioner, Ann Cavoukian, who regularly liaised with the country's privacy authorities during her three terms. \"There's nothing comparable to Germany.\"</p><p>And Mr. Mundt is certainly not alone. Everyone from German Chancellor Angela Merkel (who late last year urged the European Union to wrest back control of citizens' personal information and manage it more directly) to grassroots activists to the country's Berlin-centred startup sector are onside with his crusade.</p><p>\"Maybe we have to restrict business in certain situations to respect the privacy of every person,\" says Samuli Siren, managing director of Redstone VC in Berlin. \"I'm totally okay when business is limited when it comes to values that are important to us. I'll put it this way: Let's not do business for any price.\"</p><p>Germany's fierce pro-privacy bent has deep roots.</p><p>It's been just three decades since the fall of the Berlin Wall - 30 years since the East German domestic spy agency, the Stasi, controlled a web of 90,000 staff and nearly twice as many informants, who tracked citizens to silence dissidents and build paranoia across the country. That, coupled with the Nazi regime's pervasive use of surveillance and recordkeeping to track Jews and other targeted groups, has left many German people with a deep suspicion of mass data collection.</p><p>In 1970, the West German state of Hesse passed the world's first data-protection law, prompting other states in the Federal Republic to do the same. National legislation requiring consent when a person's data are processed followed in 1978. A subsequent court ruling that personal data should be constitutionally protected was later built into German law in time for reunification in 1990.</p><p>That legacy lives on. Germans still cling to cash, and few independent businesses accept credit or debit payments, wary of creating a digital trail.</p><p>There's less social-media penetration, too: While 53 per cent of Canadians actively used Facebook each month in 2019, only 32 per cent of Germans did, according to research firm eMarketer.</p><p>When the EU began exploring a broad data-use framework for the bloc earlier this decade, not only did Germany take a lead in designing it, but the country's laws served in part as a blueprint, says Sontje Julia Hilberg, a partner with Deloitte Legal in Berlin who focuses on data-protection law. (It was</p><p>also premised partly on \"privacy by design,\" a concept developed by Ms. Cavoukian in the 1990s that insists technology be built with privacy as a foremost consideration.) That framework became the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which went into effect in 2018 and applies to any company that does business in the EU.</p><p>GDPR grants EU citizens some of the world's most extensive rights regarding data collection. People must be informed whenever their personal information is being collected by a website and give their express consent. (That stipulation has had ramifications for web users there and even worldwide, with a wave of consent requests about \"cookies\" popping up on virtually every site.) GDPR also gives Europeans extensive control over how their data are used.</p><p>That includes the right to decide whether those data are processed in the first place and to ask for it to be erased.</p><p>Companies that violate the regulations - some of which Facebook lobbied against, according to a Guardian report - can be fined up to 4 per cent of their global revenue. France fined Google 50-million ($72-million) in January, 2019, for providing users with an insufficient consent policy and for not giving them enough control over their data. This past November, Germany fined the real estate firm Deutsche Wohnen 14.5-million over insufficient data-retention procedures.</p><p>Privacy regulation isn't the only front on which Europe is restricting data collection. The EU's competition commission has served Google with billions of euros in fines because of concerns over the dominant position of its parent company, Alphabet Inc., in the search, app and ad-sales markets. More recently, the EU commission has been looking into the dominance of Facebook's classified-ads division.</p><p>Although the fines have so far been minor (with annual revenue of US$137-billion in 2018, the EU levy was barely a slap on the wrist for Alphabet), the new regulations have brought the importance of data privacy into the public conversation and forced companies of all kinds to consider the value of data protection, Deloitte's Ms. Hilberg says. \"People are now more aware it,\" she says, adding that its values are spreading beyond the EU: \"It's become a political instrument to make clear that data privacy should be a worldwide concern.\"</p><p>Mr. Mundt has been obsessed with how the internet shifts market forces since he arrived at the Bundeskartellamt more than a decade ago. After first fighting resale price-fixing of products sold online, midway through the decade, he shifted focus to the accumulation of data, assigning an internal task force to examine its role in competition. By 2017, the agency had pushed legislators to update Germany's competition act to factor in access to data when determining a company's dominance. After all, the biggest digital giants - Facebook, Google, Amazon - built empires by learning all they could about their users.</p><p>Even when consumers don't directly pay to use Big Tech's services, the Bundeskartellamt argued that data collection created a multisided market in which data creates power.</p><p>\"If we assume that these are really powerful companies, then we have to deal with the question of: Is the gathering of the data done in an appropriate manner?\" Mr. Mundt asks. \"For us, this is of special importance, because we are one of the rare countries where this a parameter that is mentioned in the law.\"</p><p>The Bundeskartellamt's case argues that the California company's user terms and conditions, which allow Facebook to aggregate data from its multitude of apps and third-party datasets, are anticompetitive. Because there is no alternative social network with Facebook's reach, the German agency says, users who want to take part have no choice to agree to its terms. Mr. Mundt believes this could also contravene GDPR, given its strict rules around data collection and consent. \"If there were two social networks in terms of quality and network effects - one with privacy and one without - I have no doubt the consumer would choose the one with privacy,\" he says.</p><p>In August, Facebook successfully appealed the Bundeskartellamt's case in a regional court, prompting the competition office to take the matter straight to Germany's highest court, from whom the parties now await a final decision.</p><p>Facebook declined to comment on the case, but said in a statement: \"The Bundeskartellamt underestimates the fierce competition we face in Germany and the choices people have, misinterprets our compliance with GDPR and undermines the mechanisms European law provides for ensuring consistent data protection standards across the EU.\" In short: Facebook believes consumers have plenty of choice - and warns that an EU country taking a standalone position on data runs against the spirit of GDPR.</p><p>The regional court also disagreed with Mr. Mundt's argument that consumers have little choice but to agree with Facebook's terms and data aggregation. Hamburg competition lawyer Stefan Horn, who has studied the decision, says the court found reasonable flaws in the Bundeskartellamt's argument. \"I would guess people agree with Facebook's terms and conditions simply because they don't care, and it does not have any negative impact on their economic freedom,\" Mr. Horn said.</p><p>But freedom is the word Mr. Mundt has hitched both his career and his Supreme Court appeal to.</p><p>Even if he loses, he hopes to at least clarify the role competition law can play in making Big Tech fairer for consumers. \"It cannot be,\" he says, \"that all the laws we have worldwide for the protection of competition are not applicable vis-\u00e0-vis these companies.\"</p><p>Like Mr. Mundt, Germany's tech sector has been finding new ways to deal with data collection. Although the startup and investment community in Berlin - sometimes jokingly referred to as Silicon Allee - was the second-biggest in the EU last year by venture dollars deployed, behind London, it hasn't exactly flourished this century. Both capital and public awareness still tends to focus on more traditional manufacturers such as Siemens and Bosch, along with its robust auto sector, which includes Volkswagen and Daimler.</p><p>German investors are wary of venture-capital investing, and funds sometimes have an easier time attracting U.S. capital than domestic. Until a few years ago, many of the country's digital stars merely mimicked successes from other markets, often backed by prominent Berlin venture firm Rocket Internet SE.</p><p>But the country's stringent data-collection regulations might actually be the key to boosting its startup sector. A new generation of digital firms is using Germany's GDPR-backed, privacy-first mentality to its advantage. \"Short-term, it appears like a disadvantage,\" says Christian Nagel, managing partner at Earlybird Venture Capital in Berlin. But as more jurisdictions become privacy-minded, he says, \"I think it's a matter of time before it comes to every country.\"</p><p>Xain AG - short for \"the Expandable Artificial Intelligence Network\" - is building its entire business around maximum privacy. Machine-learning algorithms are key tools of today's AI technology, capable of studying large pools of data to help find patterns and develop innovations. To do this, data usually need to be centralized and, under GDPR, sufficiently stripped of identifying information before it can be analyzed. Bringing data to the algorithms is costly and time-consuming, and can result in whole datasets being cast away because they aren't properly anonymized. Xain's algorithms work on data at the source with a sophistication typically reserved for AI powerhouses such as Google. Leif-Nissen Lundb\u00e6k, Xain's chief executive, calls the startup a \"GDPR-compliant layer for machine learning.\"</p><p>In his office a few blocks from Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, he explains the technology through a familiar German lens: cars. Training autonomous vehicles requires studying an extraordinary amount of data about the environment around a car and the human decisions that guide it. But these kinds of data can expose a person's home, their workplace, their neighbours and passersby, which means it all has to be de-identified. \"The problem is that all this data is vastly privacy-sensitive, because we can learn everything about you from you driving around,\" Mr. Lundb\u00e6k says, adding that Xain has signed partnerships with both Porsche and Daimler (he declined to provide any details).</p><p>Xain has also developed an \"accounting assistant\" called ANDY that automates invoice processes while keeping data private. And the company hopes to integrate with all kinds of data-collecting technologies. As Xain product manager Lea Danschel puts it, \"We could be the privacy backbone of every AI application.\"</p><p>Another AI powerhouse - Google - is a looming presence in Berlin. The company's local headquarters are here, and in 2016, it proposed building a startup hub in Kreuzberg, a bastion for artists, new immigrants, punks and anarchists just east of Berlin's core. The proposed development, which would include workspaces, services and mentorship opportunities for local startups, was slated to occupy an abandoned electrical substation. But a local association called GloReiche quickly came out against the plan.</p><p>But the movement soon morphed from focusing on the gentrification of one of Berlin's beloved affordable enclaves to a continuing protest of the power of Big Tech.</p><p>Smoking a hand-rolled cigarette last fall as he stood in front of the substation, GloReiche activist Stefan Klein proudly described the numerous demonstrations and sit-ins Kreuzberg's eclectic residents have held to protest the campus. In October, 2018, the protesters got their wish: Google stepped back from the proposed redevelopment and said it would offer the substation to two social-focused organizations. The company declined to comment on the move, but it said in a statement that after \"numerous discussions with initiatives and neighbours,\" it had decided to cover rent and other costs for the organizations for five years.</p><p>Those two words - \"five years\" - make Mr. Klein uneasy. Google has a long-term lease on the space.</p><p>He worries the company could march back in later, jack up rents, and begin to buy up Berlin-based talent and startups to populate its campus.</p><p>One activist, from a prominent faction of the antiGoogle campaign composed of self-described nerds, spoke to The Globe and Mail about what the group sees as the company's outsized power over the internet. (Their identity is being kept confidential because of potential professional retribution.) The activist said the group hopes to one day dismantle and decentralize that power, which Google accrued by amassing data about its users for nearly two decades across search, e-mail, mobile devices and more, fuelling one of the world's most successful advertising programs. The activist admitted it would be na\u00efve to believe that stopping the Kreuzberg campus will solve the problems presented by powerful tech giants such as Google. But if nothing else, the protests have made those problems more obvious to everyone around them. Similar groups worldwide now turn to Berlin's activists to discuss tactics - including Toronto's #BlockSidewalk campaigners, who are hoping to cancel a \"smart\" community designed by Google affiliate Sidewalk Labs.</p><p>It's not just activists who are starting to adopt Germany's approach to Big Tech. In November, Amnesty International issued a report arguing that Google and Facebook's data-collection terms constitute a \"Faustian bargain.\" In order to enjoy the vast swaths of the internet to which they provide access, users must sign away their privacy right, creating \"a system predicated on human-rights abuse.\"</p><p>In the United States, antitrust action against Big Tech players has ramped up in the months since the Bundeskartellamt took aim at Facebook, with dozens of states using competition law as grounds to keep better tabs on it and Google. California, home to so many juggernaut tech platforms, has passed a new Consumer Privacy Act with many parallels to GDPR. It came into force in January, and a California Department of Justice study estimates compliance will cost businesses US$55-billion.</p><p>\"Everybody was scared when [GDPR] came up, because they thought, 'Oh, we can't exchange data anymore,' \" Berlin venture capitalist Christian Nagel says. \"Long-term, I think it will be an advantage, because I think it's a matter of time before it comes to every country. Because the nature of people is to want security. They want data protection. They want to be in charge.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20200118rbcdgermanytech</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6058-NW71-F06S-31MG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3227\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

It's called Frei, he says - the German word for free. \"I like that a lot,\" he says. \"Competition law is a lot about freedom. It's about choice. And this matters a lot to me.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Mundt has led the Bonn-based Bundeskartellamt, Germany's competition watchdog, since 2009. Over the past decade, he has grown increasingly frustrated with the amount of power the Big Tech companies have accrued because of their mass collection of user data. Most recently, the Bundeskartellamt head had become especially exasperated with Facebook Inc. Specifically, he wanted to put an end to its practice of combining user data collected from its proprietary platforms - Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp - as well as information from third-party websites to build eerily accurate profiles that help advertisers better target users. And he has taken his fight all the way to Germany's highest court.</p><p>In Mr. Mundt's mind, Facebook's arsenal of digital data sources - not just the three largest social-media platforms in the world, but also countless other websites its 2.5 billion users visit that contain tracking codes that share data with Facebook - are unmatched and give the company enormous market power. And the granularity of the personal data the platform is able to accrue has the power to influence user behaviour on a mass scale through advertising. Sometimes it's as obvious as an ad for a pair of shoes following you around the internet after you browsed for them on Amazon. But such power can also have serious consequences: Russian entities are suspected to have used Facebook ads to help swing the 2016 U.S. election in Donald Trump's favour. The subsequent Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the company used Facebook users' profile data without their permission to target them with political ads, only enhanced mistrust in unchecked data aggregation.</p><p>As Silicon Valley's data-collection capabilities have deepened over the past decade, plenty of jurisdictions have started scrutinizing the role Facebook and other platforms play in the lives of their citizens. But few countries have been as aggressive as Germany not just in calling them out, but in taking action to curb their Big Brother tendencies. While most recent antitrust rulings against data-driven players have focused on financial punishments (including the European Union's  1.5-billion fine against Google last year for anticompetitive behaviour in online search advertising), Mr. Mundt didn't think a mere fine sent a strong enough message. Instead, he wants Facebook to fundamentally change the business model that brings in tens of billions of dollars in ad revenue each year.</p><p>In February, 2019, the Bundeskartellamt announced it would prohibit the social-media company from combining user data from multiple platforms. The case is now before the Bundesgerichtshof, Germany's top court. If he succeeds, Mr. Mundt hopes it will lead to a fairer social internet, one that would give users more freedom and control over how private companies profit from their personal information.</p><p>\"If we want to deal with the market power of these companies and deal with abuse that might be happening,\" he says, \"we have to answer the fundamental question of how to deal with these data issues.\"</p><p>Germany's fight has potentially huge implications not just for Facebook and its Big Data brethren, but for the billions of people who use their platforms every day. And its privacy-first ethos is spreading. Here in Canada, federal Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-canadas-privacy-commissioner-says-urgent-need-for-laws-to-make/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-canadas-privacy-commissioner-says-urgent-need-for-laws-to-make/</url> against data abusers. Canada also just       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://globalprivacyassembly.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DCCWG-Resolution_ADOPTED.pdf\">http://globalprivacyassembly.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DCCWG-Resolution_ADOPTED.pdf</url> among global privacy commissions to call for greater collaboration with competition authorities to tackle data protection. Multiple U.S. states are building their own antitrust cases against the Silicon Valley giants, calling out their absolute control over consumers' data (even as the companies themselves claim to face plenty of competition). Facebook's home state of California has begun enforcing strict privacy laws of its own; New York is expected to follow suit.</p><p>Mr. Mundt's home country is still at the vanguard, however. \"Germany is the leading privacy and data-protection country in the world,\" says Ontario's former privacy commissioner, Ann Cavoukian, who regularly liaised with the country's privacy authorities during her three terms. \"There's nothing comparable to Germany.\"</p><p>And Mr. Mundt is certainly not alone. Everyone from German Chancellor Angela Merkel (who late last year urged the European Union to wrest back control of citizens' personal information and manage it more directly) to grassroots activists to the country's Berlin-centred startup sector are onside with his crusade.</p><p>\"Maybe we have to restrict business in certain situations to respect the privacy of every person,\" says Samuli Siren, managing director of Redstone VC in Berlin. \"I'm totally okay when business is limited when it comes to values that are important to us. I'll put it this way: Let's not do business for any price.\"</p><p>Germany's fierce pro-privacy bent has deep roots.</p><p>It's been just three decades since the fall of the Berlin Wall - 30 years since the East German domestic spy agency, the Stasi, controlled a web of 90,000 staff and nearly twice as many informants, who tracked citizens to silence dissidents and build paranoia across the country. That, coupled with the Nazi regime's pervasive use of surveillance and record-keeping to track Jews and other targeted groups, has left many German people with a deep suspicion of mass data collection.</p><p>In 1970, the West German state of Hesse passed the world's first data-protection law, prompting other states in the Federal Republic to do the same. National legislation requiring consent when a person's data are processed followed in 1978. A subsequent court ruling that personal data should be constitutionally protected was later built into German law in time for reunification in 1990.</p><p>Privacy regulation isn't the only front on which Europe is restricting data collection. The EU's competition commission has served Google with billions of euros in fines because of concerns over the dominant position of its parent company, Alphabet Inc., in the search, app and ad-sales markets. More recently, the EU commission has been looking into the dominance of Facebook's classified-ads division.</p><p>Although the fines have so far been minor (with annual revenue of US$137-billion in 2018, the EU levy was barely a slap on the wrist for Alphabet), the new regulations have brought the importance of data privacy into the public conversation and forced companies of all kinds to consider the value of data protection, Deloitte's Ms. Hilberg says. \"People are now more aware it,\" she says, adding that its values are spreading beyond the EU: \"It's become a political instrument to make clear that data privacy should be a worldwide concern.\"</p><p>Mr. Mundt has been obsessed with how the internet shifts market forces since he arrived at the Bundeskartellamt more than a decade ago. After first fighting resale price-fixing of products sold online, midway through the decade, he shifted focus to the accumulation of data, assigning an internal task force to examine its role in competition. By 2017, the agency had pushed legislators to update Germany's competition act to factor in access to data when determining a company's dominance. After all, the biggest digital giants - Facebook, Google, Amazon - built empires by learning all they could about their users. Even when consumers don't directly pay to use Big Tech's services, the Bundeskartellamt argued that data collection created a multisided market in which data creates power.</p><p>\"If we assume that these are really powerful companies, then we have to deal with the question of: Is the gathering of the data done in an appropriate manner?\" Mr. Mundt asks. \"For us, this is of special importance, because we are one of the rare countries where this a parameter that is mentioned in the law.\"</p><p>The Bundeskartellamt's case argues that the California company's user terms and conditions, which allow Facebook to aggregate data from its multitude of apps and third-party datasets, are anticompetitive. Because there is no alternative social network with Facebook's reach, the German agency says, users who want to take part have no choice to agree to its terms. Mr. Mundt believes this could also contravene GDPR, given its strict rules around data collection and consent.</p><p>WOR LD PRI V A CY L EGIS L ATI O N</p><p>CANA DA</p><p>The Libe ral g overnment keeps discussing m oving Canada</p><p>t owa rd a GDP R-li ke privacy regime, including upd ating the</p><p>decades-old PersonalIn form ation P r o tection and Elect ronic</p><p>Documents Ac t.

Hamburg competition lawyer Stefan Horn, who has studied the decision, says the court found reasonable flaws in the Bundeskartellamt's argument. \"I would guess people agree with Facebook's terms and conditions simply because they don't care, and it does not have any negative impact on their economic freedom,\" Mr. Horn said.</p><p>But freedom is the word Mr. Mundt has hitched both his career and his Supreme Court appeal to. Even if he loses, he hopes to at least clarify the role competition law can play in making Big Tech fairer for consumers. \"It cannot be,\" he says, \"that all the laws we have worldwide for the protection of competition are not applicable vis-\u00e0-vis these companies.\"</p><p>Like Mr. Mundt, Germany's tech sector has been finding new ways to deal with data collection. Although the startup and investment community in Berlin - sometimes jokingly referred to as Silicon Allee - was the second-biggest in the EU last year by venture dollars deployed, behind London, it hasn't exactly flourished this century. Both capital and public awareness still tends to focus on more traditional manufacturers such as Siemens and Bosch, along with its robust auto sector, which includes Volkswagen and Daimler.</p><p>German investors are wary of venture-capital investing, and funds sometimes have an easier time attracting U.S. capital than domestic. Until a few years ago, many of the country's digital stars merely mimicked successes from other markets, often backed by prominent Berlin venture firm Rocket Internet SE.</p><p>But the country's stringent data-collection regulations might actually be the key to boosting its startup sector. A new generation of digital firms is using Germany's GDPR-backed, privacy-first mentality to its advantage. \"Short-term, it appears like a disadvantage,\" says Christian Nagel, managing partner at Earlybird Venture Capital in Berlin. But as more jurisdictions become privacy-minded, he says, \"I think it's a matter of time before it comes to every country.\"</p><p>Xain AG - short for \"the Expandable Artificial Intelligence Network\" - is building its entire business around maximum privacy. Machine-learning algorithms are key tools of today's AI technology, capable of studying large pools of data to help find patterns and develop innovations. To do this, data usually need to be centralized and, under GDPR, sufficiently stripped of identifying information before it can be analyzed. Bringing data to the algorithms is costly and time-consuming, and can result in whole datasets being cast away because they aren't properly anonymized. Xain's algorithms work on data at the source with a sophistication typically reserved for AI powerhouses such as Google. Leif-Nissen Lundb\u00e6k, Xain's chief executive, calls the startup a \"GDPR-compliant layer for machine learning.\"</p><p>In his office a few blocks from Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, he explains the technology through a familiar German lens: cars. Training autonomous vehicles requires studying an extraordinary amount of data about the environment around a car and the human decisions that guide it. But these kinds of data can expose a person's home, their workplace, their neighbours and passersby, which means it all has to be de-identified. \"The problem is that all this data is vastly privacy-sensitive, because we can learn everything about you from you driving around,\" Mr. Lundb\u00e6k says, adding that Xain has signed partnerships with both Porsche and Daimler (he declined to provide any details).</p><p>Xain has also developed an \"accounting assistant\" called ANDY that automates invoice processes while keeping data private. And the company hopes to integrate with all kinds of data-collecting technologies. As Xain product manager Lea Danschel puts it, \"We could be the privacy backbone of every AI application.\"</p><p>Another AI powerhouse - Google - is a looming presence in Berlin. The company's local headquarters are here, and in 2016, it proposed building a startup hub in Kreuzberg, a bastion for artists, new immigrants, punks and anarchists just east of Berlin's core. The proposed development, which would include workspaces, services and mentorship opportunities for local startups, was slated to occupy an abandoned electrical substation. But a local association called GloReiche quickly came out against the plan.</p><p>But the movement soon morphed from focusing on the gentrification of one of Berlin's beloved affordable enclaves to a continuing protest of the power of Big Tech.</p><p>Smoking a hand-rolled cigarette last fall as he stood in front of the substation, GloReiche activist Stefan Klein proudly described the numerous demonstrations and sit-ins Kreuzberg's eclectic residents have held to protest the campus. In October, 2018, the protesters got their wish: Google stepped back from the proposed redevelopment and said it would offer the substation to two social-focused organizations. The company declined to comment on the move, but it said in a statement that after \"numerous discussions with initiatives and neighbours,\" it had decided to cover rent and other costs for the organizations for five years.</p><p>Those two words - \"five years\" - make Mr. Klein uneasy. Google has a long-term lease on the space. He worries the company could march back in later, jack up rents, and begin to buy up Berlin-based talent and startups to populate its campus.</p><p>One activist, from a prominent faction of the anti-Google campaign composed of self-described nerds, spoke to The Globe and Mail about what the group sees as the company's outsized power over the internet. (Their identity is being kept confidential because of potential professional retribution.) The activist said the group hopes to one day dismantle and decentralize that power, which Google accrued by amassing data about its users for nearly two decades across search, e-mail, mobile devices and more, fuelling one of the world's most successful advertising programs.</p><p>The activist admitted it would be na\u00efve to believe that stopping the Kreuzberg campus will solve the problems presented by powerful tech giants such as Google. But if nothing else, the protests have made those problems more obvious to everyone around them. Similar groups worldwide now turn to Berlin's activists to discuss tactics - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-opponents-of-sidewalk-labs-get-advice-from-german-tech-protesters/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-opponents-of-sidewalk-labs-get-advice-from-german-tech-protesters/</url>, who are hoping to cancel a \"smart\" community designed by Google affiliate Sidewalk Labs.</p><p>It's not just activists who are starting to adopt Germany's approach to Big Tech. In November, Amnesty International issued a report arguing that Google and Facebook's data-collection terms constitute a \"Faustian bargain.\" In order to enjoy the vast swaths of the internet to which they provide access, users must sign away their privacy right, creating \"a system predicated on human-rights abuse.\"</p><p>In the United States, antitrust action against Big Tech players has ramped up in the months since the Bundeskartellamt took aim at Facebook, with dozens of states using competition law as grounds to keep better tabs on it and Google. California, home to so many juggernaut tech platforms, has passed a new Consumer Privacy Act with many parallels to GDPR. It came into force in January, and a California Department of Justice study <url normalizedValue=\"https://secure.tgam.arcpublishing.com/composer/Sitting%20in%20a%20sun-splashed%20office%20on%20the%20edge%20of%20the%20Rhine%20River%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20West%20German%20presidents,%20Andreas%20Mundt%20leans%20his%20elbows%20on%20a%20table%20and%20nods%20to%20a%20yellow%20and%20blue%20experimental%20painting%20by%20the%20artist%20Maiken%20Bardeschi.%20It%E2%80%99s%20called%20Frei,%20he%20says%20%E2%80%93%20the%20German%20word%20for%20free.%20%E2%80%9CI%20like%20that%20a%20lot,%E2%80%9D%20he%20says.%20%E2%80%9CCompetition%20law%20is%20a%20lot%20about%20freedom.%20It%E2%80%99s%20about%20choice.%20And%20this%20matters%20a%20lot%20to%20me.%E2%80%9D\">https://secure.tgam.arcpublishing.com/composer/Sitting%20in%20a%20sun-splashed%20office%20on%20the%20edge%20of%20the%20Rhine%20River%20that%20once%20belonged%20to%20West%20German%20presidents,%20Andreas%20Mundt%20leans%20his%20elbows%20on%20a%20table%20and%20nods%20to%20a%20yellow%20and%20blue%20experimental%20painting%20by%20the%20artist%20Maiken%20Bardeschi.%20It%E2%80%99s%20called%20Frei,%20he%20says%20%E2%80%93%20the%20German%20word%20for%20free.%20%E2%80%9CI%20like%20that%20a%20lot,%E2%80%9D%20he%20says.%20%E2%80%9CCompetition%20law%20is%20a%20lot%20about%20freedom.%20It%E2%80%99s%20about%20choice.%20And%20this%20matters%20a%20lot%20to%20me.%E2%80%9D</url> compliance will cost businesses US$55-billion.</p><p>\"Everybody was scared when [GDPR] came up, because they thought, 'Oh, we can't exchange data anymore,' \" Berlin venture capitalist Christian Nagel says. \"Long-term, I think it will be an advantage, because I think it's a matter of time before it comes to every country.

Parked on the sixth floor of a drab, anonymous government building in Hamburg, it is a far cry from the sweet dispensers and mini golf course of Google's HQ nearby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet this office, with its small budget and 20 staff, has issued orders and fines that have made American tech giants sit up and take notice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Britain, we often hear that regulating social media is impossible or prohibitively difficult, and that any attempt would risk driving companies abroad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Germany, however, has already implemented protection against online abuse and under age access - and tech companies, far from fleeing, are staying and complying. So as MPs mull the impact of fake news and the Telegraph campaigns to make the internet safer for young people, what can Britain learn?</p><p>\"We have different cultural habits on enforcing the law in Germany,\" says Dr Caspar, Hamburg's data protection commissioner. \"When you look at colleagues outside continental Europe, we are more regulating and enforcing laws and they are more negotiating and trying to get answers by communication.\"</p><p>A former law professor, Dr Caspar has repeatedly taken on the big tech companies with headquarters in his jurisdiction. In 2013, he fined Google for illegally collecting data from open Wi-Fi networks with its Street View camera vans; in 2017 he ordered Facebook not to transfer user data from WhatsApp.</p><p>Ulrich K\u00fchn, his deputy, says: \"My impression is that [tech firms] don't care about privacy. If you compare privacy to the business models of these companies, they are diametrically opposed.</p><p>\"I don't know any of them that didn't grow by breaching privacy principles.\"</p><p>Therefore, says Dr Caspar, financial pressure is required: \"If they don't have the threat of higher fines, they won't do anything.\"</p><p>Until recently, neither Britain nor Germany had this power: Google's fine in 2013 was around \u00a3120 million, while Facebook paid only \u00a3500,000 in Britain - less than 0.01 per cent of its revenue - for the Cambridge Analytica data breach.</p><p>Now the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives states the power to levy fines of up to 4 per cent of revenue, and the British government plans to keep that after Brexit.</p><p>Still, Dr Caspar believes this will be purely theoretical unless regulators wield it.\u00a0An example of Germany's ferocity is the Network Enforcement Act, or NetzDG.</p><p>Passed in a hurry last year amid fears that the 2017 federal election would be flooded with fake news, after two years of fruitless discussions with tech companies, it aimed to enforce Germany's laws against hate speech, threats and incitement to crime online.</p><p>Under it, s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/02/12/german-court-says-facebook-data-collection-illegal/\">ocial networks must block illegal content</url> within a week and \"obviously illegal\" content within 24 hours; failure to do so can result in a fine of 50 million euros.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/02/12/german-court-says-facebook-data-collection-illegal/\">Social network removal requests (Germany 2018) for illegal content</url></p><p>\"Facebook had said to German legislators that for them German law is basically irrelevant, and it's only EU standards that apply,\" says Tankred Schipanski, digital spokesman for the ruling CDU party.</p><p>\"A newspaper is liable and responsible for when it violates someone's rights. The same should be applied to social media companies.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/02/12/german-court-says-facebook-data-collection-illegal/\">The law is controversial</url> : far-Right populists call it an establishment stitch-up, proclaiming \"the end of free speech\", while human rights groups warn it will turn private companies into risk-averse censors that \"overblock\" to avoid fines.</p><p>Judith Steinbrecher, of Bitkom, representing German tech firms including Facebook, says it \"infringes freedom of expression\" and might even \"intensify populism\" by suppressing debate.</p><p>High-profile early deletions include two joke tweets from the satirical magazine Titanic.</p><p>But six months in and there is\u00a0little sign of \"overblocking\". Statistics released by Facebook, Twitter and YouTube did indeed show that hundreds of thousands of posts and videos were reported.</p><p>Only a small amount, however - between 11 and 27 per cent - led to action. The vast majority were closed within 24 hours, indicating the companies themselves regarded them as clear-cut. In murkier cases, they consulted lawyers. Mr Schipanski admits there is more work to be done.</p><p>Facebook has been criticised for making its NetzDG reporting system too complicated, and Germany is considering changing the law so users can challenge wrongful deletions.</p><p>But, he said, the principle can be extended to other countries. The EU is considering legislation on similar principles, while France, Israel, Italy and Canada have all contacted the German government for guidance. Less controversial are Germany's systems for protecting children.</p><p>In Britain, plans to make all pornographic websites verify their users' age or be blocked by internet service providers have been pushed back due to privacy fears and technical issues.</p><p>But in Germany, age verification has been widely used and accepted since 2003. Users can register themselves at the post office, to a postman on their doorstep, at the bank or to call centre staff on a webcam, and subsequently log in with a pin number, an ID code or SIM card.</p><p>Ironically, Germany lacks the power to enforce regulations on foreign firms due to opposition from civil libertarians. But Britain has been blocking child porn and pirated music since 2013 - something Mr Schipanski thinks Germany could adopt. Germany also has stricter protections for children's data.</p><p>GDPR allows member states to set an \"age of consent\" below which companies may not process someone's personal data without permission from parents.</p><p>By default, this age is 16 - but Britain has it set at 13, the age cited in most US tech firms' terms of service. Germany has kept it at 16, with the result that social media companies have had to change the system for users below that age.</p><p>On Facebook, for example, you cannot display \"sensitive\" personal data, such as religious views and sexual orientation, on your profile without parental consent.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/02/12/german-court-says-facebook-data-collection-illegal/\">At a glance | Your data rights under GDPR</url></p><p>Advertising is only targeted based on age, location and gender, never on anything \"liked\" or posted. The problem with all such systems is the lack of serious age verification.</p><p>Most social networks simply ask users to enter a birth date when they sign up, and accept what is declared. Facebook's parental consent system can be easily fooled.</p><p>According to Dr Caspar, this may be unavoidable: asking children to verify their age would paradoxically require asking for even more personal data.</p><p>But Mr K\u00fchn also believes there are other options. \"It's interesting that the tech industry, with all its imagination and financial resources, has never come up with anything else,\" he says.</p><p>\"I'm not sure why the industry is so reluctant.\"</p><p>Jan Albrecht, a German MEP who helped guide GDPR through the European Parliament, agrees, saying a system that automatically scanned ID cards and only checked name and birth date could avoid collecting more data than is already taken.</p><p>In response to an undercover investigation, which found moderators deliberately ignoring clear signs of under age use, Facebook pledged to proactively ban users who seemed under age.</p><p>Can Britain really copy all this? And more to the point, should we? Damian Collins, chairman of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/02/12/german-court-says-facebook-data-collection-illegal/\">wrote in the Telegraph\u00a0</url> that Britain must find a similar way of making tech firms liable, while Norman Lamb, chairman of the science and technology committee, said Britain risks being \"behind the curve\" and should be looking at Germany \"very closely\".</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/02/12/german-court-says-facebook-data-collection-illegal/\">Fake news | What exactly is it - and how can you spot it?</url></p><p>Characteristically, most Germans believe that only Europe-wide rules can tame the tech titans. \"This is not amenable to national solutions,\" says Mr Schipanski. Dr Caspar is likewise keen to stress the EU's role.</p><p>But German laws such as NetzDG go beyond what the EU requires, and he thinks it would be \"too pessimistic\" to say tech cannot be regulated. \"They are not aliens,\" he says.</p><p>\"They are companies offering services for people living in Europe, and if they are in this playground, they have to play by our rules.\" American firms could have deserted Hamburg for one of Germany's 15 other states, but they have not.</p><p>Mr K\u00fchn puts it more bluntly: \"The idea of a company moving out of a country because the data privacy regulator pushes too hard is far-fetched.\"</p><p>How closely Britain should actually follow Germany's example is a question for voters and MPs. Some ideas would be fiercely debated.</p><p>What is clear is that social media does not exist in some other dimension unreachable by judges and politicians. We have the power to change it, if we wish to.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-46319920</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T0R-R3M1-JCJY-G38W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1443\"/><timeReceived>8:07 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 10, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The union has repeatedly gone after big tech on competition matters and GDPR's four percent of worldwide annual turnover fines show it doesn't intend on giving tech giants a free pass.</p><p><br/> European ministers are now looking for more permanent ways of making sure that tech superpowers - such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft - play by the rules and pay their fair share. Latest addition is Germany's finance minister, Olaf Scholz. He wrote a guest article in Welt am Sonntag where he urged for universal approach to preventing tax evasion by big tech.<br/> \"We need a worldwide minimum tax level that no state may go below,\" Scholz wrote, adding that additional measure would need to be taken to make it harder to move profits into tax havens.<br/>Reuters reports that Germany is considering this along with France, ensuring that the EU's two biggest players are behind the idea. However, Scholz' article does come as a surprise as Berlin has been more cautious when it comes to tech tax since he took office - probably due to fears of an EU-US trade war negatively impacting German car manufactures.<br/> Just last month, Scholz said it was \"necessary to take some time for debate\" regarding EU's plans for three percent levy on digital revenues of large firms like Google and Facebook, based on overall revenue in the continent and not just profits. But it seems Scholz has had his debate and is now fully behind imposing greater taxes on big tech.<br/> Unsurprisingly, one of the main opponents of the idea is Ireland, which would lose revenue as it houses the European headquarters of many of the world's biggest tech companies (due to its favorable tax breaks). Nordic governments also worry it might stifle innovation and, similar to Germany, fear escalation of trade war with the US.<br/> With the backing of the finance ministers of the EU's most influential members, France and Germany, it seems likely that a compromise on new tech tax will be reached by the end of the year - despite concerns of some member states.<br/> It'll be interesting to see how US tech giants react, as people like Tim Cook have been quite vocal when it comes to stricter EU regulations.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-n10705786</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TJH-4P81-DYDW-74HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"386\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 22, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The union has repeatedly gone after big tech on competition matters[1] and GDPR's four percent of worldwide annual turnover fines[2] show it doesn't intend on giving tech giants a free pass. European ministers are now looking for more permanent ways of making sure that tech superpowers \u2014 such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft \u2014 play by the rules and pay their fair share. </p><p>Latest addition is Germany's finance minister, Olaf Scholz. He wrote a guest article in Welt am Sonntag[3] where he urged for universal approach to preventing tax evasion by big tech.'We need a worldwide minimum tax level that no state may go below,' Scholz wrote, adding that additional measure would need to be taken to make it harder to move profits into tax havens. Reuters reports[4] that Germany is considering this along with France, ensuring that the EU's two biggest players are behind the idea. However, Scholz' article does come as a surprise as Berlin has been more cautious when it comes to tech tax since he took office \u2014 probably due to fears of an EU-US trade war negatively impacting German car manufactures[5]. Just last month, Scholz said[6] it was 'necessary to take some time for debate' regarding EU's plans for three percent levy on digital revenues[7] of large firms like Google and Facebook, based on overall revenue in the continent and not just profits. But it seems Scholz has had his debate and is now fully behind imposing greater taxes on big tech. Unsurprisingly, one of the main opponents of the idea is Ireland, which would lose revenue as it houses the European headquarters of many of the world's biggest tech companies (due to its favorable tax breaks[8]). Nordic governments also worry it might stifle innovation and, similar to Germany, fear escalation of trade war with the US. With the backing of the finance ministers of the EU's most influential members, France and Germany, it seems likely that a compromise on new tech tax will be reached by the end of the year \u2014 despite concerns of some member states. It'll be interesting to see how US tech giants react, as people like Tim Cook have been quite vocal[9] when it comes to stricter EU regulations.

But legal experts warn that restaurant operators should begin preparing now for what will likely be an onerous challenge to maintain compliance.<br/><br/>Many restaurant operators may believe data privacy is something only big tech companies like Facebook or Google have to worry about. In fact, the law applies to most restaurants doing business in California that collect the most basic information about guests: names, phone numbers and email or IP addresses, for example.<br/><br/>Noncompliance could leave restaurant companies vulnerable to costly liability with civil penalties up to $7,500 per violation.<br/><br/>The CCPA was adopted quickly by the state legislature, which was rushing to beat a deadline that could have put an even stricter proposal up for a ballot vote in November.<br/><br/>Dodging that bullet, state lawmakers now are likely to tinker with the CCPA before it goes into effect. But attorneys warn that the intent of the law \u2014 which fundamentally is to give consumers more control over how their personal information is collected, used and shared \u2014 is not likely to change.<br/><br/>\u201cThe ballot initiative was withdrawn, but that is still looming. If they try to water this down too much, that could be put it back on the ballot and a ballot initiative is a lot more difficult to change than legislation,\" said Danielle Urban, a partner with law firm Fisher Phillips in Denver.<br/><br/>Here\u2019s a look at the CCPA basics:<br/><br/>To what does it apply?<br/><br/>The CCPA applies to all \u201cpersonal information\" collected, either online or offline, by nearly any type of commercial enterprise, said attorney Helen Foster, a technology, privacy and security specialist at law firm Davis Wright Tremaine in Washington, D.C.<br/><br/>This could include just about any information that could be linked to a consumer or household \u2014 though the definition of \u201chousehold\" is likely to be a term that will require clarification, she added.<br/><br/>For restaurants, however, the CCPA would cover the type of data now routinely collected, whether in stores, online, through mobile apps or by third parties, such as delivery providers or online reservation sites.<br/><br/>Many restaurant and tech partners feel they may own that data, said Kinesh Patel, co-founder and chief technology officer of guest management firm SevenRooms.<br/><br/>\u201cBut this is a change in the way we think about that,\" he said. \u201cIt creates civil rights for data.\"<br/><br/>To whom does it apply?<br/><br/>The law applies to any company that does business in California \u2014 even a single franchised unit that might be part of a larger chain operating primarily outside the state.<br/><br/>It applies to companies that meet any of the following criteria:<br/><br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Companies with a gross revenue of more than $25 million</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Companies that receive or share information from more than 50,000 consumers, households or devices</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Companies that earn more than half of annual revenue from the sale of personal information</p></bodyText></listItem></list>Foster warns that even relatively small restaurants could be subject to the CCPA, especially if they use a website for reservations or a mobile app to interact with customers. Over the course of a year, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to surpass the 50,000-device threshold pretty quickly, she said.<br/><br/>What do restaurant companies have to do?<br/><br/>Conduct an audit.<br/><br/>Restaurant companies need to be able to identify and retrieve all the personal information related to consumers across business units or third-party partners, and be able to promptly disclose that information to any individual guest that may request it.<br/><br/>That means a good first step is probably an audit of the personal information collected from customers, including how it was obtained, how it is used and shared, said Urban.<br/><br/>\u201cI think it behooves every company to take a careful look at what they\u2019re keeping in all the departments,\" she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an excuse to say, \u2018I didn\u2019t know Joe in this department had access to this information and I\u2019m not sure why he ever had access.\u2019\"<br/><br/>Update data use-disclosures at least once a year.<br/><br/>Many companies use such disclosures already, even though people probably rarely read them. Under the CCPA, those disclosures must include more detail about how companies collect and use personal information, and deviation from that practice could open a restaurant operator up to liability, Foster said.<br/><br/>Take a hard look at your security compliance and update your data incident response protocols.<br/><br/>\u201cThis is the real kicker,\" said Foster. The CCPA effectively supplements the California Data Breach Notification Law and gives consumers private right of action. That means consumers could have the right to sue a business if there is a breach of data and that business does not maintain \u201creasonable\" security procedures.<br/><br/>The standard for \u201creasonable security,\" however, is not defined, Foster noted. But the California attorney general has previously cited the 20 controls in the Center for Internet Security\u2019s Critical Security Controls as a minimum standard.<br/><br/>Urban added that restaurant companies should make sure their cyber security insurance policies cover the terms of the CCPA.<br/><br/>\u201cDoes it cover, for example, your liability under the CCPA?\" she said. \u201cNot only do people need better coverage, but the truth is policies vary so much, and, in most cases, people find out at the time they need it, \u2018Oh wow, it doesn\u2019t cover what I thought it did.\u2019\"<br/><br/>If asked, restaurant companies will have to promptly provide consumers access to all of his or her personal information, including how it was collected, the purpose and to what entities it was sold or disclosed for business purposes.<br/><br/>Restaurant operators must first verify the identity of the person making the request.

Described by some attorneys as the nation\u2019s most extensive consumer privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, is modeled after the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, that established data privacy mandates for companies doing business in Europe. The CCPA doesn\u2019t go into effect until June 1, 2020. But legal experts warn that restaurant operators should begin preparing now for what will likely be an onerous challenge to maintain compliance. Many restaurant operators may believe data privacy is something only big tech companies like Facebook or Google have to worry about. In fact, the law applies to most restaurants doing business in California that collect the most basic information about guests: names, phone numbers and email or IP addresses, for example. Noncompliance could leave restaurant companies vulnerable to costly liability with civil penalties up to $7,500 per violation. The CCPA was adopted quickly by the state legislature, which was rushing to beat a deadline that could have put an even stricter proposal up for a ballot vote in November. Dodging that bullet, state lawmakers now are likely to tinker with the CCPA before it goes into effect. But attorneys warn that the intent of the law \u2014 which fundamentally is to give consumers more control over how their personal information is collected, used and shared \u2014 is not likely to change. \u201cThe ballot initiative was withdrawn, but that is still looming. If they try to water this down too much, that could be put it back on the ballot and a ballot initiative is a lot more difficult to change than legislation,&#34; said Danielle Urban, a partner with law firm Fisher Phillips in Denver. Here\u2019s a look at the CCPA basics: To what does it apply? The CCPA applies to all \u201cpersonal information&#34; collected, either online or offline, by nearly any type of commercial enterprise, said attorney Helen Foster, a technology, privacy and security specialist at law firm Davis Wright Tremaine in Washington, D.C. This could include just about any information that could be linked to a consumer or household \u2014 though the definition of \u201chousehold&#34; is likely to be a term that will require clarification, she added. For restaurants, however, the CCPA would cover the type of data now routinely collected, whether in stores, online, through mobile apps or by third parties, such as delivery providers or online reservation sites. Many restaurant and tech partners feel they may own that data, said Kinesh Patel, co-founder and chief technology officer of guest management firm SevenRooms. \u201cBut this is a change in the way we think about that,&#34; he said. \u201cIt creates civil rights for data.&#34; To whom does it apply? The law applies to any company that does business in California \u2014 even a single franchised unit that might be part of a larger chain operating primarily outside the state. It applies to companies that meet any of the following criteria: Companies with a gross revenue of more than $25 million Companies that receive or share information from more than 50,000 consumers, households or devices Companies that earn more than half of annual revenue from the sale of personal information Foster warns that even relatively small restaurants could be subject to the CCPA, especially if they use a website for reservations or a mobile app to interact with customers. Over the course of a year, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to surpass the 50,000-device threshold pretty quickly, she said. What do restaurant companies have to do? Conduct an audit. Restaurant companies need to be able to identify and retrieve all the personal information related to consumers across business units or third-party partners, and be able to promptly disclose that information to any individual guest that may request it. That means a good first step is probably an audit of the personal information collected from customers, including how it was obtained, how it is used and shared, said Urban. \u201cI think it behooves every company to take a careful look at what they\u2019re keeping in all the departments,&#34; she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an excuse to say, \u2018I didn\u2019t know Joe in this department had access to this information and I\u2019m not sure why he ever had access.\u2019&#34; Update data use-disclosures at least once a year. Many companies use such disclosures already, even though people probably rarely read them. Under the CCPA, those disclosures must include more detail about how companies collect and use personal information, and deviation from that practice could open a restaurant operator up to liability, Foster said. Take a hard look at your security compliance and update your data incident response protocols. \u201cThis is the real kicker,&#34; said Foster. The CCPA effectively supplements the California Data Breach Notification Law and gives consumers private right of action. That means consumers could have the right to sue a business if there is a breach of data and that business does not maintain \u201creasonable&#34; security procedures. The standard for \u201creasonable security,&#34; however, is not defined, Foster noted. But the California attorney general has previously cited the 20 controls in the Center for Internet Security\u2019s Critical Security Controls as a minimum standard. Urban added that restaurant companies should make sure their cyber security insurance policies cover the terms of the CCPA. \u201cDoes it cover, for example, your liability under the CCPA?&#34; she said. \u201cNot only do people need better coverage, but the truth is policies vary so much, and, in most cases, people find out at the time they need it, \u2018Oh wow, it doesn\u2019t cover what I thought it did.\u2019&#34; If asked, restaurant companies will have to promptly provide consumers access to all of his or her personal information, including how it was collected, the purpose and to what entities it was sold or disclosed for business purposes. Restaurant operators must first verify the identity of the person making the request. The information must be provided in a readily useable format, and accuracy is key, Foster said. Give consumers an opt-out/opt-in option. That means they can opt-out of the \u201csale&#34; of their personal information to a third party, or across business units or product/service lines. Service providers must also honor those requests, unless they are prohibited by contract from using the personal information for their own purposes. \u201cThe CCPA doesn\u2019t require contracts, but it\u2019s a good idea to put those in place specifying how [third parties] are going to respond to those requests and what they\u2019re going to do with your customer data,&#34; said Urban. Consumers under age 16 must also give opt-in consent. Those between the ages of 13 and 16 can opt-in for themselves. Those under age 13 must have a parent or guardian\u2019s authorization. Allow consumers to request that their data be deleted. Foster recommends that restaurants update their homepage and all online and offline privacy policies to inform consumers that their personal information could be sold to third parties and that they have the right to opt-out. Use a web link on the homepage titled: \u201cDo not sell my personal information.&#34; Restaurant companies must also be careful not to discriminate against guests that opt out. That means restaurants may not be able to reverse discounts offered to those who join a loyalty program, for example, but then ask for their data to be deleted. How will this be enforced? In the event of a data breach, consumers may recover \u201cnot less than $100 and up to $750 per violation&#34; in private actions, said Foster. But businesses will have a 30-day period to cure any deficiencies \u2014 though she noted that it\u2019s hard to imagine a scenario where a breach could be cured after it happens. In such cases, the attorney general could also take action. Civil penalties could be up between $2,500 and $7,500 per violation. California may be ahead of the game on data privacy, but Foster warned that other states are likely to follow suit. Patel at SevenRooms, meanwhile, sees the new law as an opportunity. Large restaurant tech companies like his have already spent a lot of time readying for compliance with the GDPR and they are ready to help restaurant companies meet the demands of greater consumer data protection, he said. \u201cI think the GDPR was so sweeping globally, that the cat\u2019s out of the bag. There\u2019s no going back,&#34; he said. \u201cIt\u2019s coming, no matter what.&#34; Contact Lisa Jennings at lisa.jennings@knect365.com Follow her on Twitter: @livetodineout\">lisa.jennings@knect365.com</url><br/><br/>Follow her on Twitter: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/livetodineout\">@livetodineout</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RESHOS-401792</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RESHOS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T7T-0CF1-JBKS-P05J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">337438</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1439\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Penton Business Media, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Restaurant Hospitality (Penton)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 8, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Let\u2019s use one of the header specs in the CMS for those, and a simple bold type for the sub sections, so the hierarchy is clear.] HED: Get ready: Consumer privacy mandates are coming DEK: A new California law will force restaurants to keep tabs on personal information or face liability By Lisa Jennings Restaurant operators must make changes to the way they collect, use and protect data about their guests in light of a sweeping new consumer privacy protection law adopted by California lawmakers in June. Described by some attorneys as the nation\u2019s most extensive consumer privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, is modeled after the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, that established data privacy mandates for companies doing business in Europe. The CCPA doesn\u2019t go into effect until June 1, 2020. But legal experts warn that restaurant operators should begin preparing now for what will likely be an onerous challenge to maintain compliance. Many restaurant operators may believe data privacy is something only big tech companies like Facebook or Google have to worry about. In fact, the law applies to most restaurants doing business in California that collect the most basic information about guests: names, phone numbers and email or IP addresses, for example. Noncompliance could leave restaurant companies vulnerable to costly liability with civil penalties up to $7,500 per violation. The CCPA was adopted quickly by the state legislature, which was rushing to beat a deadline that could have put an even stricter proposal up for a ballot vote in November. Dodging that bullet, state lawmakers now are likely to tinker with the CCPA before it goes into effect. But attorneys warn that the intent of the law \u2014 which fundamentally is to give consumers more control over how their personal information is collected, used and shared \u2014 is not likely to change. \u201cThe ballot initiative was withdrawn, but that is still looming. If they try to water this down too much, that could be put it back on the ballot and a ballot initiative is a lot more difficult to change than legislation,&#34; said Danielle Urban, a partner with law firm Fisher Phillips in Denver. Here\u2019s a look at the CCPA basics: To what does it apply? The CCPA applies to all \u201cpersonal information&#34; collected, either online or offline, by nearly any type of commercial enterprise, said attorney Helen Foster, a technology, privacy and security specialist at law firm Davis Wright Tremaine in Washington, D.C. This could include just about any information that could be linked to a consumer or household \u2014 though the definition of \u201chousehold&#34; is likely to be a term that will require clarification, she added. For restaurants, however, the CCPA would cover the type of data now routinely collected, whether in stores, online, through mobile apps or by third parties, such as delivery providers or online reservation sites. Many restaurant and tech partners feel they may own that data, said Kinesh Patel, co-founder and chief technology officer of guest management firm SevenRooms. \u201cBut this is a change in the way we think about that,&#34; he said. \u201cIt creates civil rights for data.&#34; To whom does it apply? The law applies to any company that does business in California \u2014 even a single franchised unit that might be part of a larger chain operating primarily outside the state. It applies to companies that meet any of the following criteria: Companies with a gross revenue of more than $25 million Companies that receive or share information from more than 50,000 consumers, households or devices Companies that earn more than half of annual revenue from the sale of personal information Foster warns that even relatively small restaurants could be subject to the CCPA, especially if they use a website for reservations or a mobile app to interact with customers. Over the course of a year, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to surpass the 50,000-device threshold pretty quickly, she said. What do restaurant companies have to do? Conduct an audit. Restaurant companies need to be able to identify and retrieve all the personal information related to consumers across business units or third-party partners, and be able to promptly disclose that information to any individual guest that may request it. That means a good first step is probably an audit of the personal information collected from customers, including how it was obtained, how it is used and shared, said Urban. \u201cI think it behooves every company to take a careful look at what they\u2019re keeping in all the departments,&#34; she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an excuse to say, \u2018I didn\u2019t know Joe in this department had access to this information and I\u2019m not sure why he ever had access.\u2019&#34; Update data use-disclosures at least once a year. Many companies use such disclosures already, even though people probably rarely read them. Under the CCPA, those disclosures must include more detail about how companies collect and use personal information, and deviation from that practice could open a restaurant operator up to liability, Foster said. Take a hard look at your security compliance and update your data incident response protocols. \u201cThis is the real kicker,&#34; said Foster. The CCPA effectively supplements the California Data Breach Notification Law and gives consumers private right of action. That means consumers could have the right to sue a business if there is a breach of data and that business does not maintain \u201creasonable&#34; security procedures. The standard for \u201creasonable security,&#34; however, is not defined, Foster noted. But the California attorney general has previously cited the 20 controls in the Center for Internet Security\u2019s Critical Security Controls as a minimum standard. Urban added that restaurant companies should make sure their cyber security insurance policies cover the terms of the CCPA. \u201cDoes it cover, for example, your liability under the CCPA?&#34; she said. \u201cNot only do people need better coverage, but the truth is policies vary so much, and, in most cases, people find out at the time they need it, \u2018Oh wow, it doesn\u2019t cover what I thought it did.\u2019&#34; If asked, restaurant companies will have to promptly provide consumers access to all of his or her personal information, including how it was collected, the purpose and to what entities it was sold or disclosed for business purposes. Restaurant operators must first verify the identity of the person making the request. The information must be provided in a readily useable format, and accuracy is key, Foster said. Give consumers an opt-out/opt-in option. That means they can opt-out of the \u201csale&#34; of their personal information to a third party, or across business units or product/service lines. Service providers must also honor those requests, unless they are prohibited by contract from using the personal information for their own purposes. \u201cThe CCPA doesn\u2019t require contracts, but it\u2019s a good idea to put those in place specifying how [third parties] are going to respond to those requests and what they\u2019re going to do with your customer data,&#34; said Urban. Consumers under age 16 must also give opt-in consent. Those between the ages of 13 and 16 can opt-in for themselves. Those under age 13 must have a parent or guardian\u2019s authorization. Allow consumers to request that their data be deleted. Foster recommends that restaurants update their homepage and all online and offline privacy policies to inform consumers that their personal information could be sold to third parties and that they have the right to opt-out. Use a web link on the homepage titled: \u201cDo not sell my personal information.&#34; Restaurant companies must also be careful not to discriminate against guests that opt out. That means restaurants may not be able to reverse discounts offered to those who join a loyalty program, for example, but then ask for their data to be deleted. How will this be enforced? In the event of a data breach, consumers may recover \u201cnot less than $100 and up to $750 per violation&#34; in private actions, said Foster. But businesses will have a 30-day period to cure any deficiencies \u2014 though she noted that it\u2019s hard to imagine a scenario where a breach could be cured after it happens. In such cases, the attorney general could also take action. Civil penalties could be up between $2,500 and $7,500 per violation. California may be ahead of the game on data privacy, but Foster warned that other states are likely to follow suit. Patel at SevenRooms, meanwhile, sees the new law as an opportunity. Large restaurant tech companies like his have already spent a lot of time readying for compliance with the GDPR and they are ready to help restaurant companies meet the demands of greater consumer data protection, he said. \u201cI think the GDPR was so sweeping globally, that the cat\u2019s out of the bag. There\u2019s no going back,&#34; he said. \u201cIt\u2019s coming, no matter what.&#34; Contact Lisa Jennings at lisa.jennings@knect365.com Follow her on Twitter: @livetodineout\">lisa.jennings@knect365.com</url><br/><br/>Follow her on Twitter: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/livetodineout\">@livetodineout</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NRNWS-401801</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NRNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T7T-0CF1-JBKS-P05K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459069</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1439\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Penton Business Media, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Nation's Restaurant News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 8, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

If the scrutiny leads to action, it could put the shining share prices of some of those companies - and heady returns for investors - at risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's a look at the different situations the big four tech stocks are facing.</p><p>Alphabet</p><p>Google parent company Alphabet found itself in the European Union's crosshairs this year, slapped by regulators with a $3.4 billion fine over accusations the search engine operator was tilting results in favour of its shopping service.</p><p>Barclays Capital said in a note earlier this month that \"increased regulatory scrutiny\" was one of the issues weighing on the stock, which is still up nearly 25 per cent on the year, closing Tuesday at US$988.49.</p><p>But Alphabet isn't straying away from the shopping space, and recently struck up a partnership with Walmart to deliver voice shopping and personalized results for customers.</p><p>\"The company does not view its recent partnership with Walmart as an 'anti-Amazon' alliance, but sees a large opportunity to work together to drive value for consumers,\" BMO Capital Markets said in September. \"From Google's perspective, we believe this could potentially help drive increased adoption of Google Home devices, particularly among Walmart shoppers.\"</p><p>Microsoft</p><p>Microsoftis also no stranger to EU-style justice, having been fined by the bloc's regulators in 2004 over complaints of anti-competitive conduct.</p><p>Now, however, Microsoftappears to be the one successfully putting pressure on governments to change, as the software leader launched a lawsuit last year in connection with allegedly routine U.S. government orders that kept demands for user emails and other records a secret.</p><p>Microsoftsaid Monday( <url normalizedValue=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/?p=55096\">https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/?p=55096</url> ) it would move to drop that lawsuit after the Department of Justice put forward a new policy. Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith said in a blog post that the new guideline \"limits the overused practice of requiring providers to stay silent when the government accesses personal data stored in the cloud.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, shares of Microsofthave gained nearly 27 per cent on the year, closing Tuesday at US$78.86.</p><p>Morgan Stanley predicted last week that the company's coming results should bolster returns further.</p><p>\"Increasing traction in hybrid cloud, machine learning and integrated LinkedIn opportunities raise the probability of MSFT executing to our $111 bull case, keeping us (overweight),\" the firm said. \"As investors garner higher confidence in this sustained double-digit EPS growth and the conservatism in FY18 expectations, the stock should continue grinding higher.\"</p><p>Amazon</p><p>The Seattle-based e-commerce company is certainly trying to live up to its reputation as the \"everything\" store.</p><p>Amazon is even reportedly getting into the activewear game, putting pressure on the likes of Canadian-based Lululemon Athletica Inc.</p><p>\"As for timing, we suspect AMZN will start slow to gauge and test consumer appetite before scaling the business rapidly,\" Canaccord Genuity said in a note last week. \"That said, we know from discussions with our industry contacts that AMZN is highly focused and determined to become the #1 online shopping destination (for) fashion customers and this push into athletic apparel is evidence of that directive.\"</p><p>But, along with other tech companies, Amazon has been spending millions of dollars on lobbying the U.S. Congress. Recently released disclosures showed the company was targeting issues regarding \"competition, and the Whole Foods Market acquisition.\"</p><p>Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods was a move that put the online retailer in direct competition with traditional grocers and won U.S. antitrust approval, despite founder Jeff Bezos' ownership of The Washington Post newspaper, a target of President Donald Trump's distaste at times.</p><p>\"Retail profitability is likely to continue to suffer near term from heavy investments in both core AMZN and Whole Foods, but most investors understand that margin is available when AMZN decides to capture more,\" Barclays said in a note. \"Revenue growth is what matters most at this stage of development, hence we don't see a ton of downside.\"</p><p>Shares of Amazon are up more than 30 per cent for the year, closing Tuesday at US$975.90.</p><p>Twitter</p><p>Twitter has a special place in the pantheon of tech stocks, as the platform is seemingly Trump's go-to spot for slinging insults and pronouncements. Twitter executives, along with their counterparts from Facebook Inc. and Google, have also reportedly been asked to testify before the U.S. Congress, which is probing alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.</p><p>Twitter, however, faces its own internal challenges as well, with the company reporting no movement in its monthly active users for from the first to second quarter of 2017. Twitter's stock price is up around 5.8 per cent for the year, but down more than 58 per cent since it started trading nearly four years ago, closing Tuesday at US$17.25.</p><p>Barclays said earlier this month that it expects Twitter to report an additional three million or so monthly active users this quarter, as the company \"continues to make progress on the product side, with algorithmic ranking and the new Twitter Lite app driving most of the user growth.\"</p><p>\"Stepping back from the print, we have been cautious on TWTR in 2017, and are waiting to see if ad revenue growth and user growth can move up together, likely in 2018,\" Barclays added.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:gzochodne@postmedia.com\">gzochodne@postmedia.com</email>( <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:gzochodne@postmedia.com\">gzochodne@postmedia.com</email> )Twitter: @geoffzochodne( <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/geoffzochodne\">http://twitter.com/geoffzochodne</url> ) !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2017 Postmedia Network Inc.

One question I always put is: 'Are you going to impose a large fine on a big tech firm?' Usually, she demurs, emphasising corrective measures instead or the exhaustive process that must be undergone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week, there was a change of tone. Corrective measures and correct procedure are still crucial, she said. But fines are \"inevitable\" too.</p><p>\"Under the GDPR, deterrence is a particularly important reason why the fines are included,\" she told me. \"They could have stopped at the corrective measures. But the fines are there to be punitive and give rise to deterrence.\"</p><p>How punitive? Like the $5bn ((EURO)4.6bn) that the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) slapped Facebook with last year? \"If you ask whether the FTC fine is relevant [in calculating a fine], it is,\" she said. \"A very relevant factor in terms of what quantum will create deterrence is the level of fines already existing globally in the area.\"</p><p>It may be time for Facebook to fasten its seatbelts.</p><p>To be clear, Dixon is not saying which company a fine might apply to. Nor that it is imminent (except to say that major decisions will land this year).</p><p>But of the 21 major GDPR investigations her office is conducting into big tech firms, more than half involve Facebook.</p><p>And the DPC is currently arming itself specifically for the mechanism of fines. It has been procuring 'legal external advice' on how much its fines should be by reference to other jurisdictional fines (like Facebook's $5bn US penalty).</p><p>It all looks like it adds up to one conclusion.</p><p>To many, it may seem a long time coming. European privacy regulators and pundits have been sniping at the Irish DPC for a while, wondering why it's taking so long for Dixon to come to a resolution in the big tech investigations.</p><p>The insinuation is frequently made that Ireland is slow in its process because of its economic dependence on big tech companies.</p><p>Germany's federal data protection commissioner, Ulrich Kelber, has been explicit in this regard, even suggesting that Ireland's regulatory approach was similar to the 'go-slow' manner adopted by his own country's car regulator in relation to the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal.</p><p>Dixon categorically denies this. In our interview, she challenged critics to scrutinise the number of other European GDPR investigations and results to date, specifically cross-border investigations. There are very few. Fines have been \"minor\", she added.</p><p>Dixon's analysis isn't an isolated one. Several tech, legal and privacy advocates I've spoken to about this in recent months are wary of fast fines.</p><p>Without every 't' crossed and 'i' dotted, without every email query adequately answered, without every market analysis survey returned, fines are destined to be appealed.</p><p>And once that happens, lawyers take over. What do lawyers do? Drag things on for years. What happens as those things are being dragged out? Precedents are delayed; the regulator's authority looks more watery.</p><p>That is not to say that Facebook, or whatever company is \"inevitably\" fined here, won't appeal.</p><p>But it might mean that the appeal will be shorter and less likely to succeed.</p><p>The privacy boss of one of the world's biggest tech companies recently talked me through how the biggest businesses approach this.</p><p>\"The more thorough their [regulators'] engagement with us is on it, the less room we have to challenge the decision,\" he said. \"And the less we'll want to.\"</p><p>My understanding is that some of the big firms are now privately expecting fines. One executive even told me that they'd be welcome in clarifying market rules.</p><p>Aside from the satisfaction some might take from seeing big tech firms get clobbered for hundreds of millions (or billions), will fines actually work? When the FTC announced its $5bn fine on Facebook last year, most of the reaction focused on its relatively modest impact on the tech giant, a company that makes $5bn in profit every couple of months.</p><p>This side of the Atlantic, there were also questions about the effectiveness of the FTC sanction.</p><p>What good is a fine if the company isn't forced to change its own rules as part of the settlement? This is a question the Irish DPC has tried to focus minds on before. GDPR seeks to bring companies into compliance to protect people's privacy as a first core aim.</p><p>Financial punishment may be necessary as a deterrent, but has always been considered a secondary function, or corollary, of rights enforcement - not the main aim.</p><p>The problem is that fines focus attention in a way that little else does.</p><p>A big fine, or even the threat of one, gets worldwide notice.

The move came just a few days after privacy commissioners in Ottawa and British Columbia concluded a lengthy investigation into a Canadian company implicated in the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal.</p><p>The probe found that B.C.-based AggregateIQ had broken privacy laws in its handling of a massive trove of Facebook data that was used for political messaging purposes without proper consent, but that the regulators had no power to levy fines against the firm.</p><p>Rempel called the lack of fines a failure of government and said returning minister Navdeep Bains - whose Liberal government released a Digital Charter in the run-up to the federal election laying out a series of broad intentions such as \"A level playing field\" and \"Strong Enforcement and Real Accountability\" - has failed to enact meaningful regulation.</p><p>\"We're beyond that. I mean, you have to look at Google in the same way we'd look at a company like Monsanto or DuPont in terms of regulating their operations to make sure that the environment is safe while jobs are created. Just the context is different,\" Rempel said.</p><p>\"The AggregateIQ outcome is a perfect example of this failure. Because if the Digital Charter actually worked, or had any sort of teeth to it, you and I wouldn't be having this conversation.\"</p><p>Postmedia made multiple interview requests to Bains'office in the wake of the AggregateIQ report, but the minister was not made available.</p><p>\"Our competitiveness depends on our ability to use digital innovation to harness the power of data, but not at the expense of Canadians'trust,\" spokeswoman Dani Keenan said in a statement sent on Bains' behalf. \"That's why, earlier this year, Minister Bains unveiled Canada's Digital Charter, which outlines 10 key principles for continued Canadian leadership in the digital and data driven economy.\"</p><p>Around the world, the gold-standard for data and privacy regulation has been GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), the European regulatory behemoth that caused a lot of excitement in 2018. However, since coming into force the law has faced heavy criticism for being too cumbersome and difficult to enforce.</p><p>In the United States, much of the conversation has focused on antitrust, and the possibility of breaking up the biggest tech companies.</p><p>Rempel said she doesn't favour either of those approaches.</p><p>She wouldn't get into the specific policy proposals the Conservatives plan on putting forward, but she said that the minority Parliament gives a chance for opposition parties to drive the agenda.</p><p>In particular, she said that using legislative committees to compel documents and civil servant testimony, along with potentially disrupting the budget process, could force the Liberals to act.</p><p>\"I have some plans for our parliamentary committee. I'll be reaching out to my opposition critics, from other political parties. And I think that, regardless of political stripe, we should be able to get some consensus on this,\" Rempel said. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Osprey Media Group Inc.
