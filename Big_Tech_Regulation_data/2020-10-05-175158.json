And this week, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>goes to New York to join other world leaders there for the first time.  With plenty of hot spots to discuss, what will the president focus on and what action will he seek?  </p><p>Joining us live here in Washington, the president's national security advisor, <person><nameText>General H.R. McMaster.  </nameText></person></p><p>General, welcome back to FOX NEWSSUNDAY. </p><p>MCMASTER:  Thanks, Chris, great to be here.  </p><p>WALLACE:  As we say, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>speaks to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, his first time on that stage.  How important does he think the speech is and how will he fit it into his appeal to world leaders into his doctrine of America First?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, he thinks the speech is a tremendous opportunity obviously to reach so many world leaders at the same time and to emphasize really three things.  First is to protect the American people, the second is to promote American prosperity, and the third is really to help promote accountability and sovereignty.  And in those three things will allow him to communicate his vision for America's role in the world, but also what his expectations are for international bodies like the United Nations, but also of other nations -- the expectation that they are up to protect the sovereignty of their citizens and respect the sovereignty of other nations.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, let's unpack that and let's start with issue number one.  And that, of course, is North Korea.  The president tweeted about that this morning.  Let's put it up on the screen.  </p><p>The president said: I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night, asked him -- excuse me -- asked him how Rocket Man is doing.  Long gas lines forming in North Korea.  Too bad.</p><p>Well, before I get to the substance, Rocket Man, have you heard that from the president before or is that a new one?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, that's a new one and I think maybe for the president, but it reminds me of a cover of the \"Economist\" a few years ago, portraying him as Rocket Man.  But, of course, that's where the rockets are coming from.  Rockets, though, we ought to probably not laugh too much about because they do represent a great threat to all -- to everyone.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  But let me --  </p><p>MCMASTER:  As Secretary Tillerson said at the outset, it is a global problem.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's pick up on that, here's what you had to say on Friday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCMASTER:  We've been kicking the can down the road and we're out of road.  And so, for those who have said, and have been commenting about the lack of a military option, there is a military option.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  General, what does that mean, out of road?  The fact is you want to get sanctions more time.  You're not about to go to war.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, really, it really depends on how we see this threat continue to manifest itself and our judgment about how much time we have.  We're out of road because in the past, the approach taken to the problem of North Korea and the Kim regime over decades has been to enter into long, drawn out negotiations that then deliver an unsatisfactory agreement, an agreement that then the North Korean regime breaks.  </p><p>And what that agreement does, though, that's particularly dangerous oftentimes, what has all the time in the past is locked in the status quo as the new normal.  And this regime is so close now to threatening the United States and others with a nuclear weapon that we really have to move with a great deal of urgency on sanctions, on diplomacy, and on preparing, if necessary, a military option.  </p><p>WALLACE:  So, how do you draw that line?  How do you decide we've reached the point that we have to move to a military option now?  How long do you get sanctions?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, the president has asked all of us to work on this.  So, we can't really talk about specific timelines or what conclusions we are coming to.  </p><p>But we are working very hard, very hard to make everything we are doing militarily, diplomatic -- diplomatically, economically, and with our allies and partners to be as effective as we can.  And what we recognize is not really much time.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  The administration -- I want to pick up on one part of that.  The administration talks about getting tough with North Korea's trading partners.  </p><p>Here's Treasury Secretary Mnuchin this week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We will use economic sanctions to bring North Korea to the table.  </p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWSHOST:  You're saying stopping trade with China?  </p><p>MNUCHIN:  Stopping trade with anybody.  Nobody would be off the table.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  But the U.S. did $648 billion of trade with China.  They're our single largest supplier for imported goods and our third largest market for export of goods.  </p><p>General, we're not about to cut off trade with China.  It would crater our economy.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, this is an indication, isn't it, of how serious this problem is with North Korea, and why it's in all of our interest to work together to resolve it.  So, of course, we China to help as much as they can.  You know, they have a great deal of coercive economic power over North Korea.  And, certainly, we think -- and the Chinese agree -- it's in their interest to have a denuclearized peninsula.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But, I mean, let's be serious here.  We're not going to cut off all trade with China.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, they have to take some steps, though, that restrict trade in any way that we can with this regime, to choke off the resources that allowed this regime to continue to prioritize their military efforts, their missile efforts, their nuclear efforts over the well-being of their own people.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, let me just pick up on that, that one point, isn't it possible -- in fact, isn't it likely -- that Kim has decided that the key to his survival is to have a nuclear capability?  He talked this week about having equilibrium with the U.S. and that there's nothing that can be done diplomatically, nothing that can be done economically that will stop him from pursuing that effort.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, what he should conclude is the exactly opposite, that that continued pursuit of this nuclear capability makes him more and more vulnerable and makes him less and less secure.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's turn to another subject.  The president is also going to talk about getting tougher on Iran at the United Nations.  But this week, he had the opportunity to re-impose sanctions that were lifted as part of the nuclear deal.  He didn't do that.</p><p>So, for all his talk about tearing up the agreement.  I know he has to recertify in October whether or not they are complying with it, all this talk about tearing up the agreement, in fact, isn't he going to live with it and try to find other ways to confront Iran on other fronts?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, we have to see what live with it means, right?  Live with can't be giving this regime cover to develop a nuclear capability.  And so, a lot of things have to happen immediately, rigorous enforcement of that agreement.  It is under-enforced now.  We know Iran has already violated parts of the agreement by -- </p><p>WALLACE:  But the IAEA says that they're complying with it, sir.</p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, the IAEA has identified and we've identified some of these breaches that Iran has then corrected.  But what does that tell you about Iranian behavior?  They're not just walking up to the line on the agreement.  They're crossing the line at times.  </p><p>So, there has to be much more rigorous enforcement of the deal and we have to recognize the fundamental flaws in this deal.  It is -- as the president said -- it is the worst deal.  It gave all these benefits to the Iranian regime upfront and these benefits now they are using to foment this humanitarian catastrophe in the greater Middle East.  </p><p>This broad range of destructive behavior, including support for terrorist organizations, like Hezbollah, support for proxy forces like 80 percent of the affected fighters fighting on the side of the brutal, murderous Assad regime in Syria are Iranian proxies.  </p><p>And so, we have to -- we have to recognize the broad range of Iranian destabilizing behavior and we can't allow this deal to enable that.  Their missile programs, for example, the way they are seeding this Iranian network with more and more destructive capability that places all their neighbors at risk.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I want to turn to that next subject which you brought up which is terror.  The president is going to call at the U.N. for the world to continue its war on terror.  Here's what he had to say this week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have done better in eight months of my presidency than the previous eight years against ISIS.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  But, I don't have to tell you, a bomb went off in the London subway this week.  That's the fifth terror attack in Great Britain just this year.  And experts say, as we succeed, and we are succeeding, in pushing Iraq -- ISIS back in Iraq, shrinking its territory, it is only getting them to focus more on launching attacks in Europe and the U.S.</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, the president has told us we have to do three fundamental things very effectively.  </p><p>The first is to ensure that these terrorists have no safe havens and support bases that allow them to organize, plan, and conduct attacks against us and against our allies.  </p><p>The second thing is we have to cut off the financing, the way that they resource these kinds of operations.  </p><p>And the third, we have to defeat their evil ideology.  And this has a lot to do with some of Prime Minister May's top priorities, which is to constrict their ability to use the ability to communicate with each other.  </p><p>And then, of course, none of this is a substitute for important law enforcement actions across the world and improving even further our ability to share information and to gain visibility of these terrorist networks and defeat them.  </p><p>WALLACE:  There is a report this weekend, I'm sure you read, that says that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has decided he's not going to pull out of the Paris climate accord, that we may reduce our commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions but he's going to live with the agreement, stay in the agreement with a reduced commitment.</p><p>Is that true, sir?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  No, it's false.  That's a false report.  The president decided to pull out of the Paris Accord because it was a bad deal for the American people and because it was a bad deal for the environment.  It gave the worst polluters the ability to continue polluting and emitting carbon without significantly reducing those levels.  </p><p>The president is committed to the cleanest water on Earth, the cleanest air on Earth, to an energy policy that reduces carbon emissions but then also provides clean fossil fuels to generate growth in this country and globally.  And these priorities he felt we could not pursue effectively within this flawed agreement.  </p><p>WALLACE:  So, he's out of the Paris Climate Accord?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  He's out of the Paris Climate Accord.  What he said, the door is open.  If you look at what he said on the day that he announced withdrawing from the accord, he said, at some point in the future, if there can be, if there can be a ideal that addresses these some fundamental flaws -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  But the allies said they're not going to renegotiate.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, the president's ears are open, though, if at some point they decide that they can come forward with an agreement that addresses the president's very legitimate concerns about Paris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  OK.  One final area.  It's widely known in Washington that you and Steve Bannon have sharply different views of the world.  One of the first things you did as national security advisor is kick him out as a regular official member of the NSC.  </p><p>He has dismissed you and some of the other advisors on the NSC as globalists.  He has sharply disagreed with the decision to commit, to double down in Afghanistan.  </p><p>Question: is the administration better off with Steve Bannon out of the White House?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, the administration is better off when we can serve the president by integrating, coordinating across all of our departments and agencies with our key allies and partners and to present the president with multiple options.  And then, based on his decisions, to help the president implement these policies that prioritize, protecting and advancing the interests of the American people.  </p><p>And so, what's important is to have an inclusive process, not to try to manipulate into a particular decision or to advance your own agenda.  You know, we're advancing the president's agenda and we are advancing policies and strategies that are for the American people.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, you strike is a pretty straight talker.  Are you saying that Steve Bannon was manipulating, that he was trying to work around and advance his own agenda?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Well, the National Security Council, I think, has served the president well in bringing him multiple options.  There were some who try to operate outside of that process for their own narrow agendas, and that didn't serve the president well.  </p><p>WALLACE:  That some people, does that include Steve Bannon, sir?  </p><p>MCMASTER:  I think this has been too hyped on one individual.  I mean, these reports of feuding, this really didn't even happen.  I mean, we had our doors open to all perspectives within the National Security Council, and it was up to those individuals whether they would walk through that door and permit -- and participate in an open and transparent process.  </p><p>WALLACE:  General McMaster, thank you.  Thanks for your time.  You're a busy guy, we covered a lot of ground there in about 12 minutes.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  It's always a pleasure, Chris.  Thank you.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Thank you.  And we'll be watching the president's speech, of course, on Tuesday to the U.N., sir.  </p><p>MCMASTER:  Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE:  Up next, we'll talk with two leading senators about the president's move to cut deals with Democrats.  How long will it affect the Trump agenda and how long will it last?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>had dinner with Democratic leaders Chuck and Nancy this week and they seem to have cooked up at least the outline of a deal on immigration that has many of the most devoted Trump supporters worried.  So, where do we stand on DACA and whose driving the agenda now here in Washington?  </p><p>Joining us from Chicago, <person><nameText>Dick Durbin, </nameText></person>the Senate's number two Democrat.  And here in Washington, Republican Senator <person><nameText>Roy Blunt.  </nameText></person></p><p>Well, gentlemen, let's start with the big question here in Washington.  The most immediate question, does <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>have a deal with speaker -- former Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer when it comes to DACA or not?  </p><p>And here's part of what was a shifting conversation on Thursday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The wall is going to be built, and it will be funded a little bit later.  </p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  It was a very, very positive step for the president to commit to DACA protections without insisting on the inclusion of or even a debate about the border wall.  </p><p>TRUMP:  They cannot obstruct the wall.  The wall, to me, is vital.  If I don't get the wall, then we will become the obstruction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Durbin, I want to push on two specific points.  Is there a deal to protect the DREAMers without funding for the wall?  And is there a deal to give the DREAMers a path to citizenship?  </p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>DICK DURBIN </nameText></person>(D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  Well, there's a basic understanding.  Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi met with the President Thursday night.  They came to a basic understanding, without the details, without the obvious negotiations that have to follow.  And then, Chuck and Nancy said to the president and the White House, we are going to put out a press release, so it's clear on both sides what we've agreed to.  They did exactly that.  </p><p>There was great pushback from the right.  They didn't like the parameters of this understanding and there has been a lot of conversation since.  But we are going forward.  We are going forward with the understanding that we can work with the White House to come up with an agreement that includes DACA, that includes citizenship for those who are protected under the DREAM Act and also has a substantial commitment to increase border protection.  Those are the two pillars of this understanding.  </p><p>WALLACE:  And very briefly, in this understanding do you believe that the president committed to those pillars over Chinese food on Wednesday night?  </p><p>DURBIN:  Yes.  </p><p>WALLACE:  That's pretty brief.  </p><p>OK.  Senator Blunt, the president seemed to walk away from at least the citizenship part of this deal later on Thursday.  Let's take a look at that.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We're not talking about amnesty at all.  We have not talked about amnesty.  There will be no amnesty.  We're not talking about that as part of the transaction.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  So, Senator, helpless clear this up, because -- I mean, there's genuine confusion here in Washington.  Do you believe that there is a deal on these issues and is this something that Republican senators could support?  </p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>ROY BLUNT </nameText></person>(R), MISSOURI:  Well, I think there's a desire to come to a conclusion here on both sides and Senator Durbin just mentioned border security as part of the understanding, but the details haven't been worked out, another thing that he mentioned.  </p><p>Well, the details here matter.  You know, it's always been three separate questions in my view.  One is, how do you secure the border?  Two is, what are the legitimate workforce needs of the country?  And three, what you do with people who came or stayed, or in the case of the DREAMers, were brought to the country illegally?  </p><p>I think it would be very shortsighted not to try to do all we can to solve the first problem, and the president has unbelievable credibility here.  If you solve the first problem, the other problems I think are reasonably solvable, we are seeing that to happen as people want to come together and deal with the issue who of kids who were brought here illegally.  </p><p>But you're not going to be able to solve this problem in a satisfactory way unless you give the present at the leeway he needs to be able to some point in the future say the border is now operationally secure.  That allows everybody to move to solve these other problems in a better way, Chris.  </p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWSHOST:  But, again, briefly, and I hope you will be as brief as Senator Durbin is, giving them leeway to secure the border, does that have to include funding for the wall, specifically funding for the wall as opposed to other measures, and secondly, citizenship for DREAMers?  </p><p>BLUNT:  It appears it would -- it would not preclude the wall, but it doesn't have to include the wall at this point I don't think.  There are a lots of things have to happen to secure the border and should -- in terms of citizenship, does that mean you wouldn't have to take the test that everybody else takes?  How long would you have to be here under the DREAM Act (ph)?  There are lots of things that can and will be worked out there.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let's turn to the bigger issue, which is whether or not <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is forming a new alliance with congressional Democrats at the expense of Republicans.  Here is what the president had to say about that on Air Force One.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If the Republicans don't stick together then I'm going to have to do more work.  If they are unable to stick together, then I'm going to have to get a little help from the Democrats and I've got that, I'll tell you.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, given the failure of Senate Republicans to pass Obamacare repeal and replace, isn't it wise for this president to go to Democrats and look for some votes?  </p><p>BLUNT:  Well, I think the minority can't abuse the rules of the Senate.  But under the rules of the Senate, you have to have some Democrats work with you to get most things done.  The tenures -- I was either the chief deputy whip for the deputy whip in the House, we passed two bills in 10 years that didn't have Democrats vote for them.  That's part of the work -- that's how you get the work done here in a way that allows everything else to move forward.  </p><p>So, looking for Democrats on every bill is a good idea, but making it impossible to get your work done because you've lost your own side is not part of that either.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Durbin, do you think that there is the potential for a real -- not permanent, but working alliance between <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and congressional Democrats?  And what you say to those members -- folks on the left who don't trust this president and don't trust making deals with him?  </p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>DICK DURBIN </nameText></person>(D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  Well, of course, there will be people on the right and left who will be critical.  But Senator <person><nameText>Roy Blunt </nameText></person>and I are good examples of how this can work.  I have joined him and applauded his leadership in dramatically increasing biomedical research in the United States on a bipartisan basis.  Lamar Alexander, Patty Murray joined us.  </p><p>Two weeks ago, Schumer and Pelosi sat down with the president and the other leaders and said, we can help you move immediately for Hurricane Harvey assistance, to have a short-term spending bill so the government doesn't shut down and to extend the debt ceiling of the United States, we'll do it on a bipartisan basis, Mr. President.  That's what American wants.  And the president said, I'll take it.  </p><p>We did it.  And we can do more like that, as long as we trust one another, respect the differences that we obviously do have, but try to work toward a goal.  Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander have accomplished more in the last two weeks of strengthening our health care system and moving forward to make the Affordable Care Act more affordable and more transparent than we achieved in seven months of partisan wrangling on the floor of the Senate.  It can be done.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But there are some differences.  I mean, you talked for instance about NIH spending, the Trump administration wants to cut NIH spending.  </p><p>And let me talk about another big difference on the hot issue of tax reform.  The president wants to slash corporate taxes and end the estate tax, Democrats opposed both.  The president talks about paying for tax cuts based on assumptions of dramatic growth, Democrats reject that.  </p><p>Senator Durbin, is there a deal given those very sharp differences, fundamental differences, is there a deal to be made on tax reform?  </p><p>DURBIN:  Chris, there will be differences, but that's what the Senate is all about -- sitting down with Democrats and Republicans and the Republicans are in the majority, and really working out an amendment process that comes to a conclusion where both sides have to compromise to some degree.  That's where you get the best legislation and that's where you get something the American people can trust.  </p><p>Jamming something through on one side or the other is just not the way to achieve it.  We proved that with repeal and replace.  That did not achieve what America wanted, a stronger health care system with more people with insurance coverage and quality insurance policies they can trust.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, what are the implications of all this for the 2018 midterm elections?  You have the president out on the stump recently with North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp.  This is somebody who was a vulnerable Democrat, one of the prime targets for Republicans to knock her off in 2018.  The president is saying nice things about her.  </p><p>When you add that to the president appearing to compromise on some of his basic campaign pledges, couldn't this hurt Republicans in 2018?  </p><p>BLUNT:  Well, on the tax front, it's very important we get something done -- increases take-home pay for working families, that we're almost into a decade now of very flat opportunities for families with their take-home pay.  A tax bill that increases take-home pay, and in the future creates better jobs with more take-home pay, with more pay to start with is where we should be headed.  </p><p>We ought to be looking for anybody who wants to be part of that.  But, you know, 46 Democrats sent a letter to the president that said, we'd be glad to work with you as long as you don't do these three things that you think are important parts of the tax package.  That's not a good way to start.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Finally, Senator Blunt -- and I got about a minute left -- there was more violent protest in St. Louis overnight.  People angry about the acquittal of a white police officer who was charged with murder in the death of a drug -- black drug suspect.  I know everyone opposes the violence, but even the mayor of St. Louis said she was appalled by the shooting and appalled by the verdict.  </p><p>So, what's your reaction to the situation there and the clear anger of a lot of people in the African-American community?  </p><p>BLUNT:  Well, I talked yesterday to the police chiefs that are involved in what the chiefs are doing.  I also talked to a number of community leaders and African-American pastors.  I do think this is a place where we have to figure out how to come together.  You do have to accept what the judge who has the obligation to look at this case determined.  </p><p>But at the same time, you have to look at what we need to do to bring the community together in ways that both law enforcement and community leaders have been trying to do, particularly since Ferguson.  This happened before that happened.  And we just need to continue to watch this.  </p><p>The division in the country whether it's St. Louis or Baltimore is not a good thing and we all need to be working hard to make our system work.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, Senator Durbin, thank you both.  We'll stay on top of how all of this work between the president and Chuck and Nancy plays out in Congress.  Thank you all, gentlemen.  </p><p>Coming up, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>new search for votes on both sides of the aisle.  </p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the president's potential deal to protect DREAMers without getting funding for the border wall?  </p><p>Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Coming up, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>reaching across the aisle on tax reform, suggesting there may be no cuts for the rich.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I think the wealthy will be pretty much where they are -- pretty much where they are.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  We'll ask our send a panel about the prospect for passing tax reform.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), MINORITY LEADER: He likes us. He likes me anyway. </p><p>I said, Mr. President, you're much better off if you can sometimes step right and sometimes step left. If you have to step just in one direction you're boxed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught on a hot mic on the Senate floor describing his advice to <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>to deal with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. </p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Rachael Bade, who covers Congress for Politico, Julie Pace, Washington bureau chief for the Associated Press, and Guy Benson of townhall.com. </p><p>Well, Mr. Speaker, you worked with Bill Clinton in the mid-1990s as he wasn't doing what was called triangulation, trying to negotiate apart from both Republicans and his own Democratic Party. Is that what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is doing here, and will it work? </p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWSCONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think Trump is a better dealmaker. I think that's -- he wants things to work. He wants to get the job done. I think the other day he was faced with two visits to Houston, terrible devastation, a hurricane coming to Florida, and he had the usual partisan infighting for two or three weeks or take a deal. </p><p>And he took a deal. And it worked. And I think he thought, well, maybe we'll do a little more.</p><p>Now, the challenge will be that the goals of Schumer and Pelosi and their base are so radically different from Trump that the margins for deals may be smaller than people would like. But I think it's perfectly reasonable. I -- look, I advocated for months that they start with infrastructure because it was inherently bipartisan. And I think that presidents govern best when they carve a large block out of the opposition party and have a -- and have a much bigger majority than just their own partisan base.</p><p>WALLACE: Julie, what are they saying -- you cover the White House -- what are they staying at the White House. How frustrated are they with Republican leaders and particularly their inability to deliver on Obamacare repeal and replace? And how much hope to they hold given that, as I said, on a lot of the -- and the speakers said on a lot of the basic issues what they want in tax reform, what they want in immigration, that there's such big differences -- how much hope do they hold for a working alliance with the Democrats? </p><p>JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Well, I think you have to put this in context of the relationship that the president has with McConnell and Ryan. With McConnell in particular, there's just not much of a relationship there. So when you come out of something like the Obamacare debates and the president sees that McConnell just can't get it over the finish line, there's not a lot of personal bonding there to keep that going. So there was a lot of frustration in the White House after that specific debate on the Capitol. </p><p>And I think when the president looks at Schumer, more so than Pelosi, but Schumer in particular, you know, he sees someone he likes. And this is a president who like the personal relationship. He likes to have a bond with someone. Yes, there are going to be differences on the policies, yes, they are not going to be aligned on everything. But where he can make an agreement, I think he is perfectly fine. And he's been hearing from people like Speaker Gingrich and others around him for months that this is actually what he should do, that this is an advantage for someone like Trump, who isn't particularly ideological, who doesn't have deep roots to the conservative movement or Republican ideology. </p><p>WALLACE: So -- so when it comes to DACA, does not mean the wall? Well, maybe not. Citizenship? Maybe yes.</p><p>PACE: I think on the wall, I mean this is something that you've seen the president multiple times when he's had a chance to go to the mat over the wall and say, I'm going to hold up a certain piece of legislation, I'm going to veto it over this wall. He's backed off. And I think that for his base, that's going to continue to be a frustration, but he's certainly shown a willingness to punt that, kick it down the road a little bit. </p><p>WALLACE:  We asked you for question for the panel. And on this issue of the president making a deal with Democrats on DACA, there was a lot of confusion from you, as there has been here in Washington. Let's put some of it up.</p><p>Fox Mulder -- I love that -- tweeted this, does Trump even want to get funding for the wall? Build that wall got him elected. How else will he rally his base? </p><p>And Rick Conner posted this on FaceBook, how do you think amnesty for these illegals will square with the president's campaign promises to the contrary? Is this just a negotiating ploy to get his agenda through, wall and all? </p><p>Guy, how do you answer them?</p><p>GUY BENSON, FOX NEWSCONTRIBUTOR: That's what everyone is trying to figure out in this town, including, I think, both senators that you just interviewed a little while ago. You know, I went back and tried to figure out maybe what would a deal start to look like on DACA? What would the contours perhaps start to come together with? And I think the wall seems to be out, at least for this particular piece. He says maybe sometime in the future. Unclear. </p><p>But it seems like ancient history at this point. But 2013 there was the gang of eight bill that eventually was killed in the House. But Democrats agreed in principle to a whole swath of border security and immigration enforcement provisions that I think would probably form the basis for something where Trump could potentially, somewhat credibly, claim a victory. And I went back and I looked at some of those provisions, $40 billion for border security, 20,000 new security agents, 700 miles of fencing. That's a physical border. That was in gang of eight, agreed to in the so-called \"border surge.\" So there's a chance that while the wall might be part of a DACA deal, there could be something that could be spun as or framed as a wall or a physical barrier. </p><p>WALLACE: And how do you think -- I mean it's crazy to ask you what's the base going to do, but I'm going to ask you, what do you think the reaction of the real Trump hardliners, the real base will be if they get a deal on DACA that includes citizenship and doesn't include a wall as it had been commonly thought to exist? </p><p>BENSON: Well, last week I had a long car ride, so I listen to talk radio for about six hours straight, and it was really interesting. They opened the phone lines and it was Trump base voters calling in. And there was some trepidation, there was some concern about where this might go. But, overall, there was a sense that they trust <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>that they think that he's three steps ahead of anyone else and that ultimately he's got their interests at heart. And that was sort of reflected across-the-board for most of his supporters. So that's what I would guess would be the case, unless it is egregiously bad. </p><p>WALLACE: Rachael, from your post covering Capitol Hill, what do you think is the -- are the prospects for a deal that can be passed on DACA and the prospects for a deal on tax reform? </p><p>RACHAEL BADE, POLITICO: You talk to Republicans right now, they would tell you, a slim chance in terms of the White House striking a deal with Democrats and getting it over the line, while cutting out GOP leadership. You know, you mentioned that a lot of the base still has faith in Trump and they see this. They say he knows our interests, he's going to do what is best for us.</p><p>There's a totally different feeling on Capitol Hill with GOP leadership. I heard a lot of frustration and questioning of, what is this strategy? What is the end game here? Basically, you know, Republicans control both houses of Congress. You know, so cutting out leadership is not the smartest thing for the president at this point in time, at least Republicans will tell you that. </p><p>For instance, take the DACA deal. I was talking to some folks in leadership who were saying that they don't understand why he took the wall off the table to begin with. It's the number one bargaining chip, they said, in terms of negotiating a deal. If you're going to take it off the table with Democrats, you should get something for it. So they're going to try to push him to put that back on the table and sort of use that to get a deal that is possible that conservatives could vote for it.</p><p>WALLACE: And what about tax reform? This is -- I pointed out with the two senators, they're so different on tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy, on whether or not it's going to add to the deficit or not, unless you put in what they called dynamic scoring and include a lot of the growth that is a guess whether or not it's going to happen. </p><p>BADE: Yes, I don't mean to sound alarmist, but tax reform is also in trouble right now. And it -- again, it goes back to this sort of shift we're seeing in the president going from just working to Republicans, to now wanting to work with Democrats. For instance, Republicans on The Hill, Speaker Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Gary Cohn, they've all been writing a Republican bill and they're about to unveil it. </p><p>Last week we saw the president come out and float the idea of increasing taxes on the wealthy, which blows in the face of sly-side economics and goes against -- 100 percent against what Republicans would want to see in a tax bill. So there's a fear that he's overstepping right now in terms of reaching out to Democrats and they're concerned that this is going to undercut them. And not only a Republican base, but the president and what he wants to do. </p><p>WALLACE: A quick reactions, speaker? </p><p>GINGRICH: I think the most interesting side story was Democrats won this big agreement. Everything was going to end in December. The Democrats are going to have this huge leverage because the debt ceiling ended in December. A few days later, Mitch McConnell pointed out that as the majority leader he controlled the paper. And they took out the provisions Schumer most wanted. And --</p><p>WALLACE: Which was about extraordinary measures, which means that they can keep the debt ceiling going till March. </p><p>GINGRICH: February or March. And he said, you know, I happen to be the majority leader and I control the paper and we did it on my way (ph). And Schumer, faced with that reality, couldn't break -- he couldn't say no. So we're a long way -- this dance is going to continue for a while. I think the Democrats face the real risk. Do they really hate the wall more than they love the dreamers? Because if I were the president, that's the way I'd drive it. I'd say these people are so ideological they'd rather sacrifice the dreamers. </p><p>WALLACE: All right. Gridlock breaking out here in Washington. </p><p>All right, panel, we have to take a break here. </p><p>When we combat, with growing tension between Washington and Silicon Valley, powerful Internet companies face talk of more government oversight. We'll bring back the panel to discuss Congress' new scrutiny of big tech. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA SENATOR: I think that we're still at the tip of the iceberg. The fact is, I don't think FaceBook has put the resources, the time. My understanding is they didn't even go back and check all those accounts to see if they had put out -- put out other ads. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia after FaceBook admitted it sold $150,000 worth of ads in the 2016 election to groups linked to Russia, spurring investigations by both congressional committees and Special Counsel Robert Mueller. </p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Speaker Gingrich, how big a development is this and are we beginning to see the end of Washington's hands-off approach to big tech and especially these huge Internet companies? </p><p>GINGRICH: Yes, look, I think this is probably four to six years behind the curve. These companies are so big, they control so much of our lives, they can set so many different policies internally with no supervision, that having not just the Russian angle, but really looking at the underlying nature of these companies, what they do, how they make decisions, these are the equivalent of gigantic public utilities. And in the information age, they have enormous power. And I don't think you, in a free society, you can't have power that's hidden away in secret, controlled by a handful of billionaires.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, one of the things that Mark Warner, who was a tech guy himself before he went into politics, said, that it's the wild, wild west there. Now, some people would say that's one of the reasons it succeed. Are you saying put government clamps on it? </p><p>GINGRICH: No, look, I think having the wild, wild west when companies are small is exactly right. Several of these companies are so enormous that there's some sense of, what does it mean to us as a free society to have global corporations run by founding billionaires who are -- have been, in effect, totally out of control and who internally can wipe out a company and wipe -- I mean they can be anti-conservative, they can be anti-liberal, they can do all sorts of things, and there's been almost no supervision, just to surface (ph) the information. </p><p>WALLACE: President -- Rachael, President Obama and Democrats, I think you'd agree, generally had a pretty cozy relationship with the big Internet companies, like FaceBook, like Google, like Amazon. Is that changing on Capitol Hill now, as the speaker suggested it should, and is there a partisan divide in how Republicans and Democrats see these Internet behemoths? </p><p>BADE: Yes, absolutely. The days of the industry sort of basking in the sunless praise from Washington are basically coming to an end right now. Look, for a long time Congress had sort of a light touch with the tech industry, but now you have Democrats who are furious about these Russia-linked ads that ran in 2016. Republicans are worried that Google is oppressing conservative voices. Both sides are concerned about people's private information being gathered and what happens if they're hacked. And so those are all concerns.</p><p>So, yes, generally, Republicans control everything right now in Washington and they're typically anti-regulation. But it's safe to say that this sort of darling industry is now becoming a target as much as anything else. </p><p>WALLACE: And do you have any thought about how you do it when the rubber hits the road? How do you allow these companies to grow and prosper but with some guardrails? </p><p>BADE: I think that's the question that The Hill is sort of grappling with right now, how do they do this but allow an industry to continue to grow, that influences everyone's life so much? Look, there's a test case that's going on right now on Capitol Hill. There's going to be some hearings coming up in the Senate this week to examine whether big websites and tech companies can be held liable for child sex trafficking on the Internet. Right now they cannot be sued if a user were to put illicit content on the Internet. </p><p>So the Senate is going to look at re-examining this. The tech industry is putting a lot of money in K Street to lobby against this. But I think this is an interesting first test, right? Like if -- if they can't -- if they're not going to see something as heinous as child sex trafficking as a reason to regulate, then it's safe to say that big tech still has a lot of power. </p><p>WALLACE: It's funny you talk about K Street. It is amazing. Which is the big center of lobbying here in Washington. And there was a chart in \"The Wall Street Journal\" that show the lobbying expenditures by these companies has just skyrocketed in the last few years. </p><p>Julie, where are <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and his administration on this? You talk about utilities, Speaker Gingrich. Steve Bannon used to talk about treating FaceBook and Google as public utilities, which meant heavy regulation. </p><p>PACE: Right. Steve Bannon, of course, now outside the White House. So, look, the -- at least rhetorically the position of this White House, when it comes to big tech, is so different from the Obama administration, which really wrapped its arms around the Googles and Amazon's and FaceBooks and presented them as examples of American companies that are -- that are growing strong and are dominating on the global stage. </p><p>Trump, I think, has been turned off a bit by the fact that some of the leaders of these companies are not particularly pleased with his administration and have spoken out on a lot of issues. I don't think you can divorce this conversation when it comes to the White House from that. But he's also taken on Amazon, and not just for Jeff Bezos's role in owning \"The Washington Post,\" he's taken on Amazon on his Twitter account. </p><p>I think that you are seeing some of this stemming from the president's populist message in general as well. I mean he looks at Wall Street and some of the big firms there and I think looks at tech in somewhat of the same way, a massive company that can get out of control. And he -- when he looks at his base, he can see their frustration with that. The frustration of small business owners who see themselves getting taken over by a giant like Amazon. </p><p>WALLACE: Yes. There's also this whole question, before I get to you, Guy, about the fact that Internet companies, when they have sales, they don't have to pay taxes, but the mom and pop store in the town on main street does have to pay taxes. </p><p>PACE: And that's when you've see him go after Amazon in particular for. He's done this in a -- in a series of tweets. I think it will be interesting to see if this comes up in the discussion on The Hill on tax reform if we are -- do end up talking about a big tax reform package. </p><p>WALLACE: That would actually add a lot of revenue, wouldn't it?</p><p>PACE: Yes (ph).</p><p>WALLACE:  That would really -- that would get the lobbyists -- because, Guy, there's another aspect of all of this that I want to get to, and that's growing questions about the culture in Silicon Valley. </p><p>You had three former female employees of Google just file what they hope will be a class action lawsuit charging them with pay and promotion discrimination. And as you know, there have been a number of complaints and lawsuits alleging sexual harassment in these companies. So that wild, wild west attitude applies also to the culture in Silicon Valley. </p><p>BENSON: That's right. So you'll have Democrats, in particular I think, focusing on those problems and equal pay and is there discrimination in Silicon Valley. And then you'll have on the other side, as Rachael alluded to, a lot of conservatives and Republicans look at what happened at Mozilla a few years ago and Brendan Eich ousted from that company for having traditional views on marriage. And then the firing of that engineer of Google. </p><p>Is there rampant discrimination in terms of viewpoints against conservatives and how might that play out in terms of average users having information potentially stifled in searches? There are real concerns about that on the right. So, big tech might be waking up these days and saying, uh-oh, we have real problems culturally on the left and the right in this country and that could be a problem for us on Capitol Hill as lawmakers on both sides, rather, start to dig in. </p><p>WALLACE: But I want to pick up on something that I asked Speaker Gingrich, because there's no question that these companies have been engines of huge economic growth in this country. Is there a downside to Washington -- obviously there's a downside. How big a downside is there to Washington getting more involved in regulation of the Internet? </p><p>BENSON: A huge downside. I think some of the concerns that the speaker raised are fair and reasonable and people would agree with them. My faith in the ability of government to respond to that wealth to regulation is very low. I think it is -- government is slow-moving. It is the opposite of innovative. And the Internet is a miracle. And it wouldn't exist as it does today if the government's clumsy hand had been on its neck from day one. And I think putting more hand on the neck and applying more pressure from D.C., I'm just not sure that works out well. </p><p>WALLACE: Fifteen seconds to respond, speaker. </p><p>GINGRICH: First of all, the Internet was created by ARPANET, a Department of Defense project. Second, the fact is, there are no time in American history when the huge concentrations of power are not directly challenged by government. And that's overall been good for protecting our liberty. </p><p>WALLACE: All right. We'll continue this debate. </p><p>This is an important subject and we'll keep talking about it. </p><p>Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.</p><p>Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week.\" The doctor who keeps both the Washington Redskins and Nationals healthy, while breaking down barriers in pro sports. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: The pro football season is now in full swing. And as we fans dream of how our team will get to the Super Bowl, we know injuries have a way of derailing those hopes, which brings us to our \"Power Player of the Week.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. ROBIN WEST, HEAD PHYSICIAN, WASHINGTON REDSKINS: In sports medicine, people are very highly motivated so they can play to get better. </p><p>WALLACE: Orthopedic surgeon Robin West has a busy schedule. Most of the time she's the head of Inova Sports Medicine in Virginia, except when she's the lead position for both the Washington Redskins and the Washington Nationals. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you to be the first female head doctor in the history of both major league baseball and the NFL? </p><p>WEST: I don't even think about it. I never -- it never really crossed my mind. I -- I never think of myself as different. </p><p>WALLACE (voice-over): We saw for ourselves at a Skins exhibition game. Nose tackle Phil Taylor went down on a play and West ran on the field. She examined him there and back on the sidelines for what turned out to be a season ending tear of his left quadriceps muscle. </p><p>West told us how different injuries are in the two sports. </p><p>WEST: It's over use typically in baseball. We're dealing with a lot of shoulder and elbow injuries in baseball. In football, it's a lot of traumatic injuries, high-energy injuries that we have to really manage quickly. </p><p>WALLACE: That's another difference. In baseball, an injured player is out of the game. But in football -- </p><p>WEST: The coaches are in my ear as I'm examining the kid, is he going to play, is he going to play? I have to decide that pretty quickly. </p><p>WALLACE: But West emphasizes how she makes that decision.</p><p>WEST: I'm the players' doctor, right? So it's -- I want the best for the player. So, obviously, I work for the -- I don't work for the team, I -- I want the team to do well, but I have to look at the players' best interests. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Is being a woman an advantage or a disadvantage to doing your job? </p><p>WEST: At least in football, a lot of them were raised by their mothers and their grandmothers and so they have -- they hold women in a very high regard and they come to me and will tell me more information and I -- they are very trusting, I think. </p><p>WALLACE (voice-over): Dr. West usually does any reconstructive surgeries, but she says psychological outlook is key to getting players back on the field. </p><p>WEST: One of my players today, who I operated on last week, he said he's a mental fortress. But yet I have another player who's coming to me and saying, I'm just -- I'm so depressed.  I'm not around my team. I -- and they're coming to me and they're asking me for help on the mental side. </p><p>WALLACE: Growing up, West was interested in the human body. Her mom noticed. </p><p>WEST: When I was five, she got me a \"Gray's Anatomy\" book for Christmas. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Why?</p><p>WEST: That was my present. I don't know. I just was fascinated by it.</p><p>WALLACE:  Now the big concern is brain injuries, but she says the NFL has developed a much stricter policy on concussions. </p><p>WEST: I think football's the safest it's ever been. </p><p>WALLACE: Before Washington, West was an assistant team doctor for the Pittsburgh Steelers and got two Super Bowl rings. Her dream now, to win championships in both football and baseball. </p><p>WEST: That's our goal, right? That's everyone's goal on the team is to keep the players healthy and to be as successful as we can.

Who in the president's inner circle is next to fall?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Let me tell you, I never directed him to do anything wrong.  Whatever he did, he did on his own.  </p><p>WALLACE:  What do we know about President Trump's involvement in hush money payments of two women during the 2016 campaign?

A federal judge has ruled the entire Affordable Care Act invalid.  Obamacare will remain in place pending appeal and both President Trump and Democrats are calling for Congress to pass new legislation.  We'll get to all that a little later.  </p><p>But first, the president is already dealing with a possible government shutdown that's now just five days away.  Meanwhile, prosecutors are producing more of the evidence that led former members of Mr. Trump's inner circle to plead guilty, evidence that implicates the president.  </p><p>Let's get the latest from Kevin Corke live at the White House -- Kevin.  </p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, even for an administration accustomed to seismic shifts in the news cycle, it was without a doubt a tumultuous week.  But few headlines could prove as potentially damaging to the Trump White House than those involving former members of the president's inner circle.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  Three of whom are facing time in prison for a variety of misdeeds, but none involving so-called Russian collusion.  Former national security adviser, General Michael Flynn, faces sentencing Tuesday for lying to federal investigators.  The special counsel's office recommending he get no jail time even as it has faced charges that the general was entrapped and inappropriately questioned.  </p><p>Meanwhile, in his first televised interview since being sentenced to three years behind bar, the president's former fixer, attorney Michael Cohen, claimed he repeatedly lied for Mr. Trump over the years and he would set up payments to women to help aid his 2016 campaign, a claim strongly denied by the White House.  </p><p>TRUMP:  I will take the mantle of shutting down and I'm going to shut it down for border security.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK:  But we believe you shouldn't shut it down.</p><p>CORKE:  An Oval Office meeting with leading Democrats this week did little to quell fears of a potential partial government shutdown over the president's insistence that there would be funding for a border wall, something Democrats say they won't pay for.  A work stoppage that could come in a week in which backers of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, consider their next move in the wake of a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional.  </p><p>TRUMP:  -- that the Supreme Court upholds, we'll be sitting down with the Democrats and we will get great health care for our people.  Let's say repeal and replace.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  That ruling by District Court Judge Reed O'Connor, Chris, does not impact Obamacare recipients in the short term, but it does set up a potential high court battle and that is a debate White House officials would love to have -- Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Kevin Corke reporting from the White House -- Kevin, thanks.  </p><p>WALLACE:  And joining me now from New York, the president's lead lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.  </p><p>Mayor, welcome back to \"FOX News Sunday\".  </p><p>RUDY GUILIANI, LEAD LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Thank you -- thank you, Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's start with Michael Cohen's allegation that President Trump directed him to commit a criminal campaign finance violation.  Here first was the president and then Mr. Cohen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I never directed him to do anything wrong.  Whatever he did, he did on his own.  He's a lawyer.  A lawyer who represents a client is supposed to do the right thing.  </p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  He directed me to make the payments, he directed me to become involved in these matters.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  Question.  Did Mr. Trump direct Michael Cohen to pay off these two women or not?  </p><p>GIULIANI:  No, the truth is actually what Cohen testified to under oath before Congress and what he repeated numerous times on surreptitious tape recordings that he made, which is that the president didn't know about this until some time into it, he did find out about it and eventually reimburse him.  But, you know, this is a hard thing to do, but lawyers do this all the time.  </p><p>But, Chris, even if it were true, it's not a crime.  The payment -- the payment of money in a situation like this has been covered in the Edwards case.  Not only the acquittal and hung jury in the Edwards case, but the fact that the FEC looked at those Edwards violations and determined they weren't violations --   </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>WALLACE:  I promise we're going to get to that in a minute, but let's get to the simple fact, question of whether the president directed Cohen --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- to make these --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- payments or not.  </p><p>Cohen says that the president is not to be believed.  Here he is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>COHEN:  The man doesn't tell the truth.  And it's sad that I should take responsibility for his dirty deeds.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Wow.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor -- Mayor --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  That's some lawyer.  That is some lawyer.  He was the lawyer in that situation.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>WALLACE:  But does the president tell the truth or not?   </p><p>GIULIANI:  The president is telling the truth, yes.  This man is lying.  </p><p>Now, is that a big surprise to you, that Michael Cohen is lying?  The man got up in front of the judge and said I was a fiercely loyal to Donald Trump.  Nonsense he was fiercely loyal to him, he taped him, lied to him, revealed the tape and did something a lawyer I've never heard ever did -- tape record his own client.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But -- but, sir --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  He sat there with Chris Cuomo, told him he wasn't being taped, showed him a drawer (ph), and he lied to him and taped him for two hours.  The man is a complete pathological liar that cannot be believed.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But, sir, let's -- let's turn to --   </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GIULIANI:  And they'll never put him on a witness stand.  They will never -- Chris --   </p><p>WALLACE:  Yes, but let me ask you --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  -- they will never put him on a witness stand.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I understand.  But does the question -- the real question is the credibility of the president, not the credibility of Michael Cohen --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  No, no --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let me just finish.  The president has changed his story repeatedly about whether or not he knew about hush money.  Here is what he said on Air Force One -- the president said on Air Force One this April, eight months ago.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>REPORTER:  Mr. President, did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels?</p><p>TRUMP:  No.  No.  What else?  </p><p>REPORTER:  Then why did Michael Cohen make those if there was no truth to her allegations?  </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.  Michael is my attorney and you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.   </p><p>REPORTER:  Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?  </p><p>TRUMP:  No, I don't know.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  The president said he doesn't know anything about any payments, but in one of those tapes that you're talking about where Cohen surreptitiously taped the president -- this is back in September of 2016 -- here are the president and Cohen discussing a potential --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>WALLACE:  Let's listen to the tape first.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Sure, sure.  I remember it well.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p>COHEN:  I'm all over that.  And I spoke to Allen about it.  When it comes time for the financing, which will be --   </p><p>TRUMP:  Wait a sec, what financing?  </p><p>COHEN:  Well, I'll have to pay --  </p><p>TRUMP:  Pay with cash --  </p><p>COHEN:  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  So which is it?  Did the president know about the hush money payments or not?  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Chris, there's an intervening event that you're not talking about.  I know this really well because I got criticized for revealing this when I first came into the case.  Nobody really understood why I was doing it.  </p><p>When I first came into the case, we went through the whole case.  The president saw some notes and documents, thought about it, and I went out and said, no, there was an intervening conversation after the payments took place and before the revelations you're talking about on Air Force One.</p><p>The president did talk to Cohen or to people in between and they arranged to reimburse Cohen.  This was after the payment was made, after it was over, after the campaign was over.</p><p>WALLACE:  But -- but there's --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  They're talking about a conversation, sir, in September of 2016 during the campaign.  The president is clearly aware that David Pecker, the head of \"National Enquirer\" had paid off Karen McDougal and they're talking about reimbursing McDougal --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Well, you know, that's --  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- or reimbursing Pecker for that payment.</p><p>GIULIANI:  But there's a -- there's a big difference here.  That was a - that was a conversation he was asked, middle of the campaign, I was with him back then in the middle of the campaign, he's working 18 hours a day.  I wasn't able to remember a lot of things that happened in September of 2016.  He was asked it one time.  </p><p>When he sat down with his lawyer and went through it in great detail and saw things that could refresh his recollection, we immediately corrected it.</p><p>Nobody pushed us, nobody found it, we found it.  And we corrected it and I got criticized like crazy for doing it.</p><p>WALLACE:  So you're saying --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  By the time this came out, we all knew --  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- the fact -- I mean, the -- according both to Cohen and to Pecker, the -- again, he's the head of -- or was the head of National Enquirer, they say they were in a meeting with Donald Trump --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Chris, Chris, Chris --  </p><p>WALLACE:   -- in the summer of 2016 in which --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- they discussed the payment to Karen McDougal.</p><p>GIULIANI:  We're talking about something that doesn't matter.  I mean, whether - whether it happened or didn't happen, it's not illegal.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  You're moving shells around on me.  Either it happened or it didn't happen.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  But that's what lawyers do all the time.  You argue in the alternative.  I'm telling it --  </p><p>WALLACE:  But I'm asking you for the truth, sir.</p><p>GIULIANI:  I'm telling you definitively -- well, I -- I want the truth too.  And the truth is, yes, the tape-recorded conversation did take place.  It exonerates the president.  The president tells Cohen, do it by check.  </p><p>I'm sorry, I prosecuted thousands of crimes, never prosecuted one where they wanted to hide something, they did it by check.  </p><p>Make sure we pay him back.  They paid him back.  That's what that conversation's all about.  It exonerates him.</p><p>I'd play that conversation in front of any jury in America and I'd cross-examine Cohen in front of any jury in America.</p><p>WALLACE:  OK, here's what you're telling --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  But I -- but very important; Cohen did not plead guilty to conspiracy to violate the campaign finance laws.  If they were going to use him as a witness against anybody, you always make them plea guilty to a conspiracy so you can fill the conspiracy in.  </p><p>He pled guilty to a singular crime of violating the campaign finance laws.  Not a conspiracy.</p><p>WALLACE:  Yes, but the statement is full of references to individual one who is Donald Trump.  Here's what you told the --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p>WALLACE:  Here's what you told \"The Daily Beast\" this week.  I want to put it up on the screen.  </p><p>Nobody got killed.  Nobody got robbed.  This was not a big crime.</p><p>Mayor, what's the threshold between a crime and a big crime?</p><p>GIULIANI:  My statement there was about the prosecutor's view of it, not mine.  Mr. Swinger (ph) who wrote that, actually corrected that, to say that that was taken out of context.  My point was, there was no crime.  </p><p>But even if you take the prosecutor's viewpoint, this prosecutor was appointed -- both of them, right, looking at collusion, no collusion.  Looking at obstruction --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  Sir, this was the Southern District of New York.  This is not -- has nothing to do with collusion --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  But now you're --  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- or obstruction of justice, there --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Now, you're - they're part of the Department of Justice -- he's not being investigated --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I understand it's a separate prosecutor.  I'm sure -- I'm sure when you were the --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes, this guy -- this guy is going back --  </p><p>WALLACE:  I'm sure - I'm sure when you were the U.S. attorney for the Southern District --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  And this guy is going back --  </p><p>WALLACE:  You didn't take orders from somebody in Washington who had nothing to do with the attorney general.  You were your own -- they used to call it a sovereign district of New York, sir.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  The person -- the person in charge of this investigation, Chris, is Rod Rosenstein the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.  He is the boss of Mueller and he is the boss of the Southern District of New York.  He's the one that determined, let's move it over here.  He put it there in the Southern District of New York and keeps supervision of it.</p><p>WALLACE:  I know --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  So don't give me that.</p><p>WALLACE:  But they're not --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  But they're not -- they're not working for --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  There is one Justice Department --- yes they are.  They're working for the same Rod -- Rod Rosenstein's going to make the decision, not Mueller, about what to do with this case.</p><p>WALLACE:  Right, and not Mueller.</p><p>GIULIANI:  And this is a witch-hunt.  They are going back now -- they're going back to 1982, 1983.  They're going through business records.  My goodness, they went from collusion to obstruction, no evidence -- now campaign finance, no violation of the law.  </p><p>No matter who's right about what they said, it's no violation of the law.  And now --  </p><p>WALLACE:  The president -- I -- I want to -- I want to move on.  You're -- you're very a effective lawyer, but I've got -- I've got to move on, sir.  </p><p>President Trump --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  You wanted the truth.  That's the truth.  The truth is it's not a violation of the law.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I want -- I want the truth in a limited amount of time.  </p><p>President Trump talked this week about whether or not General Flynn lied to the FBI.  Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  They took a general that they said didn't lie, and they convinced him he did lie and he made some kind of a deal.  And now, they're recommending no time.  You know why?  Because they're embarrassed that they've got caught.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Does the president believe Michael Flynn lied or not?</p><p>GIULIANI:  I don't know if Michael Flynn lied or not.  You got two contradictory things.  You've got the FBI saying at the time that he wasn't lying.  And then we have no explanation and the guy pleads guilty to lying.  </p><p>So, I -- I mean, I don't know what happened in between.  I do know they treated Flynn in a way that came very close to --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I'm asking a simple -- I'm asking a simple question.  And the reason I ask is I want to put up a tweet from the president a year ago, in December of 2017, when he says this: I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the vice president and the FBI.  He has pled guilty to those lies.</p><p>The president a year ago seemed to know that Flynn has lied.  Now, he's not so sure.</p><p>GIULIANI:  The president doesn't know that he lied.  The president -- the president --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  But he -- he knows what you knew at the time.  The man pled guilty to lying.  He did --  </p><p>WALLACE:  No, he knows -- he knows what -- he knows what Flynn said to his vice president.</p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes, but that was a lie, but that's not a crime.</p><p>WALLACE:  Well, I understand but I didn't ask if it was a crime, I asked whether it was a lie.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  Chris -- Chris, you're going all over the place and you're really confusing people.  Look, first of all --  </p><p>WALLACE:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>GIULIANI:  You are -- you are -- you are -- you are -- you are, really --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait a minute.  I didn't ask if it was a crime.  I asked whether it was a lie and he told the same lie to the FBI and to the vice president.  And you're quite right, lying to the vice president isn't a lie, it's not very good -- but lying to the FBI --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  -- is a crime.</p><p>GIULIANI:  Right.  And the more important thing about what the president knew or didn't know -- because this doesn't involve the president in terms of him being involved in any kind of conspiracy or anything else -- it's like if it's reported that one of my assistants when I was a U.S. attorney lied to the court, how do I know if he did or he didn't?  He knows what he reads.  The man pled guilty to lying --  </p><p>WALLACE:  OK.  I got -- I got one minute --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  -- so, yes.  He didn't know at the time -- I didn't know at the time -- I didn't know at the time that the FBI had previously concluded he was telling the truth.</p><p>WALLACE:  I got a --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  I didn't know he had been deprived of a lawyer.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor, you're confusing people.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GIULIANI:  I'm not confusing people.</p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask you --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  The man was railroaded.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- three last quick questions.</p><p>GIULIANI:  He was railroaded.</p><p>WALLACE:  There are -- there are reports now that the special counsel is interested again in interviewing the president.  Has his office reached out to you about sitting down for an in-person interview with the president?</p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes.  There are several unpaid parking tickets that night -- back in 1986, '87 that haven't been explained.  You know, we've got to --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Seriously?</p><p>GIULIANI:  Seriously, unpaid parking tickets --  </p><p>WALLACE:  No, no, no.</p><p>GIULIANI:  It was a movie theater.  He didn't pay the proper fee.</p><p>WALLACE:  Is the special counsel -- does he want to interview the president?  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes, good luck.  Good luck.  After what they did to Flynn, the way they trapped him into perjury and no sentence for him, 14 days for Papadopoulos.  I did better on traffic violations than they did with Papadopoulos.  </p><p>WALLACE:  So, when you say good luck, you're saying no way, no interview?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  They're a joke.  Over my dead body, but you know, I could be dead.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Do they want to speak to the president?</p><p>GIULIANI:  I do have -- I do have other lawyer -- I am disgusted with the tactics they have used in this case.  What they did to General Flynn should result in discipline.  They're the ones who are violating the law.  </p><p>They're looking at a non-crime collusion, the other guys are looking at a non-crime campaign violations, which are not violations.  And they are the ones who are violating the law, the rules, the ethics and nobody wants to look at them.  They destroyed Strzok and Page's texts, 19,000 texts.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  If he had destroyed 19,000 texts, they'd put him in jail.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Even though they can't because he's the president.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor Giuliani.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Thank you.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  I got a little --   </p><p>WALLACE:  No, listen, I love it and please come back.  To be continued.  </p><p>Thank you for your time.  Always good to talk to you, sir.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Thank you.  Thank you. </p><p>WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what a judge's Obamacare ruling could mean for millions of Americans.  </p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about President Trump saying he'd be proud to shut down the government over a border wall.  Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  A big, big victory by a highly respected judge.  Highly, highly respected in Texas and on the assumption that the Supreme Court upholds, we will get great, great health care for our people.  We'll have to sit down with the Democrats to do it but I'm sure they want to do it also.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  President Trump praising the ruling from the federal judge striking down the entire Obamacare law.</p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group.  Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume, columnist for \"The Hill\", Juan Williams, Julie Pace, Washington bureau chief for \"The Associated Press\" and Marc Short, former director of legislative affairs for President Trump.  </p><p>Well, Brit, the federal judge said Obamacare is invalid because Congress has taken out the tax penalty as part of the individual mandate, which is the way that it passed through the Supreme Court in the first place.  But we should point out the law stays in effect pending appeal.  </p><p>What do you think of the ruling and how do you think this plays politically?  </p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, remember, this is a trial court judge.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Right.</p><p>HUME:  So, this is subject to appeal to appellate court and perhaps on the Supreme Court.  I think it's an interesting legal argument whether because of the invalidation of the zeroing out of the penalty was the whole law therefore is invalid.  I think you can hear good, legal arguments on both sides of that issue but I think we're nowhere near the last of this and because the judge did not issue an injunction that shuts it down.  As you point out, Obamacare will remain in place -- what's left of Obamacare remains in place for the foreseeable future.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But how does it play politically, given the fact there are certain parts of Obamacare that people didn't like, like the individual mandate.  On the other hand, there are lot of parts of it that people did like pre-existing conditions --  </p><p>HUME:  Right. </p><p>WALLACE:  And that's according to the judge's ruling would be out, too.   </p><p>HUME:  It would be out but it won't be out now and it won't be out soon, in my judgment.  So, I think the political effect will depend on the actual practical effect and there is no practical effect for the time being.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Juan, the president and Republicans ran in 2016 on the idea of repeal and replace Obamacare, which they thought was a good issue for them.  Democrats won in 2018 on the argument the Republicans want to take away your pre-existing conditions.  </p><p>So, how do you think this is going to cut, particularly given the fact as Brit Hume says, it's not going to have a practical effect, it's not going to take effect for some months, maybe a year as it goes to the courts.  </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think you can see already this morning, Republicans are on their heels, not really saying much about this while you have Nancy Pelosi and potentially incoming speaker of the house saying Democrats will defend it.  Chris Murphy, the senator from Connecticut, saying it's a five-alarm fire.  I think clearly Democrats see themselves in a position where they are on the offensive with the voters about this.  If you take away Obamacare, you know, after how many -- 70 votes by Republicans to repeal it, didn't work even with the Republican majority, Chris.</p><p>It's not only that you would do away with things like pre-existing conditions, you would drive up premiums for everybody.  Our health care system would be in chaos.  So, I think that what you get here is Republicans right now including President Trump, who initially tweeted great, great, are saying we need a bipartisan collaboration here to make health care work.  </p><p>That's a different tone from Republicans and I think it's very telling about who is politically at risk here.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Marc, you're wrinkling your brow.  </p><p>MARC SHORT, FORMER DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think, look, Republicans won in 2010 and 2014 and 2016 in large part on a promise to repeal Obamacare and now somehow the media are saying it's an albatross on Republicans.  It's been a political win for Republicans.  </p><p>WALLACE:  If you look at the polls, Obamacare has become more popular.  </p><p>SHORT:  And you know why, Chris?  Because the last two years, from 2013 to 2017, premiums went up 105 percent across the country.  In the last year, they've gone up 5 percent.  They used to be 50 percent of the counties in the United States had one insurer, and that was it.  That's been fixed.  All counties now have more than one insurer.</p><p>Because this administration has provided more choice for people, they have actually helped to stabilize the markets.  That doesn't mean forcing people to buy a product they don't want is a good policy.  </p><p>JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS:  But in terms of the fallout from this ruling potentially, one thing you're definitely not hearing from the Republicans after this judge's ruling is any interest in going back to the drawing board and starting from scratch.  If -- ultimately, this move through the court that Obamacare fully is repealed, you do not have a lot of Republicans who want to spend 2019 deep in the weeds on health care.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Let me switch, I'll tell you what they're going to spend at the end of 2018 on.  There is the real threat now of a partial government shutdown that would start at midnight this Friday.  Here's how that played out this week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country.  So I will take the mantle.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA:  He is taking full responsibility for the Trump shutdown.  Perhaps he doesn't understand people need their paychecks.  Maybe that's not the life he leads.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  We asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of the president saying that he would be proud to shutdown the government, we got this on Facebook from Linda Rector.  </p><p>Why is shutting down the government not something to be proud of if it means protecting the country?  That's exactly what we elected the president to do. </p><p>Marc, Juan, how do you answer Linda?  And two, as a person who until last July used to deal with Congress for the White House, for President Trump, what do you think is going to happen?  Will there be a shutdown?  Will they kick it down the can into January?  </p><p>SHORT:  If there were a shutdown, it would be different the very previous ones.  This government has already funded all the men and women serving in uniform.  It has funded all the entitlement checks.  It will keep the parts of (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>So, the average American wouldn't even recognize the shutdown other than the fact that it would be a media story, Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait, there's about 30 percent of the government that gets shut down and I think 30 to 40 percent of the employees.  </p><p>SHORT:  And every time there's been a shutdown, every employee has been paid back in full.  So I think the average person is not going to feel it in the immediate future.  </p><p>Having said that, I still think you're going to find a compromise that comes together before the end of the week.  I think the president has got to look to find ways to fund this out of military construction dollars.  They'll create a separate problem later, because Democrats object to that.  </p><p>But last year, we secured the first new funding, $1.6 billion for the wall in ten years.  Democrats come on your show and say we oppose any funding for the wall.  They've already agreed to it.  It's already 1.6 in this year.  </p><p>All we're not arguing about is not what they are, it's how much it costs, and it's a matter of whether they can notified (ph) being at 1.6. </p><p>WALLACE:  That's an old joke.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let's gather here, everybody.  </p><p>So, Julie, shutdown or not?  </p><p>PACE:  I think all signs point to, as Marc says, some kind of compromise.  I think we'll have a tense couple of days.  This is normally how the pattern of these shutdowns play out, but both Republicans and Democrats that I talked on Capitol Hill last week have very little interest in a shutdown.  They have very little interest in staying in Washington for Christmas which is ultimately what this comes down to a lot of times.  </p><p>I do think that the president might be itching for a shutdown.  But I ultimately think he will sign on if there is some kind of compromise that gets some amount of wall funding and he can punt towards the military to see if that's another option for building the wall.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask about another issue, which is the president on Friday afternoon named a acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and it's already come out that during the 2016 campaign, during a debate right after the \"Access Hollywood\" came out, a debate with his Democratic candidate, this is before he joined the Trump administration as OMB director, he said this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF:  Yes, I'm supporting Donald Trump, doing so as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact I think he's a terrible human being.  But the choice on the other side is just as bad.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Well --  </p><p>PACE:  Here we are.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Do you think that creates problems for Mulvaney?  </p><p>PACE:  I think Mulvaney has been really strategic over the last couple of years.  He has found a way to work with the president.  He's been very loyal to the president since he's taken his job as OMB director.  So much so that Trump keeps trying to give him other jobs in addition to chief of staff.  </p><p>I do think that it's interesting that Mulvaney is leaving himself an out by taking on the acting chief of staff role and keeping his job as OMB director, if this doesn't work out for either side, he's got a fallback option within the administration.  But Mulvaney kind of falls into a category like a Lindsey Graham, who was also critical of the president during the campaign, even after he became the nominee but has found a way to work with him in office.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Brit, after Nick Ayers turned the president down, the vice president's chief of staff, and then Chris Christie turned the president down, he almost had to name somebody, didn't he?  This was getting a little embarrassing.  </p><p>HUME:  He was like the guy who couldn't get a date for the prom and he finally got Mulvaney, who was already on board to join in.  But Mulvaney is a good choice.  He's a very able guy, seasoned and experience, knows the issues, knows the policies, knows the government.  So -- </p><p>WALLACE:  I'll say something else, he is a happy warrior.  He's a guy who -- he's a positive guy.  He is also a guy who might come on Sunday talk shows, which John Kelly treated us like the plague.  </p><p>HUME:  He wasn't interested.  </p><p>I would add this.  There's some talk that Trump doesn't need to chief of staff, he should be his own, that is really nonsense because Trump needs help from people who really know this town, know its ways, know the details, know the issues, and he has been at important time, willing to accept advice from those people to his benefit.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right, panel, we have to take a break here.  But stay right here.  </p><p>When we come back, as new evidence implicates the president, what are the chances Democrats will move pursuing impeachment?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Coming up, the president sounds off on the Mueller investigation, as his former fixer is sentenced to prison. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Nobody, except for me, would be looked at like this. Nobody. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We'll get our Sunday panel's read on how serious the president's legal troubles really are, next on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What he did was all unrelated to me except for the two campaign finance charges that are not criminal and shouldn't have been on there. They put that on to embarrass me. They put those two charges on to embarrass me. </p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: I told the truth. I took responsibility for my actions. And instead of him taking responsibility for his actions, what does he do? He attacks my family. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: President Trump and his former fixer, Michael Cohen, taking shots at each other after Cohen received a three-year prison sentence for a number of crimes, including making hush money payments during the 2016 campaign.</p><p>And we're back now with the panel. </p><p>Julie, there are reports, and we hear these from time to time, the president is more and more consumed by the special counsel investigation, especially as former allies like Michael Cohen and the publisher of \"The National Enquirer\" are providing evidence against him. </p><p>What do you hear your sources? </p><p>JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": So I think it is indisputable that the president is consumed by these investigations. You really don't need any secret sources on this. You just need to look at his -- at his Twitter feed. He is following the twists and turns of this extremely closely. And as people who are close to him get caught up in this, he gets more agitated. And I think now we are seeing that almost every aspect of his life, over the last several years, is now under some level of investigation. His administration, his campaign, the inauguration, and his businesses. </p><p>And the business piece of this is, I think, the one that is getting to the president the most because, yes, being president is part of his identity, but actually being this successful businessman is almost more important to him in some ways. It's how he has defined himself for decades. And it's his children's legacy. They are at the top of this -- at this business. And any sign that his business could crumble, that past business dealings could be swept up in this investigation, is incredibly personal to him. </p><p>WALLACE: Marc.</p><p>MARC SHORT, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR: I agree 100 percent with Julie. I think that what's unfortunate here is that you have what begins as a special prosecutor focus on collusion in Russia. And as Julie just said, it's about every part of his life. We end up saying, instead of investigating a crime, we're investigating a person. And Republicans and civil libertarians used to oppose that motion after Iran Contra. Then they fell in love with it during the Whitewater years because they said it was a land deal but it became something about an affair with an intern. </p><p>And it's a problem. It's a problem where we have prosecutors going all over. And I think -- </p><p>WALLACE: But how about -- how about the argument that is made, gee, we didn't hear Republicans complain about it when it happened to Bill Clinton? </p><p>SHORT: I agree 100 percent. I'm saying -- I'm saying Republicans as well have been hypocritical on this. There used to be a group of strong, civil libertarians who would recognize the problem of special prosecutors. And -- probably this is now the -- what's been born of that fruit. </p><p>WALLACE: All right, so far the only alleged crime that the president is specifically linked to is not collusion, is not obstruction of justice, it involves campaign finance violations, alleged campaign finance violations. </p><p>Here is how Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler, the incoming chair of the House Judiciary Committee, responded to that this week. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JERRY NADLER (D-NY), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, RANKING MEMBER: Well, they would be impeachable offenses. Whether they are important enough to justify an impeachment is a different question. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Brit, how persuaded are you that if President Trump directed these payments, these hush money payments, as Michael Cohen says he did, that it was a campaign finance violation on his part, a criminal violation? And, two, what do you think of the likelihood that the House and the wisdom of the House proceeding to impeachment on campaign finance violation? </p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it's a little hard to imagine a president being impeached for a campaign finance violation. Most of these violations are handled as civil matters and result in fines. And they are, you know, widespread, rampant. Obama had a -- the Obama campaign had to pay a big fine.</p><p>I don't -- I just don't think the House of Representatives, even such ardent Democrats as Jerry Nadler, will go there. The greater worry is that some other charge comes out when Mueller finally gets his ore in with his report and says whatever he says. And that, I think, Chris, raises an intriguing question, which is this, how far will these House investigations go if Mueller doesn't find something very serious about the president? My thought is, it probably takes the wind out of their sails, but we'll have to wait and see. But, on balance, I don't think campaign finance is going to dislodge him. </p><p>WALLACE: When you look at all of this and, you know, as we say, there is still no hard evidence of collusion, no hard evidence of obstruction of justice, but the wall do seem to be moving in on the president on a lot of fronts. </p><p>HUME: Well, I don't think the Mueller report is likely to be -- to sing the president's praises. But that's not what he needs. What he needs is kind of an -- of a -- of a report that says, you know does not outline some major crime. And if that happens, I mean I think it changes the atmosphere dramatically, both legally and politically, because I think it's -- and if he is vindicated on no collusion, which is what he's been saying, I don't think the -- I've never thought that collusion was the central point of this investigation. </p><p>Remember, when it started, Chris, it was a counterintelligence investigation with the FBI acting as an intelligence agency to determine what Russia actually did. And if you go back and look at the letter authorizing Mueller's appointment, it says -- it mentions that it picks up that investigation and then says, he's also authorized to find out if there was collaboration between the two. That was always a subset of the overall investigation. And if it turns out to be a subset with no crime alleged in the final report, I think it's a huge boost for the president. </p><p>WALLACE: Juan.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think the Democratic base is so inflamed by Trump, by his behavior overall, I think they -- they would think that Democrats weren't, in fact, holding up to their constitutional responsivities if they did not consider impeachment. So you get the --</p><p>WALLACE: Even on campaign finance violations? </p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, what we -- what did we learn this week? He wants to say it's just Michael Cohen making these outrageous claims because Cohen wants a better deal from the prosecutors. But, in fat, we hear from David Packer at \"National Enquirer,\" same thing happened. We hear from \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the president was in the room. So if -- potentially he would be an unindicted coconspirator while his president because nobody thinks you can indict the president. But that doesn't mean that you can't go to the Congress and say, let's look at this and see -- </p><p>WALLACE: Do you really think that would be wise for Democrats to do? And this -- this is speculative.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, that's a separate issue. That's a separate issue. </p><p>WALLACE: OK. Well, that's my question, though.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK. Well, if the question was --</p><p>WALLACE: Would it be wise for them to do it if that's all that there is? </p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think that's -- no. And I think that what you're going to see, and you already see this from, by the way, Jerry Nadler, but also from Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, as the say, they're not interested right now. But the base of the party, is what I was trying to say to you, Chris, is going to be putting pressure there because they think that, in fact, Democrats had been too docile in dealing with Trump and they want -- they want them to come and have the --</p><p>WALLACE: They want blood?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, because, guess what, you've saw a blue wave, 40 seats switch hands, and the number -- you know, health care was clearly important. But also a check on Trump was very important to voters. </p><p>WALLACE: And every indication is -- everybody keeps saying this investigation is going to be over the end of the year. </p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't see it. </p><p>WALLACE: I always say, pick the over, right? </p><p>PACE: Right. We -- we don't know what else Mueller has. I think this could go well into next year and really line up with some of these congressional investigation. </p><p>WALLACE: Thank you, panel. </p><p>Up next we sit down with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, head of the Gates Foundation. In the era of America first, he worries about a shrinking U.S. role in dealing with global poverty and public health.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the world's largest private charitable fund, giving $46 billion in grants since its founding in 2000 and literally saving millions of lives. The Microsoft co-founder came to Washington this week to make the case for American leadership and the need for foreign aid in the era of America first. When we sat down at the Chamber of Commerce, that's where we began. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL GATES, MICROSOFT CO-FOUNDER AND PHILANTHROPIST: There was a recommendation by the executive branch to make fairly substantial cuts U.S. aid budget. And, fortunately, the Congress took that proposal, which would have meant cutting people off from those HIV medicines, and they decided to maintain the foreign aid levels. </p><p>WALLACE: Your wife Melinda recently talked about -- and I want to quote her directly -- how incredibly disappointing it is to see U.S. leadership deteriorating and the view of the U.S. deteriorating because of some of the egregious things that have been said by this current administration. What's she talking about? </p><p>GATES: I hope I know. The -- I think the particular episode there was talking about Africa and the conditions in Africa in a -- not in a positive way. Sort of characterizing the entire continent. But, in any case --</p><p>WALLACE: Your talk about the blank countries? </p><p>GATES: Exactly. In the U.S. engagement in Africa and around the world, there are many reasons we should maintain that. Just a pure security point of view alone would justify this level of expenditure. </p><p>Now, for many people, the humanitarian part of it is also there and that part is dramatic. And so it is disappointing when it feels like the U.S. is being short-term and the U.S. is only thinking about its interest in a very narrow way and not being the leader that says, now, we -- you know, we are going to help these countries get so that they can -- can take care of themselves. </p><p>WALLACE: The president's mantra is America first. You seem to be suggesting that in terms of America's interests you've got to look a long way beyond America first. </p><p>GATES: Well, I think that the broad definition of our interests, including investing in allies and not viewing every transaction as one that we have to maximize our benefit, taking, you know, world institutions and have them just focus on the United States. What we did, in terms of the post-World War II institutions has been a fantastic thing. That included having a common view of the future with our western allies. </p><p>If you really follow that line of thinking, the idea of helping Africa, of working on an HIV vaccine to stop the AIDS crisis, you just wouldn't do it. And -- and yet I feel, even in that narrow framework of, OK, I only care about what -- how U.S. citizens do, even in that framework, these institutions, these alliances, these investments in innovation are overwhelmingly smart things to do. </p><p>WALLACE: Since the year 2000, a billion people have lifted themselves from what you define as extreme poverty. And you say that the first wave was in China and the second wave was in India. Before we get to places where the wave hasn't hit yet, what happened in those places? </p><p>GATES: One of the first things you want to do in these countries is raise agricultural productivity. All of the Asian miracles, even going back to Taiwan and Japan, South Korea, involved more than tripling agricultural output per person so you could free up that labor and move it into the cities. And if you had the right infrastructure, educational investment, then you've got a manufacturing sector of the economy and slowly but surely you'd get a very large middle class. </p><p>WALLACE: You talk about the successes, the waves in China and India, and then there's Africa. You say that by 2050, 86 percent -- 86 percent of the extremely poor people in the world will live in Africa and, in fact, 40 percent will live in just two countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria. </p><p>What's holding them back? </p><p>GATES: They're starting at very low levels of infrastructure, very low level of property. And one of the things that drives those numbers you mentioned is the very high population growth. And so they account for double the portions of births you'd expect. By the end of the century, the majority of births in the world will take place in Africa. </p><p>Africa has to demand our attention. That's where extreme poverty is still tough. That's where stability is difficult to achieve. And, you know, we've got to go after things like these neglected diseases, malaria. We've got to help them with infrastructure. It's really, in terms of our humanity of helping the poorest, Africa's where we'll be most tested. </p><p>WALLACE: How do you even begin to address these concentrations of misery? </p><p>GATES: Well, one of the great achievements in development history was what was called the green revolution where new varieties of the cereal (ph) crops, corn, which everyone else calls maize, rice and wheat. In a period where people thought India would experience mass starvation because the agricultural output went up, they were actually able to improve the nutrition even when their population was growing. We need to do that same thing for Africa. </p><p>WALLACE: It seems that climate change could be the accelerant to all of the bad things in terms of agricultural productivity, global health, instability, extreme poverty. Talk about that. </p><p>GATES: Yes. For a country like the U.S., that's northern, you know, climate change will change things. We'll have more hot days, more forest fires. But it's not a threat to our survival. </p><p>In Africa, where you are completely dependent on the rain coming, whereas there been in the past about one out of 12 years you'll have a failed harvest, the prediction is that we be closer to one out of four years because of the higher temperature and the -- the -- unfortunately, with climate change, you -- not only is it hotter, but the rain comes all at once, or it doesn't come for long periods of time. So if you want to say, where are you going to get millions of deaths because of climate change between now and the end of the century, you don't look to the United States. Yes, you'll have some forest fires and there will be some deaths. But the -- the significant numbers are in these very, very poor countries because of the subsistence farming. </p><p>WALLACE: What do you say to those who say it's not climate change, it's weather, and that the -- the man -- the human component is questionable? </p><p>GATES: That's impressive if somebody can say that out loud. The --the amount of --</p><p>WALLACE: Have you been -- have you been to Washington? </p><p>GATES: The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is a super measurable thing. It's important not to over claim what we know because that undermines the whole discussion., But the general warming and the mechanism of that warming has to do with CO2 and methane emissions. That's -- that's really not a question. </p><p>WALLACE: I want to talk to you about toilets. Since 2011, the Gates Foundation has launched to reinvent the toilet challenge. Explain, one, why that's so important, and, two, again, dealing with the specifics, what have been some of your successes and failures along the way? </p><p>GATES: In many of these poor countries, the capital cost of building that sewer, it's just never going to happen. And so the solution would be to, instead of using that sewer, to have something in the toilet itself, which is essentially the processing facility. We have ten different universities whose designs we funded. So we put in several hundred million dollars. And now we've gotten it to the point where we have a lot of commercial companies who say, OK, that approach looks promising. </p><p>Now, the price of this toilet, that does the processing, is still ten times more expensive. It's about, you know, $10,000 per toilet right now. We need to get it into these tough parts, the slums of these African cities. We need it to be more like a thousand dollars. </p><p>WALLACE: I want to ask about your -- your old job. There's something of a backlash here in Washington against big tech. The growing feeling in Washington is that big tech does not do enough to protect users' privacy and that it shows political bias. Do you see merit in either of those arguments? </p><p>GATES: I went through an episode in the late '90s where Microsoft was subject to government investigation. </p><p>WALLACE: We remember. </p><p>GATES: And so in a way this is -- in a small way now it's less Microsoft now, but it's broad. </p><p>Yes, the government should be talking to these companies about what they do. There's nothing inappropriate. </p><p>I was naive. I didn't have an office in Washington, D.C. I thought that was a good thing and I even bragged about it. I later came to regret that. </p><p>So these -- I'm sure these guys are learning better than I did that they need to come back here and start a dialogue. And there will be new types of regulations for these companies. </p><p>WALLACE: And you don't have a problem with that? I mean you think that's appropriate?</p><p>GATES: Well, the notion that there will be privacy regulations, that makes a lot of sense. The notion that this ability to identify anyone that were going to think about how do businesses get to use that and how does the government use that, it makes a lot of sense. </p><p>WALLACE: Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are right now jockeying for which is going to be the most highly valued company in the world in terms of market capitalization. At the close of the market on Friday, Microsoft was number one at over $800 billion, Apple, $799.5 billion. Does that give you any pleasure? </p><p>GATES: You know, when I was starting Microsoft in my 20s, the idea that we could create a company that was -- you know, would beat IBM, you know, because they were the big monolith and, you know, we understood software and they didn't. And we believed in these cute, small machines to empower individuals and they believed in these big machines. It was kind of mythic that we were going to beat IBM.</p><p>By the time Microsoft valuation passed IBM, which is now, you know, 15 years ago, it didn't feel like that big of a victory. And so you really -- it's really better to define yourself by an aspiration. You know, can software improve education? Can software help, you know, medical care costs in the U.S. just keep going up dramatically? Can software play a role there?.</p><p>So, yes, I'm very proud of Microsoft and the vision that software and technology would make a big thing. You know, it's led to the most valuable, the five most valuable companies being these tech companies. So I do think it's an vindication (ph) of the importance of technology, which now is coming with a lot of responsibilities as well. </p><p>WALLACE: Bill, it's an honor to talk to you again. </p><p>GATES: Thank you. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: And if you want to learn more about the remarkable work Bill and Melinda Gates are doing, you can find their link at foxnewssunday.com. </p><p>Up next, a final word. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Stay tuned to this station and Fox News Channel for the latest on a potential end of year government shutdown. </p><p>And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDNEW-582732</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FEDNEW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V06-B751-JBSW-74YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8920\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Federal News Service, Inc.

Kavanaugh faces days of tough questioning from a Senate Judiciary Committee.  In a moment, we'll speak with two leading members of that panel.  </p><p>But first, the nations long goodbye to Senator John McCain.  McCain will be laid to rest today in a private ceremony at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, which meant so much to him.  </p><p>FOX News correspondent Peter Doocy reports on a very public farewell yesterday in Washington.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Lawmakers, loved ones and diplomats gathered Saturday for a final goodbye to Senator John McCain.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The world will be lonelier without John McCain.  </p><p>DOOCY:  One of McCain's best friends, former Senator Joe Lieberman, told mourners about the time McCain asked him to join the GOP ticket even though he was a registered Democrat.  </p><p>JOHN LIEBERMAN, MCCAIN'S BEST FRIEND:  John's response was direct and really ennobling.  That's the point, Joe, he said with a certain impatience.  You are a Democrat, I'm a Republican.  We could give our country the bipartisan leadership it needs for a change.  </p><p>DOOCY:  McCain's former political rivals spoke on his behalf too.  </p><p>BUSH:  In recent years, we sometimes talk about that intense period like football players remembering a big game.  In the process, rivalry melted away.  </p><p>OBAMA:  So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty.  John called on us to be bigger than that.  </p><p>DOOCY:  McCain's daughter Meghan broke from her tear-filled tribute to more sharply criticize the current president who wasn't invited.  </p><p>MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SEN. MCCAIN:  America has no need to be made great again because America was always great.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE:  And joining me now here in Washington, John McCain's good friend, Senator Lindsey Graham.  </p><p>Welcome again to \"FOX News Sunday.\" </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>WALLACE:  You are speaking today at the private ceremony at the U.S. naval academy.  Your tribute, first of all, how are you doing, and secondly, what are you going to say?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, I'm doing OK.  These things help.  Thank you to everybody who has called and asked me how I'm doing.  Cindy and everyone else around the family has helped me, as much I helped them, probably more so.  </p><p>I'm going to say that nobody loved a soldier more than John McCain, that I bear witness to his commitment to have their back, travel where they go, never let them be forgotten.  The public may be tired of this war called the war on terrorism, but John McCain never was.  And he had their back and he gave them what they need to win a fight we can't afford to lose.  And he was willing to lose a political race, but not a war.  So, I'm going to talk about all my travels with the troops and how much they love John McCain.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I have to ask you about the passionate, heartfelt but sometimes angry tribute by Meghan McCain who took some pretty clear shots at President Trump.  Here's a clip.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN:  We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness.  The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Was that appropriate?  Was it fair?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  If you say something bad about Meghan's father, you will know it, she didn't like it.  So, it's OK, she is grieving.  </p><p>All I can say is there's a lesson to be learned this week about John McCain.  Number one, Americans appreciate military service.  If we've learned nothing this week you know the fact that John served our country in extraordinary circumstances.  It was appreciated by everybody.  </p><p>What else do we know?  If you work hard and do your homework and know what you're talking about, people will listen to you.  That if you pick big causes bigger than yourself, you'll be remembered.  </p><p>He tried to drain the swamp before it was cool, that you can fight hard and still be respected.  If you forgive, people appreciate it, and if you admit to mistakes, you look good as a stronger man.  That's the formula, John McCain.  This was a civics lesson for anybody who wanted to listen.  Why do remember this man, because of the way he conducted his public life.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Do you think there's a lesson there for President Trump?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  There's a lesson here for everybody, including President Trump.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Those who admit it are seen by the public as bigger, not smaller.  Know what you're talking about, fight hard, forgive, and have passion, strength and kindness are not mutually exclusive.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's turn to your day job and this week, you're going to be spending a lot of time as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh -- </p><p>GRAHAM:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- to be confirmed to the Supreme Court.  </p><p>First of all, does he have the votes to win confirmation of the court?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  If he does well at the hearing he will get, my belief is 55 or higher.  If he does well enough, I'm sure he will do well.  </p><p>WALLACE:  When you say 55, you've got to have 51 Republicans, with the appointment of McCain's replacement.  So, you are saying as many as four Democrats?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, that's 55.  Last time I checked --  </p><p>WALLACE:  So, that's what you think.</p><p>GRAHAM:  Yes.  I'm not good at math, but yes, I think there are a handful of Democrats will vote for Judge Kavanaugh if he does well and maybe even more.  A lot of people should vote for Judge Kavanaugh.  If you are looking to a Republican president to pick a qualified conservative, he would be on the top of anyone's list including not just Donald Trump.  </p><p>He's the one person I think every Republican president would see is the most qualified of their generation.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Democrats say that the confirmation should be delayed until we know whether or not there's going to be either a criminal prosecution of President Trump or impeachment proceedings against President Trump.  </p><p>Here is Senator Dick Durbin, who was going to be on the program next.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  We should be withholding this decision on the Supreme Court nominee until the air is cleared and we know exactly where we stand when it comes to this president and (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Given that his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, says that candidate Trump in 2016 directed him to commit a crime, does the senator have a point?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, it wasn't the point he had when Clinton was under investigation, we approved Justice Breyer.  So, my Democratic friends did not have this view when Clinton was president.  </p><p>WALLACE:  We should point, I'm going to bring it up with Senator Durbin.  1994, Clinton is under investigation by the independent counsel in Whitewater and he was nominated.  </p><p>GRAHAM:  I think --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Stephen Breyer was confirmed to the court.  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Senator Grassley has been very fair.  More documents than the person ever nominated to the Supreme Court.  We're going to have a hearing and there's no drama in this hearing.  The only drama is those running for president, how will they handle this hearing on the Democratic side?  You know, we're going to get this good man confirmed.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let me ask you, though, about this question of criminal liability.  I want to look at some Kavanaugh's statements on that issue.  Let's put them up.  In 1999, Kavanaugh said the Nixon ruling, that President Nixon had to turn over all of the White House Watergate tapes may have been, quote, wrongly decided.  In 2009, Kavanaugh wrote: criminal investigations take the president's focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people.  </p><p>Is there a legitimate concern that Justice Kavanaugh, if you were faced with a case on the Supreme Court, would side with the president against either Congress or the court?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, what I think you'll find is somebody that has had 308 decisions.  So, you can get a pretty good idea of what he thinks based on his time on the court of appeals but the bottom line here is that most people are unsure as to whether or not a president can be indicted, a sitting president.  </p><p>Impeachment is a process to remove a president, their criminal liability aspects are very much in debate.  I think he's going to be mainstream in his thinking.  He's going to look at both sides of the issue and decide appropriately.  </p><p>WALLACE:  One issue that pro-choice senators of both sides have pressed Kavanaugh on in their meetings with him on Capitol Hill is abortion.  And Kavanaugh reportedly told them that Roe v. Wade is, quote, \"settled law\".  Is that a firm commitment in your regard, in your view, to not overturn Roe?  And if it is a firm commitment, how can you as a pro-life senator support him?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  I wouldn't vote for anybody that says that every decision the Supreme Court cannot be revisited.  They revisit through a process.  There's a process of overturning long precedent.  There's a four-part test you have to apply.  </p><p>From my point of view, what he will do is when that case comes, if it ever does, you just don't wake up one day and say, hey, I'd like to overturn Roe v. Wade.  If there's a conflict that makes it to the Supreme Court, he will apply the test of precedent to that decision, Roe v. Wade, and every other precedent.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But to make it clear, you're saying you don't view his statement, for instance, to Senator Collins, a pro-choice Republican, that it settled law means that therefore it can't be re-examined and conceivably overturn?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  He would be disqualified, in my opinion, if you would not listen to both sides of the story and decide accordingly.  This idea that Roe v. Wade is going to be challenged at state level, there are all kinds of laws out there.  Some may work their way up to Supreme Court.  He will give great deference I'm sure to Roe v. Wade.  But it can be overturned like every other decision but that will be up to the facts on the record.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Graham, thank you, thanks for your time on on the tough weekend.  Our deepest sympathies in a loss of a dear friend, sir.</p><p>GRAHAM:  Thank you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Joining me now from Illinois, another member of the committee that will be questioning Judge Kavanaugh, Dick Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat.  </p><p>Senator, Democrats have tried a variety of efforts to upend and derail the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh.  I want to put some of them up.  </p><p>The argument that there is a midterm election.  The argument that President Trump is under investigation.  If you want to see millions of pages of documents from when he was staff secretary for President George W. Bush, and the White House has no invoked executive privilege to withhold 100,000 pages from when he worked for the White House counsel.  </p><p>I think it's fair to say that none of that has worked and the question is, why is it the Democrats have so far been unable to gain any traction against Judge Kavanaugh, and in the public debate, you don't seem to have laid a glove on him?</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Let me say at the outset before we get into that and I will address it -- I joined with Lindsey Graham, every word he said John McCain John McCain.  I respect John McCain so much and yesterday was a great display of the respect so many people across this country had for this great American.  I was lucky enough to be with Lindsey and John involved in some very important negotiations for more than a year on comprehensive immigration reform.  So I back up every word.  </p><p>So let me start with Brett Kavanaugh in this way.  He is the most unpopular Supreme Court nominee in the last 40 years.  How did he reach that point so quickly?  Well, I think there were a number of reasons for it.  </p><p>You look at first and foremost is the fact that this president said I'm not going to put a man on the Supreme Court unless he is going to overturn Roe versus Wade and the Affordable Care Act.  The president is never at a loss for words and he was very explicit in terms of what he wanted in a Supreme Court nominee.  Those positions may be popular with his Republican base.  They're not popular with the American people.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait, wait -- </p><p>GRAHAM:  An issue that you have raised --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait.  I mean, he said he was going to appoint pro-life judges.  He never said that he asked him or on a litmus test about that.  And also, I have to say, I'm a little surprised that you are saying he's the most unpopular.  When did we nominate and confirm Supreme Court justices based on public opinion polls?  </p><p>DURBIN:  Well, we shouldn't be.  But you started off with the premise you've never laid a glove on him.  The fact of the matter is the American people have gone through this nomination and come to the conclusion that he's not the right person for the job.  </p><p>Let me go a little bit further here.  He comes before us at a time when people are concerned about whether this president or any president is above the law.  Think about his role, Kavanaugh's role, when it came to Judge Ken Starr going after President Clinton.  He was the aggressive prosecutor in that respect and a few years later after working in the Bush White House said that completely reversed my position.  A president should not be subject to the subject of prosecution while he's in office.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Can I -- can I let me just ask you about that because as Lindsey Graham brought up, and I was going to ask you anyway, in 1994, Bill Clinton was under investigation by an independent counsel on Whitewater and he nominated and the Senate confirmed Stephen Breyer and that was also in a midterm election year.  That relate directly contradicts two of the arguments that you're making against Kavanaugh.  </p><p>DURBIN:  Let me just say that I was not a member of the Senate when Justice Breyer came before that body, but it will tell you at the time the investigation was underway, there was no suspicion at that moment that Clinton was going to brush it aside and say, you have no authority to even question me.  It went forward.  He was subpoenaed, he was deposed, he was tried in the House -- and I should say indicted under the impeachment clause and tried in the Senate.  I was at the Senate at the time.</p><p>And now, we have a different situation completely.  There is a serious question as to whether this president, given the opportunity, will end the Mueller investigation, something which most Republicans and the overwhelming majority of Americans say would be a serious mistake and we ask, of course, Judge Kavanaugh, what do you think, and he says it's hands off when it comes to a president during his term in office.  </p><p>I think that's a mistake and it's one of the major reasons people had misgivings about his nomination.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's look at some specific issues.  As I pointed out, Kavanaugh has told some pro-choice senators that he views Roe as settled law, he was asked about Obamacare, there's a Texas case that would try to take it all down because of the fact that the individual mandate has been repealed.  He said that he was very skeptical of that.  </p><p>Obviously, these aren't confirmed commitments.  You wouldn't expect that from any judge.  </p><p>Isn't it the real problem that this is a conservative judge, Donald Trump went to the country and promised to nominate conservative judges, originalists who would -- who would interpret the Constitution as written, it hasn't healed well within the mainstream, yes conservative, but within the judicial mainstream?  </p><p>DURBIN:  Well, you overlook one of the most important elements of his nomination, and that is the fact that there has been more concealment of documents concerning his public service and his position on issues than ever in the history of the United States.  </p><p>WALLACE:  He's given you half a million documents, sir.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DURBIN:  Let me just make my point here, Chris.  The assertion of executive privilege by the White House to take 100,000 documents and say the American people will not get a chance to see them as they reflect on Kavanaugh's background is the first time in history.  This denial of access to documents violates a role that we thought was a tradition of the Senate under Senator Sessions and Senator Leahy, time and again when it came to Obama nominees.  </p><p>They are suppressing these documents.  If we are lucky we will see 6 percent, 6 percent, of all of the documents that have been produced -- that could be produced to reflect on Kavanaugh's true position on issues.  He saying and the White House saying the American people have no right to know.  </p><p>So, if he so proud of his conservative credentials show us the record, stand before us, trust the American people and they will trust you.  I would say that to Judge Kavanaugh.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I -- and you will have the opportunity to do that starting on Tuesday.  Let me just say as a point of saying goodbye, they have turned over half a million documents and the issue, part of it is about 3 million documents when he was staff secretary and every document that went to the president went to his desk.  </p><p>But, Senator Durbin, thank you.  Thanks for joining us.  We look forward to your questioning of Judge Kavanaugh starting this week.  </p><p>DURBIN:  Thanks, Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Always good to talk with you, sir.  </p><p>Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what to expect from this week's showdown between the president's Supreme Court pick and Senate Democrats.  </p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about how Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation would change the Supreme Court?  Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We need to elect senators who will vote for judges to follow our laws and our Constitution as written.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST:  President Trump on the campaign trail this week making the case for his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court and it's time now for our Sunday group.  </p><p>Former press secretary for Vice President Pence, Marc Lotter, Charles Lane of \"The Washington Post\", former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards, and \"Washington Post\" columnist and former White House speechwriter Marc Thiessen.  </p><p>Chuck, when Justice Kennedy, the swing vote on the court, stepped down and there was talk about replacing him, we heard all this talk about a fierce battle for the future of the court and I want to ask you the same question that I asked Senator Durbin, why hasn't it happen?  The Democrats don't seem to have gained much traction against Brett Kavanaugh so far.  </p><p>CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST:  I think there's a lot of reasons, starting with the fact that it's just possible Republicans care a little bit more about this than actually Democrats do.  I did a little checking and Democrats were a little bit less likely than Republicans to vote in 2016 based on the future of the Supreme Court.  So, there's a little bit of a surprising passion gap there.  </p><p>Secondly, I think it's the very simple fact that this is about 51 votes and the Republicans have 51 votes, and that means two things, one, Mitch McConnell can control the pace of this thing, control the calendar and so forth.  And secondly, it means the Democrats are just struggling to get over that work and they are divided.  Not divided down the middle, but they are divided between the main block of the party and several people who have to run for reelection in red states.  </p><p>That's created a very difficult problem in messaging for them and so they are left dealing not with the substance of the Kavanaugh thing but procedural issues like document disclosure, arcane matters, very important but very arcane about executive privilege and the net effect is they have yet to identify some hot button things that can get the public excited against Judge Kavanaugh.  </p><p>WALLACE:  We ask you for questions for the panel and we got this on Twitter from Waris Waldo, which after I read it several times realize some persons interpretation of where is Waldo.  </p><p>When did adhering to the United States Constitution became radical and threatening?</p><p>Marc Lotter, how do you answer that?  </p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER PENCE PRESS SECRETARY:  Well, I think that's the basis of this argument.  And we have -- and Judge Kavanaugh and in Justice Gorsuch -- we have someone who adheres to the Constitution and many on the liberal side prefer to appoint justices who interpret the law to mean things other than what it says.  That's the heart of the argument.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I want to turn to the nation's farewell to John McCain which has been the big story this week and his daughter Meghan's tribute to him at the National Cathedral yesterday, which still has a lot of people talking.  Here's part of that.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN:  The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Marc Thiessen, it's her dad.</p><p>MARC THIESSEN, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE SPEECHWRITER:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  She obviously feels passionately about the fact that she thinks that President Trump didn't treat her dad well and he didn't, what did you think of her remarks?  </p><p>THIESSEN:  Well, first of all, just watching her this week has been heartbreaking because her grief has been palpable and so was her anger palpable yesterday and with good reason because Donald Trump treated her father disgracefully.  </p><p>If you want to put this in perspective, there have been 1,974 United States senators since the founding of the republic.  John McCain is only the sixth senator to lie in state who wasn't either a vice president or president.  So, this is a tremendous testament and there are only 31 people in American history who had laid in state.  </p><p>This may very well be the first time that the sitting president of the United States has not participated in honoring that person, and that as a result of his disgraceful behavior towards him.  He was even criticizing John McCain by name a few weeks ago on the campaign trail to suggest that he wasn't a war hero and never apologized for that.  </p><p>This is one of the reasons, Chris, why I think Donald Trump, despite a booming economy, his disapproval has reached now 60 percent in the country.  It's not because people don't like his policies, because his policies are obviously improving the lives of people, the economy is booming and on employment is low.  But his inability to be presidential and to rise to the occasion at a moment like this, put aside his petty grievances against John McCain, I think that's one of the reasons why his popularity doesn't match his success as president.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Congresswoman Edwards, I promise I'm going to bring one but Marc Lotter is out someone often defends this president.  Your reaction?  </p><p>LOTTER:  Well, I think it takes two to tango.  And I think John McCain and Senator McCain has made a very good career out of attacking presidents when he disagreed on both sides of the aisle.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But in fairness, he somehow had a good enough relationship with George W. Bush and Barack Obama that they spoke at his funeral.  </p><p>LOTTER:  And he did.  This is one that continued on this week.  And I think once we get past this, we will remember John McCain for all of his great service.  The president is going to continue to go on and is going to do many things that John McCain supported like supporting our troops, investing in our military and we'll let their -- we'll let their disagreement I guess go on in history.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Congresswoman Edwards, your reaction to Meghan McCain's remarks and when you take in addition, because it wasn't just McCain, it was Joe Biden and it was Barack Obama, and it was George W. Bush, the last Republican president before Trump.  Was this week a rebuke of President Trump?  </p><p>DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD):  Well, I think that Meghan McCain's remarks and all of the remarks of the various speakers were John McCain speaking.  His hand was clearly evident in those remarks and particularly Meghan's remarks and I think that there were spot on for where we are in this nation.  </p><p>You know, I come from a military family too and I think for the president of the United States not to have honored and recognized Senator McCain's service, irrespective of policy disagreement I think was disgraceful and I think the nation stood up and said that it was disgraceful too.  And that all of those speakers indicated that what was valued and Senator McCain in addition to his service in his honor was his commitment to this country and that we had a president of the United States who seemed incapable of even acknowledging that.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  We're going to leave it on that note.  Panel, we will take a break here.  We'll see you a little later.  </p><p>Up next, President Trump threatens to cut Canada out of a new NAFTA deal and forge ahead just with Mexico.  What would that mean for workers in the economy?  </p><p>On this Labor Day weekend, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka joins us next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Coming up, President Trump looks to replace NAFTA as he works on a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And we're going to call it the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement. And we'll get rid of the name NAFTA. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We'll talk with the head of the largest group of unions in the country, Richard Trumka, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Negotiations to hammer out a deal to reshape NAFTA, the three nation trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, will continue this weeks after talks between the White House and Canada stalled amid some bitterness. </p><p>Joining us now to discuss the potential fallout for American workers is the president of the AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka. </p><p>Mr. Trumka, President Trump has negotiated a new NAFTA deal with Mexico, but talks with Canada stalled after some off the record comments that he made were published that he acknowledged that he won't make any concessions to Canada. And here's what he said about that afterwards. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Here's the good news, at least Canada knows where I stand, because we can't have these countries taking advantage of the United States anymore. It's very simple. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Question, can you support a deal that leads Canada out of a new NAFTA and will Congress pass it? </p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, AFL-CIO PRESIDENT: Well, Chris, before I get to that, just let me say, on behalf of the hardworking men and women of this country who wake our country up every day, make her run all day and put it to bed at night, let me wish you a happy Labor Day and all your listeners a happy Labor Day. </p><p>Look, our economies are integrated, the three countries in North America, the economy is pretty emigrated. And it's pretty hard to see how that would work without having Canada in the deal. You said that the Mexican deal is close, but there's still a lot of work to be left -- to be done, even on the Mexican deal, Chris, because the language isn't drafted. We haven't seen whole chapters of the thing. We're anxious to move forward with it and anxious to have all three countries involved, because NAFTA has had a devastating effect on the working people of this country for the last 25 years. So we've been aggressively pursuing an agreement that works for the workers in all three countries and I can say we're not done yet. </p><p>WALLACE: OK, but let's talk about the parts of the deal we do know about that the Trump administration has negotiated with Mexico that it seems to me would be pretty good for workers. Let's put them up on the screen. </p><p>Seventy-five percent of a car's value would have to be manufactured in North America. That's up from 62.5 percent. Forty to forty-five percent of the car must be made by workers in whatever country earning at least $16 an hour. </p><p>Do you support both of those provisions and, frankly, do you think that Mexico would live up to them? For instance, the salary for car workers, because in Mexico right now the salary for a car worker on average is $3 an hour. Do you think they actually are going to boost that to $16 an hour? </p><p>TRUMKA: Well, first of all, those provisions can be very, very good. And you said that the current provision is really 62.5. In actuality, Chris, it's only in the 40s because they -- they do a little cheating saying if you put in 62 percent and China puts in 38 percent, it counts as 100 percent. So it's really lower and the change is really more -- more effective. We haven't seen the details of it yet.</p><p>But you hit the nail right on the head. It doesn't matter what's in that agreement. If we can't monitor it and effect it -- and enforce it effectively, then the agreement will fail for workers and it will fail for the country. So what we're pushing right now, and we're working with Ambassador Lighthizer is, is a way to let us effectively monitor what's going on the ground and then enforce the agreement regardless of who's in the White House, because we've been told for over 25 years, trust us, this agreement will be good for workers. What we need is an agreement that we can enforce no matter who's in the White House. </p><p>WALLACE: Let me --</p><p>TRUMKA: That's what we're looking for. </p><p>WALLACE: Let me step back for a minute and go broader view. </p><p>How does big labor feel about President Trump at this point? I mean the fact is growth is up. Unemployment is down. He's using tariffs to try to break down trade barriers that I know that you hate. So, I mean, what mark do you give Donald Trump on this Labor Day weekend?</p><p>TRUMKA: Well, when he was elected, I said I would call balls and strikes. When he did something that was good for workers, we'd support him. When he did something that was bad for workers, we would oppose him. </p><p>Unfortunately, to date, the things that he's done to hurt workers outpace what he's done to help workers. He hasn't come up with an infrastructure program that could put a lot of us back to work. He overturned a regulation that would actually denied over 5 million people overtime that they would have had. He overturned some health and safety regulations that will hurt us on the job. Enforcement of OSHA and MSHA isn't what it should be. </p><p>So we keep trying to find areas where we can work with him. And where we can, we do. </p><p>WALLACE: Well, but let me ask you -- Mr. Trumka, let me ask you, I mean, 3.9 percent unemployment. 3.5 million jobs created, 4 percent -- 4.2 percent GDP in the last quarter. I mean don't you give him something for that? </p><p>TRUMKA: No, those are good, but wages have been down since the first of the year. Gas prices have been up since the first of the year. So, overall, workers aren't doing as well. He passed the tax bill that encourages companies to outsource. We can't agree to support something like that. He's -- every place we can, Chris, we do. But, unfortunately, right now, the scale is weighted against him because he's done more to hurt workers than to help workers. </p><p>WALLACE: So you have launched a new big political campaign for the midterms. You have an ad out on the web right now. Is it your hope that Democrats would take back control of the House and Senate and block the Trump agenda, even those parts that have been good for workers, like creating 3.5 million new jobs? </p><p>TRUMKA: It's not about Democrats or Republicans. It's about electing people who will support working people in this country. That's what we're looking to do. </p><p>We started a couple of months ago, going door-to-door, member to member with our members saying, what issues are important to you? We put those together. We're going to put them in front of candidates. Those candidates that support the issues that our members say they want, need and should have are the candidates that we'll support. </p><p>It probably will be Democrats because, unfortunately, Democrats support working people more than Republicans have. We'd like to change that. But the reality is, Democrats support working people more than Republicans, although we go candidate by candidate and we support those Republicans that support working people. </p><p>WALLACE: Finally, this week I looked at the presidential exit polls from 2016. Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in union households by just nine points, 51 percent to 42, which interestingly enough is the smallest Democratic advantage since Reagan ran against Mondale in 1984. Question, don't a lot of your members, union members, don't they support Donald Trump? </p><p>TRUMKA: Well, actually, three percentage points more of our members voted for Donald Trump than they did for Mitt Romney. Unfortunately, 10 percent of our members -- 10 percent fewer of our members voted for Hillary Clinton. They didn't believe her on trade. They didn't believe her on a couple of other issues. </p><p>But you talked about households. Union members themselves are a much higher percentage in there. Again, we give them all the facts and I believe in my membership, the rank and file, that when they get the facts, they make the right decision every time. We're giving them the facts on this president and anybody who's running against him and they will ultimately decide which one of those candidates that they want to support. </p><p>WALLACE: Mr. Trumka, thank you. Thanks for sharing part of this Labor Day holiday weekend with us. We'll stay on top of all this, sir. </p><p>TRUMKA: Chris, thanks for having me on. And, again, happy Labor Day. </p><p>WALLACE: When we come back, the Trump administration opens the door to regulating Google. Our Sunday panel returns to discuss the battle with big tech. That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think Canada very much wants to make the deal and I think it's going to be obviously very good for Canada if they do and I think it's probably not going to be good at all if they don't. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: President Trump playing hardball with Canada as he tries to rewrite the quarter century old North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. </p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Well, Congresswoman Edwards, there was a lot of howling, I think it's fair to say, from Democrats when President Trump said that he was going to revamp NAFTA. But aren't there, and it talked about it with Mr. Trumka, aren't there a number of provisions in this agreement with Mexico at least that are good for American workers? </p><p>DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD): Well, I think there are also a lot of Democrats who very much wanted to see a North American Free Trade Agreement that really invests in workers, that makes sure that we have protections across both borders. And I think you heard that from what Mr. Trumka was saying. And I -- you know, I think it --</p><p>WALLACE: But raising -- but raising the wage to $16 an hour? </p><p>EDWARDS: Raising the wages. Exactly.</p><p>WALLACE: Raising the amount that has to be content from North America? </p><p>EDWARDS: Right. And all -- those are -- those are actually things that many of us is Democrats have been calling for, for a long time because, you know, we can have free trade, but if it's not fair on both sides of the border, it really doesn't work. It doesn't keep workers here working and it doesn't make sure that workers in Mexico are being paid what they need. And I don't think you can have a North American Free Trade Agreement without having the other part of North America, which is Canada, in the deal too. </p><p>WALLACE: Let me pick up on that with you, Marc Lotter, because talks with Canada stalled on Friday over it seems to issues, one is continued dairy protections inside Canada and, secondly, the publishing of off the record comments by President Trump where he basically said, I'm not going to offer any concessions at all to Canada. Does this deal go through? And -- and I'm primarily, I guess, I'm talking about Congress, does this deal go through without Canada onboard? </p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER PENCE PRESS SECRETARY: I think it makes it much easier if Canada is on board to get it through Congress. But this is -- this is very tough negotiating with the president and the prime minister and the Canadian officials. The president is very clear, he wants to get this done. He wants Canada to be involved. And it's going to be a question now of, can they make enough concessions to make it fair on both sides? I think they will. </p><p>WALLACE: Let's turn to another big story this week and that is President Trump complaining that Google's search engine, when you put in \"President Trump news,\" it has been calibrated to drown out conservative voices. The president and his team this week complained about that and even talked about regulating Google. </p><p>Here's the president. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've made it clear that we, as a country, cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting and rigged search results. </p><p>We're not going to let them control what we can and cannot see, read, and learn from. We can't do that. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Chuck, first of all, from the best of your knowledge, is there political bias in the Google search? I mean is it calibrated to drown out conservative voices and to push liberal points of view? And, secondly, what do you make of the threat by the president that the government might get involved in regulating Google? </p><p>CHARLES LANE, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Well, the best of my knowledge about Google's algorithms is not very good. </p><p>WALLACE: Well, that's why I asked you. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>LANE: But I -- I would be very surprised if somebody at Google said, let's set up the algorithm to drown out Donald Trump in any specific sense like that. I think these searches work in an incredibly complex ways that for some unconscious or otherwise neutral reason may be turning up what President Trump claims they're turning up. But, of course, it's just his claim. </p><p>But there's a bigger context for this, which is, a lot of stuff going on at Google, like a few months back an employee circulating a memo internally claiming that the company isolates conservatives internally, then he winds up on the outs. There's a movement within Google to decouple Google, so to speak, from defense contracting and so forth. And I think the president's pushing back against those things and he's more generally trying to turn Google into just another part of this big, fake news media that has been his big foil all through his political career. </p><p>You know, there's a lot of suspicion, both on the left and the right, in sort of populist America about these giant technology companies. And I think in that sense, he's just trying to turn them into another one of his scapegoats to show like everything is stacked against us, even the search engine. </p><p>WALLACE: Marc, your thoughts about whether the government should be regulating a company like Google? Are their First Amendment issues there? And if they were (ph) going to regulate Google in terms of its search engine, they can do a number of things just to make life difficult for Google. </p><p>MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No doubt. And I -- look, I think the -- the fact that there -- there is conservative bias in social media. It's not just Google. It's FaceBook. It's Twitter. There's been a lot of accusations. They probably -- the only place where there's more anti-conservative bias than the legacy media is Silicon Valley. So, you know, and the fact is, a lot of people getting their news from Silicon Valley in a ways that they weren't a few years ago. But -- and so Trump is raising a valid point. </p><p>Where he loses me is when he says that he wants the government to start regulating it, because I -- the only institution I trust less than Google to regulate my -- my search is the federal government. So I think what we need is for people to be more proactive in terms of where they get their news and how they -- they consume their news. </p><p>One of the -- the -- the avenue of social media has given conservatives an incredible voice that they didn't have before because they didn't have to go through \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times.\" So they have a voice that they never had before. But we're also in these ideological silos were conservatives only read conservative news sources. Liberals only read -- Washington (ph) read liberal news sources. And I think we all need to do a better job of policing ourselves and getting out of our silos and listening to the other side because that's how we get over the division in the country.</p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, I want to pick up on the last point that Chuck made, and that is, isn't there a legitimate concern -- and on this populist issue about companies, whether it's Google or FaceBook or Twitter or Amazon, these huge companies that have so much power and so much money and so much influence? </p><p>EDWARDS: Well, I mean, but the concern, I think, is really misplaced because if you look at these entities, every time there, you know, is this sort of massive growth in this industry, something else starts up that becomes the next new thing. And we remember when Twitter was the next new thing and Instagram the next new thing. And so I think that the dynamism that's in the industry allows that to, you know, to create an environment where, you know, you can have a lot of different kinds of voices in there. And I think if anything is getting in the way of it in terms of the government, I think it's saying, you know, this -- these decisions around net neutrality because then that makes it even more difficult for conservative or even, you know, far left views to get into the mainstream if you're put on this secondary highway. </p><p>So -- but the idea that the government should have the -- the -- the ability to figure out what the search engine is, I don't think so. I mean most of the people I know in Congress can't even operate their Twitter handle. </p><p>WALLACE: I am remaining silent in this conversation. I'm -- I'm a luddite, which go to Google and look up what it means. </p><p>Thank you panel. See you next Sunday. </p><p>Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week,\" Dolly Parton on why kids around the world call her \"the book lady.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Most of us know her as a legendary singer and songwriter, but as we told you back in March, for millions of kids, she's the one who help them start reading early. </p><p>Here is our \"Power Player of the Week.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOLLY PARTON, FOUNDER, IMAGINATION LIBRARY: I just always thought there was magic in books because it takes you to other places. Anywhere you want to go, you can find it in a book. </p><p>It says Dolly Parton, that's my name. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): The Library of Congress is not the first place you'd expect to see Dolly Parton, but there she was celebrating her love of books. </p><p>PARTON (singing): In my Tennessee mountain home --</p><p>WALLACE: It's a story that begins back when she was growing up, one of 12 children, in the Smoky Mountains of east Tennessee, the daughter of Robert Lee Parton. </p><p>PARTON: Daddy never had a chance to go to school. And daddy couldn't read nor write, but he was really a smart person enough and wondered what all he might have done had he had an education. </p><p>WALLACE: Fast-forward to 1995, when the country music star decided to start the Imagination Library, to give free books to children in her hometown. </p><p>Over the years, the program has spread across the country and overseas. A book every month to kids who sign up from birth until they turn five and go to kindergarten. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to a child to get their own book mailed to them in their own name? </p><p>PARTON: It makes them feel important. It makes them feel special. So, of course, it makes them want to do what the book is all about, learn to read it. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Local communities pay for the books, but Dolly's group pays for sending out more than a million a month, which she helps cover through her companies and concerts and even a children's album. </p><p>PARTON (singing): I am a rainbow.</p><p>PARTON: Oh, millions of dollars, I'm sure. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): And is that important to you? </p><p>PARTON: Oh, it's very important, because it's my charity. Although there are many things that I do, this is the one that's nearest and dearest to my heart. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Dolly has been performing for more than 60 years. She's won eight Grammy's and is in the Country Music Hall of Fame. But she shows no sign at all of slowing down. </p><p>PARTON: My music is everything to me. It's my gift. It's my joy. It's my job. And it's just something that I love to do. And I never think about that I should quit it. </p><p>WALLACE: Which brings us back to the Imagination Library. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Though I understand that you have gotten a nickname from this program. </p><p>PARTON: I'm the book lady. Who knew?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are so honored that the hundred millionth book -- </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): So there was Dolly with the librarian of Congress donating the 100 millionth book, unveiling a copy of her own \"Coat of Many Colors,\" based on the coat her mother made for her out of scraps of cloth. </p><p>PARTON: Maybe we'll be back for our billionth book one of these days. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right.</p><p>PARTON: Wouldn't that be nice! </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you, Library of Congress? </p><p>PARTON: I know. Here I am. A little old country girl from the Smoky Mountains of east Tennessee. Now one of my little books about my mom and a story about my dad is going to be here forever in the Library of Congress. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Dolly even gave us a little concert about the coat and her family and what led her to share her dream with so many children. </p><p>PARTON (singing): In my coat of many colors that my mama made for me, made only from rags but I wore it so proudly. And although we had no money, I was rich as I could be, in my coat of many colors mama made for me, because she made it just for me. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: Dolly's Imagination Library now teams up with the Library of Congress for a special story time for kids, the last Friday of each month streaming online. </p><p>And speaking of kids, I want to introduce you to a special one. Jack Henry Wallace, who was born on Friday, 8 pounds 6 ounces. Jack will make his television debut in December as part of our annual Christmas greeting from now the six Wallace grandkids. Jack, his mom and dad, and, yes, his proud grandpa are all doing well. </p><p>And that's it for today.

Happy Easter and happy Passover from FOX News in Washington.  </p><p>It's been a turbulent week for President Trump's foreign policy.  Russia tested a powerful new missile and responded to the U.S. expelling 60 of their diplomats by kicking out 60 of ours.  Kim Jong-un made a surprise trip to China while appearing to set new conditions for talks with Mr. Trump, and the president announced he wants to pull all American forces out of Syria and is freezing recovery aid for that country.  </p><p>We want to discuss all this with Senator Lindsey Graham, a key member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  </p><p>Senator, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY and happy Easter.  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE:  Happy Easter.  A lot to talk about.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, let's start with the situation in Russia -- the launch of a powerful new missile, those mass expulsions.  </p><p>Here's how Russia's ambassador to the U.S. described the situation.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANATOLY ANTONOV, RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.:  It seems the atmosphere in Washington is poison, is poisoned.  It's a toxic atmosphere.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  How serious is the split now between Moscow and Washington?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  I think it's pretty ironic that he used the word poison.  One of the reasons we are expelling diplomats is because the Russian intelligence services most likely poisoned a British citizen and his daughter, a former Russian agent in the United Kingdom.  So, this is the '80s to me all over.  </p><p>I can tell you what Ronald Reagan did.  Every time the Russians tried to advance their military technology, we one-up to them.  Every time the Russians started running wild throughout the world, Reagan pushed back.  </p><p>So, if I were Trump, I'd look at the Reagan playbook and economically isolate Russia.  I would study every major recipient of Russia oil and gas and see if we could find ways to supply those countries with oil and gas somewhere -- from a source outside of Russia.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I want to pick up on the president's action because while the Trump administration has taken some actions, imposed some sanctions the week before last, President Trump himself has been reluctant to call out Vladimir Putin.  </p><p>In fact, here's how we talked about his call to congratulate Putin after he won his reelection victory.  Take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We had a very good call and I suspect that we will probably be meeting in the not-too-distant future to discuss the arms race.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Senator, do we need a Trump-Putin summit meeting or do we need President Trump first to take some stronger actions against Russia?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Let's go back to the Reagan playbook.  He stood up in front of the Berlin wall and said: Tear this wall down, on the other side is an evil empire.  He wound up meeting with Gorbachev to try to reduce the number of nuclear weapons.  </p><p>I think the problem is that Russia is running wild.  Whatever we're doing is not working and the president for some reason has a hard time pushing back against Putin directly.  So, again, economic isolation of Russia.  They're an oil and gas economy.  They couldn't survive very long without customers.  </p><p>So, if I were President Trump, Germany and Europe, I would -- France, I would try to cut off all of their customers and provide alternatives to their customers for oil and gas outside of Russia.  That's what I do.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Speaking of summits, North Korea leader Kim Jong-un made a surprise visit to Beijing this week to meet with Chinese President Xi as Kim prepares for a summit meeting with President Trump next month.  And according to the Chinese, Kim is now calling for phased synchronized moves to denuclearize his country.  </p><p>Question, does that concern you that according to what the Chinese said after the meeting between Kim and Xi, that the North Korean leader Kim now wants concessions from both sides and longer negotiations?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Yes, it could, but let me just highlight one thing.  The reason that North Korea is at the table is that this maximum pressure campaign against North Korea launched by the Trump administration, where the world is beginning to follow, has paid off.  They're coming to the table because it has hurt so much.  </p><p>And the president has called out Kim Jong-un by name for being the tyrant he is.  Now, we've got an opportunity, historic in nature, to sit down and maybe not only get him to give up his nuclear weapons but to end the Korean War, which is still going on.  But, yes, I'd be very cautious about the terms and conditions of this meeting and this is why I like John Bolton as national security advisor.  He's a very -- he has a very healthy skepticism, but I do hope President Trump will meet with North Korea.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, I just want to pick up on that.  You say you want to be careful about the terms of the meeting, if what Kim says he has in mind is longer negotiations, concessions on both sides, it sounds kind of like the negotiations --  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- that prior presidents have had with the North Korean regime with Kim's father.  </p><p>Do we still want to have the summit?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  We don't want to give him nine months or year to talk and build a missile at the same time.  So, I had dinner with Bolton a couple of nights ago.  His big fear is that they're just buying time.  </p><p>They're about nine months to a year away of having a missile with a nuclear weapon on top that can hit America.  He sees these negotiations as we're (ph) buying time.  That's what they've done in the past.  </p><p>So, I'd cut them off at the pass there.  I would make sure the negotiations were very focused and get quick action.  </p><p>Here's the goal in negotiations: to make sure that North Korea gives up their nuclear program.  Japan and South Korea, they don't have notes, there's no reason for North Korea to have a nuclear program.  They'll sell anything they'll build as to their history.  And maybe get a peace treaty with North Korea, South Korea, the United States and China, but not let this drag on a very long time.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Meanwhile, President Trump started talking this week about pulling all of our 2,000 troops --  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- out of Syria who are there supporting the effort against ISIS, and we learned yesterday he has frozen $200 million in funds for recovery efforts there. </p><p>Here is the president on Syria this week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We'll be coming out of Syria like very soon.  Let the other people take care of it now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Is President Trump making a mistake talking about getting out of Syria while ISIS is still alive, obviously diminished but still in the field, and while Iran is still pushing and some could say helping the Assad regime won the civil war?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, Mr. President, when it comes to Russia, read the Ronald Reagan playbook.  When it comes to Syria, do not read the Obama playbook.  </p><p>This is the Obama playbook, one foot in, one foot out.  This is a disaster in the making.  </p><p>All of his military advisors have said, we need to leave troops in Syria to work with the Kurds, calm down the conflict between Turkey and the Kurdish fighters who have helped, make sure that Raqqa does not fall back into the hands of ISIL.  There are over 3,000 ISIS fighters still roaming around Syria.  We've got troops there to protect us and to protect the region.  </p><p>If we withdrew our troops anytime soon, ISIS would come back, the war between Turkey and the Kurds would get out of hand, and you'd be giving Damascus to the Iranians without an American presence, and Russia and Iran would dominate Syria.  </p><p>It'd be the single worst decision the president could make.  I've seen this movie before when Obama did the same thing in Iraq and quite frankly gave Assad a pass in Syria when he had them on the ropes.  </p><p>We got ISIL on the ropes.  If you want to let them off the ropes, remove American soldiers.  </p><p>WALLACE:  You have talked -- we also want to talk about some domestic issues.  You have called for a second special counsel to investigate --  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Right.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- the FBI and the Justice Department and how they conducted both the Clinton investigation and the Trump investigation.  But the inspector general, who is independent, says he is looking into that and this week, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions named John Huber, the U.S. attorney from Utah, to conduct his own investigation into those matters.  </p><p>Does that move satisfy you or do you still want a second special counsel?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, some people say it's a good start, some people say it's an insufficient process.  I don't know yet.  The jury is still out regarding Mr. Huber, but I do know this: if you tried this when it came to the Trump campaign, not appoint a special counsel but take some U.S. attorney outside of Washington and let them look at the Trump-Russia connection, the left would have went crazy saying this deserves a special counsel.  </p><p>My belief is that there should be a special counsel.  And here's the question: I want a special counsel with the same determination and resources to look at the abuses of the FISA process, was the Clinton email investigation a sham, were there conflicts of interest in the Justice Department.  </p><p>I want to special counsel to be appointed with the same resources and the same determination to look at those issues as is Mueller is looking at the Trump campaign.  And I don't see that yet.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Finally, you said we had a lot to cover.  This week, the president fired the secretary of veterans affairs and he named the White House doctor, Admiral Ronny Jackson, to take that job, Jackson who famously gave President Trump a clean bill of health.  </p><p>Take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADMIRAL RONNY JACKSON, WHITE HOUSE PHYSICIAN:  To answer your question, he has incredibly good genes.  It's just the way god made him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  You call this a home run for veterans and there's no question that Admiral Jackson is a brilliant -- well, he's a great combat surgeon.  The question that everybody is raising is whether or not he is equipped has the experience to run an agency with 360,000 employees and an annual budget of $186 billion.  </p><p>Why doesn't that concern you and how much trouble do you think Admiral Jackson is going to have being confirmed?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  One, I think he'll get confirmed because he's made life-and-death decisions on the battlefield.  He's committed medical personnel on the battlefield.  He's been in the middle of this war.  </p><p>I was with him a week ago, I guess two weeks ago now, at an event in Charleston and he had no idea this was coming.  I had no idea it was coming.  But we started talking about the Veterans Administration, and he said to me something that was very satisfying.  </p><p>Somebody needs to take that place and turn it upside down.  Somebody needs to make sure that no veteran has to wait too long or drive too far to get basic health care.  </p><p>I want competition for the veterans health care.  I want the V.A. to stay in existence but if a veteran waits too long or lives too far away from a facility I want the private sector to fill in that gap.</p><p>And Admiral Jackson has that same mentality and he need somebody to go into the V.A.  He's willing to fight the bureaucracy and I think Admiral Jackson is a good pick because he's been on the battlefield.  He knows what the fight is all about.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Graham, thank you.  Thanks for your time this holiday weekend.  It was a busy set of questions and we got it all in.  Always good to talk with you, sir.  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Thank you.  Happy Easter.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Happy Easter to you.  </p><p>Up next, the president announces he wants to pull American troops out of Syria.  We'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss whether he's moving too fast.  </p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the state of U.S.-Russian relations now?  Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANTONOV:  If anybody slap your check, your face, what will be reaction from your side?  You will retaliate.  It goes without saying.  </p><p>NAUERT:  Russia should not be acting like a victim.  The only victims in the situation are the two victims in a hospital in the U.K. right now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov and State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert continuing the two countries war of words this week.  </p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group.  Former Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz, FOX News analyst Marie Harf, Catherine Lucey, who covers the White House for \"The Associated Press\", and FOX News correspondent Gillian Turner.  </p><p>Well, Gillian, let me start with you.  Where are we headed in relations with the Kremlin after this week and you heard from Senator Graham, what should President Trump do next?  </p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, all right, Chris, to lay it out right now, this investigation phase into the nerve agent attack is in full swing.  Reporting this week is that the United States is sort of hand in glove with the Brits on this investigation every step of the way and some horrifying, horrifying developments coming out of that.  </p><p>Just in the last 24 hours, the Brits confirmed that they believe President Putin at some point directly authorized this attack himself.  They believe it's not a stand-alone event and it's part of a broader plan of a large-scale assassination plan for Russian defectors around the world.  They've gone so far as to warn partner nations they should amp up security for Russian defectors living inside their borders.  </p><p>It's a horrifying set of circumstances.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Why would they do that?  I mean, what's to be gained -- I mean, I understand you don't like these people, but why is killing the person who is living as a private citizen in Salisbury, England, worth the blowback you get internationally?  </p><p>TURNER:  I think because according to the Putin and the KGB playbook, these are some of the worst people on earth, people who defected from the former Soviet Union, now from Russia are people that don't really deserve to live.  They are enemies of the state in the truest form.  And not to play pop psychology, but I think that's what motivates this.  </p><p>WALLACE:  We ask you for questions for the panel.</p><p>And on this issue of relations with Russia and the mass expulsion of diplomats, Lambert Boeman tweeted this: the only question, does this not put to bed any and all allegations of true collusion?  They put him in office, to Kremlin allegedly helping Mr. Trump, to expel people?  </p><p>Catherine, how do you answer Lambert and the argument that the Trump administration is taking action, the shows he's not playing ball with Putin?  </p><p>CATHERINE LUCEY, ASSOCIATED PRESS:  The actions this week the administration took a strong stance.  These are very aggressive actions.  But there is a disconnect a little bit between the administration's actions and the president's public rhetoric.  We haven't heard him directly challenging Putin.  So, critics are still pointing to that as a cause for concern.  </p><p>But in terms of collusion specifically, that's just not going to be put to rest until this investigation concludes.  We still don't know where that's going and the people are still waiting to see what Mueller finds.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I want to turn to a different subject, and that is Mr. Trump surprise announcement this week that he is eager to pull all use U.S. troops, about 2,000 there backing up Syrian rebels, wants to pull them out of Syria and also that he has decided to freeze $200 million in U.S. recovery aid for people in the country.  </p><p>Here was Mr. Trump this week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We are going to be coming out of there real soon.  We're going to get back to our country where we belong, where we want to be.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Congressman, I want to pick up on what Senator Graham said.  He said that the president is -- if he follows through on this -- is making exactly the same mistake that Barack Obama made in Iraq, which is to pull U.S. forces out before the battle is won.  </p><p>Is Graham right?  </p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN (R-UT):  Senator Graham is right.  Why do you telegraph in advance what you are going to do to your enemies?  And to the local people that you're working and engaging with, to signal to them that, hey, a couple weeks from now, we may not be here?  </p><p>That's -- that's not a good message.  I do think it's right to look at the aid portion of this and how are you going to distribute that, but I also don't think we're that close, inches away from getting rid of the caliphate and reclaiming all of the land.  I just don't see that.  </p><p>WALLACE:  So, I mean, there didn't seem be any pressure.  There was no huge call to pull U.S. troops out.  How do you explain the president suddenly announcing this?  He was in Ohio for an infrastructure speech, and suddenly, he says this.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  There's no way that I'm going to be able to answer that in its totality.  But, look, I think his heart is in the right place.  I do believe you want to get in, get your job done and get our troops home, and I think that's a good message to their military.  Go in with overwhelming force, do what you need to do and come back home.  </p><p>But I don't think you telegraph that in advance.  And, you know, the timeline is iffy, but I think Senator Graham is right in this case.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I mean, it's interesting because you say don't telegraph in advance.  That was one of the major points --  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- that President Trump made during the campaign.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I think I said that every week, I was critical of the president -- saying, President Obama, don't do it like this.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Right, so is President Trump.  He was saying, don't -- be unpredictable.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  Don't tell people in advance what's going to happen.  </p><p>Marie, your thought about the president's apparent eagerness to get out of Syria?  </p><p>MARIE HARF, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON:  I think it would be a huge strategic mistake and not just because of the telegraphing issue, although I do agree with Congressman Chaffetz, who will fill that void if the United States is not there?  Russia and Iran.  And we've already seen Russia and Iran both move in increasingly into Syria.  They have, you know, airbases, they have troops there, both of them do.  </p><p>If the United States pulled back and leaves the reconstruction to someone else, we are handing that country over to the two countries we don't want to have more power in the Middle East.  So, we are hearing from commanders on the ground, we are hearing from diplomats that President Trump needs to take a step back and stay in this for the long haul, whatever that means whether it's months or years.  This would be a mistake and I think Republicans like Senator Graham will keep standing up and may be pushing the president in a different direction.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Now, I have to ask you, did you feel the same way about Barack Obama when he pulled our troops out of Iraq in 2012?  </p><p>HARF:  Well, I think it was a completely different strategic situation at the time.  And there are --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Why?</p><p>HARF:  The conditions on the ground quite frankly were different.  And Barack Obama pulled troops out of Iraq on a timeline set by the Bush administration.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, that's not quite true.  </p><p>HARF:  Well, it is absolutely -- they negotiated the forces agreement under which those troops got pulled out and on that timeline.  </p><p>WALLACE:  You want to take this one on or shall I?  </p><p>HARF:  Well, wait, there's a question -- and Congressman Chaffetz brought it up.  There's a tension between going to the American people rightly so and saying, our men and women are not going to fight indefinitely overseas, policing other countries' civil wars.  There is tension between that and advocating American leadership.  The balance is not always an easy one to find, but going to the infrastructure event in Ohio and saying, we're going to get out of Syria really soon sends a bad signal to the commanders and to our enemies.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I'm going to make an audible here.  We could relitigate that, and the fact is that although there was a status of forces agreement, there's always the presumption that U.S. and Iraq were going to negotiate for troops to stay --  </p><p>HARF:  Maybe (ph).</p><p>WALLACE:  -- and that President Obama didn't push very hard.  </p><p>I want to move on to North Korea because there was an interesting -- Catherine, after Kim surprised us with the Chinese, the Chinese said that Kim is now saying --  we're not talking about a quick dismantlement like Libya did, like Gadhafi did to get rid of all of our nukes.  We want phase, synchronized talks, concessions by both sides, longer negotiations.  </p><p>What's the reaction in the White House to that?  </p><p>LUCEY:  You know, I think we're still waiting to hear how the president processes this.  We haven't heard from him in the last day or two.  But he said earlier this week that he was still looking forward to talks.  I mean, he talked about -- he made references to this in Ohio this week.  </p><p>So, we haven't heard an indication that he's not going to do this.  And some of this I think is a part of sort of -- there's some public posturing that's going to keep going on I think up until this meeting potentially happens.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Does that concern you when you hear him talk?  Because it sounds a bit like what the North Koreans have done in the past.  Well, we'll give you this, you give us that, we will play along for a while and then we'll go back on our word.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  This is all moving in the right direction.  I think this is one of the strongest points for President Trump and what he's done.  He's put the pressure on both economically and militarily.  It's pushing in the right direction.  </p><p>You see that China is obviously going to play a key, key role in ultimately what happens there and us with the Japanese and the South Koreans have got to hold the line.  And I do think it's important that the president meets with the leader of North Korea.  I think that will be productive.  </p><p>I don't think you should let off the gas at all.  And certainly, the appointment of John Bolton is not going to send any signals that we're going to be softer.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Quick final thought, Gillian?  </p><p>TURNER:  I think the president changed tack this week.  He shifted to what I would call a maximum pressure campaign against South Korea, which was really interesting, and threatening to tie a bilateral trade deal with them to the denuclearization issue.  He's now saying to South Korea or demanding that they deliver some results before he even sits down at the table for this negotiation with Kim Jong-un.  </p><p>And that was remarkable because I think it shows - - it shows up how little leverage we actually have against this crazy, despotic, rogue regime, North Korea.  The president is sort of triangulating, as much as I hate that word, looking at the levers and saying, well, I'm not really going to get what I want from this, so I might as well push this lever and see what I can extract from South Korea.  </p><p>WALLACE:  And since they're meeting first, the South Koreans and North Koreans at the end of this month, he's saying, before we sign this trade deal which you guys want, let's see how much you push the North Koreans and we certainly don't want you breaking away from us.  </p><p>TURNER:  Yes, you said it better than I did.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALLACE:  Well -- all right.  Thank you, panel.  You'll get more time in the next panel for buttering me up.  </p><p>We're going to take a break here.  We'll see you a little later.</p><p>When we come back, the decision to include a question on citizenship in the 2020 census raises an uproar.  We'll talk with two California officials about that and the escalating battle over its status as a sanctuary state.  All of that, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Coming up, the Commerce Department adds a citizenship question to the 2020 census and some states are fighting back.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Adding a question on citizen strip threatens to derail the integrity of the entire process.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  We'll ask two California officials what it means for their state, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  A look around the world as Christians celebrate Easter.  </p><p>The Trump administration announced this week the 2020 census will ask respondents whether they are U.S. citizens for the first time in 70 years, and that has started a fierce debate in California, which has voted to become a sanctuary state.</p><p>Joining me now from California, Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman and the vice chair of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, Shawn Nelson. </p><p>California's attorney general announced this week that he is suing the federal government for deciding to add that question to the census. Here was his reasoning. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERA: An undercount resulting from this decision would jeopardize vital services for all Californians. It would also jeopardize our representation in government. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Mr. Nelson, is Congressman Becerra wrong or, in fact, would you like to see California lose some seats in Congress and some federal money that is based on the large number of people in your state illegally? </p><p>SHAWN NELSON, VICE CHAIR, ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: Well, Attorney General Becerra, I just think is incorrect because the federal government has a right to conduct the census and there's nothing that says they can't ask any particular question. I don't want California to miss out on anything, but I think that hysteria than answering questions is somehow going to force people away from a censes, I -- I just don't buy it. The -- the government is precluded from sharing that information for 72 years after a person answers the census. And I think his time ought to be spent allaying the fears of people he things are going to be freaked out by having to answer questions. </p><p>WALLACE: Let -- let me ask you, though, about the practical effect of it, because it's kind of an open question as we looked into it. Even the Supreme Court has not definitively ruled. </p><p>Do you think that people who are in this country illegally should be counted when it's decided how you're going to apportion congressional seats and how you're going to divvy up federal money? </p><p>NELSON: Well, that's a great question. I mean if -- if, in the end, we essentially import a few million citizens of other countries to game the system to get extra congressional seats, I suppose that presents a big question for power in Washington, D.C. I mean we always just assumed the count is for the citizens of a country, but California, where I've lived my whole life, obviously has a little different issue. And that poses a big problem. </p><p>WALLACE: Congressman Sherman, let me ask you the same question. Why should California, or any state with a sizable number of illegal immigrants in its population, benefit from that to get more federal money or to get more seats in Congress? </p><p>BRAD SHERMAN (D), CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN: We're often shortchanged when it comes to federal money and Congress can allocate the federal money however it chooses. The enumeration for the census is the allocation of House seats and seats in the Electoral College. And the Constitution is clear, you count all persons except Indians untaxed. Those are the words of the Constitution. </p><p>Now, if people want the change the Constitution, they -- there's a process for doing that. But instead they seem to want to thwart the Constitution, to achieve their results without an amendment by deliberately undercounting all immigrants, legal and illegal. And they've got a three step program for doing that. Create massive fear, starting by calling immigrants rapists and murders, deportations. The fear in Latino and Asian communities is palpable. </p><p>Then you add this question, which the census itself, under the Trump administration says will lead to an undercount. And then you add insult to injury by saying that the reason you're doing it is to enforce the Voting Rights Act. That it's part of the Trump program for Latino empowerment. That's why they're doing it.</p><p>WALLACE: Let me -- let me --</p><p>SHERMAN: That's absolutely absurd. If you believe that, then --</p><p>WALLACE: Let me -- let me bring Mr. Nelson in, if I can, congressman, because we do have limited amount of time. </p><p>This will be the first time that this question has been asked as a general question. It's been asked, I know (ph), to a small group of people. But as a general question in the census since 1950. </p><p>What about the argument that this is an effort by the Trump administration to depress the count by frightening illegal immigrants? </p><p>NELSON: Listen, I think that any questionnaire has the potential to be avoided. The point is to reach out to communities and encourage them to participate. There's no repercussions. This information cannot be shared. And there's no reason people shouldn't participate, unless folks go out and scare them. And I would say that what's happening on this very show the Congressman Sherman might have more to do with scaring them than anything that -- that I'm seeing from -- from my end of the -- of the spectrum. I mean tell people they are protected and encourage them to participate. </p><p>My county has more poor people than most counties have people. Many of them are immigrants. We need federal money. </p><p>WALLACE: Let me -- let me -- let -- let -- I just want to ask you, Congressman Sherman, Mr. Nelson is exactly right, that the law expressly prohibits using, sharing, any information from the census with any government, with any court. So why should anybody be afraid? And perhaps aren't you, by talking as you are, aren't you creating that fear? </p><p>SHERMAN: I'm certainly trying not to create any fear. But the fact is immigrants come from countries with oppressive governments in many cases. And to convince them that a man who stands there and says these are rapists and murders and must be pushed out of our country should get information about who's in your family and what their immigration status is, and that a Congress that includes people that say they're rapists and murders isn't going to change the statute and use that as a deportation list, to convince someone who's lived through the terrible situations in Guatemala and Honduras, that they should go ahead and answer the census is going to be difficult. And to say that you're doing it to --</p><p>WALLACE: All right.</p><p>SHERMAN: Enforce the Voting Rights Act is absolutely absurd. </p><p>WALLACE: I want to switch to the other side of this because while California is suing the federal government about including this question on the census, the federal government is suing California about its decision to enact laws that in effect make it a sanctuary state. And, in fact, the Orange County Supervisors voted this week to join the federal lawsuit against their own state of California. </p><p>Here was President Trump this week. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Sanctuary cities, where they protect criminals. They protect murderers. They protect people that you don't want on the streets. Other places in California said, we don't want that. First time they're speaking up. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Mr. Nelson, you were one of the Orange County Board of Supervisors members who voted to join a federal lawsuit against her own state. Why? </p><p>NELSON: Well, it was my idea, because we are put in an untenable position where our sheriff's deputies are precluded from talking to federal authorities if they know the authorities want to pick someone up because the person is here illegally, is charged with a crime, and our -- our people can't even talk to the federal government unless there are some exceptions that are -- that are met like they're a prior convicted felon. But we have people getting out every day that we don't want released without the federal government at least having an opportunity to put hands on and make their own decision whether these people ought to be released into the streets. We've had 244 people as of last week released that we could not stop and our people could not tell ICE officials that we believe ICE would have wanted to speak with and likely wanted to do something about. </p><p>WALLACE: Congressman Sherman, you have said that Washington is violating the Constitution by putting this citizenship question in. But isn't California violating the Constitution by interfering with the federal government, which has supremacy when it comes to matters of immigration? </p><p>SHERMAN: Chris, we need comprehensive immigration reform. Until we get it, we'll be pulling our society apart over this issue. </p><p>WALLACE: Sir, you're not answering my question. Isn't --</p><p>SHERMAN: Now, I'll get -- I'll get --</p><p>WALLACE: OK.</p><p>SHERMAN: California is absolutely within its rights. And California has sued the Trump administration 29 times and we haven't lost once. (INAUDIBLE) the Trump administration --</p><p>WALLACE: You're not answering my question, which is, isn't immigration -- </p><p>SHERMAN: I will. </p><p>WALLACE: Well, let's get to it, sir.</p><p>SHERMAN: Absolutely.</p><p>WALLACE: We're almost done, sir. </p><p>SHERMAN: Yes. Yes. The states and the federal government share sovereignty in our federal system. That's why Obamacare couldn't force the states to expand Medicaid, even though that's the federal program that even though --</p><p>WALLACE: Now, that's the question of supremacy. And, in fact, when Arizona, went further than President Obama did, the Supreme Court said that they had overstepped their bounds. Under the supremacy clause, the federal government, what they say on immigration goes, and aren't you violating that? </p><p>SHERMAN: Federal government establishes immigration policy. But whether America -- whether California employees are going to spend California money and resources to help enforce that policy is a California decision. We will win that in court. And if the federal government can't compel states to participate in Medicaid, it can't compel states to become law enforcement authorities on immigration. </p><p>WALLACE: Of course the federal -- the Constitution didn't say anything about Medicaid, which didn't happen until the 1960s. It says something very specifically about immigration. </p><p>Mr. Nelson, I'm going to give you 30 seconds for a final thoughts. </p><p>NELSON: Right. </p><p>And, Chris, unfortunately, that's completely misleading. We don't want our people doing the federal government's job, nor do they have the time to do it. What California's law is requiring is our sheriffs not even cooperate, which is resulting in people that have committed crimes ending up on the streets of every county, but certainly Orange County. We got involved because we don't think that's right. We are tired of the state trying to use these arguments to prevent us from keeping the citizens safe.</p><p>WALLACE: All right, we're going to have to leave it there. Didn't think we were going to settle this, and we didn't. </p><p>Congressman Sherman, Mr. Nelson, thank you both.</p><p>NELSON: Thanks, Chris.</p><p>WALLACE: Thank you for joining us today to discuss the continuing debate over immigration.</p><p>Up next, we'll bring back the panel to weigh in on the census asking people if they are U.S. citizens, and President Trump's new war on Amazon. All of that coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Every person who uses our highways or our mass transit system, counts. Everyone who relies on our government, federal, state and local, to be there when a natural disaster strike, counts. </p><p>SHAWN NELSON, VICE CHAIR., ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: They'd like to pretend that everyone here is entitled to certain government carve outs and benefits. And, of course, non-citizens are entitled to a lot of benefits. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: California's attorney general and Orange County Supervisor Shawn Nelson with sharply different views on whether the 2020 census should ask people if they are U.S. citizens. </p><p>And we're back now with the panel. </p><p>Well, Marie, let me start with you. </p><p>Why do you think the Trump administration has decided to ask this as a general question on the census for the first time since 1950? </p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS ANALYST: Well, it's hard to know their motivation. I know what they've said. </p><p>But for many Americans, including myself, I see this decision in the context of the divisive rhetoric about immigration, in the context of more hard line policies on deportation. And that's how, most importantly, Americans and people living in the country are seeing it. </p><p>So the point of the census is to take account of everyone in the country, not just citizens, and there are many people on both sides of the aisle who firmly believe that this question will depress turnout and that we will not get an accurate count because people are scared of what the Trump administration might do with that information. </p><p>WALLACE: Gillian, do you think that's true, that this is a conscious effort to try -- to depress voter -- response by people to the census with the expressed effort of trying to lower the amount of money that's spent on federal benefits, a apportionment of congressional seats, particularly to areas with large number of illegal immigrants, which tend to be Democratic? </p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, that is certainly the political argument to be made about this issue. But there is, in fact, in addition to this, a much larger context at stake that gets a little bit more to the fundamentals of American democracy and how our representatives in Congress and elsewhere represent us, meaning the question -- and this is something the Supreme Court took up as recently as 2016, should congressional representative represent numbers -- equal numbers of voters in different districts, or should they represent equal number of people? In that -- the case was called -- I wrote it down so I'd remember, Evenwel versus Abbott. In that instance, they decided that folks who are not citizens have as much equity and should have as much say in these policy decisions as people who are American citizens. That was that decision.</p><p>WALLACE: Yes. Now that, apparently -- and -- and -- and I'm just learning about that this morning. Apparently that was a decision that was more to the states and local -- localities than it was to Congress. </p><p>So the question as to whether congressional seats should be apportioned according to people or citizens, I have to say, I was shocked to learn that it might be people and not citizens. </p><p>TURNER: Well, I was -- I -- the same, considering that, you know, American members of Congress are supposed to represent the American electorate, not just any -- everybody who I thought, you know, common parlance, what we're taught in school, seems that there's a fair argument to be made for they should also be representing the interests of non-citizens. That's a bigger question.</p><p>(CROSS TALK) </p><p>WALLACE: Let's bring it to one member of Congress that's sitting at this table. </p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN (R-UT): That's ridiculous to think that we weren't going to have people that aren't Americans, that they are going to influence the vote so that California gets more? </p><p>WALLACE: But are -- you're aware that's how it's worked up until now because there's been no citizen question? </p><p>CHAFFETZ: I'm -- I'm just -- I'm just saying, as a fundamental principle, I -- I think that's wrong. </p><p>Now, the census is going to count everybody. We're having our national debate about DACA, about immigration reform. Shouldn't we know how many people are here illegally? Of course we're going to count everybody, but we ought to know. </p><p>By the way, the biggest problem that's moving forward with the census isn't this question. And it will be on there. There's no way for the Democrats to get it off. Their way -- the biggest problem with the census is that they're going to try to do this over the Internet and through electronic machines. What -- what could possibly go wrong, Chris? </p><p>WALLACE: Catherine, what -- the debate inside the White House about this? And -- and, you know, it just seemed to come out of nowhere with Secretary of Commerce Ross announcing it this week. Had there been a lot of discussion about adding this question? </p><p>CATHERINE LUCEY, \"ASSOCIATED PRESS\": I know that Secretary Ross pointed to concerns about, appropriately, dealing with the Voting Rights Act. So that's kind of the -- the argument that's being made from the administration as to why this is important. </p><p>But I think also we know that all these legal challenges are already happening. A number of states are going to challenge this. And it's not clear how quickly this will be resolved. I mean so some people are saying that it's possible that this question may not end up on the census if it -- if it gets tied up for so long in the courts. So we'll have to see how it plays out. </p><p>WALLACE: Meanwhile, President Trump has been on a tear this week about Amazon. And here is one of his tweets, to give you a sense of what he's been talking about. </p><p>They, Amazon, pay little or no taxes to state and local governments, use our postal system as their delivery boy, causing tremendous loss to the U.S., and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business. </p><p>Congressman Chaffetz, as the former chair of the House Oversight Committee, you've dealt with some of these issues. Is President Trump right or wrong?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You know, I've been fond of the president and his policies, but he is fundamentally wrong on this issue. And I actually think he knows he's wrong on this issue. </p><p>The problems at the post office are rooted in the decline in first-class mail, their pension issues and how they account for -- for their medical costs. The fact that they have more customers in Amazon is a blessing and it is a good thing to the postal service. </p><p>If you look at UPS, FedEx, Amazon, they all use the postal service and you need them to actually boost up the numbers that are coming in to -- to the post office. So it is a good thing. </p><p>I know that they -- there is a personal conflict between the president and Mr. Bezos, and that's rooted in his acquisition of \"The Washington Post.\" But you need more customers at the post office, not less. </p><p>WALLACE: And what about this question of taxes? Because I know it was true in the past that a lot of the big box brick and mortar retailers were upset that sales over the Internet, they didn't collect sales tax. But, in fact, Amazon has, I think is collecting sales tax in 45 states. </p><p>CHAFFETZ: It's all rooted in, do you or do you not have physical presence in these states. But quite contrary to what the president has said, Amazon has been helping to lead the charge because it's in their best economic future to have sales tax collected in these states. The Remote Transaction Parody Act, which I helped sponsor, has broad bipartisan support in both -- both bodies, in the House and the Senate, and that says that the states would get to make this determination. </p><p>So Amazon is paying quite a bit of taxes, more than they've paid before, and they want each of the states to be able to make these types of decisions. A very conservative viewpoint. </p><p>WALLACE: Catherine, why is the president so focused on Amazon right now? And is it just tweets, or is there talk in the White House of really taking action to move against Amazon? </p><p>LUCEY: Well, the White House said this week there were no specific policies on the table at this time. So you're with the obvious caveats that the president sometimes makes policy without telling anyone. As of right now, they don't appear to be signaling anything. But he does, as the congressman said, this is something that's rooted both for him I think in sort of policy and politics, but also personal. And he does find the fact that Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, owns \"The Post\" deeply frustrating. Now, \"The Post\" has been very clear. Bezos is not involved in journalistic decisions. But the president does seem to lash out particularly if he's frustrated by news coverage. </p><p>WALLACE: Marie, let me ask you, because this is part of a bigger story, which is that there is a backlash against big tech. And we see it particularly with FaceBook and the role that they played with the -- with the Russian ads, the -- the role that they played with Cambridge Analytica and turning over information. </p><p>What -- what are your thoughts about why the president is targeting, not tech as an industry, but targeting Amazon and Jeff Bezos, and specifically talking about Bezos using \"The Washington Post\" to lobby for his interests here in D.C.? </p><p>HARF: Well, Catherine's right, this is personal for the president. And we see him use his Twitter feed to sort of hash out personal issues that he has, whether it's with \"The Washington Post,\" and Jeff Bezos. This is sort of his inner monologue coming -- made -- being made public, right?</p><p>But I think that he hasn't -- or his administration, even more importantly, hasn't really looked at these bigger issues of tech. There actually could be some good work if they stepped back from the personal and said how -- should and how -- should we and how should we regulate FaceBook, Twitter, Amazon, Google, all of these different platforms. There's a huge conversation we're having in our country about tech right now and the president's playing out some personal -- personal game on Twitter, which is frustrating to a lot of people. </p><p>WALLACE: I've got less than a minute left, Gillian. </p><p>And -- and while there is certainly some -- seems to be something between President Trump and Jeff Bezos, there is also a policy question here, which is that the success of these Internet companies does hurt the big box retailers in the street. </p><p>TURNER: Yes. That's -- yes. And that's, I think to the president, this is about the U.S. government, the postal service versus Amazon. And he's weighing in and putting his finger on the scale in favor of the postal service. </p><p>But to the tech sector and to the rest of America, this is about the future of brick-and-mortar and retail and what happens if a player like Amazon is forced to bear out some of the consequences that the president would like to see -- to see happen? You can't put the cat back in the box and you can't -- you can't move America away from the future of -- of online retail. </p><p>WALLACE: All right, we'll discuss more of this, I'm sure. </p><p>Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. </p><p>Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week.\" How the birth of two baby bald eagles attracted international attention for one of D.C.'s hidden gems. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Pope Francis celebrating Easter mass this morning at the Vatican. </p><p>It's one of Washington's hidden treasures just two miles from the U.S. Capitol Building. But as we showed you in 2016, thanks to some stars, it has captured the world's attention. Here's our \"Power Player of the Week.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. RICHARD OLSEN, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ARBORETUM: I think people are fascinated by this because this is -- this is real, live action nature right in front of their eyes. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Richard Olsen is talking about the birth of two baby bald eaglets, events that attracted 22 million hits on Eagle Cam. </p><p>Olsen is director of the National Arboretum in Washington. And he took us to watch the nest from a distance where the eagle family was still living. </p><p>OLSEN: What you're seeing moving is actually the mom or the dad, Mr. President or First Lady. </p><p>WALLACE: The interest in the baby eaglets has brought more attention to the rest of the arboretum, a huge collection of plants, trees and shrubs in the heart of the city. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): So is this a garden or a 400-acre laboratory? </p><p>OLSEN: It's both. It's not mutually exclusive. Science occurs here every day. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): For example, these beautiful azaleas that used to grow only in the south, until scientists at the arboretum developed hybrids that can thrive farther north. </p><p>OLSEN: We behave as a bumblebee and move pollen from the male to the female, evaluate the seedlings to find the best one that combines the traits we're looking for. </p><p>WALLACE: There's a collection of 650,000 dried fresh plants to keep a permanent record. </p><p>OLSEN: If there's any confusion as to what scientifically a rosemary is, we can go back to the original specimens and say, this is how the plant was described. </p><p>WALLACE: And there's a museum of bonsai. Miniature trees Japan gave to this country in 1976 to mark our bicentennial, including this peace tree that's had quite a life since 1625. </p><p>OLSEN: This tree did in fact survive Hiroshima. So just a mile or more away from the epicenter. And this tree survived the blast. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): So history, 400 years and one nuclear blast. </p><p>OLSEN: Yes, it's pretty amazing to think about. </p><p>This is my office and I obviously get to get out when I want. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Richard Olsen grew up loving the outdoors. </p><p>OLSEN: I was always seemed to be the kid that was out helping the parents in the tomato garden, vegetable garden. I remember planting rhubarb in Wisconsin and planting red tipped petunias in North Carolina. </p><p>WALLACE: There was a time when he considered a different line of work. </p><p>OLSEN: I thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to be an analyst in -- for the CIA. I read too many spy books and movies. </p><p>WALLACE: But by the end of college, he traded spy craft for seeds and he's never looked back. </p><p>OLSEN: Our mission at the arboretum is to enhance the American landscapes. When you walk into work and you see these trees and you think, my job is to get people to love trees as much as I love trees, that's a -- that's pretty noble. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: And more good news at the arboretum this week.

The coronavirus claiming more than 100,000 lives and some 40 million jobs, and now, the video recorded death of an unarmed black man in police custody acting like a match tossed on a tinderbox.</p><p>Tens of thousands taking to the streets overnight in more than 75 cities across the country. As some protests turn violent, the National Guard was deployed, and curfews were imposed in more than two dozen cities, the most at one time since the civil unrest of the 1960s. That is our focus this hour.</p><p>In a moment, we'll talk with Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison about the George Floyd case and what it says about race in America in 2020.</p><p>But, first, let's bring in Matt Finn in Minneapolis with the latest on another night of protests across the country -- Matt.</p><p>MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, there's been a seemingly endless cloud of acrid smoke here in Minneapolis, a combination of fires and teargas. The city has been under siege, but it appears that law enforcement might have finally gained some ground overnight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FINN: A fifth straight night of protests in Minneapolis met by a much stronger police presence. Rioters violated the curfew and clashed with officers once again, even shooting at them.</p><p>JACOB FREY (D), MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR: You're not getting back at the police officer that tragically killed George Floyd by looting a town.</p><p>FINN: In Indianapolis, police investigating multiple shootings amid the protests, including one that left a person dead. In New York, protests in all five boroughs, some turn to violence. NYPD squad cars set on fire. Molotov cocktails thrown at police.</p><p>A state of emergency declared in Los Angeles where the unrest invoked memories of Rodney King. The mayor asking for National Guard assistance after initially resisting using troops. In the nation's capital, protests once again in front of the White House, defying the president's claim on Twitter that protesters could face vicious dogs if they cross the fence.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FINN: And in an extraordinary move, the Pentagon has said it's ready to provide military support should Minnesota's governor request their assistance. So far he has not -- Chris.</p><p>WALLACE: Matt Finn reporting for Minneapolis -- Matt, thank you.</p><p>And joining us now Minnesota's Attorney General Keith Ellison.</p><p>Mr. Attorney General over the last five days we've seen rioters in Minneapolis burn down a police station, force the National Guard to retreat, and loot neighborhoods.</p><p>On Saturday, here's what Attorney General Barr had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda.</p><p>(END CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Do you have evidence that people from outside Minnesota, whether it's far left extremists or white supremacists, that outsiders are hijacking these riots in Minneapolis?</p><p>KEITH ELLISON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MINNESOTA: We have evidence that outsiders have been present and in some cases have played a very negative role. But I've been talking with protestors and trying to get a sense of who some of these folks are and I've heard mixed things.</p><p>Some of the negative stuff has come from people in Minnesota and some of it has come from people on the outside. What I'd say is we've got enough to handle on our own and that what we really need to do is refocus on justice for Mr. Floyd. And the negative behavior, looting, arson, does not help us achieve that goal.</p><p>WALLACE: On Friday you urged the people of Minneapolis not to react to the National Guard in the streets the way they would to local police. I want to put up something you said, please remember that this is not the group that you associate with unfair authority.</p><p>Question, do Blacks in Minneapolis have reason to distrust or even to fear their local police?</p><p>ELLISON: Sadly yes. There is a history of that. It has been repeated time and time again. I want to say that many officers are great people. I know so many of them and I think the chief is an extraordinary person and the mayor and the council deserve a lot of credit for appointing Mr. Arradondo. But it is an endemic problem in (ph) Minneapolis Police Department.</p><p>One problem is our Police Federation president operates as sort of an alternative chief who, I think, undermines good order in the department. So we have -- our challenge is in front of us. And I think that we can reform, we will reform, and there's a lot of great officers who want to reform. And it's good to have a chief that wants to reform.</p><p>WALLACE: While you have been consistent in condemning the violence, on Friday you quoted Martin Luther King saying, riot is the way the unheard get heard. Are you suggesting that something good may come from the violence in the streets in Minneapolis this week?</p><p>ELLISON: No, the violence really is a negative thing. But I think what Martin Luther King was trying to say is rather -- he -- rather than simply dismiss the outrage and the rage that people express after decades -- really, really, really actually centuries, of states sponsored oppression for African Americans, let's look at the roots of that rage and try to address it rather than just pound it down with massive force.</p><p>I mean people are upset for a reason. And to dismiss those reasons means we're going to be relegated to dealing with them again and again and again. I mean it was -- actually it was John F. Kennedy who said, where peaceful change is made impossible, violent change is inevitable. And these are not statements about what they believe should happen, they're statements about what does happen. And so I think that's really what the spirit of the comment was.</p><p>WALLACE: I want to drill down on this specific case, the fired police officer Derek Chauvin was charged with third degree murder, not second degree murder, which has a much stiffer penalty -- second degree does. And the big difference has to do with what he intended to do, whether he intended to kill George Floyd, I have to say we're putting up the video now and it's hard to see anything other than -- and (ph) even questionable about his intent when he kept his neck -- his knee on his neck for nine minutes including three minutes when he was no longer responsive. But, I guess, two questions.</p><p>First of all, are you comfortable with the charge of third degree murder, which means he didn't intend to kill him? And secondly, how do you respond to the Floyd family, members of which are saying that they would like to see you take over the prosecution of this case as a special prosecutor?</p><p>ELLISON: Well, let me say that we are very early in this process -- very early. It is not uncommon to amend charges. It is not uncommon to add defendants. The fact is that the investigation is still going on and it actually -- it's actually in the middle of the investigation -- or maybe even the beginning of the middle. And so I don't want anyone to conclude that these are all the charges that are going be there.</p><p>You know, to ask people to be patient who have suffered so long and been denied justice so long is really asking a lot of them. But if you want to make sure that this case results in a successful prosecution, you got to understand the defense attorneys who are going to be on the other side are very skillful and they will try to break every single link in the prosecutorial chain. So I ask people no (ph), don't rush this thing. Let's get this thing right.</p><p>Remember the Walter Scott jury hung (ph), the Rodney King jury came back acquitting the defendants. These cases which looked so obvious to us watching video tape, you get them into trial with some really good lawyers and things can go (inaudible), very different direction. So let's get this thing right.</p><p>As it relates to my role, I am standing behind the process at this point. And the process is that the county attorney has primary jurisdiction. I will say that I'm always there to assist the cause of justice, in anyway that I can, but I am backing up Minnesota state law, which means the primary --</p><p>WALLACE: Right.</p><p>ELLISON: -- authority at this point is the state -- is the county.</p><p>WALLACE: Finally, and I got a little over a minute left here so I need a quick answer from you. As Attorney General you're part of the power structure in Minnesota and you have talked in the last few days about a deep dive reform, we're going to fix a broken society. But the fact is those were exactly the same things that were being said four years ago after a police officer shot and killed Philando Castile at a traffic stop. And, in fact, Castile -- the officer who shot him, was acquitted.</p><p>So why, I guess, frankly, should we believe -- why should people in the community believe you anymore than the people who were making those same assurances four years ago?</p><p>ELLISON: Fair question. I will tell you that we did have a year long task force on preventing deadly force encounters with police. We issued a report in February. We had law enforcement community civil rights. We had people all over the state of Minnesota. This is a real serious deeply rooted problem, Chris, and I'm committed in the long term.</p><p>I believe the Commissioner of Public Safety John Harrington is -- and the governor is -- look, I'll tell you, you know who used to -- who called for real (ph) change? Martin Luther King called for it. He was talking about police brutality back in the `60s. This problem is not a simple problem nor is it a localized problem. We all have to embrace change and move forward. And maybe this can help us do it.</p><p>WALLACE: Attorney General Ellison, thank you. Thanks for your time, sir. And it's good to speak with you.</p><p>ELLISON: Thank you, sir.</p><p>WALLACE: Up next, we'll talk with the head of Minnesota's chiefs of police association about the use of force by law enforcement and how to prevent more unnecessary deaths.</p><p>WALLACE: Police departments across the country are reviewing procedures after video showing the death of George Floyd while in custody.</p><p>Joining us now, Andy Skoogman, executive director of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association which represents 300 law enforcement officials in that state.</p><p>Mr. Skoogman, after this terrible incident this week you put out a statement that your association was, quote, \"appalled\" by Derek Chauvin, the police officer's actions and you applauded the fact that the police chief in Minneapolis fired all four of the officers involved in the incident. Why?</p><p>ANDY SKOOGMAN, MINNESOTA CHIEFS OF POLICE ASSOCIATION: Well, Chris, good morning. Thanks for the opportunity.</p><p>You know, I think there's -- when we spoke last week, you and I spoke, I think there's a national narrative, or there had been last week, that police officers in Minnesota are being trained in the technique that Derek Chauvin used and that is simply not the case. It is the furthest from the truth that exist.</p><p>We did condemn the actions of the officer, not only the technique used by Derek Chauvin, but the lack of empathy shown by the other officers on the scene. We did commend Chief Medaria Arradondo from Minneapolis for his quick actions in terminating those officers and, you know, maybe lay -- lay folks don't understand but the ability to terminate an officer that quickly is unprecedented, it doesn't happen very much.</p><p>So, as Attorney General Keith Ellison said in your previous segment, Medaria Arradondo is a phenomenal police chief and he did all the right things here.</p><p>What those officers did in that video certainly not aligned with all the values that the chief of Minneapolis has worked to instill over his tenure.</p><p>WALLACE: I want to -- I want to pick up, though, because the police report that was filed after the incident said that George Floyd, the man who was killed, resisted arrest and it also said that he died at the hospital when in fact it appears clear that he was dead at the scene. Those were both lies, which raises the question, if there had not been a video in this case, isn't it possible, even likely, that these four officers would still be on the street?</p><p>SKOOGMAN: Well, Chris, you know, I really am not privy to the details in the background of this investigation, so it is hard for me to say that.</p><p>But you know, the videos -- I've said this for many years, I've been in this position for six and a half years, I believe that cell phone videos, I believe body worn camera videos are game changers for law enforcement. They weed out the bad apples and they can be used to show great things and -- that police officers are doing.</p><p>So, video is definitely the key in this case as it is in so many other cases in this day and age.</p><p>WALLACE: You know, everybody now is talking about reform and fixing things, fixing things with the police, fixing things with society. I want to put up something that you said, Mr. Skoogman.</p><p>I think law enforcement in general is looking for ways to do a better job of connecting with communities of color.</p><p>You said that back in 2017 on the first anniversary of the shooting of Philando Castile at that traffic stop that we showed in the last segment. Yet here we are and it's 2020 and we have another case, apparently, of police brutality in the death of George Floyd.</p><p>So, I'm not -- I'm not trying to put all the blame on you, but how much should people trust these claims \"we're going to make things better\", when we keep hearing it?</p><p>SKOOGMAN: Yes, no, I think a fair question.</p><p>You know, the Attorney General Keith Ellison in your previous segment talked just briefly at the end about a working group here in Minnesota that he and Commissioner John Harrington, the commissioner of public safety here in Minnesota, they co-shared a working group. It was -- they got together last year, it's a diverse group, including law enforcement, stakeholders, community members, family members of individuals who had been shot and killed by law enforcement here in Minnesota over a number of years.</p><p>That working group was actually run by Ron Davis, who ran the COPS Office under -- in the President Obama administration.</p><p>WALLACE: Look, I just want -- I need to interrupt because we are short on time here. I can hear people watching this on TV right now and saying, good, we're glad you did the task force, all of that. George Floyd is still dead.</p><p>SKOOGMAN: Absolutely, Chris. It's entirely tragic. What we are trying to do is I think we just need to continue to work together. With got to get rid of this us versus them mentality. We got to continue the training that we put together here in Minnesota and across the country around implicit bias, training isn't everything but it's certainly a start.</p><p>We need to do a better job with law enforcement and in communities of color about recruiting new officers. I'm extremely concerned about the future of law enforcement across the country. We are seeing fewer and fewer people who want to be police officers, whether -- no matter what race they are, and that's a huge problem.</p><p>And I do think that -- the final thing that I can say about this is I believe that the arbitration process in our country needs to be changed. We have officers that violate public policy, they have a pattern of doing that, police chiefs and sheriffs try to fire them and our courts reinstate those jobs. So, there is a whole thing to look at from a variety of angles, Chris.</p><p>WALLACE: Mr. Skoogman, thank you. Thanks for sharing part of your weekend with us.</p><p>Up next, we'll hear from two leading African-American voices on the racial tensions playing out on America's streets. Professor Cornel West on what can be done to heal the divide, and Republican Senator Tim Scott on whether this racial flash point will turn out any differently.</p><p>WALLACE: This latest racial flashpoint may have started in the streets of Minneapolis but the angry reaction quickly spread to cities across the country. We want to discuss the state of race in America with two leading African-Americans.</p><p>First, Professor Cornel West of Harvard Divinity School.</p><p>Professor, I want to play three videos for you and then get your reaction.</p><p>First the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in February while jogging in a suburban neighborhood in Georgia.</p><p>Then, that incident in New York Central Park on Monday where a White woman called the police after a Black man asked her to put her dog on a leash.</p><p>Here's a clip.</p><p>(BEGIN CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: An African-American man threatening my life. I'm sorry. I can't hear (INAUDIBLE). I'm being threatened by a man at The Ramble. Please send the cops immediately.</p><p>(END CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: And then the alleged murder of George Floyd on a Minneapolis street. Professor West, what's going on?</p><p>CORNEL WEST, HARVARD DIVINITY SCHOOL PROFESSOR: Well, I think what we're seeing here is the ways in which the vicious legacy of white supremacy manifests in organized hatred, greed, and corruption. If we're dealing with moral meltdown and spiritual breakdown and the sad thing about this moment, my dear brother Chris, is that we are witnessing the collapse of the legitimacy of leadership; the political class, the economic class, the professional class. That's the deeper crisis.</p><p>And so, the beautiful thing is we're seeing citizens who are caring and concerned. They're hitting the streets. So you kill a black brother, each life, not matter what color, precious. We're seeing black, white, red, yellow, especially young people, coming together. That's a beautiful thing.</p><p>Many decades ago that wasn't the case. But the problem is we have a system --</p><p>WALLACE: Well, let me --</p><p>WEST: -- that's not responding and seems to be unable to respond. That's the problem my brother.</p><p>WALLACE: Professor, you said that this week we're witnessing America as your words a fair -- a failed social experiment. Now, clearly, there is continued racial inequality and as we can see continued racial injustice. But calling America a failed social experiment and some of the things you just said, isn't that going way too far?</p><p>I mean, you look back over the 50 years since 1968, which this has reminded a lot of people of, there has been substantial progress in terms of black education and black income. We elected an African American president and we re-elected an African American president.</p><p>Clearly, we can see it's not enough, but it's not nothing either.</p><p>WEST: Oh, no, no. I'm not saying there hasn't been progress. But as Brother Malcolm used to say, and, of course, your beloved father had that dialogue with Malcolm in '59, you don't stab folks in the back nine inches, pull it out three inches, and say you're making progress.</p><p>Yes, you made progress, especially for the black middle class. I'm talking about the Black poor and working class -- all poor and working class.</p><p>You see, brother Chris, I am a Revolutionary Christian looks at the world through the lens of the cross, not Pontius Pilate. I don't measure black progress in terms of black elites, how many black faces you have in high places. That's wonderful. That's beautiful. I'm concerned about the least of these.</p><p>I'm concerned about that Jesus that went into the temple and ran out the money changers. He was concerned about the least of these.</p><p>That's the traditional Martin King. That's the traditional of John Coltrane and Ella Baker. That's what we need now but the problem is we've got a system, my brother, that rationalizes legalized loot. Wall Street greed, Wall Street crimes, legalized murder too often.</p><p>WALLACE: OK.</p><p>WEST: And keep in mind, when -- when police kill fellow citizens, they kill white brothers and sisters too. Their lives are precious too. That's wrong too. But too many black and brown have been killed.</p><p>WALLACE: I want to -- I -- I -- OK.</p><p>WEST: You see -- you see my point?</p><p>WALLACE: So you -- we saw pictures of the riots and you said it's a beautiful thing that people are taking to the street.</p><p>WEST: Absolutely.</p><p>WALLACE: And you called -- this week you called the -- the death of George Floyd a -- let me get the words right -- a lynching at the highest level. You also said, thank God that we have people in the streets.</p><p>WEST: Absolutely.</p><p>WALLACE: Here, on the other hand, is what Atlanta's African-American mayor said about what's going on in her streets this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS, (D), ATLANTA, GEORGIA: This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. This is chaos. A protest has purpose.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: I got about two minutes here, Professor. Do you think that what we're seeing in the streets, riots, violence, looting in African-American neighborhoods, do you think that's doing any good for African-Americans?</p><p>WEST: No, most of my fellow citizens, God bless them, that are in the streets are there peaceful, who are there marching. And when it does spill over into violence, looting is wrong. But legalized looting is wrong too. Murder is wrong. Legalized murder is wrong too. I look at the wickedness at high places first and then keep track of the least of these.</p><p>We all have individual responsibility, but we're living in a system that seems to be unable to reform itself. And when you have such a moment, you get violent spillover. That's the concern.</p><p>If we're more concerned about the property and spillover than the poverty, decrepit school system, dilapidated housing, massive unemployment and under-employment, we're going to be doing this every five, every 10, every 20 years. And you and I are old enough to know, though, brother, going all the way back to the Harvard years. I remember when you were arrested right there in front of the Cambridge Prison itself of '69. We go over and over again. We got to make sure we don't pass it on to our younger generation.</p><p>WALLACE: Yes, but I -- let me just say, because I got to -- I -- I got to move -- I got to move on. I was there as a reporter. I wasn't there as a protestor.</p><p>WEST: No, no, I know. Oh, yes. Oh, no, I understand. I understand that, brother. I understand.</p><p>WALLACE: But, Professor, thank you. Thank -- thanks for joining us today.</p><p>WEST: Thank you so much, though, brother.</p><p>WALLACE: Now let's turn Republican Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina.</p><p>Senator, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): Thanks, Chris.</p><p>I want to ask you the same question that I asked at the start of Professor West, which is, you know, we've got the Arbery shooting, we've got that awful incident in Central Park, and then we've got this devastating video of what that white police officer to do George Floyd.</p><p>Same question, what is going on?</p><p>SCOTT: Well, there's no doubt that what we're having the opportunity to see is the absolute devastation of too many African-American males, over too many decades, frankly.</p><p>George Floyd, thankfully, was in a position where people were able to film it and video it and that's why we are having this conversation. Had it not been for someone videotaping this, it would not have happened. If it had not been for Mr. Arbery being videotaped, it would not have happened. Even though it happened, none of us would have known about it.</p><p>The Walter Scott case in 2015, had it not been for a video, it would not have happened. And when you read the police reports, you come to the conclusion that it didn't happen the way it happened until you have a video that substantiates what it is.</p><p>And perhaps, Chris, what we should focus on, as you said earlier, was the New York City woman who said to the Harvard black man that, I'm going to call the police and say my life is being threatened. What that says is that there is a lower value on an African-American male life than it is on a white woman's life. And that is part of what played out there and that is part of the significant thing that we need to focus on.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, I would -- let me -- Senator, let me -- Senator, let me pick up on that --</p><p>SCOTT: Certainly.</p><p>WALLACE: Because this does seem -- this does seem, sir, to be a systemic problem.</p><p>SCOTT: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: And I want to put up some numbers that -- that indicate that. Young men of color are two and a half times more likely to die at the hands of police than white men. And police use of force -- this is astonishing to me -- is the sixth leading cause of death for young men of color.</p><p>SCOTT: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: How do you explain that, sir?</p><p>SCOTT: Well, I -- I can only explain that by saying that there's too much abuse within law enforcement towards African-American men. I have been a victim, seven times stopped in one year as an elected official just driving while black. So I'm not going to pretend that there isn't a major racial component.</p><p>But what I will suggest to you is what I believe is actually happening. Thank God for video. Thank God for film. Think God for this conversation that we're having today and thank God we're having it in America because if you weren't not in America, you probably couldn't have this conversation.</p><p>It is not a binary choice, progress or regression. You can actually have both at the same time. We're seeing a lot of goodwill. We're seeing a diversity in the protests that we did not see in the '60s.</p><p>John Lewis would be proud of the non-violent protesters that we're seeing today, black, white, red and brown. What he was saying and what I am saying -- what he -- actually, what he did say is that any violence in the midst of this -- these protests --</p><p>WALLACE: Right.</p><p>SCOTT: Simply takes away from the actual issue, which is that George Floyd lost his life. It looks like murder to me. Let's get the investigation started and finished so that we will have more confidence in a legal system that we can all say, this is a system where the woman has a blindfold on.</p><p>WALLACE: Senator -- Senator, I want to follow upon on something that Professor West said, which is that, you know, we have to talk not only about what is going on in the riots in the streets, we have to talk about what is going on among people at the highest levels of our society. And I want to put up some tweets that were sent out by President Trump this week.</p><p>The first one, this was about the riots in Minneapolis. These thugs are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd. Any difficulty and we will assume control. But when the looting starts, the shooting starts.</p><p>And that I want to put up another series of tweets, Senator Scott, and these were after there were protests that turned violent at the White House on Friday night. The president praised the Secret Service. He said, nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs and the most ominous weapons I have ever seen. Many Secret Service agents just waiting for action. We put the young ones on the front line, sir, they love it, and good practice.</p><p>Now, obviously, Secret Service has to protect the president, but, you know, you -- you've -- you're not as old as I am or Cornel West, but you have seen racial tensions in this country. When we hear about the looting starts, the shooting starts, when you hear about vicious police dogs, is that kind of talk from the president of the United States constructive at this moment?</p><p>SCOTT: Well, those are not constructive tweets, without any question. I'll say this, I spoke with the president yesterday morning and he and I had a good conversation about what are the next steps. I told him what I'm going to tell you, which is, Mr. President, it helps us when you focus on the death, the unjustified, in my opinion, the criminal death of George Floyd. Those tweets are very helpful. It is helpful when you say what you said yesterday, which is that it's important for us to recognize the benefit of non-violent protests. It is helpful when you respond to my request to have the Department of Justice, led by Attorney General Barr, have a commission and a conversation around race and justice in this nation. Mr. President, it is helpful when you lead with compassion. And the tweets that I saw yesterday were far better.</p><p>WALLACE: OK, but -- but -- but, Senator Scott, I've got a minute left, did you -- did you -- did you, sir, did you speak truth to power and did you say to him, when you talk about thugs, when you talk about looting and shooting and you talk about vicious police dogs, what did you say about that?</p><p>SCOTT: I used similar words that you just used, which as we talked about the fact that there's a constructive way to -- to have a dialogue with a nation and, in a similar fashion, that we had a conversation after Charlottesville. The president will listen if you engage him with the facts of the issue and then you ask him to focus on -- his attention on making progress as one nation under God.</p><p>I think is tweets yesterday were far more responsive after the conversation. I'm thankful that we can have that conversation. We don't always agree. I didn't agree with some of his tweets beforehand, but we have the ability to sit down and dialogue on how we move this nation forward and not let the detractors get in the way of what has been a pretty phenomenal couple of years economically.</p><p>WALLACE: Senator --</p><p>SCOTT: Yes, Chris.</p><p>WALLACE: Senator Scott, thank you. Thanks for coming in today. Always good to talk with you, sir.</p><p>SCOTT: Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss rising tensions over racial inequality and the president's war with Twitter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE FREEMAN, HENNEPIN COUNTY ATTORNEY: I'm here to announce the former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin is in custody.</p><p>GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN): The absolute chaos. This is not grieving and this is not -- this is not making a statement that we fully acknowledge needs to be fixed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Reaction from Minnesota officials to the alleged murder of George Floyd by a white policeman this week.</p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group.</p><p>Former Trump National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton, anchor of \"THE DAILY BRIEFING,\" Dana Perino, and Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service.</p><p>The country is going through a tough time right now and minorities are going through the toughest time. I want to put up some statistics.</p><p>More than 100,000 people died from the coronavirus. More than 40 million jobs lost. And if you want to get a sense of how that has especially hitting minorities, in Minnesota, more than one-third of Covid cases are African-Americans, although they're just 6 percent of the population of that state.</p><p>And then, of course, now the George Floyd case.</p><p>Mo, is that why we're seeing these violent demonstrations across the country at this moment? Is this a kind of perfect storm?</p><p>MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE, FORMER DNC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Look, this is probably one of the saddest moments in this country in my lifetime, right? It's all -- it's everything you just said coming together, colliding in -- in -- in a terrible way. And it is disproportionately hurting people of color and minority communities.</p><p>I think it's important to recognize, though, that there is a difference between the protesters who are out there making a legitimate point fighting for justice, and the rioters and looters who are exploiting the death of George Floyd and exploiting this moment for whatever reason that they are. We're seeing the best and worst of America right now. We are seeing police officers marching with protesters. We're seeing police officers take a knee in prayer at these protests with the protesters.</p><p>But we're also seeing these violent clashes between criminals and the police, and rioters and the police.</p><p>WALLACE: Right.</p><p>ELLEITHEE: And the police overreaching into many cases. So it is -- you know, we could sure use some leadership to try to bring us all together, bring us all together the way past presidents have, but it -- we also all have to take the responsibility ourselves. And -- and that starts in the streets, it starts in the communities.</p><p>WALLACE: OK, let me -- let me bring in -- we've got limited time here, Mo, so let me bring in Dana.</p><p>How do you explain this explosion of violence across the country far from where this terrible incident happened in Minneapolis?</p><p>DANA PERINO, ANCHOR, \"THE DAILY BRIEFING\": Well, you know, I am humble enough to say that I -- I don't know. And I think a lot of people this morning wake up and just feel, again, this incredible sense of sadness and a little bit of fear and some humility is in order from leadership, but also some leadership is needed.</p><p>I believe the nation needs a circuit breaker. There -- we have to figure out a way to deal with what we can going forward. A lot of this frustration was borne out because of something that happened on Monday where Derek Chauvin kneeled on the officers neck -- on -- on George Floyd's neck. He died. Many other people -- if this had been anyone else, that person would have been put in jail under probable cause until charged. That didn't happen. And we can't go back and fix that.</p><p>I do think that right now local leadership needs to figure out a way to get everybody in a room and start talking about how they can do things, because a government can't heal a heart, but it can do a couple of things well, which is, one, restore law and order --</p><p>WALLACE: Right.</p><p>PERINO: But also figure out a way to mete out justice, consistently, every day, equally, for everyone.</p><p>WALLACE: And then there is the escalating battle between President Trump and the social media giants, and that escalated this week with the -- Twitter tagging two of the president's tweets, one on the alleged corruption of mail-in voting, and then the other one about when the looting starts, the shooting starts.</p><p>Here's the president responding to that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The choices that Twitter makes when it chooses to suppress and it blacklists, shadow ban are editorial decisions, pure and simple.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Michael, what do you think of the president's decision to try to regulate, to try to limit Twitter? Is it good policy? And, realistically, in the midst of a presidential election, and also the Senate and of the House election, what are the chances that he's actually going to be able to do this?</p><p>MICHAEL ANTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: I agree with what Attorney General Barr said late last week, I think Friday. He said that this is not just Twitter but all the social media companies essentially pulled a bait and switch on the country, that they rose to prominence, they grew their markets by saying that we're -- they were neutral platforms, that anybody could say anything, and they were indifferent to and had nothing to do with content.</p><p>And now that they have great market power, you know, huge audiences, gigantic user bases and so on, they've decided to influence the message that takes place on their platform. There're not -- they're no longer neutral platforms, and so they've changed their behavior and -- and there are, you know, government regulations that would have -- have applied to them had they been sort of honest about this all along and they're going to apply to them now. So I think what the attorney general said was right and this is -- this is long overdue. We're -- we're addressing -- we're addressing a fact that has been in place for a long time, but we've been pretending it wasn't true for at least five or ten years.</p><p>WALLACE: Dana, I want to look at this from -- from both sides. Is this a -- a fight that it's smart for the president to take on in the midst of his campaign for re-election? And what about Twitter? Was it smart for them to start tagging or putting alerts in front of presidential tweets? Don't you go down a very slippery slope there if you're going to call of the president, don't you have to call out Joe Biden? If you're going to call out Republicans, don't you have to call out Democrats?</p><p>PERINO: Well, I absolutely think it's a win for President Trump and a loser for Twitter, for Twitter's decision that they made this week. There are many people on the -- on the right who believe that the game is rigged. And the president said, all right, I think that the refs are working for the other side. So by taking this action, he decided to work the refs a little bit.</p><p>Twitter then decided to take a tweet about mail-in voting -- of all the tweets that you could have chosen, they decide to take on this one on mail- in voting. They had to then fact-check themselves twice to clarify what they meant.</p><p>And I do think that when you are fact-checking the president of the United States but not the leader of Iran, then you have absolutely opened up Pandora's Box. And, you know, FaceBook separates itself by saying, like, we are not going to fact-check the president.</p><p>I think one of the things -- like speaking to what Michael Anton just said, I don't think that these social media companies should look at President Trump as anything different than a citizen. I understand his words carry a lot of weight --</p><p>WALLACE: Right.</p><p>PERINO: But you have to apply these things equally. And if not, they're going to face some regulation.</p><p>WALLACE: I've got about a minute left for you, Mo. Your thoughts about what's going on here both on the side of Twitter tagging the president and the president talking about trying to establish some limits on what Twitter and the other social media giants can do.</p><p>Mo, are you with us?</p><p>ELLEITHEE: Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry.</p><p>WALLACE: I think we lost him.</p><p>ELLEITHEE: You cut out there for a second, Chris.</p><p>No, no, I apologize, I -- you got me know.</p><p>Look, I -- you know, to Dana's point, you know, if they were going to treat him like any other citizen, he would have been kicked off the platform by now, right? The president of the United States has been violating the terms of service and we've seen Twitter apply those terms of service to other people. This isn't censorship, this is them calling him out for violating those terms of service.</p><p>But the content's still there. People can still see it for themselves whether it's when he's being faxed checked or when he's glorifying violence. But I do think they're going to have to do a better job of applying it across the board.</p><p>WALLACE: Thank you, panel, see you next Sunday. A very busy, very difficult week.</p><p>Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week,\" the author whose brand-new novel foresees much of the pandemic we're going through right now.</p><p>WALLACE: You can't deny the eerie timing of a new novel about a fictitious global pandemic. The book parallels, with uncanny accuracy, much of what we're seeing right now.</p><p>Here's our \"Power Player of the Week.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAWRENCE WRIGHT, AUTHOR, \"THE END OF OCTOBER\": The experts in the field all were quite apprised of what would happen when something like this comes into our society.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Lawrence Wright finished his latest novel, \"The End of October,\" in 2019, but it reads like a front page in 2020, a deadly virus spreading globally, scientists fighting with politicians, a stock market plunged, even a vice president put in charge of the response.</p><p>WRIGHT: It wasn't prophecy, Chris, as has been said. It was, you know, just -- the question was, what would happen if -- if we had a pandemic? You know, a really virulent, highly contagious one?</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): How unsettling is it right now to be watching the news and see so much of it follow your plot?</p><p>WRIGHT: Well, it's dismaying. And I hope it stops. My book is pretty bleak.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): The virus in the book begins in Indonesia, then spreads to Mecca, as millions of pilgrims arrive for the annual hajj, and doctors race to save lives.</p><p>WRIGHT: I was fascinated by the ingenuity and, as I saw it, the heroism of people like my hero who go out into these hot zones and face these novel diseases with so little preparation and no understanding of what might happen. To me, that's just terrifying.</p><p>WALLACE: Celebrities like Taylor Swift and Brad Pitt succumbed to the virus, but not everyone.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): So, I'm reading your book and suddenly I pop up grilling the Russians foreign minister.</p><p>WRIGHT: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: How did that happen?</p><p>WRIGHT: I employed certain personalities in the book, some of them real, you being one. You're lucky I didn't kill you off like I did with Anderson Cooper. So I don't want you to complain too much, Chris.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Wright is no stranger to writing about disasters. He won a non-fiction Pulitzer Prize for \"The Looming Tower,\" on the rise of Islamic terrorism and the run-up to 9/11. He says a famous movie director inspired his latest book.</p><p>WRIGHT: Ridley Scott wanted me to write a script about how civilization would collapse. And, you know, I thought about nuclear war and so on, but I just thought, pandemic.</p><p>WALLACE: But Wright says he misjudged the end of civilization part, and thank goodness.</p><p>WRIGHT: I didn't give enough credit to individuals for voluntarily sequestering themselves in their homes for months at a time.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): In terms of lives and livelihoods, how do you think this all ends?</p><p>WRIGHT: Like a war or a depression, a pandemic is like an x-ray into our society. We can see all the broken places. We know where our shortcomings are. And we have the opportunity to remedy them.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: And now the countdown to the countdown.</p><p>As you may know, I've also written a new book.

We're eight days from the first contest in the race for the White House. Will Iowa be make-or-break for Pete Buttigieg?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BUTTIGIEG:  They call me Mayor Pete, and I am running for president of the United States.</p><p>WALLACE:  He entered the race a relative unknown.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  What's the best way to pronounce your last name?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Buttigieg.</p><p>WALLACE:  But things have changed since our first town hall last May.</p><p>Mayor Pete Buttigieg.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>He shot to the top tier of 2020 candidates. The Democratic field got a lot smaller. Then his rivals started taking shots.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  We set this up in a way to solve the problem without running up $20 trillion, $30 trillion, $40 trillion.</p><p>WARREN:  The numbers that the mayor is offering just don't add up.</p><p>WALLACE:  A win in Iowa could show Mayor Pete has what it takes to go all the way. But questions remain about his experience, his electability, and support from key groups.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  The black voters who know me best are supporting me.</p><p>WALLACE:  The stakes are high. Can the former mayor from the Midwest close the deal?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  If you make me the next president, I'll work every day to make you proud.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Good evening from the River Center in downtown Des Moines. Tonight it's the site of our Fox News town hall, with a now former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg. Folks here have a lot of questions they want to ask, so let's get right to it. Ladies and gentlemen, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE:  Folks, we've got a lot of questions. You got to sit down so we can actually ask them.</p><p>And before -- and we are going to get the good questions that were submitted by people here, but first I want to ask you a question about the terrible news we heard today about the tragic death of basketball great Kobe Bryant and his daughter, 13-year-old daughter. He was taking her to a basketball game. I'm sure some folks here may not know this news yet -- taking her to a basketball game. She -- they crashed, a helicopter crash.</p><p>One of the things we ask our leaders to do is to make sense out of senseless events. Your thoughts about the death of Kobe Bryant?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, it's shocking. And I think we're all still in shock about what happened. And I think it's a reminder that our lives are often touched by people we never even meet. And there are millions of people -- not just in Los Angeles, but around the world right now -- mourning because they were inspired by what he did on the field, what he meant off the field. And it's also, of course, such a tough human moment to think about, that he was spending time with his daughter, and her loss is unthinkable, as is that of everybody who was on that helicopter. And I think all of America is united in mourning and sending our love and our thoughts and, of course, our prayers to the families.</p><p>WALLACE:  Thank you.</p><p>Our first question in the town hall here is from Noah Manderfeld, and it's about impeachment. Noah?</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi, Pete.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Hi.</p><p>QUESTION:  With the impeachment hearings underway in Washington, the question isn't necessarily whether Donald Trump did hold funds from Ukraine in search of political dirt on a rival. Rather, whether he should be removed from office because of it. Do you believe he should be removed from office?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  I do. And if he's not, it's going to send a message that this Senate, or at least Senate Republicans today, think that it's OK to lie, it's OK to cheat, it's OK to involve a foreign government or pressure a foreign government to get involved in American elections.</p><p>Just now, we're getting more indications about John Bolton, indicating what he knew, which is one more reason why, if this is a serious trial, we've got to have the witnesses and the evidence who can help explain what happened.</p><p>I've never seen these lengths gone to prevent witnesses and evidence that, according to the president, would show that he's innocent. Kind of makes you think.</p><p>But let's be honest about what's going on, on the floor of the Senate. The Senate GOP has made it clear that it's not going to be a fair trial. And I think the effect of that on a lot of us, certainly on me, is it's exhausting. You just watch this process. They're sending the message it's a foregone conclusion, doesn't matter what the evidence is, what the witnesses are, or, frankly, what the president admitted to doing in broad daylight on television. None of that matters.</p><p>And I think it's designed to make us kind of turn it off and walk away. And the great thing about being a voter, the great thing about 2020, especially in Iowa and other early states where voters have so much influence, is that this is a chance to respond. Nobody here has a vote on the floor of the Senate, but no matter what they do in Senate, the last word comes to the American people. And this is our chance to send a message that, no, that's not OK. And if the Senate won't say so, we will.</p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor, our next question comes from Scott Matter. He has a question about electability and experience. Scott?</p><p>QUESTION:  Mayor Pete, you'll be 39 years old a year from now when you're sworn in as president. How do you think that your age -- or will your age be a factor when you're working with members of Congress, many of whom are several decades older than yourself?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, one thing that I got comfortable with early as a mayor was having colleagues, was having appointees, and other elected officials I had to work with who were older than I am. I think I'm the exact median age of the United States of America right now, actually -- right about 38. So half of the country is younger and half of the country is older.</p><p>And what I'm seeing is a hunger to make sure that we're delivering solutions that are oriented toward the future. You know, right now, we are facing issues whose scope was not seen a few years or decades ago. Just think about what we're up against as a country, figuring out how to regulate big tech, dealing with global health security issues, climate change leaping off the pages of scientific papers and becoming a clear and present danger with impacts all around us right now, different kinds of international issues, cyber security.</p><p>We're moving into an era that I think is going to call for a worldview that is informed by those experiences from a younger generation. And I'm ready to bring those experiences into the White House.</p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor, our next question comes from Caleb Lillquist who wants to talk to you about the polarization in our politics today.</p><p>QUESTION:  Mr. Buttigieg, there is a common theme in your messages about trying to fix a divided nation that has become polarized over the past years. Other than creating policy that appeals to both sides of the political spectrum, how do you plan to appeal to Republican voters in order to steal them -- steer them away from voting for President Trump?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Yeah. Well, first of all, we're doing it right now. This network is known for having a lot of more conservative viewers. But I don't think that you have to be a Democrat to see what is wrong with this president and this presidency.</p><p>I'm meeting a lot of what I like to call future former Republicans who are coming to my events. And I'm not pretending that we're going to agree on everything. I'm not trying to trick anybody. But my message is that we can at least agree on this, that if you're having trouble looking your kids in the eye and explaining this presidency to them, that you have a choice.</p><p>But the really important thing I think to remember, not just in order to win but in order to govern, is that if there is an American majority that can agree on what we're against, there's an even bigger majority that agrees on what we're for.</p><p>Remember, I'm proposing things that most Americans even in conservative states think we ought to do:  raising wages, making sure that corporations pay their fair share in taxes, delivering paid family leave, doing something about gun violence.</p><p>You know, more than 80 percent of Republicans thinks we ought to at least be doing universal background checks. These are things that most Americans want to see happen. And I believe that's important to remember from the perspective of what it's going to take to govern in the future, because a big issue we have right now is that a majority in the American people isn't necessarily being reflected by a majority on the floor of the American Congress.</p><p>So it's going to take presidential leadership to hold senators to account and make sure they're responding to these ideas and these reforms that are viewed as necessary not just by my fellow Democrats, but by independents and an awful lot of Republicans.</p><p>So we don't have to choose between being bold and being unifying. This is my point. Some folks are saying you've got to pick one or the other or that you've got to measure boldness by how many people you can turn off and turn away. I think that actually these bold ideas about how to make American life better are part of how we're going to unify the country. And we have to unify this country, because it has become dangerously divided and frighteningly polarized. This is our chance to do something about that, and it's at the core of my campaign.</p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor, I want to pick up on these last two questions, because it seems to me they strike a common theme. And I think it's fair to say it's the biggest knock against you among voters who might be receptive to your message, and that is the question of your lack of experience, especially in areas that are so key and so important to being president of the United States.</p><p>You were the mayor of the 305th largest city in America. You were never elected with more than 11,000 votes in any of your successful elections. You've never run a business. The flipside, you're obviously smart as the Dickens, you served in the military. But what makes you, given your life experience, what makes you qualified, what makes you ready to be able to run the largest enterprise in the world, the United States government?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, look, anyone ought to be humbled by the scope of the American presidency and what it requires. And the reality is, there is no job like the presidency.</p><p>But I also think we've got to ask what kind of experience we're looking for. And that's what the American people are going to decide. Look, I'll admit, if what you're looking for is the most years spent in Washington, you've got a clear choice and it's not going to be me.</p><p>But I would also argue that the kind of experience you have governing on the ground in a city of any size is the kind of experience we need a little more of in Washington, because we don't have the luxury of alternative facts. We have to get things done. We can't shut down a city government over a partisan disagreement. There wouldn't be any drinking water. We just have to get it solved. And I think we'd be well served if we'd get Washington to work a little more like our best cities and towns.</p><p>Now, if I were the 305th most senior member of Congress, I'm not sure that folks would be as surprised by my candidacy. But this is exactly my point. And actually, the fact that the city that I'm from and the city that I led is not one of America's biggest global cities, that's part of the point, as well. There are so many communities in Iowa and across America that have felt passed over, in addition to neighborhoods in some of our biggest cities that just feel they're being ignored by the political process.</p><p>I think we need a voice -- frankly, I think my party needs to provide more voices from these kinds of communities that hold so much of the key to the future of this country and that need answers from a Washington that can't seem to speak to us anymore, that isn't even paying attention.</p><p>We've got a president saying the economy's fantastic because the Dow Jones is looking good. And I think in a lot of our communities that are not necessarily the biggest cities, as well as some neighborhoods in our biggest cities, folks are saying, great, when is that getting to my kitchen table?</p><p>It's just a different perspective, just like having served brings a different perspective and coming from the generation that I come from brings a different perspective. And I believe -- look, I've heard some folks saying this is no time to take a risk. And I agree. But I think the biggest risk that we could take right now would be to try to go up against this president with the same, old playbook that we've been relying on that helps explains how we got here in the first place. I think it's time for something completely different.</p><p>WALLACE:  We have a...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALLACE:  We have a different question, this one comes from Stephanie Dicken, a former elementary schoolteacher. She has a question about your standing in the African-American community. Stephanie?</p><p>QUESTION:  First of all, I'd like to thank you for your service as a vet and as a public servant.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Thank you.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you very much.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So there seems to be a lack of enthusiasm for you in the black community. I believe that no one is perfect and that we can all learn from our mistakes. I also believe that we should surround ourselves with people who can support us and help us be successful. So can you tell me a little bit about your police department in South Bend, the lessons that you've learned, and how you plan to overcome the concerns of your voters?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Absolutely. You know, one of the most painful issues of racial justice, in particular affecting black families in our country, is this wall of mistrust between communities of color and police departments. And we have experienced that in my city.</p><p>We had a police shooting that took the life of one of our residents, Eric Logan, last year that caused tremendous anguish in our city. And we've been working on issues related to justice in policing for the entire time that I was mayor.</p><p>Now, I can tell you all of the things that we were able to do working side by side to deliver improvements, to bring more residents into the process, to add transparency to what was happening with the use of force. And you know what? Once we started publishing data in great detail about use of force online for all to see, use of force went down in our city.</p><p>But other things were a tremendous struggle. And we were not able to reach the point that I wanted us to, including recruiting and retaining more officers of color. When you're a mayor, you don't get to just comment on these things or debate them or legislate over them. We're on the ground every day trying get this done.</p><p>And in response to some of the tragedies we experienced as a community, we called the community in to be part of the solution, creating opportunities to sit together side by side and craft different kinds of policies on everything from the way body cameras were used to how training works in our department.</p><p>And there are a lot of lessons we learned the hard way that I think about every day when I'm looking at what we could do with the powers of the presidency to deal not only with the problems of racial justice in policing, but more broadly the problem of systemic racism in this country.</p><p>And the reality is, the racial inequality that we see around us is often getting worse and it's not going to get better on its own. You can't just rub out a racist policy and replace it with a neutral one and expect everything to get better.</p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor, I want to just pick up on this, and we need to wrap up this segment, because we've got a lot more questions. In our first town hall, last May, I asked you about this question of your lack of support in the African-American community, which was then less than 1 percent, and here's what you said then. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  I think that's particularly true of black and brown voters who are just skeptical of people who come along seemingly out of nowhere. And so it's why we've worked so hard to make sure that as we go into this summer in our outreach and in our substance that we're speaking to voters who are concerned with what the next president can do to deal with, for example, the glaring racial inequities that we see in our society.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Now, that was eight months ago. And for all of your outreach in these eight months, you're -- last national poll, you're at 2 percent support among African-Americans. I guess the question is, is it just possible that the African-Americans -- we've been talking to them all over around the country, especially in South Carolina, which obviously has one of the early primaries, that they have heard you, that they have learned about your record, and they just think there would be another Democratic candidate who would represent them better?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, I'll tell you this. Having eight months to introduce yourself is, of course, not the same as having 20 or 30 or 40 years. But I'll also say that...</p><p>WALLACE:  But eight months from now, we're going to have the election.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  That's right. And when I'm engaging -- first of all, I should note that the support that I have that is the strongest among African-American voters is in my own community, where people know me best. And, yes, we have work to do to make sure that that extends in particular into the South.</p><p>But when we were, for example, the other day in South Carolina, at a black-owned business engaging in a conversation about economic empowerment, one of the biggest things I heard about was just the determination to make sure we get a candidate who can win. And I'm mindful that that's one of the things you've got to show, not just tell. And, of course, Iowa is the first opportunity we'll get on the calendar to demonstrate that we can do just that.</p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor, we have a lot more questions for you, coming up after a quick break. Folks here want to ask you about your plans for Medicare and foreign policy and other issues you would face as president. That's next as we come to you live from the River Center here in Des Moines, Iowa.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  And we're back now with our town hall with Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Julie Morneau is our next questioner, and she wants to ask you, Mayor, about healthcare.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  All right.</p><p>WALLACE:  Julie?</p><p>QUESTION:  So one of the core pieces of the ACA are the subsidies provided to help make insurance affordable for the average Pete. With recent changes to legislation and revenue sources for the subsidies that -- that no longer existing, what would you do to keep the costs of policies down while Medicare for all who want it is being implemented?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Yes. So this is one of the reasons why we've got to pay attention to the whole system. There's a big debate going on about which coverage plan is best. Of course, I think mine, Medicare for all who want it, is best.</p><p>We've also got to look at the cost side. Now, one thing that we can do is deliver a quality public plan where the premiums never go above 8.5 percent of your income, and that's part of the design of my plan, and that's why I think most people will choose it in the end. I just trust people to choose it on their own.</p><p>But we also need to make sure that we're prepared to fund the subsidies that make health care affordable, whether it's under the ACA, in my vision, for all Americans. And that means we can't be afraid to talk about revenue.</p><p>Now, there are two steps you can take that would fund the entirety of what I'm proposing in health care for 10 years. Just two things you got to do. One of them is roll back the Trump corporate tax cuts...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... which I think most us think is the right thing to do. And the other one is such a commonsense move that it's kind of astonishing it hasn't happen already, and that is to finally allow Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs with the drug companies. If we do that, there is enough revenue to maintain those subsidies you're asking about. And we should.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor, you talk about being at least relatively speaking a moderate, a centrist, particularly in comparison to some of your opponents in this race, like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. And, in fact, right now you're fundraising very much against Bernie Sanders by saying he could win here in Iowa and if he does, he can't beat Donald Trump and you believe you can.</p><p>We looked, though, at all of your domestic proposals. And we want to put them up on the screen. We added them up:  a trillion dollars for childcare and college aid and affordable housing, $2 trillion to address climate change, $1.5 trillion to pay for Medicare for all who want it. And then when you add that up to all of your other plans, it comes to $5.7 million -- or trillion dollars, rather, in new spending.</p><p>Question:  What's moderate about that?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, it's the right thing to do. And I suppose it's moderate in the sense that most Americans want us to take those steps. Now, it costs a fraction of what some of my competitors in this primary are proposing. The health care piece alone, folks can't seem to agree whether it's $20 trillion or $40 trillion.</p><p>I figured out a way to do it that is affordable. Now, $5.7 trillion is not a small amount of money. But I'm also committing that everything that I propose is paid for, that the sum total of all the things I've offered up in this campaign will be at worst be deficit neutral and ultimately will actually reduce the deficit.</p><p>And I think it's time for my party to be a little more comfortable owning the issue of the deficit, because even though I'm the youngest person running for president, I'm old enough to remember when Republicans talked about the deficit all the time, only for this president to have a trillion-dollar deficit on his watch, mostly as a consequence of these giant tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy.</p><p>If we make these commonsense moves around corporate tax cuts, around negotiating drug prices, around things like closing the loopholes that allow people to park their profits elsewhere, dealing with the fact that a company like Amazon, on billions of dollars in profits, pays exactly zero in taxes, we can pay for all of the things I'm proposing.</p><p>And unlike tax cuts on the wealthiest, the investments that I'm proposing actually do pay for themselves. That's why we have federal investment in infrastructure, health, and education. It is affordable compared to doing nothing for sure, especially when it comes to climate.</p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor, you may want to listen to this next question, because Juliana Martinez -- Juliana, where you are? Stand up -- is already a president, which you are not yet.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Oh.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUESTION:  She's the student body president at Dordt University in Sioux Center. Juliana, your question?</p><p>QUESTION:  During the Des Moines debate earlier this month, you mentioned that Democrats have a better track record than Republicans do when it comes to tackling debt in America. You also went on to say that you would support money being thrown towards education, childcare, and the environment. How are you going to increase government spending while also decreasing national debt?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Great, Madam President.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Let me unpack a little bit of what I was just mentioning, because there's this idea out there that we couldn't possibly make the investments we need to without tax levels that put pressure on the economy. And it's just not true.</p><p>The kinds of reforms that I'm talking about are about making sure that corporations and the wealthiest pay their fair share. We don't have to go back to the levels of taxes that we had in the '50s and '60s, although it's worth mentioning that our economy grew pretty well back then, too. All we have to do is have the tax code actually make sense.</p><p>And when we do, when we make these investments, something like early childhood education, something like making sure we've got the kind of infrastructure that our country deserves, instead of crumbling roads and bridges, making sure that broadband is getting out to rural areas and that we pay attention to our digital infrastructure, and, of course, preventing a climate catastrophe that is already starting to show its face in our communities, that is an investment in the future. It will pay for itself, and we'll be really glad we did it in the years to come.</p><p>WALLACE:  Next question from Wade Steinke on foreign policy. Wade?</p><p>QUESTION:  Hello, Mayor Pete. Thank you for being here today. My question is, how would you balance pulling us out of the Middle East versus maintaining commitments to our allies in the region?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, that's always been an important issue, and it just got a lot more important because of the president's steps that have destabilized a region that was already one of the most volatile in the world.</p><p>Here's what we've got to do. It starts by recognizing that we don't have to choose between endless war and completely disappearing from the world stage. What we've got to do is decide what our priorities are and raise the bar for the use of force.</p><p>Think about what was happening in Syria. In northern Syria, you had a tiny handful of people, some highly specialized intelligence and special operations personnel, holding the line. They didn't take responsibility for turning Syria into Switzerland. Their job was to make sure that the worst things were prevented. And when the president pulled the rug out from that, we saw the effect.</p><p>We've seen the effects of the decision to have that strike in Iraq that has complicated an already complicated situation, both with Iraq and, of course, moved us closer to the brink of war with Iran.</p><p>What we need to do is build up, not tear up our international partnerships, because American lives depend on our relationships with our allies. And we shouldn't be doing any of this alone. We shouldn't have to be doing any of this alone.</p><p>Because at our best, America is standing for things like democracy and human rights and stability that are not just American values. They're human values that are shared around the world. And, frankly, part of our strategic edge is that we stand for those things.</p><p>But it only works if we're authentically living up to them, and that starts right at home, because how can we be a force for stability and human rights and democracy and freedom abroad if our own president is echoing the vocabulary of dictators, saying that, for example, unfavorable coverage is the work of the enemy of the people? We've got to get our own house in order, and then we will be in much better position for global leadership.</p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor, let's...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Let's play this out in real time. And I don't even know if you know this, but there has been a rocket attack tonight on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. They believe it was not the Iranians, but Iranian-backed militias. They hit the embassy. We know, according to U.S. officials, there were no fatalities. We don't know yet whether or not there were any casualties.</p><p>But, again, a rocket attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad by Iranian-backed militias. What does President Buttigieg do in this moment? What questions are you asking? What steps are you taking?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, first, we have to take steps to make sure that U.S. personnel are safe, and we have to look at a proportional response or preventative actions to make sure this can't happen again. And we should be coordinating with our allies in order to make sure that safety is enhanced as we move forward.</p><p>Look, these are not the kinds of conflicts that we were used to a dcc or a generation ago. We're talking about complicated dynamics with proxy fighting, with different kinds of players, sometimes hard to even tell where something came from. And that's the world that the next president is going to have to manage.</p><p>But the other thing is that we've got to manage that with a view to the people, the humans, the Americans who are impacted. That's why it was so disturbing to hear the president seem to brush away the traumatic brain injuries of the Americans who were injured by the Iranian missile attack in Iraq.</p><p>We're talking about somebody who as a privileged son of a multi-millionaire faked an injury in order to avoid serving, goes on to become the president, and minimizes the real injuries of those who did. This is exactly why someone like Donald Trump has no business anywhere near the Situation Room, because you have to be able to make these decision with the perspective of those who have their lives on the line every minute that they are in the Middle East or in the region.</p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor, we have to...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor, we have to take a break here. When we come back, we'll hear from more voters about more of the big issues on their minds, like climate change and abortion.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  And welcome back to our Fox News town hall with Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Correspondent Peter Doocy has been on the trail here in Iowa the past few months in the lead-up to the first in the nation contest. And he takes a look now at the special role Iowa plays in choosing our next president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOOCY:  For many Iowans, the caucuses are a family tradition.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yeah, Iowans take this very seriously. They study up on this every four years.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think Iowans are really good about hearing all the facts and sorting things through.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Here you go and you say, oh, I had so and so, I had dinner with Representative So-and-So, or I -- you know, and it's amazing. This is democracy.</p><p>DOOCY:  There's an old adage that there are only three tickets out of Iowa, because only John McCain finished outside the top three and became his party's nominee. Iowa Democrats have a better track record of picking eventual nominees. Seven out of 10 Democratic caucus winners captured the nomination, compared to 3 out of 8 Republicans. And two Democratic Iowa winners have gone on to become president, Carter and Obama.</p><p>OBAMA:  You have done what the cynics said we couldn't do.</p><p>DOOCY:  Compared to just one Republican, George W. Bush.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  That begins right here in Iowa on February 3rd, and I'm hoping you'll make it possible.</p><p>DOOCY:  A lot changes cycle to cycle, but the focus will remain on issues and not impeachment.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I'm not paying too much attention to that, because it's kind of out of our hands.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  It's kind of something that has to be done, but not something that's going to, I don't think, move a lot of votes.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  You know what? I don't think it makes any difference. We're too close to the caucus time.</p><p>DOOCY:  It's so close to the caucus time t that the senators that have to leave tonight to go back for the impeachment trial may only have one day left to campaign in the state before the caucuses and a day that a lot of Iowans might be busy in the afternoon, Super Bowl Sunday. Chris?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Pete, thank you.</p><p>Mayor, let's talk about the polls. And I got to say, every poll seems to have a different leader. But let's look at the polls. At the end of 2019, December 31st, you led in the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls with 22 percent. But now, less four weeks later, you're in third place at 17.8 percent. Actually, I'm trying to see -- yeah, there you are, 17.8 percent.</p><p>Given that this is your 25th trip to Iowa and that you're campaigning here as a Midwesterner, as a neighbor, going back to Peter Doocy's piece, don't you have to grab one of those three top tickets to have any chance going forward?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  We definitely have to perform well in Iowa. And...</p><p>WALLACE:  I know you -- well, let me interrupt -- you always say perform well. Don't you have to win -- be first, second or third?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  I'll let the analysts make up the goal posts. What I know is that this is our first chance to show versus tell our ability to win. And what I'm seeing in terms of the energy on the ground, the skill of our organizers, the enthusiasm of our volunteers, I believe we have what it takes to surprise a lot of people, turn a lot of heads, and do exactly that.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALLACE:  So are you going to -- so you're going to finish in the top three?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  We're going to do great. And we're in it to win it.</p><p>WALLACE:  You're in it to win it. I mean, the last person who said that was Hillary Clinton, so I don't know.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Why would you remind me of that?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALLACE:  Let's get back to the questioner. Brandon Wheelock is a student at Drake University here in Des Moines. Brandon?</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening, sir. What is your plan to limit presidential powers so they cannot be abused and manipulated, as we've seen them been in the recent presidency? And do you have a plan to diffuse federal authority back down to the state level so that the states may decide their own laws and their policies again, as what used to previously happen?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Yeah, so there's no question right now we've got a president who doesn't seem to think there's any limits on his own power. Turns out a big part of what kept the presidency in its place was just the restraint of presidents. And so we're going to look at legal solutions.</p><p>Impeachment is supposed to be a constitutional solution, but there should be congressional limitations on what a president can do. And there are.</p><p>But the reality is, this is also about making sure we empower not just states, but communities. Maybe it's a mayor's-eye view. But one of the things you'll notice across my policies is that I don't always expect that the answers will come from Washington. I think more of the funding should.</p><p>So whether we're dealing with mental health and addiction, whether we're dealing with racial inequities in health, whether we're dealing with infrastructure solutions, I think as much as possible we need to empower local communities that are already doing so much in order to solve these challenges and then ensure that the federal policy is a floor, not a ceiling on what can be done.</p><p>And we've also got to insist that other branches step up and do their job. That's one of the problems with war powers. It's not just the behavior of presidents. It's a Congress that's been all too happy to leave its war powers aside because it's difficult to deal with.</p><p>Which is why, if I'm required to seek an authorization for the use of force -- and I hope I never am -- but if I am, I will insist as a limitation on myself that it have a three-year expiration, that if I or a future president really needed to extend an engagement, we'd have to go back to Congress and sell Congress and the American people.</p><p>That way the troops who put their lives on the line and can summon the courage to go abroad and into harm's way will know that our elected officials will have to summon the courage to take an up-or-down vote on whether they should be there in the first place.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALLACE:  Stay right -- keep standing, because your next question is from Noah Baker. He's a student at Coe College in Cedar Rapids.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you, Mayor Pete. Pointing to examples like France and China, what is your take on using nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels and attempt to slowdown climate change?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, the greatest threat that we have when it comes to energy issues is carbon pollution leading to climate change. And that means we shouldn't have blanket solutions that ignore the pathway to get to where we need to go. And for that reason, I'm not going to be dogmatic about nuclear.</p><p>I think that in the short term, as part of the transition, it is a source of non-CO-2 emitting power. But I also don't think that it's the solution for the long run, and it's why I don't support adding nuclear to the mix. There are too many issues, too many questions about the storage of waste and all of the hazards that are there.</p><p>So we've got to recognize that in the median term, it's part of how we get there. But at the end of the day, we've got to be so much more imaginative about how we generate power, generate energy, and fuel the I'd of this country in order to meet the goals that are imperative in order for us to live well in the decades to come.</p><p>WALLACE:  We have a question now from Kristin Day about abortion. Kristin?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Hi.</p><p>QUESTION:  I am a proud pro-life Democrat. So do you want the support of pro-life Democrats, pro-life Democratic voters? There are about 21 million of us. And if so, would you support more moderate platform language in the Democratic Party to ensure that the party of diversity, of inclusion really does include everybody?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, I respect where you're coming from, and I hope to earn your vote. But I'm not going to try to earn your vote by tricking you. I am pro-choice. And I believe that a woman ought to be able to make that decision. Here's what I...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But I know that the difference of opinion that you and I have is one that we have come by honestly. And the best that I can offer -- and it may win your vote and, if not, I understand -- the best I can offer is that if we can't agree on where to draw the line, the next best thing we can do is agree on who should draw the line. And in my view, it's the woman who's faced with that decision in her own life.</p><p>WALLACE:  This is an interesting moment, because President Trump spoke at the March to Life movement. He was the first president ever to actually appear at the March to Life movement. And I'm curious, Kristin, were you satisfied with the answer you got from the mayor?</p><p>QUESTION:  No, I was not, because he did not answer the second part of my question. And the second part was, the Democratic platform contains language that basically says that we don't belong, we have no part in the party, because it says abortion should be legal up to nine months, the government should pay for it, and there's nothing that says that people have a diversity of views on this issue should be included in the party.</p><p>In 1996, and I guess several years after that, there was language in the Democratic platform that said that we understand that people have very differing views on this issue, but we are a big tent party that includes everybody. And so, therefore, we welcome you, people like me, into the party so we can work on issues that we agree on.</p><p>So my question was, would you be open to language like that in the Democratic platform, that really did say that our party is diverse and inclusive and we want everybody?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, I support the position of my party that this kind of medical care needs to be available to everyone. And I support the Roe vs. Wade framework that holds that early in pregnancy there are very few restrictions and late in pregnancy there are very few exceptions.</p><p>And again, the best I can offer is that we may disagree on that very important issue, and hopefully we will be able to partner on other issues.</p><p>QUESTION:  So that would be a no?</p><p>WALLACE:  So what do you -- what do you say to Democrats who are pro-life -- and there are obviously millions of them, as well -- what do you say, then, to them on an issue of such deep conscience, that they should overlook this particular issue and look at the whole sum of views, or go find another party?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Look, I've never encountered a politician or, frankly, another person that I agreed with 100 percent of the time, and even on very important things. We may sometimes disagree.</p><p>But at the end of the day, this is what I believe. And people I care about and respect view it differently. But this is something I believe is so important, especially because I'm never going to have to make that decision. And so I may have my views, but I cannot imagine that a decision that a woman confronts is going to ever be better medically or morally because it's being dictated by any government official. And that's just where I am on the issue.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALLACE:  I think it's fair to say Kristin is not clapping, but that's part of the process.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  I understand.</p><p>WALLACE:  Let's hear now from Lauren Johnson, who has a question about housing and homelessness. Lauren?</p><p>QUESTION:  All right. We're seeing a rise in homelessness and a rise in housing costs around the country, but we're also seeing it here in Des Moines. What would you do as president to build more affordable homes from Des Moines all the way to San Francisco?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  So I am proposing that we invest $430 billion in making sure that more affordable housing gets built and making sure that families can better access, things like tax credits and vouchers to support their ability to get a home. But that's half the equation. Part of it is the cost of housing.</p><p>And then the other part of it is -- what I think is the biggest problem in our economy today, one that's not even complicated, it's this:  People are not getting paid enough. Sometimes the problems are simpler than they look.</p><p>And right now, there is not a single county in the whole United States of America where somebody working -- working full time, if they're at minimum wage, could afford even a two-bedroom apartment. So we need to not only make sure that there is more support for affordable housing to be built, but also just lift wages.</p><p>Affordable housing is only affordable if you've got the income to afford it. And right now, we're actually seeing the minimum wage worth less than it used to be. And folks earning a lot more than the minimum wage still struggling to be able to get the housing that they need.</p><p>We have to tackle this. We have the resources to do it, if we have the will. And shame on us if we allow homelessness to be a problem that accelerates in our time.</p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor, you talk about...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You talk about facing the problems of the future rather than continuing to fight the battles over the past. Is that putting the best face on the fact that you're really young?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, I certainly think it's one of the virtues that I bring, from the perspective of my generation. Look, the next president is going to face issues that are different in kind than some of the things that we have been dealing with in the past. Just look at where we are as a country and what we're up against.</p><p>And I've also noticed that there's a generation of leaders around the world, in countries from Finland to New Zealand, who are taking office at ages younger than mine. And I think that that's the sort of thing you might expect America to be leading, rather than playing catchup on.</p><p>But let me -- let me make a more tactical point, which is that every time my party has won in the last 50 years, won the White House, one of the things about our nominee has been it's somebody who's new on the scene, not viewed as a creature of Washington, and opening the door to a new generation of leadership.</p><p>So even if you're just focused on how to win, let's remember that part of how we galvanize Americans is getting them to focus on the future. And I think I have a lot to offer when it comes to that.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALLACE:  Coming up, we'll get into some other topics in a lightning round you don't want to miss, when we return from the River Center here in Des Moines, Iowa.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  And we're back here at the River Center for our Fox News town hall with Pete Buttigieg. Mayor, time for a lightning round. Quick questions, quick answers. We put you through your paces back in May in Claremont. Let's see how you do this time.</p><p>Is there one of the rival candidates who's either in the race still or perhaps has dropped out that you were closest to?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  You know, I get along with all of them. I don't know that I want to name check anybody and get them in trouble. But it's a great group. And of course, we're in the heat of competition. But we share the same values. I admire every one of my competitors. And just for the record, while I am competing to win, whoever is the nominee, we have all got to all rally around them immediately and defeat this president.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALLACE:  Do you ever take it personally -- I mean, you had that moment with Elizabeth Warren when she was attacking you for being in wine cellars, with crystals. I didn't quite get all of that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But in any case, I mean, is it just, well, it's business, as they say in \"The Godfather\"? Or...</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, look, I mean, I'm human being. I can get hot under the collar, especially when somebody is throwing stones. But again, at the end of the day, you remember that we share the same values. We're together on about 80 percent of what to do. We're negotiating our differences. That's what primaries are for. And I'm never going to allow it to distract from the respect that we have for each other and the common goal that we have of turning the page and getting a new and better president.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALLACE:  The New York Times last Monday endorsed Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, which is a little bit odd, to have a dual endorsement. Here's what they said about you, and I want to put it up. This is what the Times said about Mayor Pete. \"His showing in the lead-up to the primaries predicts a bright political future. We look forward to him working his way up.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Did that condescending pat on the head tick you off? Because that's the way I read it.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, one of the things about running when you're young is that you get patted on the head a lot and told you're the future.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But this is about the present, not just the future. This is about where we are right now. And the reason I'm running right now is because we need a different kind of nominee and a different kind of president right now.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALLACE:  We didn't factor in applause in the lightning round, folks. You've got to let me ask the questions. Is there one particular meal or one particular dish that you have eaten -- it doesn't have to have been in Iowa...</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Yes, it does. We're in Iowa.</p><p>WALLACE:  No, no, no, not when you hear the question.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Oh.</p><p>WALLACE:  That you have eaten on this campaign, felt you had to eat politically that you really didn't want to eat? Hell, if you want to include Iowa, that's fine.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  No, I eat pretty well.</p><p>WALLACE:  Your voice just rose.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  No, I'm just thinking about it. I remember the good meals more than I do the -- to be honest, most of my meals are in vehicles now. So anytime I'm actually at a table, it's kind of a treat. And then we were at the Iowa state fair. There was -- it was amazing. I did it in the wrong order. I started with the root beer float and then went to the bacon ball BLT, which is a thing that exists at the Iowa state fair, and then came around through the slushies into the fried Oreo situation, and there was some kind of -- there was like a steak on a stick. Anyway, maybe I just blocked out the bad ones, but I'm mostly remembering the good memories.</p><p>WALLACE:  And those -- you enjoyed all of those?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  I did. I did.</p><p>WALLACE:  OK. You turned 38, right, a week ago.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Uh-huh.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALLACE:  He's no longer 37, folks. Do you feel that you're getting old? Or politically, do you feel that you're less young? And how did you celebrate?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  So as I enter my late-mid-30s...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I actually feel invigorated. I celebrated with Chasten at home. It was a rare treat to be at home with him and Mom and the dogs and just remember what matters -- this sounds like such a cliche, but it's true. When you're politics -- you know, involved in campaigns all the time, just being close to those you love. And I can't think of a better way to spend a birthday.</p><p>WALLACE:  OK. I got my last minute for a lightning round here. When we held our town hall in May, it just happened to be on the night of the finale of \"Game of Thrones,\" and you were disconcertingly aware and sophisticated about the goings-on in that show. So here's the question I have.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Do you have a new guilty pleasure when you get a few minutes off the campaign trail? Is there some new show?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Yes, I finally figured out how to do the app so that I can watch \"Star Trek:  Picard\". And I'm a huge \"Star Trek\" fan, so I'm really excited to see where it goes.</p><p>WALLACE:  You're a big \"Star Trek\" fan?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Oh, yeah, yeah. Grew up on \"The Next Generation.\" I was all about that.</p><p>WALLACE:  You realize there was a generation before \"The Next Generation\"?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Can you do the Spock thing?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  I -- yeah, I...</p><p>WALLACE:  Oh, oh! All right. We would like to give you a chance now for a brief closing statement. Mayor, the floor is yours.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  All right. Well, thanks again for the chance to be here. And if you believe in this message and if you think this is the right way to turn the page, I need help. I need help knocking on doors. I need help reaching out to friends, especially to those who might be so exhausted by the process that this -- they're this close to switching it off, when this is actually our chance to make sure that we send a different message.</p><p>I also need everybody who's watching who believes in me to go to peteforamerica.com and help us with a contribution. We're fueling not just the eight days leading up to the caucuses, but the road ahead. And I am convinced that we are going to -- beginning right here in Iowa -- change what people think is possible, that we can send a message to people who are telling us that we have to choose between our head and our heart, that we have to choose between what it takes to govern and what it takes to win, or that we have to choose between unity and boldness in this country.</p><p>I don't think we have to choose. I don't think we can choose, because I don't think we can get any one of those things unless we get all of them, and this is our chance to turn the page. So that's why I'm asking you to caucus for me, and I hope to earn your support. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALLACE:  Give me a chance here. Thank you, Mayor. Thank you very much for coming on again. We very much appreciate it. Thank you to our audience here in Des Moines.</p><p>A program note tomorrow, special coverage of the Senate impeachment trial, starting at 12:30 Eastern back in Washington. But that's it for tonight. Have a great week. And as I always say, we'll see you next Fox News Sunday.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2345137101</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2T-YTV1-JBHT-D2PF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8407\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CQ Roll Call Jan 27, 2020</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Senate</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Trump, Donald J</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Buttigieg, Pete</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bryant, Kobe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Iowa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Witnesses</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Basketball</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Presidential elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Candidates</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Television news</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political parties</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Aircraft accidents &amp;

We're eight days from the first contest in the race for the White House. Will Iowa be make-or-break for Pete Buttigieg?   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  They call me Mayor Pete, and I am running for president of the United States.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  He entered the race a relative unknown.   </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  What's the best way to pronounce your last name?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Buttigieg.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  But things have changed since our first town hall last May.  </p><p>      Mayor Pete Buttigieg.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      He shot to the top tier of 2020 candidates. The Democratic field got a lot smaller. Then his rivals started taking shots.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  We set this up in a way to solve the problem without running up $20 trillion, $30 trillion, $40 trillion.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  The numbers that the mayor is offering just don't add up.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  A win in Iowa could show Mayor Pete has what it takes to go all the way. But questions remain about his experience, his electability, and support from key groups.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  The black voters who know me best are supporting me.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  The stakes are high. Can the former mayor from the Midwest close the deal?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  If you make me the next president, I'll work every day to make you proud.  </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Good evening from the River Center in downtown Des Moines. Tonight it's the site of our Fox News town hall, with a now former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg. Folks here have a lot of questions they want to ask, so let's get right to it. Ladies and gentlemen, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Thank you. Thank you.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Folks, we've got a lot of questions. You got to sit down so we can actually ask them.   </p><p>      And before -- and we are going to get the good questions that were submitted by people here, but first I want to ask you a question about the terrible news we heard today about the tragic death of basketball great Kobe Bryant and his daughter, 13-year-old daughter. He was taking her to a basketball game. I'm sure some folks here may not know this news yet -- taking her to a basketball game. She -- they crashed, a helicopter crash.   </p><p>      One of the things we ask our leaders to do is to make sense out of senseless events. Your thoughts about the death of Kobe Bryant?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, it's shocking. And I think we're all still in shock about what happened. And I think it's a reminder that our lives are often touched by people we never even meet. And there are millions of people -- not just in Los Angeles, but around the world right now -- mourning because they were inspired by what he did on the field, what he meant off the field. And it's also, of course, such a tough human moment to think about, that he was spending time with his daughter, and her loss is unthinkable, as is that of everybody who was on that helicopter. And I think all of America is united in mourning and sending our love and our thoughts and, of course, our prayers to the families.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p>      Our first question in the town hall here is from Noah Manderfeld, and it's about impeachment. Noah?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hi, Pete.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Hi.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  With the impeachment hearings underway in Washington, the question isn't necessarily whether Donald Trump did hold funds from Ukraine in search of political dirt on a rival. Rather, whether he should be removed from office because of it. Do you believe he should be removed from office?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  I do. And if he's not, it's going to send a message that this Senate, or at least Senate Republicans today, think that it's OK to lie, it's OK to cheat, it's OK to involve a foreign government or pressure a foreign government to get involved in American elections.   </p><p>      Just now, we're getting more indications about John Bolton, indicating what he knew, which is one more reason why, if this is a serious trial, we've got to have the witnesses and the evidence who can help explain what happened.   </p><p>      I've never seen these lengths gone to prevent witnesses and evidence that, according to the president, would show that he's innocent. Kind of makes you think.  </p><p>      But let's be honest about what's going on, on the floor of the Senate. The Senate GOP has made it clear that it's not going to be a fair trial. And I think the effect of that on a lot of us, certainly on me, is it's exhausting. You just watch this process. They're sending the message it's a foregone conclusion, doesn't matter what the evidence is, what the witnesses are, or, frankly, what the president admitted to doing in broad daylight on television. None of that matters.  </p><p>      And I think it's designed to make us kind of turn it off and walk away. And the great thing about being a voter, the great thing about 2020, especially in Iowa and other early states where voters have so much influence, is that this is a chance to respond. Nobody here has a vote on the floor of the Senate, but no matter what they do in Senate, the last word comes to the American people. And this is our chance to send a message that, no, that's not OK. And if the Senate won't say so, we will.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Mayor, our next question comes from Scott Matter. He has a question about electability and experience. Scott?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Mayor Pete, you'll be 39 years old a year from now when you're sworn in as president. How do you think that your age -- or will your age be a factor when you're working with members of Congress, many of whom are several decades older than yourself?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, one thing that I got comfortable with early as a mayor was having colleagues, was having appointees, and other elected officials I had to work with who were older than I am. I think I'm the exact median age of the United States of America right now, actually -- right about 38. So half of the country is younger and half of the country is older.   </p><p>      And what I'm seeing is a hunger to make sure that we're delivering solutions that are oriented toward the future. You know, right now, we are facing issues whose scope was not seen a few years or decades ago. Just think about what we're up against as a country, figuring out how to regulate big tech, dealing with global health security issues, climate change leaping off the pages of scientific papers and becoming a clear and present danger with impacts all around us right now, different kinds of international issues, cyber security.   </p><p>      We're moving into an era that I think is going to call for a worldview that is informed by those experiences from a younger generation. And I'm ready to bring those experiences into the White House.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Mayor, our next question comes from Caleb Lillquist who wants to talk to you about the polarization in our politics today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Mr. Buttigieg, there is a common theme in your messages about trying to fix a divided nation that has become polarized over the past years. Other than creating policy that appeals to both sides of the political spectrum, how do you plan to appeal to Republican voters in order to steal them -- steer them away from voting for President Trump?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Yeah. Well, first of all, we're doing it right now. This network is known for having a lot of more conservative viewers. But I don't think that you have to be a Democrat to see what is wrong with this president and this presidency.   </p><p>      I'm meeting a lot of what I like to call future former Republicans who are coming to my events. And I'm not pretending that we're going to agree on everything. I'm not trying to trick anybody. But my message is that we can at least agree on this, that if you're having trouble looking your kids in the eye and explaining this presidency to them, that you have a choice.   </p><p>      But the really important thing I think to remember, not just in order to win but in order to govern, is that if there is an American majority that can agree on what we're against, there's an even bigger majority that agrees on what we're for.   </p><p>      Remember, I'm proposing things that most Americans even in conservative states think we ought to do:  raising wages, making sure that corporations pay their fair share in taxes, delivering paid family leave, doing something about gun violence.   </p><p>      You know, more than 80 percent of Republicans thinks we ought to at least be doing universal background checks. These are things that most Americans want to see happen. And I believe that's important to remember from the perspective of what it's going to take to govern in the future, because a big issue we have right now is that a majority in the American people isn't necessarily being reflected by a majority on the floor of the American Congress.  </p><p>      So it's going to take presidential leadership to hold senators to account and make sure they're responding to these ideas and these reforms that are viewed as necessary not just by my fellow Democrats, but by independents and an awful lot of Republicans.   </p><p>      So we don't have to choose between being bold and being unifying. This is my point. Some folks are saying you've got to pick one or the other or that you've got to measure boldness by how many people you can turn off and turn away. I think that actually these bold ideas about how to make American life better are part of how we're going to unify the country. And we have to unify this country, because it has become dangerously divided and frighteningly polarized. This is our chance to do something about that, and it's at the core of my campaign.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Mayor, I want to pick up on these last two questions, because it seems to me they strike a common theme. And I think it's fair to say it's the biggest knock against you among voters who might be receptive to your message, and that is the question of your lack of experience, especially in areas that are so key and so important to being president of the United States.  </p><p>      You were the mayor of the 305th largest city in America. You were never elected with more than 11,000 votes in any of your successful elections. You've never run a business. The flipside, you're obviously smart as the Dickens, you served in the military. But what makes you, given your life experience, what makes you qualified, what makes you ready to be able to run the largest enterprise in the world, the United States government?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, look, anyone ought to be humbled by the scope of the American presidency and what it requires. And the reality is, there is no job like the presidency.   </p><p>      But I also think we've got to ask what kind of experience we're looking for. And that's what the American people are going to decide. Look, I'll admit, if what you're looking for is the most years spent in Washington, you've got a clear choice and it's not going to be me.   </p><p>      But I would also argue that the kind of experience you have governing on the ground in a city of any size is the kind of experience we need a little more of in Washington, because we don't have the luxury of alternative facts. We have to get things done. We can't shut down a city government over a partisan disagreement. There wouldn't be any drinking water. We just have to get it solved. And I think we'd be well served if we'd get Washington to work a little more like our best cities and towns.   </p><p>      Now, if I were the 305th most senior member of Congress, I'm not sure that folks would be as surprised by my candidacy. But this is exactly my point. And actually, the fact that the city that I'm from and the city that I led is not one of America's biggest global cities, that's part of the point, as well. There are so many communities in Iowa and across America that have felt passed over, in addition to neighborhoods in some of our biggest cities that just feel they're being ignored by the political process.  </p><p>      I think we need a voice -- frankly, I think my party needs to provide more voices from these kinds of communities that hold so much of the key to the future of this country and that need answers from a Washington that can't seem to speak to us anymore, that isn't even paying attention.  </p><p>      We've got a president saying the economy's fantastic because the Dow Jones is looking good. And I think in a lot of our communities that are not necessarily the biggest cities, as well as some neighborhoods in our biggest cities, folks are saying, great, when is that getting to my kitchen table?   </p><p>      It's just a different perspective, just like having served brings a different perspective and coming from the generation that I come from brings a different perspective. And I believe -- look, I've heard some folks saying this is no time to take a risk. And I agree. But I think the biggest risk that we could take right now would be to try to go up against this president with the same, old playbook that we've been relying on that helps explains how we got here in the first place. I think it's time for something completely different.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  We have a...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  We have a different question, this one comes from Stephanie Dicken, a former elementary schoolteacher. She has a question about your standing in the African-American community. Stephanie?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  First of all, I'd like to thank you for your service as a vet and as a public servant.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      So there seems to be a lack of enthusiasm for you in the black community. I believe that no one is perfect and that we can all learn from our mistakes. I also believe that we should surround ourselves with people who can support us and help us be successful. So can you tell me a little bit about your police department in South Bend, the lessons that you've learned, and how you plan to overcome the concerns of your voters?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Absolutely. You know, one of the most painful issues of racial justice, in particular affecting black families in our country, is this wall of mistrust between communities of color and police departments. And we have experienced that in my city.   </p><p>      We had a police shooting that took the life of one of our residents, Eric Logan, last year that caused tremendous anguish in our city. And we've been working on issues related to justice in policing for the entire time that I was mayor.  </p><p>      Now, I can tell you all of the things that we were able to do working side by side to deliver improvements, to bring more residents into the process, to add transparency to what was happening with the use of force. And you know what? Once we started publishing data in great detail about use of force online for all to see, use of force went down in our city.   </p><p>      But other things were a tremendous struggle. And we were not able to reach the point that I wanted us to, including recruiting and retaining more officers of color. When you're a mayor, you don't get to just comment on these things or debate them or legislate over them. We're on the ground every day trying get this done.   </p><p>      And in response to some of the tragedies we experienced as a community, we called the community in to be part of the solution, creating opportunities to sit together side by side and craft different kinds of policies on everything from the way body cameras were used to how training works in our department.   </p><p>      And there are a lot of lessons we learned the hard way that I think about every day when I'm looking at what we could do with the powers of the presidency to deal not only with the problems of racial justice in policing, but more broadly the problem of systemic racism in this country.  </p><p>      And the reality is, the racial inequality that we see around us is often getting worse and it's not going to get better on its own. You can't just rub out a racist policy and replace it with a neutral one and expect everything to get better.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Mayor, I want to just pick up on this, and we need to wrap up this segment, because we've got a lot more questions. In our first town hall, last May, I asked you about this question of your lack of support in the African-American community, which was then less than 1 percent, and here's what you said then. Take a look.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  I think that's particularly true of black and brown voters who are just skeptical of people who come along seemingly out of nowhere. And so it's why we've worked so hard to make sure that as we go into this summer in our outreach and in our substance that we're speaking to voters who are concerned with what the next president can do to deal with, for example, the glaring racial inequities that we see in our society.   </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Now, that was eight months ago. And for all of your outreach in these eight months, you're -- last national poll, you're at 2 percent support among African-Americans. I guess the question is, is it just possible that the African-Americans -- we've been talking to them all over around the country, especially in South Carolina, which obviously has one of the early primaries, that they have heard you, that they have learned about your record, and they just think there would be another Democratic candidate who would represent them better?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, I'll tell you this. Having eight months to introduce yourself is, of course, not the same as having 20 or 30 or 40 years. But I'll also say that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  But eight months from now, we're going to have the election.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  That's right. And when I'm engaging -- first of all, I should note that the support that I have that is the strongest among African-American voters is in my own community, where people know me best. And, yes, we have work to do to make sure that that extends in particular into the South.   </p><p>      But when we were, for example, the other day in South Carolina, at a black-owned business engaging in a conversation about economic empowerment, one of the biggest things I heard about was just the determination to make sure we get a candidate who can win. And I'm mindful that that's one of the things you've got to show, not just tell. And, of course, Iowa is the first opportunity we'll get on the calendar to demonstrate that we can do just that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Mayor, we have a lot more questions for you, coming up after a quick break. Folks here want to ask you about your plans for Medicare and foreign policy and other issues you would face as president. That's next as we come to you live from the River Center here in Des Moines, Iowa.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  And we're back now with our town hall with Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Julie Morneau is our next questioner, and she wants to ask you, Mayor, about healthcare.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  All right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Julie?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  So one of the core pieces of the ACA are the subsidies provided to help make insurance affordable for the average Pete. With recent changes to legislation and revenue sources for the subsidies that -- that no longer existing, what would you do to keep the costs of policies down while Medicare for all who want it is being implemented?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Yes. So this is one of the reasons why we've got to pay attention to the whole system. There's a big debate going on about which coverage plan is best. Of course, I think mine, Medicare for all who want it, is best.   </p><p>      We've also got to look at the cost side. Now, one thing that we can do is deliver a quality public plan where the premiums never go above 8.5 percent of your income, and that's part of the design of my plan, and that's why I think most people will choose it in the end. I just trust people to choose it on their own.  </p><p>      But we also need to make sure that we're prepared to fund the subsidies that make health care affordable, whether it's under the ACA, in my vision, for all Americans. And that means we can't be afraid to talk about revenue.   </p><p>      Now, there are two steps you can take that would fund the entirety of what I'm proposing in health care for 10 years. Just two things you got to do. One of them is roll back the Trump corporate tax cuts...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      ... which I think most us think is the right thing to do. And the other one is such a commonsense move that it's kind of astonishing it hasn't happen already, and that is to finally allow Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs with the drug companies. If we do that, there is enough revenue to maintain those subsidies you're asking about. And we should.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Mayor, you talk about being at least relatively speaking a moderate, a centrist, particularly in comparison to some of your opponents in this race, like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. And, in fact, right now you're fundraising very much against Bernie Sanders by saying he could win here in Iowa and if he does, he can't beat Donald Trump and you believe you can.   </p><p>      We looked, though, at all of your domestic proposals. And we want to put them up on the screen. We added them up:  a trillion dollars for childcare and college aid and affordable housing, $2 trillion to address climate change, $1.5 trillion to pay for Medicare for all who want it. And then when you add that up to all of your other plans, it comes to $5.7 million -- or trillion dollars, rather, in new spending.   </p><p>      Question:  What's moderate about that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, it's the right thing to do. And I suppose it's moderate in the sense that most Americans want us to take those steps. Now, it costs a fraction of what some of my competitors in this primary are proposing. The health care piece alone, folks can't seem to agree whether it's $20 trillion or $40 trillion.   </p><p>      I figured out a way to do it that is affordable. Now, $5.7 trillion is not a small amount of money. But I'm also committing that everything that I propose is paid for, that the sum total of all the things I've offered up in this campaign will be at worst be deficit neutral and ultimately will actually reduce the deficit.   </p><p>      And I think it's time for my party to be a little more comfortable owning the issue of the deficit, because even though I'm the youngest person running for president, I'm old enough to remember when Republicans talked about the deficit all the time, only for this president to have a trillion-dollar deficit on his watch, mostly as a consequence of these giant tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy.  </p><p>      If we make these commonsense moves around corporate tax cuts, around negotiating drug prices, around things like closing the loopholes that allow people to park their profits elsewhere, dealing with the fact that a company like Amazon, on billions of dollars in profits, pays exactly zero in taxes, we can pay for all of the things I'm proposing.  </p><p>      And unlike tax cuts on the wealthiest, the investments that I'm proposing actually do pay for themselves. That's why we have federal investment in infrastructure, health, and education. It is affordable compared to doing nothing for sure, especially when it comes to climate.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Mayor, you may want to listen to this next question, because Juliana Martinez -- Juliana, where you are? Stand up -- is already a president, which you are not yet.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Oh.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  She's the student body president at Dordt University in Sioux Center. Juliana, your question?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  During the Des Moines debate earlier this month, you mentioned that Democrats have a better track record than Republicans do when it comes to tackling debt in America. You also went on to say that you would support money being thrown towards education, childcare, and the environment. How are you going to increase government spending while also decreasing national debt?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Great, Madam President.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      Let me unpack a little bit of what I was just mentioning, because there's this idea out there that we couldn't possibly make the investments we need to without tax levels that put pressure on the economy. And it's just not true.   </p><p>      The kinds of reforms that I'm talking about are about making sure that corporations and the wealthiest pay their fair share. We don't have to go back to the levels of taxes that we had in the '50s and '60s, although it's worth mentioning that our economy grew pretty well back then, too. All we have to do is have the tax code actually make sense.   </p><p>      And when we do, when we make these investments, something like early childhood education, something like making sure we've got the kind of infrastructure that our country deserves, instead of crumbling roads and bridges, making sure that broadband is getting out to rural areas and that we pay attention to our digital infrastructure, and, of course, preventing a climate catastrophe that is already starting to show its face in our communities, that is an investment in the future. It will pay for itself, and we'll be really glad we did it in the years to come.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Next question from Wade Steinke on foreign policy. Wade?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hello, Mayor Pete. Thank you for being here today. My question is, how would you balance pulling us out of the Middle East versus maintaining commitments to our allies in the region?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, that's always been an important issue, and it just got a lot more important because of the president's steps that have destabilized a region that was already one of the most volatile in the world.  </p><p>      Here's what we've got to do. It starts by recognizing that we don't have to choose between endless war and completely disappearing from the world stage. What we've got to do is decide what our priorities are and raise the bar for the use of force.   </p><p>      Think about what was happening in Syria. In northern Syria, you had a tiny handful of people, some highly specialized intelligence and special operations personnel, holding the line. They didn't take responsibility for turning Syria into Switzerland. Their job was to make sure that the worst things were prevented. And when the president pulled the rug out from that, we saw the effect.   </p><p>      We've seen the effects of the decision to have that strike in Iraq that has complicated an already complicated situation, both with Iraq and, of course, moved us closer to the brink of war with Iran.   </p><p>      What we need to do is build up, not tear up our international partnerships, because American lives depend on our relationships with our allies. And we shouldn't be doing any of this alone. We shouldn't have to be doing any of this alone.   </p><p>      Because at our best, America is standing for things like democracy and human rights and stability that are not just American values. They're human values that are shared around the world. And, frankly, part of our strategic edge is that we stand for those things.   </p><p>      But it only works if we're authentically living up to them, and that starts right at home, because how can we be a force for stability and human rights and democracy and freedom abroad if our own president is echoing the vocabulary of dictators, saying that, for example, unfavorable coverage is the work of the enemy of the people? We've got to get our own house in order, and then we will be in much better position for global leadership.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Mayor, let's...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Let's play this out in real time. And I don't even know if you know this, but there has been a rocket attack tonight on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. They believe it was not the Iranians, but Iranian-backed militias. They hit the embassy. We know, according to U.S. officials, there were no fatalities. We don't know yet whether or not there were any casualties.   </p><p>      But, again, a rocket attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad by Iranian-backed militias. What does President Buttigieg do in this moment? What questions are you asking? What steps are you taking?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, first, we have to take steps to make sure that U.S. personnel are safe, and we have to look at a proportional response or preventative actions to make sure this can't happen again. And we should be coordinating with our allies in order to make sure that safety is enhanced as we move forward.   </p><p>      Look, these are not the kinds of conflicts that we were used to a dcc or a generation ago. We're talking about complicated dynamics with proxy fighting, with different kinds of players, sometimes hard to even tell where something came from. And that's the world that the next president is going to have to manage.   </p><p>      But the other thing is that we've got to manage that with a view to the people, the humans, the Americans who are impacted. That's why it was so disturbing to hear the president seem to brush away the traumatic brain injuries of the Americans who were injured by the Iranian missile attack in Iraq.   </p><p>      We're talking about somebody who as a privileged son of a multi-millionaire faked an injury in order to avoid serving, goes on to become the president, and minimizes the real injuries of those who did. This is exactly why someone like Donald Trump has no business anywhere near the Situation Room, because you have to be able to make these decision with the perspective of those who have their lives on the line every minute that they are in the Middle East or in the region.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Mayor, we have to...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Mayor, we have to take a break here. When we come back, we'll hear from more voters about more of the big issues on their minds, like climate change and abortion.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  And welcome back to our Fox News town hall with Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Correspondent Peter Doocy has been on the trail here in Iowa the past few months in the lead-up to the first in the nation contest. And he takes a look now at the special role Iowa plays in choosing our next president.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOOCY</emphasis>:  For many Iowans, the caucuses are a family tradition.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yeah, Iowans take this very seriously. They study up on this every four years.   </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think Iowans are really good about hearing all the facts and sorting things through.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Here you go and you say, oh, I had so and so, I had dinner with Representative So-and-So, or I -- you know, and it's amazing. This is democracy.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOOCY</emphasis>:  There's an old adage that there are only three tickets out of Iowa, because only John McCain finished outside the top three and became his party's nominee. Iowa Democrats have a better track record of picking eventual nominees. Seven out of 10 Democratic caucus winners captured the nomination, compared to 3 out of 8 Republicans. And two Democratic Iowa winners have gone on to become president, Carter and Obama.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OBAMA</emphasis>:  You have done what the cynics said we couldn't do.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOOCY</emphasis>:  Compared to just one Republican, George W. Bush.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  That begins right here in Iowa on February 3rd, and I'm hoping you'll make it possible.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOOCY</emphasis>:  A lot changes cycle to cycle, but the focus will remain on issues and not impeachment.   </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'm not paying too much attention to that, because it's kind of out of our hands.   </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It's kind of something that has to be done, but not something that's going to, I don't think, move a lot of votes.   </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  You know what? I don't think it makes any difference. We're too close to the caucus time.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOOCY</emphasis>:  It's so close to the caucus time t that the senators that have to leave tonight to go back for the impeachment trial may only have one day left to campaign in the state before the caucuses and a day that a lot of Iowans might be busy in the afternoon, Super Bowl Sunday. Chris?   </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Pete, thank you.  </p><p>      Mayor, let's talk about the polls. And I got to say, every poll seems to have a different leader. But let's look at the polls. At the end of 2019, December 31st, you led in the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls with 22 percent. But now, less four weeks later, you're in third place at 17.8 percent. Actually, I'm trying to see -- yeah, there you are, 17.8 percent.   </p><p>      Given that this is your 25th trip to Iowa and that you're campaigning here as a Midwesterner, as a neighbor, going back to Peter Doocy's piece, don't you have to grab one of those three top tickets to have any chance going forward?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  We definitely have to perform well in Iowa. And...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  I know you -- well, let me interrupt -- you always say perform well. Don't you have to win -- be first, second or third?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  I'll let the analysts make up the goal posts. What I know is that this is our first chance to show versus tell our ability to win. And what I'm seeing in terms of the energy on the ground, the skill of our organizers, the enthusiasm of our volunteers, I believe we have what it takes to surprise a lot of people, turn a lot of heads, and do exactly that.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  So are you going to -- so you're going to finish in the top three?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  We're going to do great. And we're in it to win it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  You're in it to win it. I mean, the last person who said that was Hillary Clinton, so I don't know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Why would you remind me of that?  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Let's get back to the questioner. Brandon Wheelock is a student at Drake University here in Des Moines. Brandon?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Good evening, sir. What is your plan to limit presidential powers so they cannot be abused and manipulated, as we've seen them been in the recent presidency? And do you have a plan to diffuse federal authority back down to the state level so that the states may decide their own laws and their policies again, as what used to previously happen?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Yeah, so there's no question right now we've got a president who doesn't seem to think there's any limits on his own power. Turns out a big part of what kept the presidency in its place was just the restraint of presidents. And so we're going to look at legal solutions.   </p><p>      Impeachment is supposed to be a constitutional solution, but there should be congressional limitations on what a president can do. And there are.  </p><p>      But the reality is, this is also about making sure we empower not just states, but communities. Maybe it's a mayor's-eye view. But one of the things you'll notice across my policies is that I don't always expect that the answers will come from Washington. I think more of the funding should.   </p><p>      So whether we're dealing with mental health and addiction, whether we're dealing with racial inequities in health, whether we're dealing with infrastructure solutions, I think as much as possible we need to empower local communities that are already doing so much in order to solve these challenges and then ensure that the federal policy is a floor, not a ceiling on what can be done.   </p><p>      And we've also got to insist that other branches step up and do their job. That's one of the problems with war powers. It's not just the behavior of presidents. It's a Congress that's been all too happy to leave its war powers aside because it's difficult to deal with.   </p><p>      Which is why, if I'm required to seek an authorization for the use of force -- and I hope I never am -- but if I am, I will insist as a limitation on myself that it have a three-year expiration, that if I or a future president really needed to extend an engagement, we'd have to go back to Congress and sell Congress and the American people.   </p><p>      That way the troops who put their lives on the line and can summon the courage to go abroad and into harm's way will know that our elected officials will have to summon the courage to take an up-or-down vote on whether they should be there in the first place.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Stay right -- keep standing, because your next question is from Noah Baker. He's a student at Coe College in Cedar Rapids.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mayor Pete. Pointing to examples like France and China, what is your take on using nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels and attempt to slowdown climate change?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, the greatest threat that we have when it comes to energy issues is carbon pollution leading to climate change. And that means we shouldn't have blanket solutions that ignore the pathway to get to where we need to go. And for that reason, I'm not going to be dogmatic about nuclear.   </p><p>      I think that in the short term, as part of the transition, it is a source of non-CO-2 emitting power. But I also don't think that it's the solution for the long run, and it's why I don't support adding nuclear to the mix. There are too many issues, too many questions about the storage of waste and all of the hazards that are there.   </p><p>      So we've got to recognize that in the median term, it's part of how we get there. But at the end of the day, we've got to be so much more imaginative about how we generate power, generate energy, and fuel the I'd of this country in order to meet the goals that are imperative in order for us to live well in the decades to come.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  We have a question now from Kristin Day about abortion. Kristin?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Hi.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I am a proud pro-life Democrat. So do you want the support of pro-life Democrats, pro-life Democratic voters? There are about 21 million of us. And if so, would you support more moderate platform language in the Democratic Party to ensure that the party of diversity, of inclusion really does include everybody?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, I respect where you're coming from, and I hope to earn your vote. But I'm not going to try to earn your vote by tricking you. I am pro-choice. And I believe that a woman ought to be able to make that decision. Here's what I...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      But I know that the difference of opinion that you and I have is one that we have come by honestly. And the best that I can offer -- and it may win your vote and, if not, I understand -- the best I can offer is that if we can't agree on where to draw the line, the next best thing we can do is agree on who should draw the line. And in my view, it's the woman who's faced with that decision in her own life.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  This is an interesting moment, because President Trump spoke at the March to Life movement. He was the first president ever to actually appear at the March to Life movement. And I'm curious, Kristin, were you satisfied with the answer you got from the mayor?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  No, I was not, because he did not answer the second part of my question. And the second part was, the Democratic platform contains language that basically says that we don't belong, we have no part in the party, because it says abortion should be legal up to nine months, the government should pay for it, and there's nothing that says that people have a diversity of views on this issue should be included in the party.   </p><p>      In 1996, and I guess several years after that, there was language in the Democratic platform that said that we understand that people have very differing views on this issue, but we are a big tent party that includes everybody. And so, therefore, we welcome you, people like me, into the party so we can work on issues that we agree on.   </p><p>      So my question was, would you be open to language like that in the Democratic platform, that really did say that our party is diverse and inclusive and we want everybody?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, I support the position of my party that this kind of medical care needs to be available to everyone. And I support the Roe vs. Wade framework that holds that early in pregnancy there are very few restrictions and late in pregnancy there are very few exceptions.   </p><p>      And again, the best I can offer is that we may disagree on that very important issue, and hopefully we will be able to partner on other issues.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  So that would be a no?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  So what do you -- what do you say to Democrats who are pro-life -- and there are obviously millions of them, as well -- what do you say, then, to them on an issue of such deep conscience, that they should overlook this particular issue and look at the whole sum of views, or go find another party?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Look, I've never encountered a politician or, frankly, another person that I agreed with 100 percent of the time, and even on very important things. We may sometimes disagree.  </p><p>      But at the end of the day, this is what I believe. And people I care about and respect view it differently. But this is something I believe is so important, especially because I'm never going to have to make that decision. And so I may have my views, but I cannot imagine that a decision that a woman confronts is going to ever be better medically or morally because it's being dictated by any government official. And that's just where I am on the issue.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  I think it's fair to say Kristin is not clapping, but that's part of the process.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  I understand.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Let's hear now from Lauren Johnson, who has a question about housing and homelessness. Lauren?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  All right. We're seeing a rise in homelessness and a rise in housing costs around the country, but we're also seeing it here in Des Moines. What would you do as president to build more affordable homes from Des Moines all the way to San Francisco?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  So I am proposing that we invest $430 billion in making sure that more affordable housing gets built and making sure that families can better access, things like tax credits and vouchers to support their ability to get a home. But that's half the equation. Part of it is the cost of housing.   </p><p>      And then the other part of it is -- what I think is the biggest problem in our economy today, one that's not even complicated, it's this:  People are not getting paid enough. Sometimes the problems are simpler than they look.   </p><p>      And right now, there is not a single county in the whole United States of America where somebody working -- working full time, if they're at minimum wage, could afford even a two-bedroom apartment. So we need to not only make sure that there is more support for affordable housing to be built, but also just lift wages.   </p><p>      Affordable housing is only affordable if you've got the income to afford it. And right now, we're actually seeing the minimum wage worth less than it used to be. And folks earning a lot more than the minimum wage still struggling to be able to get the housing that they need.   </p><p>      We have to tackle this. We have the resources to do it, if we have the will. And shame on us if we allow homelessness to be a problem that accelerates in our time.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Mayor, you talk about...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      You talk about facing the problems of the future rather than continuing to fight the battles over the past. Is that putting the best face on the fact that you're really young?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, I certainly think it's one of the virtues that I bring, from the perspective of my generation. Look, the next president is going to face issues that are different in kind than some of the things that we have been dealing with in the past. Just look at where we are as a country and what we're up against.   </p><p>      And I've also noticed that there's a generation of leaders around the world, in countries from Finland to New Zealand, who are taking office at ages younger than mine. And I think that that's the sort of thing you might expect America to be leading, rather than playing catchup on.   </p><p>      But let me -- let me make a more tactical point, which is that every time my party has won in the last 50 years, won the White House, one of the things about our nominee has been it's somebody who's new on the scene, not viewed as a creature of Washington, and opening the door to a new generation of leadership.   </p><p>      So even if you're just focused on how to win, let's remember that part of how we galvanize Americans is getting them to focus on the future. And I think I have a lot to offer when it comes to that.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Coming up, we'll get into some other topics in a lightning round you don't want to miss, when we return from the River Center here in Des Moines, Iowa.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  And we're back here at the River Center for our Fox News town hall with Pete Buttigieg. Mayor, time for a lightning round. Quick questions, quick answers. We put you through your paces back in May in Claremont. Let's see how you do this time.   </p><p>      Is there one of the rival candidates who's either in the race still or perhaps has dropped out that you were closest to?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  You know, I get along with all of them. I don't know that I want to name check anybody and get them in trouble. But it's a great group. And of course, we're in the heat of competition. But we share the same values. I admire every one of my competitors. And just for the record, while I am competing to win, whoever is the nominee, we have all got to all rally around them immediately and defeat this president.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Do you ever take it personally -- I mean, you had that moment with Elizabeth Warren when she was attacking you for being in wine cellars, with crystals. I didn't quite get all of that.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      But in any case, I mean, is it just, well, it's business, as they say in \"The Godfather\"? Or...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, look, I mean, I'm human being. I can get hot under the collar, especially when somebody is throwing stones. But again, at the end of the day, you remember that we share the same values. We're together on about 80 percent of what to do. We're negotiating our differences. That's what primaries are for. And I'm never going to allow it to distract from the respect that we have for each other and the common goal that we have of turning the page and getting a new and better president.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  The New York Times last Monday endorsed Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, which is a little bit odd, to have a dual endorsement. Here's what they said about you, and I want to put it up. This is what the Times said about Mayor Pete. \"His showing in the lead-up to the primaries predicts a bright political future. We look forward to him working his way up.\"   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      Did that condescending pat on the head tick you off? Because that's the way I read it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, one of the things about running when you're young is that you get patted on the head a lot and told you're the future.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      But this is about the present, not just the future. This is about where we are right now. And the reason I'm running right now is because we need a different kind of nominee and a different kind of president right now.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  We didn't factor in applause in the lightning round, folks. You've got to let me ask the questions. Is there one particular meal or one particular dish that you have eaten -- it doesn't have to have been in Iowa...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Yes, it does. We're in Iowa.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  No, no, no, not when you hear the question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Oh.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  That you have eaten on this campaign, felt you had to eat politically that you really didn't want to eat? Hell, if you want to include Iowa, that's fine.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  No, I eat pretty well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Your voice just rose.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  No, I'm just thinking about it. I remember the good meals more than I do the -- to be honest, most of my meals are in vehicles now. So anytime I'm actually at a table, it's kind of a treat. And then we were at the Iowa state fair. There was -- it was amazing. I did it in the wrong order. I started with the root beer float and then went to the bacon ball BLT, which is a thing that exists at the Iowa state fair, and then came around through the slushies into the fried Oreo situation, and there was some kind of -- there was like a steak on a stick. Anyway, maybe I just blocked out the bad ones, but I'm mostly remembering the good memories.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  And those -- you enjoyed all of those?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  I did. I did.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  OK. You turned 38, right, a week ago.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Uh-huh.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  He's no longer 37, folks. Do you feel that you're getting old? Or politically, do you feel that you're less young? And how did you celebrate?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  So as I enter my late-mid-30s...  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      I actually feel invigorated. I celebrated with Chasten at home. It was a rare treat to be at home with him and Mom and the dogs and just remember what matters -- this sounds like such a cliche, but it's true. When you're politics -- you know, involved in campaigns all the time, just being close to those you love. And I can't think of a better way to spend a birthday.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  OK. I got my last minute for a lightning round here. When we held our town hall in May, it just happened to be on the night of the finale of \"Game of Thrones,\" and you were disconcertingly aware and sophisticated about the goings-on in that show. So here's the question I have.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      Do you have a new guilty pleasure when you get a few minutes off the campaign trail? Is there some new show?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Yes, I finally figured out how to do the app so that I can watch \"Star Trek:  Picard\". And I'm a huge \"Star Trek\" fan, so I'm really excited to see where it goes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  You're a big \"Star Trek\" fan?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Oh, yeah, yeah. Grew up on \"The Next Generation.\" I was all about that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  You realize there was a generation before \"The Next Generation\"?  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      Can you do the Spock thing?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  I -- yeah, I...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Oh, oh! All right. We would like to give you a chance now for a brief closing statement. Mayor, the floor is yours.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  All right. Well, thanks again for the chance to be here. And if you believe in this message and if you think this is the right way to turn the page, I need help. I need help knocking on doors. I need help reaching out to friends, especially to those who might be so exhausted by the process that this -- they're this close to switching it off, when this is actually our chance to make sure that we send a different message.   </p><p>      I also need everybody who's watching who believes in me to go to peteforamerica.com and help us with a contribution. We're fueling not just the eight days leading up to the caucuses, but the road ahead. And I am convinced that we are going to -- beginning right here in Iowa -- change what people think is possible, that we can send a message to people who are telling us that we have to choose between our head and our heart, that we have to choose between what it takes to govern and what it takes to win, or that we have to choose between unity and boldness in this country.  </p><p>      I don't think we have to choose. I don't think we can choose, because I don't think we can get any one of those things unless we get all of them, and this is our chance to turn the page. So that's why I'm asking you to caucus for me, and I hope to earn your support. Thank you.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Give me a chance here. Thank you, Mayor. Thank you very much for coming on again. We very much appreciate it. Thank you to our audience here in Des Moines.   </p><p>      A program note tomorrow, special coverage of the Senate impeachment trial, starting at 12:30 Eastern back in Washington. But that's it for tonight. Have a great week. And as I always say, we'll see you next Fox News Sunday.   </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2S-STJ1-F15W-H39P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

That's sort of where the automotive AI world is in 2017. Artificial intelligence is on the cusp of bringing to life the sort of futuristic computer that can identify, parse and react to real-world driving scenarios.But like everything in tech, it's in a hype cycle that's seeing dozens of companies, large and small, competing to make sure their technology is in the car of the future. This past year, I've have a non-stop parade of startups pitch me about their AI autonomous driving systems. Many of them are suspect, while a few, like AImotive[1] and Comma AI[2], look like they're destined either to be swallowed up by a larger entity or to become part of the industry standard. </p><p>But don't expect a lot to change in 2018.\"The autonomous vehicle industry is just getting started, and it's going to be decades and decades of development,\" said Danny Shapiro, NVIDIA's senior director of automotive. As the company building the hardware underpinning many current AI systems, NVIDIA has an insider's view[3]. As Shapiro sees it, any standard for vehicle AI would just squelch innovation this early in the game.Instead, for the next decade or so, you can expect to see consolidation. Automakers or large tech companies will gobble up smaller startups for their AI prowess or talent. It's a story that's played itself out over and over again in Silicon Valley. Over the past year Intel acquired MobileEye. GM (which had invested heavily in Lyft) invested heavily in Uber. Meanwhile Waymo is now teaming up with Lyft.But the stakes are far higher for autonomous cars. They have the potential to save lives, expand transportation options for people who can't drive, and change the way cities and vehicles handle parking. And, of course, they will reduce CO2 emissions, by either being an EV or hybrid, or by driving more conservatively than humans.But there needs to be a standard eventually. At some point, autonomous cars will be on the road and if there isn't a federally regulated standard governing how these vehicles interact with the world, there will be chaos as consumers, cities and automakers with competing systems follow slightly different rules. For example, if every vehicle treated an intersection differently, the resulting chaos would be no better than when humans are behind the wheel. Automakers understand this.Although these companies are fundamentally using AI in the same way, there are some differences in how the data is parsed and what hardware is deployed in their automobiles. For example, Mercedes-Benz pulls information from LiDAR, hardware used to measure and map items in the real world with lasers. Instead of trying to crunch the individual pixels in the resulting images, it creates blocks of data it calls \"Stixels[4].\" Meanwhile, Tesla doesn't believe it needs LiDAR data to teach or drive its cars.BMW is working on its own AI tech now but sees a future in sharing. \"We think that there will be an industry standard,\" said Peter Schwarzenbauer, the BMW AG board member responsible for digital business innovation. \"But how it will turn out, we don't know yet. But I don't think that you'll see too many different systems on the planet.\" In addition to appeasing US regulators, car companies will have to adjust their AI systems for every region where they sell a car. It won't be easy, but if at some point they can reach an agreement, it will work to the benefit of all involved.In 2018, expect to see more self-driving news out of Waymo, Mercedes, GM, Intel[5] and other big tech and car companies. With nearly all the companies touting their method for training their AI systems in a simulation instead of on the road, expect more news about cloud-based driving tech. But there will also be many small players. Think: scrappy startups like AImotive and Comma AI that either rise to the occasion or collapse by overpromising and under delivering. But mostly be on the lookout for more partnerships like the one between Ford and Intel or between GM and Lyft[6] (and now Uber[7]).2017 was all about the AI hype. In 2018, companies are going to have to start delivering on their promises to make self-driving cars a reality.

And so the measure would levy a 3 percent tax on certain revenue the companies earn in France.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Trump administration warned on Wednesday that it would investigate whether the tax unfairly discriminates against U.S. businesses.</p><p>French officials stood firm Thursday, brushing off the criticism.</p><p>\"France is a sovereign state, it decides its fiscal provisions in a sovereign manner, and it will continue to decide its tax decisions in a sovereign manner,\" said Bruno Le Maire, France's finance minister, speaking to the French Senate on Thursday.</p><p>\"I believe profoundly that between allies, we should and we can settle our differences by other means than threats,\" he added.</p><p>The so-called \"taxe GAFA\"- based on the acronyms of the big tech companies - had already passed in France's National Assembly and was approved on Thursday in the French Senate, the upper house. It will become law after getting a signature from President Emmanuel Macron, for whom the tax has been a priority, and it will be retroactively applied for 2019.</p><p>The tax will apply to tech companies with revenues of more than $850 million, with at least $28 million earned in France. It will affect about 30 companies, including U.S., British, Chinese, German and Spanish businesses, along with one French advertising company, Criteo.</p><p>(Amazon's founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, also owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>The tax is the latest move from Europe designed to gain more control over big tech.</p><p>Last year, the European Union implemented a sweeping new set data privacy regulations that have forced companies to offer European citizens greater ability to determine how their personal information is used, stored and sold.</p><p>European antitrust regulators have also been far more skeptical of U.S. tech companies than their American counterparts, meaning that Google, Apple and others have been hit with major fines in recent years and forced to alter their business practices. And European lawmakers and regulators have talked about doing more, expressing doubts about big tech's ability to regulate itself.</p><p>This muscular approach has drawn the ire of President Trump, who appeared to lash out last month at the E.U. antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager. </p><p>\"You have a woman in Europe, I won't mention her name . . . she hates the United States perhaps worse than any person I've ever met,\" Trump told Fox Business, discussing antitrust law.</p><p>But if European leaders have generally been tougher on big tech than the U.S. government, the French tax also highlighted that Europe is far from united on tech policy.</p><p>Macron pushed hard for an E.U.-wide digital tax policy. But several E.U. countries resisted. Notable among those in opposition were Ireland (where Google, Facebook and Apple have their European headquarters) and Luxembourg (where Amazon's European headquarters is located). Those countries have been successful in luring tech companies with low tax schemes. </p><p>Another fault line has emerged as the privacy rules have gone into effect. European tech activists have criticized Ireland's privacy regulatory agency for what they say is the slow pace of its investigations of suspected violations. The agency says it is simply being meticulous before it pursues high-profile cases.</p><p>Le Maire, the French finance minister, admitted in the spring that an E.U.-wide tax was a dead-end, as it would require the backing of all 28 members of the bloc. So he proposed instead that France go ahead alone.</p><p>Britain, Austria and Poland are among those pursuing their own versions. But because France went first, it will face the consequences.</p><p>Washington announced an investigation under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which grants the president the power to impose retaliatory measures against U.S. trading partners.</p><p>This was the same measure that permitted the Trump administration to slam China with tariffs last year, though it has rarely been used against so close an ally.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:James.McAuley@washpost.com\">James.McAuley@washpost.com</email></p><p>Michael Birnbaum and Quentin Ari\u00e8s in Brussels and Tony Romm in Washington contributed to this report. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-3f696a3aa3c911e9bd56eac6bb02d01d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ6-3MJ1-JB4M-V1DM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><timeReceived>10:47 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

American big tech companies such as Facebook and Alphabet's Google have offered their support, willing to promote this regulation as a demonstration of their company values.The group Access Now, which helped draft this 'Paris Call,' said in a statement[3] on Monday, November 12, that it could help counter the actions of nations that defend their sovereignty. The organization said,'Sovereignty can justify overbroad data collection and government hacking, Internet shutdowns, restrictions on expression based on poorly defined standards of hate speech or terrorist content, and limits on the security of platforms, all in the name of the needs of the state.Ultimately, the Paris Call will reinforce other efforts to improve protections for users and their rights.''Hate speech' is all too often designated by liberally biased tech companies as conservative speech that undermines their politically correct liberal narratives. </p><p>The Media Research Center created a Special Report [4]that noted how tech firms acted as censors that enabled far-left arbiters like the ADL and SPLC to 'treat standard conservative beliefs in faith and family as examples of [hatred]' or let \"Anti-Conservative Fact Checkers' determine what is or isn't \"fake news.'Facebook has also famously worked with Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel[5] to censor 'hate speech' online. She has often been accused of censoring genuine critiques of Germany's migrant crisis.Facebook has even been overzealous in this task to the point German courts have stepped in to prevent criticism from being censored[6]. One such case was when Facebook removed a post by a German man commenting, \"Germans are getting increasingly stupid. No wonder, since the left-wing system media litters them every day with fake news about 'skilled workers,' declining unemployment figures or Trump\" beneath a Facebook post, until a court order had it restored.Even Jason Pontin, a former free speech advocate who was heavily cited in a recently leaked Google private memo, has admitted that social media companies are poor judges[7] when it comes to making the distinction between genuinely dangerous hate speech and views they find personally offensive, '[Social media companies] should've been able to articulate a principle-based approach that was fairly applied to everyone, regardless of their political viewpoints but they've really failed to do so... And as revelations have come out, they've come to seem not only inconsistent, but misguided and sometimes actively dishonest.'According to Cyberscoop,[8] Google and Cisco were two of the major tech companies who are supporting this initiative. Nicklas Lundblad, a Google vice president, stated publicly that, 'We support the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace because as security threats evolve, continuous collaboration with the industry and with governments is the best way to protect users and help create a more secure internet for everyone.' The same big tech companies that are wary of being regulated by the U.S. government in order to protect free speech, will gladly volunteer to be regulated by foreign governments so that they can restrict free speech. According to The Telegraph[9], Google, Facebook, and Microsoft already appear to be on board with this resolution, but the United States, Russia, and China have each refused to sign this agreement, dealing it a major blow.

American big tech companies such as Facebook and Alphabet's Google have offered their support, willing to promote this regulation as a demonstration of their company values.The group Access Now, which helped draft this 'Paris Call,' said in a statement[3] on Monday, November 12, that it could help counter the actions of nations that defend their sovereignty. The organization said,'Sovereignty can justify overbroad data collection and government hacking, Internet shutdowns, restrictions on expression based on poorly defined standards of hate speech or terrorist content, and limits on the security of platforms, all in the name of the needs of the state.Ultimately, the Paris Call will reinforce other efforts to improve protections for users and their rights.''Hate speech' is all too often designated by liberally biased tech companies as conservative speech that undermines their politically correct liberal narratives. </p><p>The Media Research Center created a Special Report [4]that noted how tech firms acted as censors that enabled far-left arbiters like the ADL and SPLC to 'treat standard conservative beliefs in faith and family as examples of [hatred]' or let \"Anti-Conservative Fact Checkers' determine what is or isn't \"fake news.'Facebook has also famously worked with Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel[5] to censor 'hate speech' online. She has often been accused of censoring genuine critiques of Germany's migrant crisis.Facebook has even been overzealous in this task to the point German courts have stepped in to prevent criticism from being censored[6]. One such case was when Facebook removed a post by a German man commenting, \"Germans are getting increasingly stupid. No wonder, since the left-wing system media litters them every day with fake news about 'skilled workers,' declining unemployment figures or Trump\" beneath a Facebook post, until a court order had it restored.Even Jason Pontin, a former free speech advocate who was heavily cited in a recently leaked Google private memo, has admitted that social media companies are poor judges[7] when it comes to making the distinction between genuinely dangerous hate speech and views they find personally offensive, '[Social media companies] should've been able to articulate a principle-based approach that was fairly applied to everyone, regardless of their political viewpoints but they've really failed to do so... And as revelations have come out, they've come to seem not only inconsistent, but misguided and sometimes actively dishonest.'According to Cyberscoop,[8] Google and Cisco were two of the major tech companies who are supporting this initiative. Nicklas Lundblad, a Google vice president, stated publicly that, 'We support the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace because as security threats evolve, continuous collaboration with the industry and with governments is the best way to protect users and help create a more secure internet for everyone.' The same big tech companies that are wary of being regulated by the U.S. government in order to protect free speech, will gladly volunteer to be regulated by foreign governments so that they can restrict free speech. According to The Telegraph[9], Google, Facebook, and Microsoft already appear to be on board with this resolution, but the United States, Russia, and China have each refused to sign this agreement, dealing it a major blow.

That means Google will have to pay publishers for the headlines and snippets of stories that appear in Google News and even Google searches. According to TechCrunch[1], France is the first country in the European Union[2] to 'transpose the neighbouring right for news[3] into national law, following the passing of a pan-EU copyright reform[4] last year.'Neighbouring rights: the Autorit has granted requests for urgent interim measures presented by press publishers &amp; the news agency @afpfr[5]. It requires @Google[6] to negotiate with them the remuneration due to them for the re-use of their protected contents. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/VMBnIz0Ll5\">https://t.co/VMBnIz0Ll5</url>[7] pic.twitter.com/2lhGtwniq6[8]; \u2014 Autorit de la Concurrence (@Adlc_) April 9, 2020[9]Per TechCrunch: Among various controversial measures the reform included a provision to extend copyright to cover content such as the ledes of news stories which aggregators such as Google News scrape and display. The copyright reform as a whole was voted through the EU parliament in March 2019, while France's national law for extended press publishers rights came into force in October 2019. A handful of individual EU Member States, including Germany and Spain, had previously passed similar laws covering the use of news snippets \u2014 without successfully managing to extract payments from Google, as lawmakers had hoped. In Spain, for example, which made payments to publishers mandatory, Google instead chose to pull the plug on its Google News service entirely. But publishers who lobbied for a pan-EU reform hoped a wider push could turn the screw on the tech giant. In its full report, the Autorit de la Concurrence[10] condemned Google's past retaliation, saying that's it's unfair to do that given its dominance in the market. About 90 percent of searches in Europe come from Google and that kind of retaliation is extremely damaging to an already fragile news industry. These practices are made possible by the dominant position that Google is likely to hold in the market of general search services. This position leads Google to bring significant traffic to the websites of publishers and news agencies. Thus, according to the data provided by the complainants relating to 32 press titles, and not disputed by Google, the search engines \u2014 and therefore Google for a large part \u2014 represent, according to the sites, between 26% and 90% of the redirected traffic to their pages. This traffic is also very important and crucial for publishers and news agencies who cannot afford to lose any share of their digital readership due to their economic difficulties. Under these conditions, publishers and news agencies are placed in a situation where they have no other choice than to comply with Google's display policy without financial counterpart. Indeed, the threat of downgrading from the display is synonymous for each press publisher with the loss of traffic and therefore of income, both if it is the only one affected by this downgrading and if this downgrading targets all the publishers. This is the reason why most publishers have been led to accept conditions which are even more unfavourable for them after the entry into force of the law on neighbouring rights than those pre-existing. Google told TechCrunch and other news outlets it will comply with the interim measures[11] mandated today, which include: Google must conduct negotiations within 3 months from the request to open negotiations from a press publisher or a news agency. Neither the indexing, nor the classification, nor the presentation of the protected content taken up by Google on its services should in particular be affected by the negotiations. Google will have to provide the Autorit with monthly reports on how it is complying with the decision. 'In practice, the vast majority of press publishers have granted Google licenses for the use and display of their protected content, and this without possible negotiation and without receiving any remuneration from Google. In addition, as part of Google's new display policy, the licenses which have been granted to it by publishers and press agencies offer it the possibility of taking up more content than before,' it writes in French (which we've translated via Google Translate). 'In these conditions, in addition to their referral to the merits, the seizors requested the order of provisional measures aimed at enjoining Google to enter in good faith into negotiations for the remuneration of the resumption of their content.'

So that digital remains synonymous with multiplied opportunities for consumers, businesses and innovation in our country, this bill must now be placed on the agenda of the National Assembly. The cost of inaction is too high.

Facebook's recent announcement of plans to launch a digital coin has met with a chorus from regulators, central bankers and governments insisting it must respect anti-money-laundering rules and ensure the security of transactions and user data. But there are also deeper concerns that the growing powers of big tech companies increasingly encroach on areas belonging to governments, like issuing currency. </p><p>\"We cannot accept to have any exchange currencies with the same kind of power and the same kind of role of sovereign currencies,\" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told journalists. \"There is a need for regulation, there is need for very strong commitments and obligations for that project and for the time being the necessary requirements are not fulfilled by the project Libra,\" he added. France, which chairs the Group of Seven advanced economies this year, has asked European Central Bank executive board member Benoit Coeure to set up a G7 task-force to look into crypto-currencies and digital coins like the Libra. Coeure is due to present a preliminary report to ministers and central bankers at the meeting, in the quaint chateau town of Chantilly, north of Paris. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the task force was likely to evolve over time into something including a broader range of regulators beyond G7 countries, given the huge impact Libra could have on the global economy. \"If the Libra is aspiring to be used globally, countries must seek a globally coordinated response,\" Kuroda said. \"This is not something that can be discussed among G7 central banks alone.\" G7 finance ministers are also concerned about how best to tax big tech companies, with France keen to use its presidency of the two-day meeting to get broad support for ensuring minimum corporate taxation. G7 governments are concerned that decades-old international tax rules have been pushed to the limit by the emergence of companies like Facebook and Apple, which book profits in low-tax countries regardless of the source of the underlying income. The issue has become more vexed than ever in recent days as Paris defied U.S. President Donald Trump last week by passing a tax on big digital firms' revenues in France, despite a threat from Trump to launch a probe that could lead to trade tariffs. Their bilateral dispute aside, France and the United States are in favour of rules ensuring minimum taxation as part of an effort among nearly 130 countries to overhaul international tax rules. Although a G7 agreement would set the tone for the broader push, an agreement among all of the G7 ministers on a minimum rate or range of rates is likely to prove elusive as Britain and Canada have reservations, a French Finance Ministry source said on Friday. \"If we don't agree at the G7 level on the broad principles for taxing digital companies today or tomorrow then quite frankly it will be complicated to find among 129 countries at the OECD,\" Le Maire said.

EURACTIV Germany took the chance to head along and sit down with Francesca Bria to discuss Spain's role in the EU's digital revolution.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Francesca Bria is Barcelona's Chief Technology and Digital Innovation Officer. She spoke to EURACTIV Germany's\u00a0Alicia Prager.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EURACTIV: Can you tell us about your approach to developing Barcelona as a \"Smart City\"? What are your experiences with shaping its digital strategy? </emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bria:</emphasis> At first, our problem was that the concept of the \"Smart City\" has been developed by the big tech vendors for the last ten years. They introduced all kinds of different technologies: connectivity, big data, big dashboards in order to manage the city service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But why do we need this technology? Who is going to govern this data? Who is going to own the infrastructure of the city? So we shifted the paradigm upside down and started with the problems that citizens are facing in the city: affordable housing, the energy transition, climate change. And then we discussed how to give back the control of data to citizens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We started a large-scale participatory democracy movement, both online and offline. We went from neighbourhood to neighbourhood, doing citizens participation processes to identify their priorities and then used the online platform <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.decidim.barcelona/\">\"Decidim Barcelona\"</url> with 400.000 citizens to prioritize their proposals and create the Government Agenda.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the key motivation for your work in Barcelona? What impacts are you hoping for?</emphasis></p><p>For us, one of the main problems is the crisis of political representation: people don't trust public institutions anymore. They don't think we have a vision for the future, they don't think that we are solving their problems. And also they don't trust the corporations anymore. And this is why we have so many people voting for populist, right-wing parties that are raising to power all around the world.</p><p>So, we wanted to rethink the relationship between citizens and public institutions and try to revitalize democracy, putting people at the centre. Our answer to right-wing populism is not less democracy - it's more democracy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How are you putting that into action?</emphasis></p><p>For example, we own 700 km2 of fibre and have built a sensor and an IoT (Internet of things) network. This means we can store the data in a public repository. Using privacy, security and ethics by design and then use this data to help solve the real problems of the citizens.</p><p>Citizens can choose whom to share their data with: for example, they can grant the doctors access to their medical data in order to improve the health system, but at the same time making sure that insurance companies won't get access to that information. The idea is to give back data sovereignty to citizens.</p><h/><p>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) defended a larger budget for the EU, saying the bloc's funding is already \"stretched\" despite new challenges\u00a0 like digitalisation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Could the model be replicated in other cities?</emphasis></p><p>Yes, we refer to all the technology policies that we run in Barcelona as \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.barcelona.cat/digitalstandards\">ethical digital standards</url>\" and we share them with hundreds of cities around the world using a free software       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.barcelona.cat/digitalstandards\">platform</url>.</p><p>Our digital democracy platform is now being used by over 60 cities around the world and I chair a network of cities called the <url normalizedValue=\"https://globalcio.github.io/welcome/\">Cities CIOs Council.</url>\u00a0There are hundreds of cities who are collaborating in this kind of approaches.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do you feel that less tech-savvy citizens are also involved in these types of developments? Are they clued up to what is going on? Has there been any criticism? </emphasis></p><p>For me, it is very important to make these issues around digitalization more political. It's not about technology, its about the model of the city. Who owns the data and what is done with it, are becoming increasingly political questions now. It's not just about privacy, it's also about the economic and social model.</p><p>In Barcelona we have created the <url normalizedValue=\"https://sharingcitiesalliance.com/\">Sharing Cities Alliance</url>, to collectively negotiate with Uber and Airbnb, following the public pressure they have faced: Uber in terms of workers rights and unfair competition with the cab sector, Airbnb for contributing to the rising cost of housing rentals. Cities get out of control. Our project is about reconquering them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">One way to gain control over services like Uber and Airbnb could be the introduction of a digital tax. But it sounds like this measure would not go far enough?</emphasis></p><p>We should tax these companies. Full stop. Then we can also look at ways we should modernise the international tax system to account for the digitalisation of the economy as it is now happening at the OECD level.</p><p>In Europe we have to build our own way for the digital society, we should not rely on Silicon Valley. We can regulate the big tech platforms, enforce taxation and modernise our competition law but at the same time we need to have our own public infrastructures and we need alternatives. It is a matter of European sovereignty and democracy.</p><h/><p>The cable industry's ambitions of ubiquitous gigabit connectivity have long been hindered by a number of obstacles, including patchy coverage and consumer trust issues. Carlota Reyners Fontana explains what the EU Commission is doing to improve the bloc's broadband gaps.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How can that be done in times when people use all these platforms so heavily?\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>We are using Facebook, Google and so on because we don't have alternatives. We don't control our digital identities, we don't control the data, we don't control the payment systems. Instead of cleaning the mess up afterwards and trying to fix problems of privacy, monopoly power and our poor infrastructures, we have to take these building blocks of the new digital infrastructure back into public hands and get the all ecosystem to work with us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">With the European elections coming up, do you have a message for the new Commission?</emphasis></p><p>Get your act together! We need a strategy and we need to act. We should understand that digital is not just about technical tools or some regulatory framework, it's a core political programme for a future Europe that we have to build.</p><p>This plan should not be about one particular industry, this has a global impact on society. We need structural transformation, including things like the reallocation of property rights, new welfare programs, new education programs making European universities attractive, and having incentives for talented people working in the tech sector to stay in Europe.</p><p>Slowly, I feel like politicians are waking up, confronted with geopolitical changes. We should be able to mobilize collective action to make sure Europe will work for a people-centred, rights-preserving vision for the digital society.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Samuel Stolton]</emphasis></p><h>Further Reading</h><h/><p>The EU must counter poisonous populism with a rEUnaissance delivering a new economic and social contract and hope to European citizens, writes Luca Jahier.</p><h/><p>Over the coming years, the professional higher education sector must smooth educational differences among the European regions, boost local employment and provide students with the

C\u00e9dric O, the French junior minister for digital affairs, told the Guardian that Emmanuel Macron's drive to make companies including Amazon and Apple pay more and fairer tax would go ahead, despite US warnings  that it could open up a new front in the international trade war.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Washington has threatened to retaliate with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/23/french-wine-makers-hope-for-g7-detente-with-trump-over-tariffs\">tariffs of up to 100%</url> on imports of French products such as champagne, cheese, handbags, lipstick and cookware worth $2.4bn (\u00a31.8bn) after a US government investigation found that France's new digital services tax would harm US technology companies.</p><p>A decision on tariffs is expected in the coming weeks, but O said: \"We will not withdraw the tax, that is certain. We think retaliation measures are not good for either the US, France or businesses concerned and they could lead to a reaction from the European Union.\"</p><p>France is to become the first major economy to impose a tax on internet heavyweights. Dubbed the Gafa tax - an acronym for Google, Apple, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/23/french-wine-makers-hope-for-g7-detente-with-trump-over-tariffs\">Facebook</url> and Amazon - the legislation will impose a 3% levy on the total annual revenues of the largest technology firms providing services to French consumers. President Macron has called it a \"fairer\" response to internet giants who are are currently able to book profits in low-tax countries like Ireland and Luxembourg, no matter where the revenue originates. Donald Trump has called it \"foolish\" and threatened revenge. France has argued that the tax is aimed at all tech firms and not just American ones.</p><p>But O said the tax, although \"politically symbolic and democratically important\", was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of new regulations that must be introduced internationally to deal with the powerful tech giants, which he warned had gained a vast footprint on global economies, threatening democracy and risking a public health crisis over hate speech.</p><p>O said internet and technology regulation was now a major part of French soft power on the international diplomatic stage. He said the domination of a tiny number of tech giants on the way people search for information, communicate and interact was now challenging public power and nation states. France is not the only country that has devised a tax on tech firms - the UK is considering its own measures. But France, which wants the OECD club of rich countries to lead on tech tax issues, is now urging the EU and countries further afield to look closer at regulation.</p><p>O said tech giants, as monopolies, now presented a democratic challenge to governments. \"Certain tech platforms have become the building blocks of our economy and democracy,\" he said. \"They have acquired a monopoly position today which gives them a footprint no other company has on the economy, so they need to see specific regulations applied ... A company which has 1.4 billion citizens on its social networks can't be treated like just any other company, with the same rules. A company that is the only search engine or messaging platform can't have just the same rules as any other private company.\"</p><p>He said ideas being discussed internationally could include special regulations for tech giants, making large tech companies share their data or services, or limiting acquisitions.</p><p>Current rules were inadequate and had to be updated, he said. \"Right now, we have a body of regulations that were thought up in the industrial age and struggle to adapt to the data economy.\"</p><p>O said addressing online hate speech was also key. \"Hate speech is a global public health problem,\" he warned. \"The rise in online hate speech creates a major difficulty for public powers: we don't know how to protect our citizens online in the same way we protect them in real life. If I threatened to kill you or your children in the street, I'd face police. But that doesn't exist online. It's both a public health issue and a problem for democracy, because if people think we can't protect them, they will vote for others who they think - rightly or wrongly - can protect them.\"</p><p>He added: \"If the only countries that know how to successfully regulate hate online are authoritarian, non-democratic countries, that is a problem for democracies and progressive governments.\"</p><p>France is currently debating a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/23/french-wine-makers-hope-for-g7-detente-with-trump-over-tariffs\">tough new law against online hatred</url> aimed at wiping out racist and homophobic trolling, but there have been rows in the French senate over whether hateful content should be taken down from a social network site within 24 hours.</p><p>O said he felt people's concerns over the impact of big tech giants in daily life had played a role in citizens' protest movements recently. He said the town-hall debates held in France after the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/23/french-wine-makers-hope-for-g7-detente-with-trump-over-tariffs\">gilets jaunes</url> (yellow vests) anti-government protests had shown there was concern over not just tech giants paying enough tax, but the new online economy and its impact.</p><p>\"Some think the world is developing fast and abandoning them, and tech can be part of that fear - whether it's online commerce, with small businesses closing, the Uber-isation of working patterns, or people questioning how a growing number of decisions are taken by algorithms that no one understands.\"</p><p>He said: \"There are views that technology has gone from a utopia, where the internet was presented as solving all our problems, to a type of dystopia, which is just as irrational. This is particularly present in France, which has had a complex relationship with technology for the past decades. But it's everywhere and we must address it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-59341394</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYP-1S01-F021-6081-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"948\"/><timeReceived>6:15 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

The tax on GAFA - Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon - companies is expected to bring in hundreds of millions of Euros in revenue.\"The tax will be introduced whatever happens on 1st January and it will be for the whole of 2019 for an amount that we estimate at \u20ac500m,\" Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister said a press conference in Paris. </p><p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been working on proposals for an international agreement to regulate taxation on technology companies. France has chosen to move forward with plans because of the way big companies are structured so carefully and intricately in ways that allow them to derive huge revenues form European economies while skirting the bulk of their tax bills[1] by moving profits to low-tax jurisdictions. The European Commission estimates that regular companies pay in the region of 23% tax on profits while internet companies only pay a mere eight to nine percent and some firms pay nothing at all. The EU-wide levy failed in part because key member states vetoed the proposal, namely Ireland, a country in which Google and Apple both own headquarters. According to DW, Ireland justified its decision because it believed the tax would exacerbate EU-US trade tensions. France has been recently backed by Germany in a proposal to enforce a three percent tax on big internet companies[2] that make money from user data or digital advertising. It's proposed the three percent tax should be enforceable by 2021 with the hope that it will level the playing field between the big guys and the smaller companies that pay more tax. But again, it must be agreed upon by all 28 member states and stets such as Ireland, Sweden and Denmark have all publicly voiced their concerns while Germany is seeking a diluted proposal, much to the frustration of France. The UK also has plans to pursue a domestic tax after Phillip Hammond said the UK can no longer wait for \"painfully slow\" discussions regarding tech firms' tax avoidance[3] in the EU to produce meaningful solutions. Hammond plans to introduce the new domestic tax by April 2020 which is predicted to rake in more than 400 million for the British economy.

Because of the Gilets Jaunes protests or yellow vests movement that has spread across the country, French President Emmanuel Macron has scrapped the controversial gas tax and is planning to raise the minimum wage as well as tax cuts for elderly pensioners.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-3946339</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V0M-2VM1-DY7P-T3MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"222\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>College Media Network: Media network college</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 18, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They want to turn France into one of the leading countries when it comes to artificial intelligence. \u201c[Artificial intelligence] is a technological, economical, social and obviously ethical revolution,\u201d Macron said in a speech. \u201cThis revolution won\u2019t happen in 50 or 60 years, it\u2019s happening right now. </p><p>There are new opportunities and we can choose to follow some innovations or not.\u201d Some of the best mathematics and engineering schools are in France, and some of the best data scientists and AI researchers come from France. Many of them now work in California or London for Facebook, Deepmind, etc. And the French government wants to capitalize on that soft power to make an AI push. And yet, how do you attract engineers and scientists? France\u2019s answer is quite complicated because the government doesn\u2019t want to inject a ton of public money and call it a day. It\u2019s all about creating an AI ecosystem with strong pillars. France\u2019s AI strategy First, many private companies have opened or plan to open AI research centers in France. Facebook and Google already work with hundreds of researchers in Paris. Today, Samsung, Fujitsu, DeepMind, IBM and Microsoft all announced plans to open offices in France to focus on AI research. This represents tens of millions of dollars in investments and hundreds of employees. \u201cEverybody is saying that Silicon Valley is overflowing right now,\u201d a source close to the French President told me. That\u2019s why big tech companies need to find talent outside of the U.S. Foreign companies creating hundreds of jobs isn\u2019t going to foster public research and European tech giants though \u2014 these companies are just tapping the smartest brains they can find. That\u2019s why the French government wants to make it easier to work on fundamental research papers when you work for a private company. The INRIA is going to create a national AI research program with four or five partners. The goal is quite simple \u2014 Macron said that there should be twice as many people studying and researching AI projects in France. Researchers will also be able to access and use some cloud computing capacities for their work. It\u2019s also going to get easier if you want to create a startup based on your research work or if you want to work for a private company during your PhD. Second, France is going to set some new boundaries when it comes to data. French administrations are going to share new data sets so that anyone can build AI services using those data sets. When it comes to health data, it looks like France wants to avoid another NHS/DeepMind scandal. While multiple French governments have worked on some kind of health data hub, Macron announced that this time it\u2019s going to happen for real. The INDS is going to make sure that services and public institutions respect your privacy and grant authorizations on a case-by-case basis. Third, when it comes to regulation, companies will be able to experiment in multiple industries. And it starts with autonomous vehicles. Companies will be able to test level 4 self-driving cars in 2019. Overall, France is going to invest $1.85 billion (\u20ac1.5 billion) in AI projects, from public research to startup investments. Last year, Macron announced that there would be a new $11.2 billion (\u20ac10 billion) public fund managed by Bpifrance. Macron said today that AI startups should be the first priority of this new fund. Making AI as neutral as possible Arguably, the most interesting part of Macron\u2019s speech was about the moral impact of artificial intelligence. As algorithms become more prominent, there\u2019s a risk that they become black boxes that decide for you. The French administration already has to share all its algorithms and data that they use following Axelle Lemaire\u2019s law. But that\u2019s still not the case for some touchy subjects. Macron said it\u2019s still a work in progress. Research projects or companies financed with public money will also have to share everything \u2014 this could impact public infrastructure companies for instance. But it\u2019s more complicated when you\u2019re talking about private companies. Macron said GDPR was a step in the right direction. And now, he wants to go further. He doesn\u2019t have any practical suggestion for now, but he said that there should be an international certification authority. For instance, this authority could make sure that there\u2019s no bias in training data sets. I don\u2019t think Facebook or Google would enjoy this new regulation. Finally, you introduce a bias if your staff is not diverse enough. That\u2019s why schools and universities should make sure that they train a diverse group of people. Not the first AI push As Next INpact pointed out, there have been multiple reports on artificial intelligence over the past few years \u2014 FranceIA, the CNIL, the OPECST and the European Economic and Social Committee all wrote their own recommendations when it comes to AI policies. Today, Fields medal winner and parliament member C233;dric Villani shared a new report on artificial intelligence. It\u2019s always an interesting read, and it was the inspiration for Macron\u2019s speech today. According to a source close to the French President, multiple ministers now have to focus on artificial intelligence for their own industries. Today\u2019s report feels more like a starting point than a conclusion. The French President thinks that AI is something important but not urgent. Now, it\u2019s all about convincing the rest of the government to put aside all the urgent tasks for a minute and look at what\u2019s important. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN713397520180403</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S18-BK01-DXCW-D46C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"945\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 3, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

On July 16, 2020, in Schrems II, the EU Court of Justice invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield mechanism. The EU Court of Justice struck down a similar program, the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor, in 2015. Over 5,000 companies, including many franchisors and franchisees, that self-certified for Privacy Shield with the U.S. Commerce Department may no longer rely on it for data transfers of EU personal data to the U.S.So What? Franchisors may be in breach of vendor and other contracts to the extent they have agreed to fully comply with all relevant data privacy laws and they fail to be covered by an appropriate legal mechanism allowing for such cross border transfer of data. </p><p>In addition, with Privacy Shield no longer available as a data transfer mechanism, there is potential risk of EU regulatory cease and desist orders to stop data transfer, and fines of up to 4% of a company's worldwide annual turnover or gross revenues. How Does Schrems II Affect Franchisors? All franchisors with operations or activities in Europe need to consider the impact of this EU Court of Justice decision. The main EU privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), applies to any franchise (regardless of where it is based) that collects or processes personal data from EU residents. U.S.-based franchisors that receive customer data from their EU franchisees must review what data they collect and for what purposes to see what new actions may be necessary to comply with the GDPR. A franchisor operating a worldwide customer loyalty program should review how the Schrems decision impacts their program. Franchisors may also need to reconsider their handling of personal data for existing and prospective EU franchisees.Why Did this Happen? The transfer of EU personal data is limited to countries with 'adequate' data protection safeguards in place. Due to the access of the NSA and other federal law enforcement to personal data in the U.S., the Schrems II Court has again held U.S. data protection to be 'inadequate.' Privacy Shield utilized an 'ombudsperson' process to protect EU data privacy rights, but the Court questioned its independence and authority to make binding decisions on U.S. intelligence.Is that All? No. Schrems II calls into question the viability of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), far and away the most common EU personal data transfer mechanism in use. SCCs are EU-approved appendices that permit data transfer, but parties to a contract must adopt the clauses verbatim. In so doing, the parties agree to EU jurisdiction and the technical data protection requirements in the clauses.Are Standard Contractual Clauses Dead? Not yet. A case-by-case analysis now applies to SCC transfers. The Schrems II Court holds that EU exporters of data (or EU data regulators) must suspend SCC data transfers when the law of the recipient country 'allows its public authorities to interfere with the rights of the data subjects to which that data relates.' Given that the U.S. already falls into that category of countries, however, it appears that suspensions of SCC transfers to the U.S. may be imminent.Does Franchisor Compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act Help in the EU? Not really. Many franchise businesses are now complying with the data privacy requirements of the CCPA, but the EU Court's decision in Schrems II was based upon concerns over the reach of U.S. intelligence into EU personal data. Even under the CCPA's data privacy regimen, EU personal data remains subject to surveillance by the U.S. government.What Should Franchisors Receiving EU Customer and Personal Data Do? Take stock of the Personal Data You Collect. Only collect personal data that you actually need. The collection and processing of data that is of little or no value will only expose you to risks of noncompliance with data privacy laws and possible costs and damages resulting from any data breach. All franchisors on U.S. soil should take a close look at how they receive, process and store the personal data of EU citizens. Prepare to explain the actions you have taken to protect the data at issue. If your franchise business enrolled in Privacy Shield, keep up the data protection measures you adopted as part of the process. Implementation of those safeguards indicates a strong privacy program, as opposed to a check-the-box approach. Know what happens to the EU data you receive, and with whom you share it. If the collection of EU data does not serve a specific purpose, do not collect and store such data. Adjust Your Contracts and Manuals. To the extent possible and appropriate, insert contractual language that accurately states what you do to comply with data privacy laws, including cross border transfer of data. In addition, review all data privacy guidelines described in operations manuals to ensure they correctly inform franchisees of your data privacy directives. Given that EU data regulators are likely to focus early enforcement efforts on the giants of the tech industry, businesses can use this time to craft robust 'data transfer agreements' and 'data processing agreements' to supplement Standard Contractual Clauses. Look at the Clouds. Cloud services may help with transfers, but they are not a panacea. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud arguably serve as nation-less server farms that allow the processing of data in the cloud, as opposed to any particular country. There are two problems with this argument. First, a cloud is a collection of physical servers with physical locations. In fact, cloud services offer restricted geographic regions to their customers. See <url normalizedValue=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html</url>[1]. Second, cloud services are not immune to requests, subpoenas or surveillance by U.S. intelligence. Still, a cloud provider can be a powerful ally in your corner. Expect the cloud providers and other big tech to continue to push EU regulators to accept the 'EU Cloud Code of Conduct,' in the works since 2017. Unless and until the cloud itself becomes an accepted data transfer mechanism, the cloud providers will argue that they provide 'adequate' safeguards. On the same day that Schrems II was issued, Microsoft sought to assure its cloud customers, noting 'a settlement that enabled us to begin disclosing transparency reports about the number of U.S. national security orders we receive and established new policies within the U.S. government limiting the use of secrecy orders.' <url normalizedValue=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/eupolicy/2020/07/16/assuring-customers-about-cross-border-data-flows/\">https://blogs.microsoft.com/eupolicy/2020/07/16/assuring-customers-about-cross-border-data-flows/</url>[2]  Consider Other Data Transfer Mechanisms. Schrems II ended Privacy Shield and weakened SCCs, but Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) and GDPR Article 49 'derogations' remain limited options. BCRs are internal rules that govern transfers amongst the same group of companies. EU data authorities consider BCRs on a company-by-company basis. The approval process is multi-layered, and can be costly and time-consuming. As with SCCs, inter-company BCRs covering data transfers to the U.S. may face heightened scrutiny given Schrems II's inadequacy finding. Article 49 of the GDPR permits data transfers pursuant to exemptions ('derogations') in the absence of a valid transfer mechanism. For example, a derogation can apply if a data subject explicitly consents to the transfer, or if the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller. The European Data Protection Board interprets derogations narrowly, however, and they are not intended to be large-scale solutions to data transfers to the U.S. Hope for New Transfer Mechanisms. The EU and U.S. could negotiate a new mechanism to replace Privacy Shield, but it is unlikely at this point. Article 42 of the GDPR contemplates the development of codes of conduct and certification mechanisms to provide appropriate safeguards for cross-border data transfers, but there is nothing concrete at present. Finally, the EU Commission has been working on new SCCs, and was rumored to have them ready for release had Schrems II invalidated SCCs. It is not clear when or if such new SCCs will issue. Consult With Your IT About Alternatives. If the EU effectively shuts down all viable means of transferring personal data to the U.S. for processing, then you may need to examine the feasibility and economics of replicating or creating operations in the EU to process the data there or another country deemed 'adequate.' The topic warrants a spot on corporate medium- and long-range planning agendas. Remain Pragmatic. If the EU data authorities are left to enforce Schrems II alone, then past experience indicates that the Big Tech companies will receive the brunt of regulatory action, leaving the EU with limited resources to police the vast volume of data transfers to the U.S. If EU data controllers read Schrems II and refuse on their own to transfer data to the U.S., however, then the commercial impact will be abrupt and significant.What Comes Next? The status quo for personal data transfers out of the EU will not likely remain for long. The U.S. tends to get the heat and headlines in the EU, but all nations engage in data intelligence. EU countries surveille their own citizens, and it continues to be an issue for debate. <url normalizedValue=\"https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2017-surveillance-intelligence-services-vol-2-summary_en.pdf\">https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2017-surveillance-intelligence-services-vol-2-summary_en.pdf</url>[3]. Further, many countries are enacting data localization rules, requiring any personal data to be stored in-that country. China and Russia, among others, assert a right to engage in intelligence on data found within their borders.At the end of the day, a political solution is necessary. The EU will need to consider surveillance and national security as important considerations to be balanced against privacy rights, and seek a pragmatic, agreeable solution to commercial data transfer. The United States may need to bolster their enforcement of data privacy rights of individuals. In the meantime, companies must take stock of what personal data they collect and for what purposes. If they must handle the personal data of EU residents, it is essential that they monitor this volatile legal landscape and implement processes that are appropriate for their unique uses of personal data.

It was Gregory S. Bielli, the president and CEO of the Tejon Ranch Company. We'd met him once before, when we were in a better frame of mind.</p><p><br/><br/>Tejon Ranch is a small public company headquartered in Lebec, about an hour north of Los Angeles, and its main asset is obvious from Interstate 5: real estate. The company owns the largest continuous expanse of private land in California, a 270,000-acre parcel-about half the size of Rhode Island-wedged between two national forests, Los Padres and Sequoia.<br/>Together, the two of us owned more than 18,000 shares of Tejon Ranch, an investment our wives had advised us against. When we'd bought in about a year earlier, the shares had been worth nearly half a million dollars-a significant chunk of our retirement nest eggs. Tejon Ranch had appeared to us to be poorly managed. As professors who write about shareholder activism, we'd thought we'd seen an opportunity to mimic the big activists, such as Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn, who agitate to improve the transparency and performance of much larger companies.<br/>Listen to the audio version of this article:<url normalizedValue=\"https://goo.gl/hU2dqX\">Download the Audm app</url> for your iPhone to listen to more titles.<br/>We had been pressuring Tejon Ranch's executives, using the playbook that top activists have developed over the past decade or so. But the stock had tanked, we had lost more than $70,000, and we thought Bielli had lied to us.<br/>We rolled down our windows to shout to him as we entered the resort's roundabout, but then thought better of it. We were on a scouting trip, in advance of the company's annual shareholder meeting the next morning; we'd come to see the meeting room and plan our attack. (The cheapest rooms at the Balboa Bay Resort were four times as expensive as those at the Newport Mesa Inn, so we were staying four miles inland.) We would have plenty of time to badger Bielli at the meeting, when we would be clean, better dressed, and better prepared.<br/>For as long as public companies have existed, so too has tension between shareholding owners and company managers. In their 1932 book, The Modern Corporation and Private Property, Adolf A. Berle and Gardiner C. Means described the \"separation of ownership and control\" inherent in corporations, and noted that owners and managers have different goals. As a company grows and its shareholders become more dispersed, they wrote, it becomes harder for shareholders to pressure managers, and a gap develops between the owners' interests and the managers' behavior.<br/>Over the decades, the size of this gap has oscillated. At times of minimal pressure from shareholders, power has shifted toward managers, who pay themselves more, enjoy corporate perquisites, build dubious empires, and in some cases relax into mediocrity. But every so often shareholders revolt, not unlike citizens staging a coup when their leaders lose touch.<br/>The 1980s, a decade of corporate raids evoked so memorably in the book Barbarians at the Gate, were one such revolutionary moment. At the start of that decade, most stock was held by scattered, individual investors, and institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies were passive owners. In 1981, there was not a single attempt in the U.S. by any investor to unseat a manager. It was a good time to be a chief executive.<br/>But during the following five years, all of that changed. By 1986, more than 10 percent of corporate takeovers were hostile-the buyers bypassed managers and instead directly offered shareholders a large premium to sell their shares-and banks were making record-setting loans to fund them. (The raiders greatly augmented, or leveraged, their investments with borrowed money, enabling them to target even the biggest corporations.) Carl Icahn targeted and broke up underperforming companies, such as the airline TWA. T. Boone Pickens and others went after bulky conglomerates, questioning what a company like Beatrice might gain from making both orange juice and bras, or why the CEO of Unocal, a sprawling oil company that eventually merged with Chevron, needed a piano on a company jet.<br/>Eventually, companies developed defenses, most notably the \"poison pill,\" which dilutes the stake (and voting rights) of anyone who acquires a substantial amount of stock without first obtaining the board's approval. By the 1990s, power had been returned to management.<br/>But the past decade or so has brought another round of agitation against management, just as significant as the corporate raiding of the 1980s. Activist hedge funds have sought out companies whose managers didn't seem to be acting in the best interest of shareholders, and exposed them. Some of these funds, like the ones led by Ackman and Icahn, have attracted the media spotlight, but most are considerably quieter in their approach and in the news coverage they generate.<br/>Unlike the 1980s corporate raiders, activist hedge funds don't seek to take over companies outright. Instead, they buy minority stakes-typically 5 to 10 percent-in companies that seem to be performing poorly, and then press for actions that would increase the share price: buying back stock, spinning off a key division, firing the CEO, or even selling the company to someone else.<br/>Activists have found allies in mutual funds and pension funds, which are unwilling or unable to play an active role on their own, in part due to the sheer number of holdings in their vast portfolios. Hedge funds also help one another, forming \"wolf packs\" that together can overcome managers' resistance to their demands: After one buys in, others follow. Today, numerous activists, including Ackman, Icahn, and Paul Singer at Elliott Management, each control more than $10 billion of capital-capital that is, in its own way, highly leveraged, not by debt but by the money and voting shares of allies.<br/>Activist hedge funds are controversial; some observers have accused them of pushing companies to take actions that yield quick profits but ultimately destroy value and jobs. Regardless, major companies have bent to their will. Activists pushed for the ouster of Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. They created turmoil at Sotheby's, where they aggressively fought to rework the board. Starboard Value, a prominent activist fund, shook up Darden Restaurants, not only replacing the entire board, but scrutinizing small operational details at Olive Garden. (Starboard's analysts found that Olive Garden could save up to $5 million a year simply by training staff to give each patron one or two bread sticks instead of passing them out like swag. Savings would likewise emerge from cutting down on salad dressing-a win for patrons as well, the analysts surmised; they'd concluded that overdressed greens were leaving customers unhappy.)<br/>By the time we were ready to try our experiment, in 2014, shareholder activism was ubiquitous, at least at large companies. More than 500 activist funds controlled a total of more than $100 billion in assets. According to our research, they were targeting more than 100 public companies a year.<br/>On November 2, 2014, over dinner at Juniper and Ivy, a bustling \"left-coast cookery\" in the Little Italy neighborhood of San Diego, we got to discussing our professional plans. We thought we had done just about everything two academics studying shareholder activism could do. We had published well-received research articles. One of us (Frank) had served as an expert witness in disputes brought by companies who challenged activists' tactics under federal law. We had spoken at and hosted conferences on activism and knew many of the big players. In between bites of buttermilk biscuits, we considered possible new projects.<br/>When dessert arrived, Steven was struck with what initially seemed like a crazy idea: \"Let's get out of the ivory tower and try actually being activists. We'll pick a company and target its managers. How hard can it be?\" It wasn't completely crazy. Steven had been a corporate attorney for almost a decade, and Frank (also an attorney) had worked in derivatives at Morgan Stanley; we hadn't always been creatures of the tower, and had skills and experience that seemed germane. We resolved that night to find a small company, invest, and shake things up.<br/>We first learned about Tejon Ranch from a student presentation in one of Steven's classes. The company made money from a hodgepodge of farming and minerals businesses related to its land, as well as from commercial leases. It grew almonds, grapes, and pistachios; collected royalties on oil and gas and on limestone excavated for cement; even traded water rights. Along Interstate 5, a giant Tejon Ranch outlet mall boasted the highest-grossing Starbucks in California. But the company's true value was still unrealized.<br/>The land had been in development for decades, and yet the great majority of it was still undeveloped. What's more, it was unclear exactly when the various residential developments that the company had approved would be finished (or even started). The market capitalization of Tejon Ranch-the value of all its shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange-was about half a billion dollars. By our calculations, the value of the land alone was likely at least twice that. We spotted two crucial problems that we felt we could help address. First, Tejon Ranch needed to improve its disclosures, so investors could understand the value of its land. (For example, the company could disclose the value per square foot that its joint-venture partners had estimated for small parcels that were already being developed.) Second, the company needed a more aggressive timetable for development.<br/>Tejon Ranch seemed like a perfect target. Its stock price had dropped almost 50 percent over 10 years. Its revenue in 2014 was minuscule for a public company: just $52 million. Profits were just $5.7 million. Meanwhile, the managers were feasting: Bielli, the CEO, made $2.7 million in 2014; his CFO and second-in-command, Allen Lyda, made $1.2 million. The company appeared in need of a shake-up.<br/>We began buying shares, building our stake over the course of about a week and a half. On some days, our purchases were more than 10 percent of the company's stock activity on the New York Stock Exchange. By May 13, 2015, we each owned about 9,000 shares-more than Bielli himself owned.<br/>At lunchtime the next day, we sent a short letter to Bielli, asking for a meeting. We didn't say much other than that we were \"significant shareholders\" who were \"excited\" about the business. We assumed the company would ignore us, at least at first.<br/>But the head of investor relations replied that afternoon, saying he, Bielli, and Lyda would be \"more than happy to meet with you.\" We set a date in July. It was that easy.<br/>Shareholders are typically happy when activists target a company they're invested in: When an activist hedge fund announces an ownership stake of more than 5 percent (the threshold that requires public disclosure), the company's stock price tends to go up immediately. (Frank's co-authored research shows that this increase has been, on average, about 7 percent.) Securities analysts give targeted firms higher ratings and, although studies differ, most available evidence shows that targeted companies report higher returns over the next five years.<br/>And yet chief executives are seldom pleased when activists darken their door. It's not hard to see why. In a majority of cases, activists push for some kind of organizational change, especially at the top. Historically, CEO pay has declined by an average of about $1 million in the year after an activist intervention, and CEO turnover post-intervention is higher than that at similar corporations.<br/>There is also the matter of some activists' tactics. One weapon in their arsenal-sometimes deployed almost immediately-is the \"poison pen\" letter, a vitriolic expos not unlike the letters that sometimes featured in Agatha Christie's novels, but focused on business transgressions instead of sexual ones.<br/>Daniel Loeb, a pioneering activist and the founder of the hedge fund Third Point, made billions of dollars by excoriating CEOs and board members with such letters, which he released publicly. In 2003, for instance, he labeled L. Pendleton Siegel, then the CEO and chairman of the lumber-and-real-estate company Potlatch, the \"Chief Value Destroyer\" after the company's shares dropped 60 percent in six years. Loeb also lambasted the company's directors for acting as management's \"lackeys,\" calling two people on the board-both descendants of the timber baron Frederick Weyerhaeuser, a co-founder of Potlatch in 1903-members of the \"Lucky Sperm Club.\" He asked pointed questions about Potlatch's losses, its pension plan, and its business strategy. In another letter, to Irik Sevin, the CEO and president of Star Gas, Loeb wrote: \"Do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites.\" (Sevin resigned less than a month after Loeb first disclosed his fund's investment; Siegel fared better, staying on as the chair of the Potlatch board until he retired in 2006.)<br/>We imagined a gentler approach-we wanted to work constructively with Bielli and the Tejon Ranch management team. We figured it would be difficult to force Tejon Ranch to develop its property more quickly. But several sophisticated investors already sat on the company's board, including Daniel Tisch, the son of Laurence Tisch (the late financier and a co-founder of the Loews Corporation), who had been buying up Tejon Ranch shares for years. Four investment funds held stakes more than 100 times larger than ours. If we could persuade management merely to illuminate the business more fully-perhaps with the support of some of these large investors-we might start a chain reaction.<br/>Activists often target the most-opaque companies. By shining a light on the dark corners of a business, they can uncover problems that demand fixing. In the case of Tejon Ranch, a lack of clarity about land value and development hurdles-regulatory, environmental-created uncertainty about whether management was doing all it could. That uncertainty might have inhibited potential buyers of the company from coming forth. If we could persuade the company to disclose more details, a potential buyer might emerge.<br/>A billionaire activist might have traveled to the Tejon Ranch headquarters by private jet or helicopter. We drove.<br/>We followed the same route that the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoaches took in the mid-19th century. We marveled at the mountains, the valleys, the trees-and the absence of people. There hasn't been much development at Tejon Ranch since it was established in the mid-1800s, with land grants from Mexico. Much of the acreage probably looks about the same now as it did then.<br/>To prepare for our meeting, we pulled into one of the company's few developed plots of land, a rest stop, where the Black Bear Diner was as deserted as the surrounding landscape. Midway through 2015, Tejon Ranch was not having a banner year. Combined revenues from farming and minerals were essentially flat, and the timetable was uncertain for the company's main hope, three new residential communities totaling more than 30,000 homes.<br/>We finalized our pitch while we pulled up to the corporate headquarters, an unimposing ranch-style building. There were maybe a dozen cars in the front parking lot. We pulled on the door handles of the entrance, which are replicas of the Tejon Ranch log a cross above a semicircle, a little like an upside-down ankh.<br/>The lobby was deserted, but the receptionist was expecting us, and Bielli and Lyda quickly appeared, along with the head of investor relations. The three men ushered us into a conference room. There was no general counsel. The only lawyers present were us.<br/>Bielli had well-coiffed hair and a smooth, friendly swagger. We liked him immediately. He had been hired in 2013 to replace the outgoing CEO, after working as a regional president of a residential real-estate developer. At age 55, he was also the company's youngest board member, its \"new blood.\"<br/>We told Bielli we thought that Tejon Ranch shares were massively undervalued, and that the company needed to disclose many more details about its finances and its development timetables. We believed that if potential investors knew that the land would be developed soon, the stock price would skyrocket. Disclosures are a touchy issue for corporate managers: They can make problems public or, if they are false or misleading, they can be the basis for a future class-action lawsuit. But Bielli was gracious and affable, saying that he agreed with every point. He assured us that Tejon Ranch had a disclosure-review process that would be lead to improvements by the end of the year. It would respond to all our concerns. We left after an hour feeling energized and validated. Bielli seemed ready to do everything we'd asked. Lyda, the CFO, followed up a few weeks later with assurances that the company's joint ventures, a specific area we had mentioned where we thought disclosures were poor, were \"definitely an area where we will continue to expand our disclosure.\"<br/>We were frankly at a loss as to what to do next. We had the promise of improved disclosures in six months, but after the meeting, we began to worry that it was a delay tactic. Some shareholder activists might have turned up the heat immediately, publishing an angry letter. But we decided to be patient.<br/>We also worried a bit about what the disclosure might show. Would it really cause the share price to rise, as investors came to understand the company's true value? Activists succeed by demonstrating that the answer to that kind of question is yes. But it was also possible that more disclosure would show that faster development was nearly impossible, due to California's bureaucracy, regulatory requirements, and environmental challenges. In that case, the share price might not change-if anything, the revelation that management could do nothing to develop the land faster might depress it.<br/>The end of the year came and went with no disclosure-review results in the areas we'd discussed, so on January 19, 2016, we sent Bielli an email asking for an update. We also expressed our displeasure with Tejon Ranch's recent performance. The stock price had declined by more than a third since the start of 2015; we had lost more than $100,000 collectively on paper. Bielli received $1.9 million in pay that year.<br/>The response was again swift, but not nearly as friendly. Bielli wrote: \"We wish to clarify that during our meeting in 2015, we advised you that management and the board, including the audit committee, regularly and continually discuss our level of disclosure, and that of our peer group.\" Then he said, \"We did not intend to imply that the board and/or management was engaging in a specific, unique disclosure review process\"-but rather that there was an \"on-going\" process to review disclosure. (Tejon Ranch declined to comment further on our conversations with Bielli and other company executives, or on our arguments in this article, except to say that the company \"does not disclose material non-public information unless such disclosure is to all investors at the same time,\" that it is \"receptive to the views of shareholders,\" that its board and management regularly review its strategy, that it is a unique company, and that it is confident in its prospects. It also declined to participate in the fact-checking of the article.)<br/>Bielli had evidently lawyered up, and we should not have been surprised. As activism has become more common, some companies have responded proactively by doing what many activists would ask for: buying back their own stock, spinning off divisions, and paying out cash to stockholders in the form of dividends. But they are also defending themselves better against the deeper operational changes some activists seek. Many have hired lawyers and consultants to advise them on how to avoid being targeted-and how to resist activists' demands if they are targeted.<br/>Some companies have adopted notice provisions in their bylaws, which force activists to give the board advance warning before they try to replace directors or propose new strategies. These and other measures add cost and red tape to activists' efforts, and give management time to wage a public-relations war against them. Companies have also become more proactive with shareholders generally, blasting them information and conveying the idea that they are transparent and open to dialogue. The main goal of all this defense is to rally the shareholder base to management's side. Painting activists as money-grubbing short-timers who will harm the company's long-term prospects-and who care nothing for the broader social goals the company's management has always cherished-is a favored strategy. We worried that Tejon Ranch might be preparing some of these strategies against us.<br/>We retained an attorney-a prominent securities lawyer who agreed to represent us for free-to try to prove that Bielli had backtracked on his promise of disclosure. But that was a tough assignment, because we had nothing in writing, and we weren't successful.<br/>We again considered sending out a Daniel Loeb\"like poison-pen letter, to cast public aspersions on Bielli for misleading us. But that didn't appeal to us, so we swallowed our anger and tried to understand his perspective. Bielli made a lot of money, but he was a new CEO and his job was difficult.<br/>We wanted to keep the pressure on him and the company, but in a responsible way. Shareholders of public companies really have only one chance per year to do that: the annual meeting. That is when the directors are elected or reelected, and threatening to unseat directors is the activist's ultimate weapon. In recent years activists have won some 70 percent of election contests, known as proxy fights, and even when they lose, the board and management frequently yield to the pressure anyway. For example, the activist Nelson Peltz lost his proxy fight against DuPont, but the CEO still eventually resigned.<br/>We couldn't credibly threaten a proxy fight. We didn't have the money to stage one; it would require the hiring of both a publicist and a proxy-solicitation firm to reach out to all the other shareholders, and would cost more than $1 million. But there was one thing we could do at the annual meeting: talk. We would have an opportunity to take the floor and advocate for improved disclosure and a clear timetable. We thought our plan was a good one-and well timed to resonate with other shareholders. The stock price of Tejon Ranch had recently hit its lowest point since the 1990s. Our retirement funds were evaporating.<br/>The meeting at Balboa Bay was scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. on May 11, 2016, with breakfast in the Commodore Room, overlooking some yachts. As we signed in, wearing freshly pressed shirts, Bielli appeared with Lyda, the CFO, and a newly hired general counsel who had been an attorney with the city of Anaheim. Lyda seemed uncomfortable interacting with us, but Bielli slapped us on our shoulders and joked about our row over disclosures. We told him we were looking forward to some new disclosures in his investor-relations presentation later that morning. He laughed and suggested we grab some food.<br/>This was a half-billion-dollar company, one we thought was worth a lot more, but only about 10 shareholders were in attendance. One was wearing a Route 66 T-shirt and cargo shorts and told us he owned 50 shares, now worth about $1,000. He had decided to buy the stock after driving back and forth past the property for many years. Of course, we weren't expecting a scene from Wall Street, where Gordon Gekko speaks to a packed hall of shareholders. The reality is that, with the exception of a few well-known large companies such as Berkshire Hathaway, almost no one attends shareholder meetings. (Some companies are even doing away with in'person meetings, instead having virtual meetings where personal interaction is impossible.) Tejon Ranch's annual meeting was typical. Although the company's stock was languishing, it looked like the only pressure from shareholders would be coming from us.<br/>Even so, this was our chance to interact with the board. We met several of the company's directors, including Daniel Tisch, who still owned a large stake and said he'd be happy to speak with us further at some point. All were men, and their average age was 65. One told us he was serving on the board as a public service. Another said he couldn't believe Tejon Ranch was still a public company, and should find a buyer. When we asked a third director about the idea of selling the company, he said, \"Sure, we'd be open to that, but we haven't received any offers.\" The board was certainly not without expertise, but overall, its members seemed more like a friendly group of retired local real-estate brokers than the independent directors of a New York Stock Exchange\"listed company.<br/>The meeting started on time, and the chairman of the board read from a script. Bielli gave his presentation, which summarized the company's proposed land developments but didn't add new detail. When he finished, the chairman asked whether anyone would like to speak. We stood up and poured our hearts out about Tejon Ranch's potential, its falling stock price, its sluggish development, and its inadequate disclosures. We emphasized that we believed the stock price was low because management refused to commit to a clear development timetable. The man in the cargo shorts seemed impressed. We felt we had made our mark, and the meeting ended with tension in the air. A few of the directors walked over to thank us. Tisch gave us his contact information.<br/>We weren't sure how Bielli would react. The largest investors, who sat on the board, told us they wanted Tejon Ranch to be more aggressive. They were open to finding a buyer. But they didn't seem inclined to put genuinely heavy pressure on Bielli or his team. Tejon Ranch was just a sliver of the portfolios of many of its investors. And some saw the company as a very long-term investment: The land would always be there, awaiting its eventual development; slow progress wasn't optimal, but it might have a silver lining nonetheless-pushing the share price down further and presenting a good opportunity to buy more shares. (Tisch, who is 66 years old, later said his grandchildren would see the fruits of his investment.)<br/>We weren't interested in waiting decades, and we asked to meet with Bielli again, in early November. Even after our dispute, he agreed. We planned our final gambit.<br/>On Election Day, we drove back to the Tejon Ranch headquarters. The air was crisp and dry, and the markets were calm. Tejon Ranch's stock was up a bit since the shareholder meeting, but we were still carrying a paper loss of more than $40,000.<br/>Once again, everyone knew we were coming. Bielli and a couple of his colleagues greeted us with smiles and Tejon Ranch\"labeled water bottles. We sat around a table ringed with photographs of sites of the company's potential developments. Facing us was a large photo of a shimmering lake at the entrance to one of the three residential communities the company had planned.<br/>The best shareholder activists know the granular details of their target's businesses. After a year and a half as amateur activists, we had learned those details as best we could. We asked about a new joint venture, which had valued some land at $3.50 per square foot. We pressed them about whether this value was accurate and represented a fair estimate of other real estate on the property. If it did, Tejon Ranch should be worth billions. But they dodged this question, and referred us to their most recent investor-relations presentation for any information about valuation estimates. Bielli was prepared. He wasn't going to say too much, as he had during our first meeting.<br/>We dug into some financial minutiae. We even asked about the state of the lake depicted in the photograph on the wall, given its importance to the marketing of that development project and the drought in California; Bielli admitted that \"it's completely dry now, and has been for some time.\" We hoped they would tell the public more about these issues, but had little power to make them do so.<br/>Then we asked the big question: What did Bielli think about selling the company? We had been speaking with a few potential buyers (though our conversations had been only preliminary), and we told him that. We thought he would be angry, or at least surprised. But he responded smoothly. He said that the benefits of being public outweighed the costs. He had been at a private company and had worked under pressure from private-equity investors. Public markets, he said, enabled Tejon Ranch to operate under much less short-term pressure, and to take a longer-term perspective. We were flabbergasted: Many companies go private or stay private to avoid the short-term pressure that public markets can create. But the fact is, for companies the size of Tejon Ranch-and there are thousands of them, filling the portfolios of mutual funds and pension funds, even though most investors have never heard their name-Bielli is probably right. Because so many investors are passive today, most CEOs can relax, even if their performance is mediocre.<br/>We drove away discouraged. The company had enormous potential. But realizing its value seemed impracticable. To be sure, Bielli and his team faced an uphill battle to develop the property and clear regulatory and environmental hurdles. And they disclosed more in 2016 than they did in 2015, perhaps because of us. But the timeline was still vague. This was what the company's annual report said about their three major residential projects: \"Estimated completion time anticipated to be 25 years, or greater, from commencement of construction. To-date construction has not begun.\" That wasn't going to lure a buyer.<br/>As we drove back through the mountains, we tried to imagine what the land would look like in 100 years. Would this area be a flourishing exurb of Los Angeles? A home to new campuses of big tech companies like Google and Apple? Or would it still be deserted, a source of high income for a handful of executives, but of little value to anyone else?<br/>Whether you love them or hate them, activist hedge funds are the most important phenomenon to emerge in the financial markets during the past 20 years. But this wave of activism recently seems to have peaked, for reasons that-if you squint hard-mirror our own failure.<br/>Even large activists are having difficulties. Easy opportunities, like getting big, cash-rich companies to pay some of that cash out to shareholders, are mostly gone; the remaining opportunities involve the hard work of organizational change. And as companies develop and share their own playbooks for fending off activists, that's becoming harder for outsiders to impose. This was a lesson we learned: Without a quick trick in mind-a proposal that would be relatively painless for management to adopt-you need to dig in and be willing to unseat and replace the CEO and operate the company differently. Many of today's hedge funds are not prepared to face more-difficult operational tasks. And once you start looking at companies below a certain size, it's not worth your while to try.<br/>Some large institutional investors, such as pension funds, have begun pulling their money from activists. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square, which had been one of the most successful activist funds, lost money last year (in large part due to an ill-fated bet on Valeant Pharmaceuticals). As in the 1990s, following the incursions of 1980s corporate raiders, the tide may be shifting back to calmer, pro-management seas.<br/>It's undoubtedly true-as the increasingly sophisticated public outreach of companies under attack tends to highlight-that activists are primarily looking to make a buck, not protect the interests of employees or pursue social goals. This feeds criticism that activists are short-termers bent only on that buck. But in our view, they've mostly strengthened rather than weakened the companies they've targeted, and provided a spur to executives that probably should be welcomed not just by shareholders but by anyone who cares about a strong economy. Activists hold stock for longer, on average, than pension funds or mutual funds d years, not days or weeks. And while some evidence suggests that activism is associated with lower spending on research and development-which might harm a company's long-term prospects-other evidence contradicts that finding.<br/>We still think Tejon Ranch is undervalued. But we didn't have the resources to make a sale happen, and in any event, we weren't certain enough to wait for a buyer to emerge.<br/>In the weeks after the presidential election, Tejon Ranch shares soared, increasing as much as 27 percent, perhaps on expectations that as a firm dealing in real estate, it would thrive during Donald Trump's administration. We felt that we had done as much as we could, so we ended our experiment in December, selling our stock for a combined gain of about $55,000. We'd like to take some credit for the increase. After all, the company did improve its disclosures a bit, as we had hoped. But in truth, the gain was mostly plain luck, and as of late March the stock price had fallen back below our initial purchase price.<br/>Whatever happens to the big activist funds, small public companies, such as Tejon Ranch, seem likely to remain mostly unperturbed. Last year, according to FactSet SharkRepellent, a corporate-governance database, fewer than 1 percent of these companies had to fight a battle with a hedge-fund activist over board control. The managers of these companies know that they're safe-to the detriment, we believe, of their shareholders, of the economy, and ultimately even of their own employees.<br/>From our perspective, corporate America is now too well guarded. There are too few, rather than too many, of us activists out there banging at the gate.<br/>Read <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/05/frank-and-stevens-excellent-corporate-raiding-adventure/521436/\">Frank and Steven's Excellent Corporate-Raiding Adventure</url> on theatlantic.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLANT-frankandstevensexcellentcorporateraidingadventure521436</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLANT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NBK-TXV1-JCG7-V18H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">368376</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5735\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

It was Gregory S. Bielli, the president and CEO of the Tejon Ranch Company. We'd met him once before, when we were in a better frame of mind.</p><p><br/><br/>Tejon Ranch is a small public company headquartered in Lebec, about an hour north of Los Angeles, and its main asset is obvious from Interstate 5: real estate. The company owns the largest continuous expanse of private land in California, a 270,000-acre parcel-about half the size of Rhode Island-wedged between two national forests, Los Padres and Sequoia.<br/>Together, the two of us owned more than 18,000 shares of Tejon Ranch, an investment our wives had advised us against. When we'd bought in about a year earlier, the shares had been worth nearly half a million dollars-a significant chunk of our retirement nest eggs. Tejon Ranch had appeared to us to be poorly managed. As professors who write about shareholder activism, we'd thought we'd seen an opportunity to mimic the big activists, such as Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn, who agitate to improve the transparency and performance of much larger companies.<br/>Listen to the audio version of this article:<url normalizedValue=\"https://goo.gl/hU2dqX\">Download the Audm app</url> for your iPhone to listen to more titles.<br/>We had been pressuring Tejon Ranch's executives, using the playbook that top activists have developed over the past decade or so. But the stock had tanked, we had lost more than $70,000, and we thought Bielli had lied to us.<br/>We rolled down our windows to shout to him as we entered the resort's roundabout, but then thought better of it. We were on a scouting trip, in advance of the company's annual shareholder meeting the next morning; we'd come to see the meeting room and plan our attack. (The cheapest rooms at the Balboa Bay Resort were four times as expensive as those at the Newport Mesa Inn, so we were staying four miles inland.) We would have plenty of time to badger Bielli at the meeting, when we would be clean, better dressed, and better prepared.<br/>For as long as public companies have existed, so too has tension between shareholding owners and company managers. In their 1932 book, The Modern Corporation and Private Property, Adolf A. Berle and Gardiner C. Means described the \"separation of ownership and control\" inherent in corporations, and noted that owners and managers have different goals. As a company grows and its shareholders become more dispersed, they wrote, it becomes harder for shareholders to pressure managers, and a gap develops between the owners' interests and the managers' behavior.<br/>Over the decades, the size of this gap has oscillated. At times of minimal pressure from shareholders, power has shifted toward managers, who pay themselves more, enjoy corporate perquisites, build dubious empires, and in some cases relax into mediocrity. But every so often shareholders revolt, not unlike citizens staging a coup when their leaders lose touch.<br/>The 1980s, a decade of corporate raids evoked so memorably in the book Barbarians at the Gate, were one such revolutionary moment. At the start of that decade, most stock was held by scattered, individual investors, and institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies were passive owners. In 1981, there was not a single attempt in the U.S. by any investor to unseat a manager. It was a good time to be a chief executive.<br/>But during the following five years, all of that changed. By 1986, more than 10 percent of corporate takeovers were hostile-the buyers bypassed managers and instead directly offered shareholders a large premium to sell their shares-and banks were making record-setting loans to fund them. (The raiders greatly augmented, or leveraged, their investments with borrowed money, enabling them to target even the biggest corporations.) Carl Icahn targeted and broke up underperforming companies, such as the airline TWA. T. Boone Pickens and others went after bulky conglomerates, questioning what a company like Beatrice might gain from making both orange juice and bras, or why the CEO of Unocal, a sprawling oil company that eventually merged with Chevron, needed a piano on a company jet.<br/>Eventually, companies developed defenses, most notably the \"poison pill,\" which dilutes the stake (and voting rights) of anyone who acquires a substantial amount of stock without first obtaining the board's approval. By the 1990s, power had been returned to management.<br/>But the past decade or so has brought another round of agitation against management, just as significant as the corporate raiding of the 1980s. Activist hedge funds have sought out companies whose managers didn't seem to be acting in the best interest of shareholders, and exposed them. Some of these funds, like the ones led by Ackman and Icahn, have attracted the media spotlight, but most are considerably quieter in their approach and in the news coverage they generate.<br/>Unlike the 1980s corporate raiders, activist hedge funds don't seek to take over companies outright. Instead, they buy minority stakes-typically 5 to 10 percent-in companies that seem to be performing poorly, and then press for actions that would increase the share price: buying back stock, spinning off a key division, firing the CEO, or even selling the company to someone else.<br/>Activists have found allies in mutual funds and pension funds, which are unwilling or unable to play an active role on their own, in part due to the sheer number of holdings in their vast portfolios. Hedge funds also help one another, forming \"wolf packs\" that together can overcome managers' resistance to their demands: After one buys in, others follow. Today, numerous activists, including Ackman, Icahn, and Paul Singer at Elliott Management, each control more than $10 billion of capital-capital that is, in its own way, highly leveraged, not by debt but by the money and voting shares of allies.<br/>Activist hedge funds are controversial; some observers have accused them of pushing companies to take actions that yield quick profits but ultimately destroy value and jobs. Regardless, major companies have bent to their will. Activists pushed for the ouster of Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. They created turmoil at Sotheby's, where they aggressively fought to rework the board. Starboard Value, a prominent activist fund, shook up Darden Restaurants, not only replacing the entire board, but scrutinizing small operational details at Olive Garden. (Starboard's analysts found that Olive Garden could save up to $5 million a year simply by training staff to give each patron one or two bread sticks instead of passing them out like swag. Savings would likewise emerge from cutting down on salad dressing-a win for patrons as well, the analysts surmised; they'd concluded that overdressed greens were leaving customers unhappy.)<br/>By the time we were ready to try our experiment, in 2014, shareholder activism was ubiquitous, at least at large companies. More than 500 activist funds controlled a total of more than $100 billion in assets. According to our research, they were targeting more than 100 public companies a year.<br/>Steven Davidoff Solomon (above) and Frank Partnoy studied and wrote about shareholder activism for years before deciding in 2014 to try it themselves. (Justin Fantl)<br/>On November 2, 2014, over dinner at Juniper and Ivy, a bustling \"left-coast cookery\" in the Little Italy neighborhood of San Diego, we got to discussing our professional plans. We thought we had done just about everything two academics studying shareholder activism could do. We had published well-received research articles. One of us (Frank) had served as an expert witness in disputes brought by companies who challenged activists' tactics under federal law. We had spoken at and hosted conferences on activism and knew many of the big players. In between bites of buttermilk biscuits, we considered possible new projects.<br/>When dessert arrived, Steven was struck with what initially seemed like a crazy idea: \"Let's get out of the ivory tower and try actually being activists. We'll pick a company and target its managers. How hard can it be?\" It wasn't completely crazy. Steven had been a corporate attorney for almost a decade, and Frank (also an attorney) had worked in derivatives at Morgan Stanley; we hadn't always been creatures of the tower, and had skills and experience that seemed germane. We resolved that night to find a small company, invest, and shake things up.<br/>We first learned about Tejon Ranch from a student presentation in one of Steven's classes. The company made money from a hodgepodge of farming and minerals businesses related to its land, as well as from commercial leases. It grew almonds, grapes, and pistachios; collected royalties on oil and gas and on limestone excavated for cement; even traded water rights. Along Interstate 5, a giant Tejon Ranch outlet mall boasted the highest-grossing Starbucks in California. But the company's true value was still unrealized.<br/>The land had been in development for decades, and yet the great majority of it was still undeveloped. What's more, it was unclear exactly when the various residential developments that the company had approved would be finished (or even started). The market capitalization of Tejon Ranch-the value of all its shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange-was about half a billion dollars. By our calculations, the value of the land alone was likely at least twice that. We spotted two crucial problems that we felt we could help address. First, Tejon Ranch needed to improve its disclosures, so investors could understand the value of its land. (For example, the company could disclose the value per square foot that its joint-venture partners had estimated for small parcels that were already being developed.) Second, the company needed a more aggressive timetable for development.<br/>Tejon Ranch seemed like a perfect target. Its stock price had dropped almost 50 percent over 10 years. Its revenue in 2014 was minuscule for a public company: just $52 million. Profits were just $5.7 million. Meanwhile, the managers were feasting: Bielli, the CEO, made $2.7 million in 2014; his CFO and second-in-command, Allen Lyda, made $1.2 million. The company appeared in need of a shake-up.<br/>We began buying shares, building our stake over the course of about a week and a half. On some days, our purchases were more than 10 percent of the company's stock activity on the New York Stock Exchange. By May 13, 2015, we each owned about 9,000 shares-more than Bielli himself owned.<br/>At lunchtime the next day, we sent a short letter to Bielli, asking for a meeting. We didn't say much other than that we were \"significant shareholders\" who were \"excited\" about the business. We assumed the company would ignore us, at least at first.<br/>But the head of investor relations replied that afternoon, saying he, Bielli, and Lyda would be \"more than happy to meet with you.\" We set a date in July. It was that easy.<br/>Frank Partnoy (Justin Fantl)<br/>Shareholders are typically happy when activists target a company they're invested in: When an activist hedge fund announces an ownership stake of more than 5 percent (the threshold that requires public disclosure), the company's stock price tends to go up immediately. (Frank's co-authored research shows that this increase has been, on average, about 7 percent.) Securities analysts give targeted firms higher ratings and, although studies differ, most available evidence shows that targeted companies report higher returns over the next five years.<br/>And yet chief executives are seldom pleased when activists darken their door. It's not hard to see why. In a majority of cases, activists push for some kind of organizational change, especially at the top. Historically, CEO pay has declined by an average of about $1 million in the year after an activist intervention, and CEO turnover post-intervention is higher than that at similar corporations.<br/>There is also the matter of some activists' tactics. One weapon in their arsenal-sometimes deployed almost immediately-is the \"poison pen\" letter, a vitriolic expos\u00e9 not unlike the letters that sometimes featured in Agatha Christie's novels, but focused on business transgressions instead of sexual ones.<br/>Daniel Loeb, a pioneering activist and the founder of the hedge fund Third Point, made billions of dollars by excoriating CEOs and board members with such letters, which he released publicly. In 2003, for instance, he labeled L. Pendleton Siegel, then the CEO and chairman of the lumber-and-real-estate company Potlatch, the \"Chief Value Destroyer\" after the company's shares dropped 60 percent in six years. Loeb also lambasted the company's directors for acting as management's \"lackeys,\" calling two people on the board-both descendants of the timber baron Frederick Weyerhaeuser, a co-founder of Potlatch in 1903-members of the \"Lucky Sperm Club.\" He asked pointed questions about Potlatch's losses, its pension plan, and its business strategy. In another letter, to Irik Sevin, the CEO and president of Star Gas, Loeb wrote: \"Do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites.\" (Sevin resigned less than a month after Loeb first disclosed his fund's investment; Siegel fared better, staying on as the chair of the Potlatch board until he retired in 2006.)<br/>We imagined a gentler approach-we wanted to work constructively with Bielli and the Tejon Ranch management team. We figured it would be difficult to force Tejon Ranch to develop its property more quickly. But several sophisticated investors already sat on the company's board, including Daniel Tisch, the son of Laurence Tisch (the late financier and a co-founder of the Loews Corporation), who had been buying up Tejon Ranch shares for years. Four investment funds held stakes more than 100 times larger than ours. If we could persuade management merely to illuminate the business more fully-perhaps with the support of some of these large investors-we might start a chain reaction.<br/>Activists often target the most-opaque companies. By shining a light on the dark corners of a business, they can uncover problems that demand fixing. In the case of Tejon Ranch, a lack of clarity about land value and development hurdles-regulatory, environmental-created uncertainty about whether management was doing all it could. That uncertainty might have inhibited potential buyers of the company from coming forth. If we could persuade the company to disclose more details, a potential buyer might emerge.<br/>A billionaire activist might have traveled to the Tejon Ranch headquarters by private jet or helicopter. We drove.<br/>We followed the same route that the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoaches took in the mid-19th century. We marveled at the mountains, the valleys, the trees-and the absence of people. There hasn't been much development at Tejon Ranch since it was established in the mid-1800s, with land grants from Mexico. Much of the acreage probably looks about the same now as it did then.<br/>To prepare for our meeting, we pulled into one of the company's few developed plots of land, a rest stop, where the Black Bear Diner was as deserted as the surrounding landscape. Midway through 2015, Tejon Ranch was not having a banner year. Combined revenues from farming and minerals were essentially flat, and the timetable was uncertain for the company's main hope, three new residential communities totaling more than 30,000 homes.<br/>We finalized our pitch while we pulled up to the corporate headquarters, an unimposing ranch-style building. There were maybe a dozen cars in the front parking lot. We pulled on the door handles of the entrance, which are replicas of the Tejon Ranch log a cross above a semicircle, a little like an upside-down ankh.<br/>The lobby was deserted, but the receptionist was expecting us, and Bielli and Lyda quickly appeared, along with the head of investor relations. The three men ushered us into a conference room. There was no general counsel. The only lawyers present were us.<br/>Bielli had well-coiffed hair and a smooth, friendly swagger. We liked him immediately. He had been hired in 2013 to replace the outgoing CEO, after working as a regional president of a residential real-estate developer. At age 55, he was also the company's youngest board member, its \"new blood.\"<br/>We told Bielli we thought that Tejon Ranch shares were massively undervalued, and that the company needed to disclose many more details about its finances and its development timetables. We believed that if potential investors knew that the land would be developed soon, the stock price would skyrocket. Disclosures are a touchy issue for corporate managers: They can make problems public or, if they are false or misleading, they can be the basis for a future class-action lawsuit. But Bielli was gracious and affable, saying that he agreed with every point. He assured us that Tejon Ranch had a disclosure-review process that would be lead to improvements by the end of the year. It would respond to all our concerns. We left after an hour feeling energized and validated. Bielli seemed ready to do everything we'd asked. Lyda, the CFO, followed up a few weeks later with assurances that the company's joint ventures, a specific area we had mentioned where we thought disclosures were poor, were \"definitely an area where we will continue to expand our disclosure.\"<br/>We were frankly at a loss as to what to do next. We had the promise of improved disclosures in six months, but after the meeting, we began to worry that it was a delay tactic. Some shareholder activists might have turned up the heat immediately, publishing an angry letter. But we decided to be patient.<br/>We also worried a bit about what the disclosure might show. Would it really cause the share price to rise, as investors came to understand the company's true value? Activists succeed by demonstrating that the answer to that kind of question is yes. But it was also possible that more disclosure would show that faster development was nearly impossible, due to California's bureaucracy, regulatory requirements, and environmental challenges. In that case, the share price might not change-if anything, the revelation that management could do nothing to develop the land faster might depress it.<br/>Interstate 5 runs alongside Tejon Ranch, which was established by land grants from Mexico in the mid-1800s. Much of the land remains undeveloped today. (Justin Fantl)<br/>The end of the year came and went with no disclosure-review results in the areas we'd discussed, so on January 19, 2016, we sent Bielli an email asking for an update. We also expressed our displeasure with Tejon Ranch's recent performance. The stock price had declined by more than a third since the start of 2015; we had lost more than $100,000 collectively on paper. Bielli received $1.9 million in pay that year.<br/>The response was again swift, but not nearly as friendly. Bielli wrote: \"We wish to clarify that during our meeting in 2015, we advised you that management and the board, including the audit committee, regularly and continually discuss our level of disclosure, and that of our peer group.\" Then he said, \"We did not intend to imply that the board and/or management was engaging in a specific, unique disclosure review process\"-but rather that there was an \"on-going\" process to review disclosure. (Tejon Ranch declined to comment further on our conversations with Bielli and other company executives, or on our arguments in this article, except to say that the company \"does not disclose material non-public information unless such disclosure is to all investors at the same time,\" that it is \"receptive to the views of shareholders,\" that its board and management regularly review its strategy, that it is a unique company, and that it is confident in its prospects. It also declined to participate in the fact-checking of the article.)<br/>Bielli had evidently lawyered up, and we should not have been surprised. As activism has become more common, some companies have responded proactively by doing what many activists would ask for: buying back their own stock, spinning off divisions, and paying out cash to stockholders in the form of dividends. But they are also defending themselves better against the deeper operational changes some activists seek. Many have hired lawyers and consultants to advise them on how to avoid being targeted-and how to resist activists' demands if they are targeted.<br/>Some companies have adopted notice provisions in their bylaws, which force activists to give the board advance warning before they try to replace directors or propose new strategies. These and other measures add cost and red tape to activists' efforts, and give management time to wage a public-relations war against them. Companies have also become more proactive with shareholders generally, blasting them information and conveying the idea that they are transparent and open to dialogue. The main goal of all this defense is to rally the shareholder base to management's side. Painting activists as money-grubbing short-timers who will harm the company's long-term prospects-and who care nothing for the broader social goals the company's management has always cherished-is a favored strategy. We worried that Tejon Ranch might be preparing some of these strategies against us.<br/>We retained an attorney-a prominent securities lawyer who agreed to represent us for free-to try to prove that Bielli had backtracked on his promise of disclosure. But that was a tough assignment, because we had nothing in writing, and we weren't successful.<br/>We again considered sending out a Daniel Loeb-like poison-pen letter, to cast public aspersions on Bielli for misleading us. But that didn't appeal to us, so we swallowed our anger and tried to understand his perspective. Bielli made a lot of money, but he was a new CEO and his job was difficult.<br/>We wanted to keep the pressure on him and the company, but in a responsible way. Shareholders of public companies really have only one chance per year to do that: the annual meeting. That is when the directors are elected or reelected, and threatening to unseat directors is the activist's ultimate weapon. In recent years activists have won some 70 percent of election contests, known as proxy fights, and even when they lose, the board and management frequently yield to the pressure anyway. For example, the activist Nelson Peltz lost his proxy fight against DuPont, but the CEO still eventually resigned.<br/>We couldn't credibly threaten a proxy fight. We didn't have the money to stage one; it would require the hiring of both a publicist and a proxy-solicitation firm to reach out to all the other shareholders, and would cost more than $1 million. But there was one thing we could do at the annual meeting: talk. We would have an opportunity to take the floor and advocate for improved disclosure and a clear timetable. We thought our plan was a good one-and well timed to resonate with other shareholders. The stock price of Tejon Ranch had recently hit its lowest point since the 1990s. Our retirement funds were evaporating.<br/>The meeting at Balboa Bay was scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. on May 11, 2016, with breakfast in the Commodore Room, overlooking some yachts. As we signed in, wearing freshly pressed shirts, Bielli appeared with Lyda, the CFO, and a newly hired general counsel who had been an attorney with the city of Anaheim. Lyda seemed uncomfortable interacting with us, but Bielli slapped us on our shoulders and joked about our row over disclosures. We told him we were looking forward to some new disclosures in his investor-relations presentation later that morning. He laughed and suggested we grab some food.<br/>This was a half-billion-dollar company, one we thought was worth a lot more, but only about 10 shareholders were in attendance. One was wearing a Route 66 T-shirt and cargo shorts and told us he owned 50 shares, now worth about $1,000. He had decided to buy the stock after driving back and forth past the property for many years. Of course, we weren't expecting a scene from Wall Street, where Gordon Gekko speaks to a packed hall of shareholders. The reality is that, with the exception of a few well-known large companies such as Berkshire Hathaway, almost no one attends shareholder meetings. (Some companies are even doing away with in-person meetings, instead having virtual meetings where personal interaction is impossible.) Tejon Ranch's annual meeting was typical. Although the company's stock was languishing, it looked like the only pressure from shareholders would be coming from us.<br/>Even so, this was our chance to interact with the board. We met several of the company's directors, including Daniel Tisch, who still owned a large stake and said he'd be happy to speak with us further at some point. All were men, and their average age was 65. One told us he was serving on the board as a public service. Another said he couldn't believe Tejon Ranch was still a public company, and should find a buyer. When we asked a third director about the idea of selling the company, he said, \"Sure, we'd be open to that, but we haven't received any offers.\" The board was certainly not without expertise, but overall, its members seemed more like a friendly group of retired local real-estate brokers than the independent directors of a New York Stock Exchange-listed company.<br/>The meeting started on time, and the chairman of the board read from a script. Bielli gave his presentation, which summarized the company's proposed land developments but didn't add new detail. When he finished, the chairman asked whether anyone would like to speak. We stood up and poured our hearts out about Tejon Ranch's potential, its falling stock price, its sluggish development, and its inadequate disclosures. We emphasized that we believed the stock price was low because management refused to commit to a clear development timetable. The man in the cargo shorts seemed impressed. We felt we had made our mark, and the meeting ended with tension in the air. A few of the directors walked over to thank us. Tisch gave us his contact information.<br/>We weren't sure how Bielli would react. The largest investors, who sat on the board, told us they wanted Tejon Ranch to be more aggressive. They were open to finding a buyer. But they didn't seem inclined to put genuinely heavy pressure on Bielli or his team. Tejon Ranch was just a sliver of the portfolios of many of its investors. And some saw the company as a very long-term investment: The land would always be there, awaiting its eventual development; slow progress wasn't optimal, but it might have a silver lining nonetheless-pushing the share price down further and presenting a good opportunity to buy more shares. (Tisch, who is 66 years old, later said his grandchildren would see the fruits of his investment.)<br/>We weren't interested in waiting decades, and we asked to meet with Bielli again, in early November. Even after our dispute, he agreed. We planned our final gambit.<br/>On Election Day, we drove back to the Tejon Ranch headquarters. The air was crisp and dry, and the markets were calm. Tejon Ranch's stock was up a bit since the shareholder meeting, but we were still carrying a paper loss of more than $40,000.<br/>Once again, everyone knew we were coming. Bielli and a couple of his colleagues greeted us with smiles and Tejon Ranch-labeled water bottles. We sat around a table ringed with photographs of sites of the company's potential developments. Facing us was a large photo of a shimmering lake at the entrance to one of the three residential communities the company had planned.<br/>The best shareholder activists know the granular details of their target's businesses. After a year and a half as amateur activists, we had learned those details as best we could. We asked about a new joint venture, which had valued some land at $3.50 per square foot. We pressed them about whether this value was accurate and represented a fair estimate of other real estate on the property. If it did, Tejon Ranch should be worth billions. But they dodged this question, and referred us to their most recent investor-relations presentation for any information about valuation estimates. Bielli was prepared. He wasn't going to say too much, as he had during our first meeting.<br/>We dug into some financial minutiae. We even asked about the state of the lake depicted in the photograph on the wall, given its importance to the marketing of that development project and the drought in California; Bielli admitted that \"it's completely dry now, and has been for some time.\" We hoped they would tell the public more about these issues, but had little power to make them do so.<br/>Then we asked the big question: What did Bielli think about selling the company? We had been speaking with a few potential buyers (though our conversations had been only preliminary), and we told him that. We thought he would be angry, or at least surprised. But he responded smoothly. He said that the benefits of being public outweighed the costs. He had been at a private company and had worked under pressure from private-equity investors. Public markets, he said, enabled Tejon Ranch to operate under much less short-term pressure, and to take a longer-term perspective. We were flabbergasted: Many companies go private or stay private to avoid the short-term pressure that public markets can create. But the fact is, for companies the size of Tejon Ranch-and there are thousands of them, filling the portfolios of mutual funds and pension funds, even though most investors have never heard their name-Bielli is probably right. Because so many investors are passive today, most CEOs can relax, even if their performance is mediocre.<br/>We drove away discouraged. The company had enormous potential. But realizing its value seemed impracticable. To be sure, Bielli and his team faced an uphill battle to develop the property and clear regulatory and environmental hurdles. And they disclosed more in 2016 than they did in 2015, perhaps because of us. But the timeline was still vague. This was what the company's annual report said about their three major residential projects: \"Estimated completion time anticipated to be 25 years, or greater, from commencement of construction. To-date construction has not begun.\" That wasn't going to lure a buyer.<br/>As we drove back through the mountains, we tried to imagine what the land would look like in 100 years. Would this area be a flourishing exurb of Los Angeles? A home to new campuses of big tech companies like Google and Apple? Or would it still be deserted, a source of high income for a handful of executives, but of little value to anyone else?<br/>The value of Tejon Ranch hinges partly on the future of three big residential projects. The authors hoped for greater clarity on when these projects would be started and finished. (Justin Fantl)<br/>Whether you love them or hate them, activist hedge funds are the most important phenomenon to emerge in the financial markets during the past 20 years. But this wave of activism recently seems to have peaked, for reasons that-if you squint hard-mirror our own failure.<br/>Even large activists are having difficulties. Easy opportunities, like getting big, cash-rich companies to pay some of that cash out to shareholders, are mostly gone; the remaining opportunities involve the hard work of organizational change. And as companies develop and share their own playbooks for fending off activists, that's becoming harder for outsiders to impose. This was a lesson we learned: Without a quick trick in mind-a proposal that would be relatively painless for management to adopt-you need to dig in and be willing to unseat and replace the CEO and operate the company differently. Many of today's hedge funds are not prepared to face more-difficult operational tasks. And once you start looking at companies below a certain size, it's not worth your while to try.<br/>Some large institutional investors, such as pension funds, have begun pulling their money from activists. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square, which had been one of the most successful activist funds, lost money last year (in large part due to an ill-fated bet on Valeant Pharmaceuticals). As in the 1990s, following the incursions of 1980s corporate raiders, the tide may be shifting back to calmer, pro-management seas.<br/>It's undoubtedly true-as the increasingly sophisticated public outreach of companies under attack tends to highlight-that activists are primarily looking to make a buck, not protect the interests of employees or pursue social goals. This feeds criticism that activists are short-termers bent only on that buck. But in our view, they've mostly strengthened rather than weakened the companies they've targeted, and provided a spur to executives that probably should be welcomed not just by shareholders but by anyone who cares about a strong economy. Activists hold stock for longer, on average, than pension funds or mutual funds d years, not days or weeks. And while some evidence suggests that activism is associated with lower spending on research and development-which might harm a company's long-term prospects-other evidence contradicts that finding.<br/>We still think Tejon Ranch is undervalued. But we didn't have the resources to make a sale happen, and in any event, we weren't certain enough to wait for a buyer to emerge.<br/>In the weeks after the presidential election, Tejon Ranch shares soared, increasing as much as 27 percent, perhaps on expectations that as a firm dealing in real estate, it would thrive during Donald Trump's administration. We felt that we had done as much as we could, so we ended our experiment in December, selling our stock for a combined gain of about $55,000. We'd like to take some credit for the increase. After all, the company did improve its disclosures a bit, as we had hoped. But in truth, the gain was mostly plain luck, and as of late March the stock price had fallen back below our initial purchase price.<br/>Whatever happens to the big activist funds, small public companies, such as Tejon Ranch, seem likely to remain mostly unperturbed. Last year, according to FactSet SharkRepellent, a corporate-governance database, fewer than 1 percent of these companies had to fight a battle with a hedge-fund activist over board control. The managers of these companies know that they're safe-to the detriment, we believe, of their shareholders, of the economy, and ultimately even of their own employees.<br/>From our perspective, corporate America is now too well guarded. There are too few, rather than too many, of us activists out there banging at the gate.<br/>Read       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/05/frank-and-stevens-excellent-corporate-raiding-adventure/521436/\">Frank and Steven's Excellent Corporate-Raiding Adventure</url> on theatlantic.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-frankandstevensexcellentcorporateraidingadventure521436</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NBC-VR41-JCG7-V022-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5828\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

That night, a new moon added almost no light to a poorly lit four-lane road in Tempe, Arizona, as a specially adapted Uber Volvo XC90 detected an object ahead. Part of the modern gold rush to develop self-driving vehicles, the SUV had been driving autonomously, with no input from its human backup driver, for 19 minutes. An array of radar and light-emitting lidar sensors allowed onboard algorithms to calculate that, given their host vehicle's steady speed of 43mph, the object was six seconds away - assuming it remained stationary. But objects in roads seldom remain stationary, so more algorithms crawled a database of recognizable mechanical and biological entities, searching for a fit from which this one's likely behavior could be inferred.</p><p>At first the computer drew a blank; seconds later, it decided it was dealing with another car, expecting it to drive away and require no special action. Only at the last second was a clear identification found - a woman with a bike, shopping bags hanging confusingly from handlebars, doubtless assuming the Volvo would route around her as any ordinary vehicle would. Barred from taking evasive action on its own, the computer abruptly handed control back to its human master, but the master wasn't paying attention. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">Elaine Herzberg</url>, aged 49,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">was struck and killed</url>, leaving more reflective members of the tech community with two uncomfortable questions: was this algorithmic tragedy inevitable? And how used to such incidents would we, should we, be prepared to get?</p><p>\"In some ways we've lost agency. When programs pass into code and code passes into algorithms and then algorithms start to create new algorithms, it gets farther and farther from human agency. Software is released into a code universe which no one can fully understand.\"</p><p>If these words sound shocking, they should, not least because Ellen Ullman, in addition to having been a distinguished professional programmer since the 1970s, is one of the few people to write revealingly about the process of coding. There's not much she doesn't know about software in the wild.</p><p>\"People say, 'Well, what about Facebook - they create and use algorithms and they can change them.' But that's not how it works. They set the algorithms off and they learn and change and run themselves. Facebook intervene in their running periodically, but they really don't control them. And particular programs don't just run on their own, they call on libraries, deep operating systems and so on...\"</p><p>                   What is an algorithm?                   </p><p>Few subjects are more constantly or fervidly discussed right now than <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">algorithms</url>. But what is an algorithm? In fact, the usage has changed in interesting ways since the rise of the internet - and search engines in particular - in the mid-1990s. At root, an algorithm is a small, simple thing; a rule used to automate the treatment of a piece of data. If a happens, then do b ; if not, then do c. This is the \"if/then/else\" logic of classical computing. If a user claims to be 18, allow them into the website; if not, print \"Sorry, you must be 18 to enter\". At core, computer programs are bundles of such algorithms. Recipes for treating data. On the micro level, nothing could be simpler. If computers appear to be performing magic, it's because they are fast, not intelligent.</p><p>Recent years have seen a more portentous and ambiguous meaning emerge, with the word \"algorithm\" taken to mean any large, complex decision-making software system; any means of taking an array of input - of data - and assessing it quickly, according to a given set of criteria (or \"rules\"). This has revolutionized areas of medicine, science, transport, communication, making it easy to understand the utopian view of computing that held sway for many years. Algorithms have made our lives better in myriad ways.</p><p>Only since 2016 has a more nuanced consideration of our new algorithmic reality begun to take shape. If we tend to discuss algorithms in almost biblical terms, as independent entities with lives of their own, it's because we have been encouraged to think of them in this way. Corporations like Facebook and Google have sold and defended their algorithms on the promise of objectivity, an ability to weigh a set of conditions with mathematical detachment and absence of fuzzy emotion. No wonder such algorithmic decision-making has spread to the granting of loans/ bail/benefits/college places/job interviews and almost anything requiring choice.</p><p>We no longer accept the sales pitch for this type of algorithm so meekly. In her 2016 book <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">Weapons of Math Destruction</url>, Cathy O'Neil, a former math prodigy who left Wall Street to teach and write and run the excellent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">mathbabe</url> blog, demonstrated beyond question that, far from eradicating human biases, algorithms could magnify and entrench them. After all, software is written by overwhelmingly affluent white and Asian men - and it will inevitably reflect their assumptions (Google \"racist soap dispenser\" to see how this plays out in even mundane real-world situations). Bias doesn't require malice to become harm, and unlike a human being, we can't easily ask an algorithmic gatekeeper to explain its decision. O'Neil called for \"algorithmic audits\" of any systems directly affecting the public, a sensible idea that the tech industry will fight tooth and nail, because algorithms are what the companies sell; the last thing they will volunteer is transparency.</p><p>The good news is that this battle is under way. The bad news is that it's already looking quaint in relation to what comes next. So much attention has been focused on the distant promises and threats of artificial intelligence, AI, that almost no one has noticed us moving into a new phase of the algorithmic revolution that could be just as fraught and disorienting - with barely a question asked.</p><p>The algorithms flagged by O'Neil and others are opaque but predictable: they do what they've been programmed to do. A skilled coder can in principle examine and challenge their underpinnings. Some of us dream of a citizen army to do this work, similar to the network of amateur astronomers who support professionals in that field. Legislation to enable this seems inevitable.</p><p>We might call these algorithms \"dumb\", in the sense that they're doing their jobs according to parameters defined by humans. The quality of result depends on the thought and skill with which they were programmed. At the other end of the spectrum is the more or less distant dream of human-like artificial general intelligence, or AGI. A properly intelligent machine would be able to question the quality of its own calculations, based on something like our own intuition (which we might think of as a broad accumulation of experience and knowledge). To put this into perspective, Google's DeepMind division has been justly lauded for creating a program capable of mastering arcade games, starting with nothing more than an instruction to aim for the highest possible score. This technique is called \"reinforcement learning\" and works because a computer can play millions of games quickly in order to learn what generates points. Some call this form of ability \"artificial narrow intelligence\", but here the word \"intelligent\" is being used much as Facebook uses \"friend\" - to imply something safer and better understood than it is. Why? Because the machine has no context for what it's doing and can't do anything else. Neither, crucially, can it transfer knowledge from one game to the next (so-called \"transfer learning\"), which makes it less generally intelligent than a toddler, or even a cuttlefish. We might as well call an oil derrick or an aphid \"intelligent\". Computers are already vastly superior to us at certain specialized tasks, but the day they rival our general ability is probably some way off - if it ever happens. Human beings may not be best at much, but we're second-best at an impressive range of things.</p><p>Here's the problem. Between the \"dumb\" fixed algorithms and true AI lies the problematic halfway house we've already entered with scarcely a thought and almost no debate, much less agreement as to aims, ethics, safety, best practice. If the algorithms around us are not yet intelligent, meaning able to independently say \"that calculation/course of action doesn't look right: I'll do it again\", they are nonetheless starting to learn from their environments. And once an algorithm is learning, we no longer know to any degree of certainty what its rules and parameters are. At which point we can't be certain of how it will interact with other algorithms, the physical world, or us. Where the \"dumb\" fixed algorithms - complex, opaque and inured to real time monitoring as they can be - are in principle predictable and interrogable, these ones are not. After a time in the wild, we no longer know what they are: they have the potential to become erratic. We might be tempted to call these \"frankenalgos\" - though Mary Shelley couldn't have made this up.</p><p>                   Clashing codes                   </p><p>These algorithms are not new in themselves. I first encountered them almost five years ago while researching a piece for the Guardian about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">high</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">frequency</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">trading (HFT) on the stock market</url>. What I found was extraordinary: a human-made digital ecosystem, distributed among racks of black boxes crouched like ninjas in billion-dollar data farms - which is what stock markets had become. Where once there had been a physical trading floor, all action had devolved to a central server, in which nimble, predatory algorithms fed off lumbering institutional ones, tempting them to sell lower and buy higher by fooling them as to the state of the market. Human HFT traders (although no human actively traded any more) called these large, slow participants \"whales\", and they mostly belonged to mutual and pension funds - ie the public. For most HFT shops, whales were now the main profit source. In essence, these algorithms were trying to outwit each other; they were doing invisible battle at the speed of light, placing and cancelling the same order 10,000 times per second or slamming so many into the system that the whole market shook - all beyond the oversight or control of humans.</p><p>No one could be surprised that this situation was unstable. A \"flash crash\" had occurred in 2010, during which the market went into freefall for five traumatic minutes, then righted itself over another five - for no apparent reason. I travelled to Chicago to see a man named Eric Hunsader, whose prodigious programming skills allowed him to see market data in far more detail than regulators, and he showed me that by 2014, \"mini flash crashes\" were happening every week. Even he couldn't prove exactly why, but he and his staff had begun to name some of the \"algos\" they saw, much as crop circle hunters named the formations found in English summer fields, dubbing them \"Wild Thing\", \"Zuma\", \"The Click\" or \"Disruptor\".</p><p>Neil Johnson, a physicist specializing in complexity at George Washington University, made a study of stock market volatility. \"It's fascinating,\" he told me. \"I mean, people have talked about the ecology of computer systems for years in a vague sense, in terms of worm viruses and so on. But here's a real working system that we can study. The bigger issue is that we don't know how it's working or what it could give rise to. And the attitude seems to be 'out of sight, out of mind'.\"</p><p>Facebook would claim they know what's going on at the micro level ... But what happens at the level of the population??</p><p>  Neil Johnson    </p><p>Significantly, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">Johnson's paper</url> on the subject was published in the journal Nature and described the stock market in terms of \"an abrupt system-wide transition from a mixed human-machine phase to a new all-machine phase characterized by frequent black swan [ie highly unusual] events with ultrafast durations\". The scenario was complicated, according to the science historian George Dyson, by the fact that some HFT firms were allowing the algos to learn - \"just letting the black box try different things, with small amounts of money, and if it works, reinforce those rules. We know that's been done. Then you actually have rules where nobody knows what the rules are: the algorithms create their own rules - you let them evolve the same way nature evolves organisms.\" Non-finance industry observers began to postulate a catastrophic global \"splash crash\", while the fastest-growing area of the market became (and remains) instruments that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">profit from volatility</url>. In his 2011 novel The Fear Index, Robert Harris imagines the emergence of AGI - of the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">Singularity</url>, no less - from precisely this digital ooze. To my surprise, no scientist I spoke to would categorically rule out such a possibility.</p><p>All of which could be dismissed as high finance arcana, were it not for a simple fact. Wisdom used to hold that technology was adopted first by the porn industry, then by everyone else. But the 21st century's porn is finance, so when I thought I saw signs of HFT-like algorithms causing problems elsewhere, I called Neil Johnson again. </p><p>\"You're right on point,\" he told me: a new form of algorithm is moving into the world, which has \"the capability to rewrite bits of its own code\", at which point it becomes like \"a genetic algorithm\". He thinks he saw evidence of them on fact-finding forays into Facebook (\"I've had my accounts attacked four times,\" he adds). If so, algorithms are jousting there, and adapting, as on the stock market. \"After all, Facebook is just one big algorithm,\" Johnson says. </p><p>\"And I think that's exactly the issue Facebook has. They can have simple algorithms to recognize my face in a photo on someone else's page, take the data from my profile and link us together. That's a very simple concrete algorithm. But the question is what is the effect of billions of such algorithms working together at the macro level? You can't predict the learned behavior at the level of the population from microscopic rules. So Facebook would claim that they know exactly what's going on at the micro level, and they'd probably be right. But what happens at the level of the population? That's the issue.\"</p><p>To underscore this point, Johnson and a team of colleagues from the University of Miami and Notre Dame produced a paper, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">Emergence of Extreme Subpopulations from Common Information and Likely Enhancement from Future Bonding Algorithms</url>, purporting to mathematically prove that attempts to connect people on social media inevitably polarize society as a whole. He thinks Facebook and others should model (or be made to model) the effects of their algorithms in the way climate scientists model climate change or weather patterns.</p><p>O'Neil says she consciously excluded this adaptive form of algorithm from Weapons of Math Destruction. In a convoluted algorithmic environment where nothing is clear, apportioning responsibility to particular segments of code becomes extremely difficult. This makes them easier to ignore or dismiss, because they and their precise effects are harder to identify, she explains, before advising that if I want to see them in the wild, I should ask what a flash crash on Amazon might look like.</p><p>\"I've been looking out for these algorithms, too,\" she says, \"and I'd been thinking: 'Oh, big data hasn't gotten there yet.' But more recently a friend who's a bookseller on Amazon has been telling me how crazy the pricing situation there has become for people like him. Every so often you will see somebody tweet 'Hey, you can buy a luxury yarn on Amazon for $40,000.' And whenever I hear that kind of thing, I think: 'Ah! That must be the equivalent of a flash crash!'\"</p><p>Anecdotal evidence of anomalous events on Amazon is plentiful, in the form of threads from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">bemused sellers</url>, and at least one       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">academic paper</url> from 2016, which claims: \"Examples have emerged of cases where competing pieces of algorithmic pricing software interacted in unexpected ways and produced unpredictable prices, as well as cases where algorithms were intentionally designed to implement price fixing.\" The problem, again, is how to apportion responsibility in a chaotic algorithmic environment where simple cause and effect either doesn't apply or is nearly impossible to trace. As in finance, deniability is baked into the system.</p><p>                   Real-life dangers                   </p><p>Where safety is at stake, this really matters. When a driver ran off the road and was killed in a Toyota Camry after appearing to accelerate wildly for no obvious reason, Nasa experts spent six months examining the millions of lines of code in its operating system, without finding evidence for what the driver's family believed had occurred, but the manufacturer steadfastly denied - that the car had accelerated of its own accord. Only when a pair of embedded software experts spent 20 months digging into the code were they able to prove the family's case, revealing a twisted mass of what programmers call \"spaghetti code\", full of algorithms that jostled and fought, generating anomalous, unpredictable output. The autonomous cars currently being tested may contain 100m lines of code and, given that no programmer can anticipate all possible circumstances on a real-world road, they have to learn and receive constant updates. How do we avoid clashes in such a fluid code milieu, not least when the algorithms may also have to defend themselves from hackers?</p><p>You have all these pieces of code running on people's iPhones, and collectively it acts like one multicellular organism</p><p>  George Dyson    </p><p>Twenty years ago, George Dyson anticipated much of what is happening today in his classic book Darwin Among the Machines. The problem, he tells me, is that we're building systems that are beyond our intellectual means to control. We believe that if a system is deterministic (acting according to fixed rules, this being the definition of an algorithm) it is predictable - and that what is predictable can be controlled. Both assumptions turn out to be wrong.</p><p>\"It's proceeding on its own, in little bits and pieces,\" he says. \"What I was obsessed with 20 years ago that has completely taken over the world today are multicellular, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">metazoan</url> digital organisms, the same way we see in biology, where you have all these pieces of code running on people's iPhones, and collectively it acts like one multicellular organism.</p><p>\"There's this old law called Ashby's law that says a control system has to be as complex as the system it's controlling, and we're running into that at full speed now, with this huge push to build self-driving cars where the software has to have a complete model of everything, and almost by definition we're not going to understand it. Because any model that we understand is gonna do the thing like run into a fire truck 'cause we forgot to put in the fire truck.\"</p><p>Unlike our old electro-mechanical systems, these new algorithms are also impossible to test exhaustively. Unless and until we have super-intelligent machines to do this for us, we're going to be walking a tightrope.</p><p>Dyson questions whether we will ever have self-driving cars roaming freely through city streets, while Toby Walsh, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of New South Wales who wrote his first program at age 13 and ran a tyro computing business by his late teens, explains from a technical perspective why this is.</p><p>\"No one knows how to write a piece of code to recognize a stop sign. We spent years trying to do that kind of thing in AI - and failed! It was rather stalled by our stupidity, because we weren't smart enough to learn how to break the problem down. You discover when you program that you have to learn how to break the problem down into simple enough parts that each can correspond to a computer instruction [to the machine]. We just don't know how to do that for a very complex problem like identifying a stop sign or translating a sentence from English to Russian - it's beyond our capability. All we know is how to write a more general purpose algorithm that can learn how to do that given enough examples.\"</p><p>Hence the current emphasis on machine learning. We now know that Herzberg, the pedestrian killed by an automated <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">Uber car in Arizona</url>, died because the algorithms wavered in correctly categorizing her. Was this a result of poor programming, insufficient algorithmic training or a hubristic refusal to appreciate the limits of our technology? The real problem is that we may never know.</p><p>\"And we will eventually give up writing algorithms altogether,\" Walsh continues, \"because the machines will be able to do it far better than we ever could. Software engineering is in that sense perhaps a dying profession. It's going to be taken over by machines that will be far better at doing it than we are.\"</p><p>Walsh believes this makes it more, not less, important that the public learn about programming, because the more alienated we become from it, the more it seems like magic beyond our ability to affect. When shown the definition of \"algorithm\" given earlier in this piece, he found it incomplete, commenting: \"I would suggest the problem is that algorithm now means any large, complex decision making software system and the larger environment in which it is embedded, which makes them even more unpredictable.\" A chilling thought indeed. Accordingly, he believes ethics to be the new frontier in tech, foreseeing \"a golden age for philosophy\" - a view with which Eugene Spafford of Purdue University, a cybersecurity expert, concurs.</p><p>\"Where there are choices to be made, that's where ethics comes in. And we tend to want to have an agency that we can interrogate or blame, which is very difficult to do with an algorithm. This is one of the criticisms of these systems so far, in that it's not possible to go back and analyze exactly why some decisions are made, because the internal number of choices is so large that how we got to that point may not be something we can ever recreateto prove culpability beyond doubt.\"</p><p>The counter-argument is that, once a program has slipped up, the entire population of programs can be rewritten or updated so it doesn't happen again - unlike humans, whose propensity to repeat mistakes will doubtless fascinate intelligent machines of the future. Nonetheless, while automation should be safer in the long run, our existing system of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">tort law</url>, which requires proof of intention or negligence, will need to be rethought. A dog is not held legally responsible for biting you; its owner might be, but only if the dog's action is thought foreseeable. In an algorithmic environment, many unexpected outcomes may not have been foreseeable to humans - a feature with the potential to become a scoundrel's charter, in which deliberate obfuscation becomes at once easier and more rewarding. Pharmaceutical companies have benefited from the cover of complexity for years (see the case of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">Thalidomide</url> ), but here the consequences could be both greater and harder to reverse.</p><p>                   The military stakes                   </p><p>Commerce, social media, finance and transport may come to look like small beer in future, however. If the military no longer drives innovation as it once did, it remains tech's most consequential adopter. No surprise, then, that an outpouring of concern among scientists and tech workers has accompanied revelations that autonomous weapons are ghosting toward the battlefield in what amounts to an algorithmic arms race. A robotic sharpshooter currently polices the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, and while its manufacturer, Samsung, denies it to be capable of autonomy, this claim is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">widely disbelieved</url>.

At time of writing, competitors including Amazon and Microsoft have resisted following suit.</p><p>In common with other tech firms, Google had claimed moral virtue for its Maven software: that it would help choose targets more efficiently and thereby save lives. The question is how tech managers can presume to know what their algorithms will do or be directed to do in situ - especially given the certainty that all sides will develop adaptive algorithmic counter-systems designed to confuse enemy weapons. As in the stock market, unpredictability is likely to be seen as an asset rather than handicap, giving weapons a better chance of resisting attempts to subvert them. In this and other ways we risk in effect turning our machines inside out, wrapping our everyday corporeal world in spaghetti code.</p><p>Lucy Suchman of Lancaster University in the UK co-authored an open letter from technology researchers to Google, asking them to reflect on the rush to militarize their work. Tech firms' motivations are easy to fathom, she says: military contracts have always been lucrative. For the Pentagon's part, a vast network of sensors and surveillance systems has run ahead of any ability to use the screeds of data so acquired.</p><p>\"They are overwhelmed by data, because they have new means to collect and store it, but they can't process it. So it's basically useless - unless something magical happens. And I think their recruitment of big data companies is a form of magical thinking in the sense of: 'Here is some magic technology that will make sense of all this.'\"</p><p>Suchman also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/ubers-self-driving-car-saw-the-pedestrian-but-didnt-swerve-report\">offers statistics</url> that shed chilling light on Maven. According to analysis carried out on drone attacks in Pakistan from 2003-13, fewer than 2% of people killed in this way are confirmable as \"high value\" targets presenting a clear threat to the United States. In the region of 20% are held to be non-combatants, leaving more than 75% unknown. Even if these figures were out by a factor of two - or three, or four - they would give any reasonable person pause.</p><p>\"So here we have this very crude technology of identification and what Project Maven proposes to do is automate that. At which point it becomes even less accountable and open to questioning. It's a really bad idea.\"</p><p>Suchman's colleague Lilly Irani, at the University of California, San Diego, reminds us that information travels around an algorithmic system at the speed of light, free of human oversight. Technical discussions are often used as a smokescreen to avoid responsibility, she suggests.</p><p>\"When we talk about algorithms, sometimes what we're talking about is bureaucracy. The choices algorithm designers and policy experts make are presented as objective, where in the past someone would have had to take responsibility for them. Tech companies say they're only improving accuracy with Maven - ie the right people will be killed rather than the wrong ones - and in saying that, the political assumption that those people on the other side of the world are more killable, and that the US military gets to define what suspicion looks like, go unchallenged. So technology questions are being used to close off some things that are actually political questions. The choice to use algorithms to automate certain kinds of decisions is political too.\"</p><p>The legal conventions of modern warfare, imperfect as they might be, assume human accountability for decisions taken. At the very least, algorithmic warfare muddies the water in ways we may grow to regret. A group of government experts is debating the issue at the UN convention on certain conventional weapons (CCW) meeting in Geneva this week.</p><p>                   Searching for a solution                   </p><p>Solutions exist or can be found for most of the problems described here, but not without incentivizing big tech to place the health of society on a par with their bottom lines. More serious in the long term is growing conjecture that current programming methods are no longer fit for purpose given the size, complexity and interdependency of the algorithmic systems we increasingly rely on. One solution, employed by the Federal Aviation Authority in relation to commercial aviation, is to log and assess the content of all programs and subsequent updates to such a level of detail that algorithmic interactions are well understood in advance - but this is impractical on a large scale. Portions of the aerospace industry employ a relatively new approach called model-based programming, in which machines do most of the coding work and are able to test as they go.</p><p>Model-based programming may not be the panacea some hope for, however. Not only does it push humans yet further from the process, but Johnson, the physicist, conducted a study for the Department of Defense that found \"extreme behaviors that couldn't be deduced from the code itself\" even in large, complex systems built using this technique. Much energy is being directed at finding ways to trace unexpected algorithmic behavior back to the specific lines of code that caused it. No one knows if a solution (or solutions) will be found, but none are likely to work where aggressive algos are designed to clash and/or adapt.</p><p>As we wait for a technological answer to the problem of soaring algorithmic entanglement, there are precautions we can take. Paul Wilmott, a British expert in quantitative analysis and vocal critic of high frequency trading on the stock market, wryly suggests \"learning to shoot, make jam and knit\". More practically, Spafford, the software security expert, advises making tech companies responsible for the actions of their products, whether specific lines of rogue code - or proof of negligence in relation to them - can be identified or not. He notes that the venerable Association for Computing Machinery has updated its code of ethics along the lines of medicine's Hippocratic oath, to instruct computing professionals to do no harm and consider the wider impacts of their work. Johnson, for his part, considers our algorithmic discomfort to be at least partly conceptual; growing pains in a new realm of human experience. He laughs in noting that when he and I last spoke about this stuff a few short years ago, my questions were niche concerns, restricted to a few people who pored over the stock market in unseemly detail.</p><p>\"And now, here we are - it's even affecting elections. I mean, what the heck is going on? I think the deep scientific thing is that software engineers are trained to write programs to do things that optimize - and with good reason, because you're often optimizing in relation to things like the weight distribution in a plane, or a most fuel-efficient speed: in the usual, anticipated circumstances optimizing makes sense. But in unusual circumstances it doesn't, and we need to ask: 'What's the worst thing that could happen in this algorithm once it starts interacting with others?' The problem is we don't even have a word for this concept, much less a science to study it.\"</p><p>He pauses for moment, trying to wrap his brain around the problem.</p><p>\"The thing is, optimizing is all about either maximizing or minimizing something, which in computer terms are the same. So what is the opposite of an optimization, ie the least optimal case, and how do we identify and measure it? The question we need to ask, which we never do, is: 'What's the most extreme possible behavior in a system I thought I was optimizing?'\"</p><p>Another brief silence ends with a hint of surprise in his voice.</p><p>\"Basically, we need a new science,\" he says.</p><p>                     Andrew Smith's Totally Wired: The Rise and Fall of Joshua Harris and the Great Dotcom Swindle will be published by Grove Atlantic next February                   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-46839735</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T50-9GM1-F021-602X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5338\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Most eaters (I include myself) will salivate at bacon, despite what we know of the waste, squalor and suffering caused by mainstream meat production. Yet when we hear about a new type of ''ethical'' meat with a much lower carbon footprint, cultured from cells without killing a single animal, our initial response is usually something like: ''Ew! -- I wouldn't eat that.'' </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  We should try to get beyond our disgust about ''lab meat,'' argues the journalist Chase Purdy, who is in the rare position of having actually tasted it. In a fast-paced global narrative, Purdy follows the various cell-cultured meat companies that are currently competing to get their product to market first. The front-runners are in Israel, the Netherlands and (no surprise) Silicon Valley. The results of what Purdy calls this ''edible space race'' may shape the future of meat eating around the world.</p><p>Meat that is grown in a vat doesn't taste as bad as you might expect, according to Purdy.</p><p>  It's not as if conventional ground beef from feedlot cows tastes that great either when you really pay attention. In San Francisco, at the offices of the food company JUST, a lab tech serves Purdy a taco stuffed with duck chorizo grown from cells. The meat, he reports, is ''moist and richly flavored.'' The early prototypes of cell-cultured meat -- grown from muscle stem cells -- suffered from being too lean, but now the companies have figured out ways to grow fat tissue as well as muscle tissue, which means that the mouthfeel is getting closer to the meat we know (though it's still easier to make a texturally plausible meatball than a convincing steak).</p><p>  This is Purdy's first book, and he sometimes falls into journalistic clich\u00e9s. His story teems with the occasional ''make-or-break'' moment or a light bulb going off in someone's head. But the upside is that his writing is always punchy and readable, even when he is explaining the complex and gruesome biology of growing a new piece of flesh from an old one. Sometimes there is a kind of Frankenstein fascination, such as in his description of how scientists at JUST have figured out a way to manipulate cells collected from the pointy tip of a chicken's feather to become not just more feathers but also muscle and fat. Purdy explains that ''scientists can take a cell that would normally live its life as a feather producer, tell it to stop working on feathers, and then revert it back into an earlier-stage cell.'' In this way, cells from a single feather could give rise to multiple batches of chicken nuggets.</p><p>  [ Read an excerpt from ''Billion Dollar Burger.'' ]</p><p>  The snag is that these cell-grown nuggets would cost $50 apiece. Up until now, the biggest obstacle to getting cultured meat on the market has been the sheer expense -- hence the ''billion dollar burger'' of Purdy's hyperbolic title. When the first lab-grown burger was unveiled in 2013 by a panel including the Dutch food scientist Mark Post, it was estimated to have cost $330,000 for a single five-ounce patty: equivalent to $1.2 million per pound of beef. But that cost is falling, and fast. In 2019 an Israeli firm called Future Meat Technologies claimed that by 2022, it would be able to get cell-cultured meat on the market for as little as $10 a pound.</p><p>  Even if it were cheap enough, would we want to add cultured meat to our grocery lists? Purdy says that the biggest barrier to getting these products to market in the United States is ''a difficult regulatory landscape'' influenced by meat lobbyists with a strong vested interest in keeping cell-cultured meat off the shelves.</p><p>  We can't blame the meat industry for all of our wariness around cell-cultured meat, however. Purdy concedes that many questions about this new technology remain unanswered. In the Netherlands, Post tells him that one of the many differences between traditional meat and cell-cultured meat is that the cell culture lacks an immune system. This sounds like it might just be important.</p><p>  It's too soon to say whether our ''Ew'' response to cultured meat is warranted or not. Many of the much-promoted novel foods of the past -- margarine, I'm looking at you -- turned out over time to be less healthy than was first thought. In a lovely passage, Purdy has a conversation in the kitchen with his aunt and grandmother about whether they would like to eat these new meats. ''I'd have to get past the whole thought of it all,'' his aunt replies. She's not the only one.Bee Wilson is the author, most recently, of ''The Way We Eat Now.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: At the laboratories of Redefine Meat.

In exchange for the efficiency and convenience provided by the \"Big 4\" firms \u2014 Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 he argues that we are pressed into conformity. By constantly interacting with these companies' products, we have allowed them to intrude upon our inner lives, destroy contemplation and manipulate our behaviors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Forward's Sam Bromer met with Foer and they spoke about how spirituality and Jewish concepts influenced \"World Without Mind,\" Foer's admiration for Justice Louis Brandeis, and the steps that can be taken to combat tech's intrusion on our collective psyches.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Sam Bromer: Your father, Bert Foer, worked in antitrust law for many years. How did he influence \"World Without Mind,\" if at all? Because clearly there's a huge antitrust element to what you're writing about.</p><p> Franklin Foer: My dad went to law school. He trained to be an antitrust lawyer. And then my grandfather, as he was dying, asked my dad to come work in the family business, which was jewelry. So he had this kind of decade-long diversion into being a small businessman. But antitrust was kind of his burning passion, as much as antitrust can be anyone's burning passion. So, I'm sure I absolutely absorbed from him the basics of what constitutes predatory pricing and anti-competitive behavior. And like every good Jewish boy, I wanted to please my dad. So I'm sure that all that was in the back of my mind.</p><p> To what extent did your upbringing in a Jewish household affect either your views on the preciousness of literary criticism or your fear of monopolistic corporations as authoritarian?</p><p> I think that some of my skepticism and hostility to the big tech companies grows from a Jewish sense of time, and just the idea of there being a Sabbath, which is a break in the architecture of the week, where there's a moment where you're disconnected. And this idea that there were these sources that are trying to hijack our attention and overrun our lives, leaving no space for contemplation. I think that idea is in some ways at the core of my hostility to Facebook and Google and Apple and Amazon.</p><p> So spirituality and contemplation are sort of hand in hand in how you view the world?</p><p> Absolutely. To put the Jewish spin on it, I would say that a lot of my thinking about this rose out of my readings of Brandeis, who is the ultimate Jewish secular saint. Brandeis made a fetish of contemplation. He invented a concept of privacy and also was the great critic of monopoly.</p><p> But I think it's impossible to think metaphysically, impossible to think about the things that go beyond the world of appearance, if your attention is constantly being directed and if you're constantly being distracted. So I think that contemplation is the necessary ingredient that makes a spiritual life possible.</p><p> Brandeis had a theory of intellectual privacy, and spoke of the need for protection from surveillance and interference while generating ideas and private opinions. What do you think regulators or Supreme Court members or government officials can learn from his ideas?</p><p> Well, privacy is something that everybody claims to want, but nobody articulates why. Privacy is beyond just having somebody get a peek through your window. The threat isn't just that your space is being crowded and violated. What Brandeis was worried about was that idea that the fear of somebody looking over your shoulder as you think would start to affect your thought \u2014 that as soon as we know we have an audience, we start to bend our opinions to try to please our audience.</p><p> And so he was really worried most intensely about the disappearance of independence. And when you put it that way, what he's arguing is that as the creep of privacy descends upon us, we become less able to be citizens because we're less able to formulate opinions that are entirely our own.</p><p> Are you skeptical of collectivist solutions to the problems posed by these tech companies? Take, for example, unionization at media companies that are affected by technological change, like Vox or the Los Angeles Times.</p><p> I'm definitely pro-union. I think that the preservation of good journalism in some ways depends on unionization. If you look around newsrooms, it's hard to find anybody who has any gray hairs. I've always wondered what happens to all these people. And part of what happens to all people is that they get pushed out because there's not a pay structure that works for people who have families or who age in their profession.</p><p> What happens in journalism is that there is a race to the bottom, where a lot of these outlets hire young people because the product that they produce oftentimes requires less skill and less experience and less expertise. Aggregation is the simplest and cheapest type of journalism. And so I think as unions fight to exist and then as they fight to make it more possible to have an extended career in journalism, what they're actually fighting for, at the end of the day, is a certain idea of quality.</p><p> Do you think that no matter what these companies like Facebook do, as gatekeepers they are going to have an effect on our political system? And what are the consequences of that?</p><p>Facebook is in the process right now of reckoning with its size and power. And we would have never had an internal reckoning over that had they not been accused of messing with the results of the 2016 election or if there hadn't been this scandal about Russian interference.</p><p> I think that Facebook is just really uncomfortable \"owning\" its power. To be the most powerful media outlet in the world means that what you publish has tremendous impact and therefore should be held to pretty high standards. But Facebook is not built to hold its content up to high standards.</p><p> And so to accept the power that they actually have, and the responsibility to the power that they actually have, means that they would have to become a different sort of company that is a less profitable company. So they're in a real conundrum.</p><p> You write in the book about Facebook's infamous lab rat-like experimentation on its users, and then also Google's involvement in the 2012 election. Do you think that these kinds of activities should be regulated? Should these companies be bound to a code of conduct, or require more informed consent from their users?</p><p> I think we need to find some response to the problem of addiction, and I think it should be viewed as a public health problem. I'm not exactly sure whether that means posting a Surgeon General's warning on iPhone and Facebook pages, but I do think that needs to be addressed.</p><p> Secondly, there's the problem of privacy, and we have this gobsmacking fact that there is no comprehensive legislative regime that protects people's privacy, which stands in stark contrast to the direction [in which] the Europeans are quickly moving. And so I think that's the most urgent thing. And then, you're right, they need to be held to some sort of code of conduct. And when academics conduct research on subjects, they are duty bound to a code of ethics that wires them to disclose certain manipulations or to give the subjects a sense of their involvement in experimentation, and I think it would be nice if there [could be] something akin to that for the tech companies.</p><p> Perhaps the tech companies could draw from academia, where the same sort of process requires more protections for the people involved.</p><p> At the same time, the amount of manipulation that happens at Facebook on a daily basis is endemic. Everything is being constantly tested. And that's true at most media companies as well, where headlines are constantly being tested. And I don't think we want to eliminate that; I don't think we want the government trying to eliminate that. But when it comes to experiments that are designed to deliberately manipulate emotions or electoral results. I don't want to be a prude, but manipulation of elections is a bridge too far.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNY-7933274849e08380a17b9af72e028aa1a8bf838</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898C0256751F2 NWBKNY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S35-CFT1-DXVP-V2V6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399552</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1352\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Forward<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

They quickly got to work spending Hughes's money: building up an impressive staff, 'leasing offices in prime locations and hiring top-shelf consultants,' and 'handsomely paying writers to travel the globe,' Foer confesses in his new book, World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech Companies[3]. In the end, however, the magazine 'couldn't resist the historical force remaking our profession,' Foer writes. Under Hughes, Foer argues, the publication embraced a reliance on data and algorithms that killed the core values of the magazine. Foer and others were driven out[4] and the publication became a 'vertically integrated digital media company,' in the words of its then-new CEO Guy Vidra[5]. In his book, Foer, now a national correspondent for The Atlantic, ruminates on the power he sees large tech companies holding over media outlets \u2014 a power he believes is detrimental to journalistic neutrality, the pursuit of truth, and intellectual rigor. </p><p>I spoke to Foer about the dependence of media organizations on large tech platforms, his views on subscription-based models, and how he thinks journalism institutions should think about data and algorithms. Here's our conversation, lightly condensed and edited for clarity. Hope Reese: You write about your experience as editor at The New Republic under Chris Hughes' ownership \u2014 how you both started out as idealists, but that the relationship 'ended badly,' under pressure to build an online audience and earn ad revenue. Was there a moment when you sensed that things were heading the wrong way, from an editorial standpoint? Was there a way you could have taken the publication in a new direction? Franklin Foer: Ambition can be a blinding thing. If we had restrained ourselves as we went along, we could've actually come out ahead and made it work. Ambition sounds like a great thing in journalism, but it's also incredibly expensive. We built a pretty large staff, and so I think that given our natural size and given the size of the audience and our mission, we would've been better served being hugely disciplined in our spending. That's one we could've managed profoundly differently, leading to a different outcome.I actually think we were on a decent course before Chris panicked. If we'd given our business plan a little bit more time, we could've probably found a way to limit our losses to something that was reasonable in the short-term. That could've gotten us closer to profitability over the long term.Reese: I'm sure The Atlantic faces some of the same constraints \u2014 the need for revenue, the need for page views \u2014 that you felt at The New Republic. The Atlantic obviously has a much larger readership; according to Pew[6], The Atlantic had 5.1 million unique visitors per month in 2014, while The New Republic had in the 1 million range. But how are the two different, in terms of the approach? Foer: Well, I'm not in a managerial position at The Atlantic, so I don't have any special insight into the way that the business is being run. But it seems that David Bradley had such a patient approach to making The Atlantic work as a business. It took a lot of trial and error, but he was eventually able to make it work. It seems to me that they figured out how to grow a couple different businesses simultaneously. They figured out how to sell digital advertising, which is so damn tricky. These are just things that take time to build up. They're specialized and their markets take a whole lot of time to understand. It takes time for the market to appreciate the virtues of a brand. That's just patience. Unfortunately, Chris' ethos, and the ethos of many, many other people who would've been put in his position, was not a patient one.Reese: How reliant are these media companies on platforms? Is there any way you could envision a media company that could break out of that constraint?  Foer: There's a certainly a collective-action problem, where no media company wants to be the first one to bust free from the platforms, but the dependence on the platform is hugely problematic. It's problematic from a business standpoint because the platforms are so capricious \u2014 Facebook changes what it wants all the time. Google changes what it wants all the time. Media slavishly trails after it, making all these editorial adjustments that require resources shifting around. There's no way that media outlets can be nimble enough to keep up.Dependence on the platform is not just hard on the business. I think it's terrible for the soul, because the values of these platform companies end up shaping the values of all the media outlets that depend on them. Media ends up embracing the ethos of Facebook and Google. Facebook and Google end up worming their way into the very fiber of the organizations that rely on them for traffic \u2014 and therefore revenue. The future of journalism \u2014 not just as a business, but as an enterprise \u2014 demands that we find some way to break free from the platforms. Newspaper publishers are doing interesting things in this regard in that they've decided to take on the platforms as an antitrust issue. They're trying to find a policy solution for the problem. You know, bravo. You know, kudos to them for making that effort \u2014 because that's probably ultimately what it's going to take. But I also think that we need to create cultural conditions in the public that make a subscription model more appealing. That that's not something that can happen straight away because the public has become so acclimated to getting everything for nothing. Even when the Times imposes paywalls, they're still not really asking very much of consumers relative to the resources that are required from consumers to fund journalism on that scale. Everything is out of whack right now.Reese: In your book, you write that there's this assumption that subscribers are getting older and are going to die off. How do you envision a new way of thinking about subscription-based models? Foer: I'm a cultural critic, not an MBA, so I don't really know. But I have instincts about this. My instinct is that it's possible to create and cultivate a whole new set of values that lead people in a different direction.Edward Bernays[7], who was the godfather of public relations and the nephew of Sigmund Freud, wrote about public relations in the 1920s. He was hired by the book industry after the stock market crash. They needed to find some sort of way to juice the market. He came up with an elegantly brilliant solution, which was that he promoted bookshelves[8], which had not been a fixture in middle-class homes until them. He worked with architectural magazines and women's magazines and home magazines to try to make bookshelves a sign of middle-class life. It seemed to have worked. I think that something similar could happen with media now, which is that you need to find ways to make media seem like it's representative of higher standard living. That it's virtuous. That it's a prerequisite for being a member of American life and good standing. I think it's doable. It's not easy.Reese: Should we see media as 'virtuous'? You write about the culture industries presenting themselves as the 'organic alternative.' But should everyone have access to news and information, or is this just something extra for the privileged to consume? Foer: Everybody should have access to media. The house of our democracy depends on it. I also think everybody should pay for media, just as everybody pays for food. Everybody needs food to survive, yet we don't give away food for free. We create an economy that subsidizes it. I actually think it's such an important good that we should consider ways for government to subsidize media as it does in Europe and as we've done here in this country since the beginning of the republic when we started giving cut-rate prices to newspapers, to the postage of newspapers and magazines.While I think everybody needs good information, I also think that we need to respect the fact that there's always going to be a high-end version of news. That's gonna cost a hell of a lot of money for consumers to get, and that's fine. That's just the way that this ecosystem works. You need healthy elites in order to have a healthy public at large.Reese: One of the core issues you have is with the way data is being use to manipulate readers and audiences \u2014 to feed them what they are looking for. What about the argument that maybe news organizations should ask for more or different types of data?  Foer: Data exists in the fact that we have all this information. What I resent is the way in which data becomes a substitute for judgment. That data begins to lead conversations rather than the other way around. I think that we're awash in data. I hate walking into newsrooms that have massive screens hovering over telling people how things are performing on social media or the traffic that's flowing to any piece at any given moment. That becomes oppressive. It becomes the enemy of creativity. It becomes the enemy of human judgment, because we begin to defer to that.I don't want to be overly binary and say that we should ignore it all together because, look, we've always had data in media. We've always known how many copies of the newspaper sold. We've always looked at newsstand sales of magazines or ratings for TV news. That's driven decisions since time immemorial, and we want an audience for what we produce. I don't think that we can banish data all together, but I think we can fetishize it a whole lot less.Reese: Do you think there will be a point where journalists and organizations get tired of relying on data? Or is this only moving in one direction? Foer: I'm pretty optimistic that there'll be pushback, because we're in the midst of an era that's fairly extreme, where we have access to so much information.Why do I believe that a backlash is possible? First, it's because I think that it's inevitable that journalism gets angry at its dependence on Facebook. It looks for ways to liberate itself from Facebook because the financial viability, the profession, ultimately depends on it. Once journalism liberates itself from Facebook, I think that will alleviate some of the obsession with data. Second, I think that the ethos of journalism is probably not as strong as we thought it was, but there's still something within journalists that's gonna ultimately chase against the trends. There's bound to be a point at which journalism just says, 'Enough. We can't stomach this.' Or at least things start to moderate in some sort of way.Reese: Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. What would happen, say, if Mark Zuckerberg bought The New York Times? Are big news organizations susceptible to being taken over by large tech companies or tech executives? Foer: Sure. I mean, this is what happens around the world and through American history. You have oligarchs, you have rich people who try to buy media in order to both control information and also to launder their reputations because newspapers are seen as a sign of civic commitment. It would be totally un-shocking if Zuckerberg were to, at some point, try to buy The New York Times.I think it's a problem. They already control so much access to information and I just don't think our democracy can sustain having such extreme concentrations of informational power.Reese: Your book seems to hold journalists and journalism to a high standards \u2014 in the pursuit of truth, the investigation of power, and other noble values. What about the argument that, say, the people working in the tech companies have their own core values? That they want to make information free and connect people, and all those things? Do you see very different core values in media organizations versus the tech industry? Foer: Yeah, I do. Journalism has a commitment about holding people to truth, and that's not the core commitment of the tech companies. There's much more of, I think, a sense of almost relativism that you get with the tech companies. You saw this in Zuckerberg's response[9] to the fake news crisis during the last presidential election. He just struggled to understand what was so wrong about it or what Facebook had done wrong in the midst of it.It's because the whole notion of Facebook or Amazon or Google is to be responsive to the market, to give consumers exactly what they desire. If consumers desire fake news and propaganda, then that's what they get.Reese: What about Facebook's recent announcement[10] about not allowing pages that had fake news to put up ads? Do you think things could move in a different direction? Foer: I think that was political pressure that Zuckerberg was facing that caused him to at least make some gestural attempt to solve the problem of fake news. The problem is that Facebook can't regulate fake news. If Facebook were to take an extremely strong stance against fake news, what would that look like? If Donald Trump posted an announcementsay, if Donald Trump were banging on about Barack Obama's birth certificate, which I think counts as fake news, would a platform be able to strip Donald Trump of a microphone?The problem is that if Facebook were to acknowledge its ability to gate keep in that sort of way, it would piss a lot of people off, and it would actually highlight the extent of their power. The more that Facebook inserts itself into the middle of controversy, the more it stirs up enemies, the greater the likelihood of there being a movement to regulate Facebook. I think Facebook is, to an extent, stuck.Reese: I want to bring the conversation back to data and algorithms. You write that 'algorithms are meant to erode free will.' Do you think that data and algorithms have any kind of inherent good or evil? Foer: I'm not anti-algorithms. Algorithms are neutral. They're procedures, they're systems. We benefit from them all the time. I mean, I happen to like Spotify's algorithms. I dig algorithms that lead me to the sneakers that I never knew I wanted to buy. I don't think that they're necessarily oppressive.The problem is that algorithms play this role in sorting information for us, guiding us to things. Algorithms are essentially picking winners and losers in markets, in news, in culture \u2014 and, in effect, in democracy. Because they're so invisible, we don't really apply skepticism to them. There's no real countervailing force working against them, which means algorithms become a source of enormous power for these corporations. That's just something we have to worry about.Reese: Clearly media companies have some dependency on platforms. But do any of these platforms or tech companies also depend on the content produced by media organizations, the journalism? What's the relationship there? Foer: Yes, of course. They sort the world, so they need access to news. They need access to entertainment. What they've done is they've diminished the relevance of media brands. When you're clicking through Facebook or Google, you're only dimly aware of where you're clicking. I mean, you click based on headlines I think probably much more than on the name of the purveyor of information. It just becomes this giant stew where media brands have become devalued and bylines are devalued. That's the way these companies like it. Reese: What advice would you give a publication that's starting from scratch? How could it become successful in the current landscape? Foer: We live in this world where the distinctions between media outlets have become blurred. The distinctions between bylines have become blurred. That really saddens me, and I feel like it's reflected in the way in which so much of the internet feels homogenous. In order to maintain the value of your product, you have to be fierce in protecting the identity of your organization and in the identity of your writers.Sadly, I feel like we've stumbled into this world where those things have been devalued. Starting over again, yes, I would love it if we had subscriptions, but subscriptions only matter if organizations have a strong sense of who they are. One of the tolls of the platforms has been to sap us of that sort of identity.Photo of Foer discussing his book last month by the Berkeley Center for New Media[11] used under a Creative Commons license.

The more dependent we become on Google, Twitter and Facebook for information, the less certain we can be that we are looking at the real world and not the manufactured Matrix deemed suitable for adult consumption by Silicon Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What price are you willing to pay for the convenience of unlimited access to limited truth?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These questions arise this week, as they have almost every week for the past decade, as the evidence mounts that search engines and social media are not just a conduit of reality, but a filter of it. There is the whole truth, and then there is the Google Truth. More and more, we are getting the Google Truth, and the devil take the hindmost.</p><p>Of course, the whole truth is there to see for anyone who takes the time to look for it, but in an age where critical thinking is a lost art, and where the day is easily filled with comforting distractions, it is even harder for those \"with eyes to see\" to remember to use them discerningly than it was back when Jesus warned us to do so.</p><p>Breitbart.com released a leaked video last week that showed Google executives meeting with staff members on the Friday after Trump's election on Nov. 8, 2016, and lamenting their failure to elect Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Among the many shocking comments, Google cofounder Sergey Brin consoled his crew:</p><p>\"Most people here are pretty upset and pretty sad. I find this election deeply offensive, and I know many of you do too. It's a stressful time, and it conflicts with many of our values. I think it's a good time to reflect on that. ... So many people apparently don't share the values that we have.\"</p><p>Google insists that nothing at the meeting suggests that the company would let its employees' obvious bias affect \"the way we build or operate our products.\" That would be reassuring if it were not so laughable. Just repeat the experiment made by PJmedia.com, when they found that 96 percent of the Google results about Trump were negative. Do your own search on Google for the phrase \"Trump news\" and study the results. When I did it, every result on the first page was anti-Trump, including headlines such as \"House GOP 'screwed' as bad political numbers pile on Trump,\" \"Fox News hosts blast Trump for 'distasteful' remarks on Puerto Rico,\" and \"What if Trump has been a Russian asset since 1987?\"</p><p>The first positive story about Trump came on the fourth page of Google results (39th on the list) when a CNBC story reported on Trump's claim that \"Facebook, Twitter, Google 'have to be careful'\" not to rig the news. Kudos to reporter Ryan Browne for telling the story straight when so many other outlets used the occasion as one more opportunity to bash Trump.</p><p>Of course, it's not just Google that is deciding what you should and shouldn't read. Twitter, which also denies that it has a political agenda, is one of the worst offenders.</p><p>Last week, Twitter rejected four ads proposed by the Center for Immigration Studies because they supposedly contained \"hateful content\" in the form of either \"hate speech\" or \"advocacy against a protected group.\" The so-called hate speech was advocating in favor of enforcing current U.S. immigration laws that target \"criminal aliens\" or \"illegal aliens.\" So are we to assume that \"illegal aliens\" are now a \"protected class\"? Not by federal law, but only by Twitter law, which sums up the problem nicely. Are we comfortable letting Big Tech dictate to us what we can and cannot say (or see) in the modern town square?</p><p>I'm not, and yet I suspect that most Americans, especially conservatives, will demur against trying to regulate access to information on the internet. Why? Because we also support the free market and want to limit government regulation of private enterprise. Therein lies the rub.</p><p>Even though the behavior of Twitter and Google is inexecrable, the argument will be made that no one has to use Google or Twitter, so they do not deserve regulation. Moreover, you could make the case that Google's filtering of information is a form of protected \"free speech\" in that no one is obligated to tell the \"whole truth\" except when sworn to do so. Just as I pick and choose what information to include in a column, so too Google could argue that it is free to pick and choose what information to provide to the public -- and civil libertarians are likely to accept such an argument.</p><p>This is a perfect example of the most insidious of Saul Alinsky's \"Rules for Radicals\" -- \"Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules.\"</p><p>Alinsky's \"Rules\" are a Machiavellian roadmap for anyone who is willing to do anything to gain power. For the most part, those who have embraced the \"Rules\" are -- like Alinsky himself -- radical leftists who are intent on restructuring American society into a socialist utopia like Venezuela (sarcasm intended).</p><p>It is rather obvious, as you go down the list of the rules that they are constantly in play as the progressive movement inside both the Democratic and Republican parties works to undermine the conservative movement embodied somewhat paradoxically by President Trump. This is true in attacks on Trump himself, as well as attacks on targets that are associated with Trump such as Judge Brett Kavanaugh or Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.</p><p>--\"Ridicule is man's most potent weapon.\"</p><p>--\"Keep the pressure on.\"</p><p>--\"Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.\"</p><p>But \"Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules\" is the most dangerous of the \"Rules\" because, as in jiu jitsu, it turns the enemy's strength into a weapon against him.</p><p>In this case, those who wish to control the flow of information (and thus control the culture) have asked conservatives to surrender their voices as the price for keeping a free market. Should they accede to this Hobson's choice, conservatives will soon find they have neither a voice nor a free market.</p><p>Google is no different than any other public utility. It is not an accident that we originally referred to the Internet as a superhighway, and just as the public has a vested interest in protecting the neutrality of highways, phone service, and power transmission, so too do we have a right to demand neutrality in how the storage and transmission of information to the public takes place.</p><p>If we surrender that right, then we have no one to blame but ourselves for the dystopian nightmare that will follow.</p><p>Frank Miele is managing editor of the Daily Inter Lake for 1 1/2 more weeks.

Frank Field was elected on the Labour vote by the people of Birkenhead to represent them in Parliament.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Does he ask them when he decides to vote with the Tories to keep them in power? No, his ego thinks he knows best.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When the local party asked why, and realising he may be deselected, he threw his toys out of the pram.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If we are to believe this man and his reasons for acting like this, the voters would think more of him if he resigned and called a by-election.</p><p>Disgusted voter Supporter of cuts AMID the outpouring of outrage and grief from the media-driven anti-Corbyn amalgam at Frank Field's long-overdue departure, it was refreshing to see three ECHO letters describing the sainted Frankie's true agenda.</p><p>This was in sharp contrast to Joe Riley's piece which read like a composite editorial of the Daily Mail, Scum, et al, who, when it suits them, define democratic accountability as \"bullying\".</p><p>The portrait of Field as the sainted defender of the poor is totally false. After the bankerinduced crash, he asserted that the only solution was savage cuts in public services, with the pensioners accepting their share as they, according to Frankie, prosper at the expense of the young. He doesn't mention that British pensions are the second lowest in the EU.</p><p>When he said \"We will have to cut our living standards\", is it the 1% who control 50% of the wealth in Britain, or the CEOs in the banks and industry whose income increased 100-fold under Frank's New Labour? And increased even further under his much-admired Tory party.</p><p>Unfortunately, instead of celebrating his departure, John McDonnell describes him as a good friend.</p><p>I would say to John, with friends like that, you don't need an enemy agent in Labour's ranks who is part of the rightwing alliance determined to crush you, Jeremy, and the ideas you espouse.</p><p>Instead of trying to change his mind, you should call on his mates to join him.</p><p>Tony Mulhearn, L16 Single-minded IF YOU ever wondered why Jeremy Corbyn doesn't, or ever will have, the full support of Labour Party members, then you just need to read Anthony Hammond's letter to understand why (Corbyn's our man, ECHO, September 3).</p><p>He castigates and berates four of Merseyside's most respected MPs and also Tom Watson, the Labour Party's deputy leader, for daring to criticise Jeremy Corbyn and his policies and then warns them all \"Corbyn's our man, he's theirs, too, whether they like it or not.\"</p><p>\"  Well, I'm sorry, but not everyone agrees with him. He says that 7,000 to 10,000 turned out to listen to Jeremy Corbyn in 2016 in Liverpool. Well, I am a Labour Party member, and have been since joining in 1969 as an 18-year-old, but I didn't turn up. Does that make me a so-called \"Blairite Scouser\"?\"There are approximately 540,000 Labour Party members, does he think every single one of them has no right to challenge or disagree with anything Jeremy Corbyn says? We live in a democracy and are all members of a Labour Party that preaches free speech and equality.</p><p>is Maybe Mr Hammond needs to look up Clause Three of the Labour Party's constitutional rulebook which states quite clearly that: \"The Party shall bring together members and supporters who share its values to develop policies, make communities stronger through collective action and support, and promote the election of Labour Party representatives at all levels of the democratic process.\"</p><p>The key phrases are, \"bring together\", \"share its values\", and \"collective action and support\".</p><p>You simply cannot have one faction of the party trying to dictate everything.</p><p>I'm afraid this type of intimidatory and single-minded viewpoint is one of the reasons why the Labour Party is split and is in turmoil, and is as far away as it ever was from winning a General Election.</p><p>FK, Knotty Ash Remember this IN RESPONSE to Mr Steve Ward, from Kirkby, about the \"slap in the face to Scouse hospitality\" (Just asking, ECHO, August 29).</p><p>He wrote about the attack on the Manchester City team bus last season. I was also very disappointed by a minority of so-called LFC fans, but let me remind him of the Wimbledon FC team bus being burned before Everton's relegation match in 1994.</p><p>I'm sure that was not good Scouse hospitality either.

If there was, we might have some kind of law and order.</p><p>The problem has reached epidemic proportions. A Doyle, Rock Ferry Out of sight ... WITH the back-entries continuing to be in a state of collapse in Kensington Fields, why has our council just embarked on renewing a perfectly good cycle lane in Jubilee Drive? We all understand that the cycle lane provides passage through a bollard area in the road, but it is the most stable road, pavement or path in the entire estate.</p><p>Surely improving rain drainage, eradicating rat nests and providing a safe surface to walk on for residents should take priority? Or is it just that it's out of sight, out of mind? Please invest in our infrastructure and stop fixing things that aren't broke! Bernie Hunt, Kensington Fields Sign petition THIS week, the Home Secretary laid down a much-needed challenge to big tech companies at the NSPCC's HQ in London.</p><p>Sajid Javid said he was demanding change to protect children from online groomers, as well as urging the industry to tackle the vile trade in indecent images.</p><p>And not before time. NSPCC research shows that the equivalent of one child in every primary school classroom surveyed has been sent a naked or seminaked image from an adult; and one-in-50 had sent a nude or semi-nude image to an adult.</p><p>Social media sites often know where we shop, what we buy and even where we go on holiday to target us with adverts. If they can use that technology for profit, then why not to flag the risks to our children and proactively detect these groomers? The NSPCC's Wild West Web campaign is calling on Mr Javid and Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright to create an independent regulator, with the power to investigate and to fine social networks which fall short. And social networks must be forced to publish annual transparency reports about the scale of abuse on their platforms.</p><p>Of course, parents need to take steps to ensure their children are as safe as can be online. But online platforms should be built to be safe in the first place.</p><p>In the coming months, the Government will publish its White Paper setting out proposals for what social network regulation could look like. The NSPCC will be doing all we can to make sure these laws are fit for purpose, and we're asking everyone to sign our Wild West Web petition to tell Mr Wright and Mr Javid how important this issue is.</p><p>Visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nspcc.org.uk/whatwe-do/campaigns/wild-west-web\">www.nspcc.org.uk/whatwe-do/campaigns/wild-west-web</url> Helen Westerman, NSPCC Campaigns Manager for the North</p><p>IT IS a pity there are not as many police on the streets, as there are homeless on both sides of the Mersey, mainly Liverpool.

They were joined by executive producer Barry Josephson and Kathy Reichs, who authored the novels \u201cBones\u201d is based on. The case went to private arbitration in 2016.</p><p> \u201cWe are so proud of the hard work we did on Bones for 12 seasons and only ever wanted Fox to live up to its promises and contractual obligations,\u201d Deschanel said in a statement.</p><p> Boreanaz added in his own statement that \u201cit\u2019s clear that what we were saying all along was true: we were owed additional compensation for our work.\u201d</p><p> Fox denounced the decision and vowed to fight it.</p><p> \u201cThe ruling by this private arbitrator is categorically wrong on the merits and exceeded his arbitration powers,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cFox will not allow this flagrant injustice, riddled with errors and gratuitous character attacks, to stand and will vigorously challenge the ruling in a court of law.\u201d</p><p> Among Lichtman\u2019s findings were that Fox studio executives did not even attempt to try to find the true market value for shows similar to \u201cBones\u201d when negotiations were going on with the Fox network.</p><p> He said that Fox sacrificed the Fox studio\u2019s business for the sake of Hulu\u2019s success, with the network handing over rights to \u201cBones\u201d for a share of ad revenue that would not be shared with the studio. That hurt the haul of the producers.</p><p> Those parts of the ruling were making waves in Hollywood on Wednesday, with trade papers speculating what it might mean for other studios that have stakes in different entities that do business with each other.</p><p> \u201cWhat we have exposed in this case is going to profoundly change the way Hollywood does business for many years to come,\u201d said John Berlinski, attorney for the plaintiffs.</p><p> Lichtman also slammed what he called the \u201ccavalier attitude\u201d of the Fox executives who testified.</p><p> \u201cNone of the witnesses took responsibility or expressed any remorse for their actions,\u201d the decision said, adding that the executives \u201cappear to have given false testimony in an attempt to conceal their wrongful acts.\u201d</p><p> Some of the executives Lichtman called out by name, including Peter Rice and Dana Walden, are headed to Disney as part of its $71.3 billion takeover of most of Fox.</p><p>Disney CEO Bob Iger said he stood by his soon-to-be colleagues.</p><p> \u201cPeter Rice and Dana Walden are highly respected leaders in this industry, and we have complete confidence in their character and integrity,\u201d Iger said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cDisney had no involvement in the arbitration, and we understand the decision is being challenged and will leave it to the courts to decide the matter.\u201d</p><p> Follow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton\">https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton</url> .</p><p> The Conversation</p><p> Listening in to brain communications, without surgery</p><p> February 28, 2019</p><p> Author: Salvatore Domenic Morgera, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Bioengineering, University of South Florida</p><p> Disclosure statement: Salvatore Domenic Morgera has received research funding in networks from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, The Fonds de recherche du Qu\u00e9bec - Nature et technologies, National Science Foundation, and the United States Special Operations Command.</p><p> Partners: University of South Florida provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation US.</p><p> Plenty of legitimate science \u2013 plus a whole lot of science fiction \u2013 discusses ways to \u201chack the brain.\u201d What that really means, most of the time \u2013 even in the fictional examples \u2013 involves surgery, opening the skull to implant wires or devices physically into the brain.</p><p> But that\u2019s difficult, dangerous and potentially deadly. It would be smarter to work with the brain without needing to open patients\u2019 skulls. Neurological disorders are common, affecting more than a billion people worldwide, of all ages, genders, and educational and income levels. My neural engineering team\u2019s research, as part of a wider effort across the bioengineering discipline, is working toward understanding and easing various neurological dysfunctions, such as multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.</p><p> Identifying and influencing brain activity from outside the skull could eventually permit doctors to diagnose and treat a wide range of debilitating nervous system diseases and mental disorders without invasive surgery.</p><p> Wireless connections within the brain</p><p> My group believes we are the first to have discovered a new way nerve cells communicate with each other. Nerves are well known to connect through physical links \u2013 or what might be called \u201cwired\u201d connections \u2013 in which the axons of one nerve cell send electrical and chemical signals to the dendrites of a neighboring cell.</p><p> Our research has found that nerve cells also communicate wirelessly, by using the wired activity to create tiny electric fields of their own, and sensing the fields neighboring cells create. This creates the possibility of many more neural pathways and can help explain why different parts of the brain connect so quickly during the execution of complicated tasks.</p><p> We have been able to monitor these electric fields from outside the skull, effectively listening in on nerve communications. We hope that will help us find alternate, healthy connections for nerves damaged by multiple sclerosis, or rebalance nerve activity due to autism spectrum disorder, or prime neurons to fire together in specific patterns and restore long-term memories lost as a result of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.</p><p> Specifically, we have found when an insulated, or myelinated, nerve fiber in the brain is active and sending signals along its length known as action potentials, special regions along its length generate a very small electric field. The cellular regions where this happens, called nodes of Ranvier, act like small antennas that can transmit and receive electrical signals.</p><p> Any disruption of the two highly specialized structures \u2013 the myelin sheath or the node of Ranvier \u2013 not only results in neurological dysfunction, but the surrounding electric field changes too.</p><p> Listening to nerves</p><p> The technological challenge involves precisely targeting specific parts of the brain to listen in on. The device must receive signals from areas roughly the diameter of a human hair, several centimeters deep within the brain.</p><p> One way is to place a small number of flexible antenna patches on the skull to create what we call a \u201cbrain lens.\u201d Comparing readings from several patches lets us electronically target exactly the nerves to listen in on. We are designing and experimenting with metamaterials \u2013 materials engineered at the molecular level \u2013 that are especially good at serving as high-accuracy antennas that can be tuned to receive signals from very specific locations.</p><p> No pain, but potentially great gain</p><p> By listening in on wireless communications between nerves, we can identify areas of the brain where the electric fields indicate there are problems. The detailed characteristics of a nerve\u2019s activity \u2013 or lack of activity \u2013 can offer clues about what specific problem is occurring in the brain. These findings could help diagnose potential medical conditions far more easily than current methods.</p><p> Look, for instance, at the actual case of one patient, a 38-year-old woman we\u2019ll call \u201cBianca,\u201d who has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a degenerative disease of the brain and spinal cord that has no known cure. Multiple sclerosis patients\u2019 immune systems damage the myelin sheath between the nodes of Ranvier, causing communication problems between the brain and the rest of the body. This damage radically alters the activity in the affected nerves.</p><p> To monitor the progress of her disease, Bianca has had spinal taps to see if her spinal fluid has high levels of particular antibodies associated with MS. She has also had MRI scans to reveal the areas of her brain where the myelin is damaged, and will face additional testing to determine how fast information flows through her nervous system.</p><p> Using a brain lens device would let doctors monitor Bianca\u2019s brain without painful spinal taps and uncomfortable and time-consuming MRIs and CT scans. It may some day allow Bianca to monitor her own brain and send the data to her specialist for evaluation.</p><p> Therapeutic treatment without drugs and surgery</p><p> In addition, we\u2019re hoping that our approach can lead to new therapies that are also easier on patients. At the moment, Bianca is taking several drugs that carry significant health risks and often make her feel nauseated and fatigued. She is one of many, who want to try a different therapy option.</p><p> This work plans to go beyond identifying the regions of her brain where the electric fields indicate unhealthy conditions. Inspired by computer network management and advanced digital networks, which route signals around areas that are damaged or interrupted, we are developing a method by which our scalp patch system could send messages into the brain as well.</p><p> Each damaged nerve fiber is generally one of thousands packed together into a tract of nerve fibers where neighboring nerve fibers are typically healthy. Our device could help identify sites with myelin damage and follow those nerve fibers back before the point of damage, to pick up their undisturbed signals. Then we would use the brain lens to transmit complementary electric fields into the brain, sending those healthy signals to the areas around the myelin damage, to encourage neighboring nerve fibers to carry the messages the damaged fiber can\u2019t.</p><p> So far, we have been able to simulate this approach in a super-computing environment where brain nerve parameters have been provided by clinical research laboratories. In the coming months, we will build and test a brain lens prototype. Listening in to the brain and communicating with it offers a fascinating new set of possibilities for medical diagnosis and treatment without surgery.</p><p> The Conversation</p><p> Sequencing the white shark genome is cool, but for bigger insights we need libraries of genetic data</p><p> February 28, 2019</p><p> Of more than 500 species of sharks in the world\u2019s oceans, scientists have only sequenced a handful of genomes \u2013 most recently, white sharks.</p><p> Author: Gavin Naylor, Director, Florida Program for Shark Research, University of Florida</p><p> Disclosure statement: Gavin Naylor receives funding from the National Science Foundation and from the Lenfest Ocean Program</p><p> Partners: University of Florida provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation US.</p><p> The headlines are eye-catching: Scientists have sequenced the genome of white sharks. Or the bamboo lemur, or the golden eagle. But why spend so much time and money figuring out the DNA makeup of different species?</p><p> I am an evolutionary biologist at the Florida Program for Shark Research. Our research focuses on understanding how modern sharks and rays diversified over the course of their evolution to colonize the habitats they occupy today.</p><p> Rough screening of whole genomes is useful to help identify genetic markers (sequences of genes) to better understand population-level processes. But the real and enduring value of whole genome sequencing is only realized when a lot of accurate, high-resolution genomes are amassed that can be compared with one another. This type of work is just getting started.</p><p> Blueprints without instructions</p><p> An organism\u2019s genome \u2013 the complete catalog of its DNA \u2013 holds the blueprint for its design. Differences in the DNA sequences that make up genomes are responsible for the differences we see among individuals.</p><p> Identical twins are physically similar to one another because their genomes are identical. Siblings resemble each other because they inherit large stretches of their genomes from the same set of parents. And closely related species look more similar to each other than do those that are more distantly related, because their underlying genomes are more similar.</p><p> It follows that if we had a complete genome sequence for an organism, we would have all the information we\u2019d need to understand how it works \u201cfrom the ground up.\u201d Indeed, this was the justification for the initial Human Genome Project</p><p> But an organism\u2019s genomic DNA sequence can contain billions of nucleotides, or genetic building blocks. Trying to piece together what that organism might look like from its genome sequence would be like trying to make sense of thousands of concurrently transmitted telephone conversations from the \u201cpackets\u201d of information that arrive at the receiving end of a fiber-optic telephone cable, without knowing anything about how the information was organized. The data is \u201call there,\u201d but it\u2019s hard to know what it means without an explicit interpreter. And scientists do not yet know how all of the information in genomes is organized, or how its activity is choreographed.</p><p> Bases are the part of DNA that stores information and gives DNA the ability to encode phenotype \u2013 a person\u2019s visible traits. There are four types of bases in DNA: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).</p><p> Learning by comparing</p><p> If it\u2019s so hard to interpret information buried in genomes, why bother collecting the data? The answer is that if we compare genomes against one another, we can deduce which elements are responsible for particular traits.</p><p> For example, humans and chimpanzees have genomes that are approximately 98 percent similar. This means that the 2 percent difference between their respective genomes must somehow account for the differences in their appearance and associated traits. Comparing the genomes side by side allows us to identify the parts of the genome responsible for the observed differences.</p><p> Obviously, it is important to choose carefully which comparisons to make. Comparing a human genome with a duck-billed platypus genome isn\u2019t going to tell us much about what makes humans \u2013 or duck-billed platypuses, for that matter \u2013 so \u201cspecial.\u201d The two species diverged about 150 million years ago, and there are so many differences in their genomes and in the traits they exhibit that it would be impossible to know which genomic differences were responsible for which traits.</p><p> However, comparing human and platypus genomes (two mammals) against a bird genome would allow us to identify aspects of human and platypus genomes that were shared, but distinct from the bird genome. And in turn, comparing genomes of several mammals and birds against genomes of amphibians would help us narrow down what genomic elements birds and mammals had in common that were different from amphibians.</p><p> Genomic information can help scientists understand evolutionary relationships among related species.</p><p> Building genetic libraries</p><p> Hierarchical comparisons like the one described above lie at the core of comparative genomics, a field that sets out to understand how patterns of variation in genomes are associated with, or \u201cmap to,\u201d patterns of variation in observable traits. Biologists refer to this set of associations as the \u201cgenotype-phenotype map.\u201d</p><p> Obviously, scientists need to know the evolutionary relationships among organisms before any of this can be done, and to make sure the genomic information we collect is accurate. If it is inaccurate or incomplete, we risk missing important associations between genotypes and the traits they code for.</p><p> Recent advances in next-generation DNA sequencing and computer science are revolutionizing the collection and analysis of this data. But it\u2019s still expensive. It costs about US$30,000 to sequence and assemble a 2.5 billion base pair genome (for comparison, the human genome has about 3 billion base pairs) with sufficient accuracy to be useful for comparative genomic work - and more for larger genomes, such as that of the lungfish or the salamander.</p><p> An international consortium of scientists is working to collect high-quality genome sequences for all vertebrate animals that meet this standard. Initial comparisons are focusing on species selected to represent the evolutionary diversity of different groups of vertebrates \u2013 a carefully vetted set of birds, reptiles, mammals, amphibians and fishes. In September 2018 the project released its first 15 high-quality reference genomes for species including the Canadian lynx, zebra finch and blunt-snouted clingfish.</p><p> Subsequent comparisons will fill in the evolutionary gaps, until we eventually have a complete set of highly accurate genomes that can be compared with one another. These highly accurate genomes will improve our understanding of the genotype-phenotype map. They also will serve as as references for researchers trying to understand the role different genes play in guiding normal development, and for others exploring likely causes of developmental anomalies, birth defects and genetic diseases.</p><p> Other sequencing initiatives are less focused on obtaining highly accurate and/or complete genomes for comparative genomic work. Many are essentially \u201cfishing expeditions,\u201d looking to see if something interesting shows up, or to identify molecular markers that can subsequently be used for management and conservation efforts. For example, the recently published white shark genome found that olfactory genes were not as abundant as expected given white sharks\u2019 good sense of smell, and that white sharks have a higher proportion of transposable elements \u2013 DNA sequences that can move from one location on the genome to another \u2013 than is typical.</p><p> Such projects are usually much less expensive, since they are not designed to obtain high-resolution genomic maps with complete coverage of the genome. Unfortunately, they have limited utility for downstream research. They are generally too incomplete to be useful for developmental biologists, and are of limited use for understanding the genotype-phenotype map.</p><p> Nonetheless, they do serve to spur public interest in the burgeoning field of genomics, which is already having a big impact in fields ranging from basic biology to applied personalized medicine. As more high-resolution genomes are gathered and compared, we can expect that our understanding of the architectures underpinning different life forms will expand exponentially.</p><p> Opinion: Don\u2019t Let Tech Headlines Lead to Panic-Induced Policies</p><p> By Jennifer Huddleston</p><p> InsideSources.com</p><p> This week (Tuesday and Wednesday), both the House and Senate held hearings on federal data privacy policy. This is no coincidence: From news that the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook are negotiating a record-breaking multi-billion dollar fine tied to user privacy violations, to an Apple bug that allowed outside parties to hear Facetime calls, to concerns about apps that paid users (including teens) to track all their smartphone data, it seems each week now brings scary tech headlines.</p><p> These incidents have led plenty of people to think the worst about our technological future, including some Democratic and Republican legislators. But let\u2019s not forget that we have existing tools and laws for many situations. Bowing to pressure to \u201cdo something\u201d rather than letting our system do its work has real risks. Overreacting could ruin the possibility of new and better innovation in the future.</p><p> In some cases, the solution is already in place. Apple fixed the bug affecting Facetime a few weeks later. And in cases where such a bug may have done real harm, lawsuits filed by individuals and investigations considered by attorneys general could provide legal remedies. We should remember that our court system can provide an appropriate balance in many such cases.</p><p> What\u2019s more, regulatory authorities like the FTC already have the power to protect consumers if the data security or data privacy claims made by companies are truly misleading or otherwise creating clear harm. If an app misleads users as to why it\u2019s collecting user data, what data it\u2019s collecting, or other data security or privacy terms, each should fall squarely under the FTC\u2019s unfair and deceptive trade practices authority.</p><p> We shouldn\u2019t assume every headline involving privacy and data security involves malicious intent. Sometimes even companies with a high priority on data security and user privacy can make mistakes.</p><p> We also shouldn\u2019t sell our fellow Americans short. There seems to be a rush to the conclusion that no customer who uses Apple, Facebook or other platforms knows what they are agreeing to. In fact, data show that individuals are comfortable identifying the trade offs between privacy and the usefulness of a service.</p><p> For example, one survey shows the vast majority of daily Google users are aware that the service collects information. Similarly, others show that most people are aware of available privacy-maximizing options like clearing cookies or using ad blockers. Even in the case of the controversial Facebook app, interviews with some users found that many knew quite well that they were providing Facebook with data in exchange for gift cards.</p><p> So while some may shudder at the idea of allowing a company to track every use of their smartphones in exchange for a benefit, others prefer the benefit.</p><p> Sometimes, of course, an incident can alert us to the need for a new regulation. These should be specific and narrowly tailored rather than enforcing a top-down system. We shouldn\u2019t lock in one way of doing things when tech innovators invent better ways of doing things all the time.</p><p> An American version of Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, a cumbersome system of internet controls focused on data privacy that went into effect last May, would not only change the pro-innovation approach that\u2019s made the United States the world\u2019s tech leader, but could actually make the problems leading to such headlines worse.</p><p> It comes with costly regulatory burdens that many small innovators  potential future tech giants  can\u2019t afford to comply with, solidifying the position of larger tech companies. Such regulations can also close off pathways to future innovations that require a degree of freedom to pursue.</p><p> Not too long ago, headlines over privacy and data security concerns involved Big Tech players like MySpace and Yahoo. Luckily, we didn\u2019t shift away from the American approach then, and the next wave of innovation was better. While it\u2019s important to make informed personal choices about what we do online, a privacy panic won\u2019t do much good.</p><p> ABOUT THE WRITER</p><p> Jennifer Huddleston is a research fellow with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.

When mismanaged banks are deemed \"too big to fail\" while ordinary Americans lose their homes to foreclosure, people get frustrated. A lot of dissatisfaction with Washington is built on the sense that the deck is stacked in favor of a select few.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A recent example is the unnecessary proposal for new TV rules being considered at the FCC.</p><p> For most people, the idea that we need new federal regulations to give us more choice in TV is ridiculous on its face. From Netflix to Roku boxes to Apple TV, we have more ways to find and watch TV than ever \u2014 from wall-size projection screens to smartphones.</p><p> The quality and diversity of programming has exploded too \u2014 diverse voices and stories are stronger than ever on our television screens. From \"Modern Family\" to \"The Wire,\" the quality and diversity of video storytelling is simply light years beyond anything we saw during the \"big three\" network era. The biggest problem for many viewers with TV today is \"not enough time to watch.\"</p><p> Yet FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has proposed a new rule (called \"AllVid\" after a proposal President Obama's first FCC chairman rejected several years ago) that would force existing TV companies to hand over their complete programming libraries for tech companies to use in competing services and devices of their own without negotiating or paying for the rights. You can see why many observers call it a giveaway to Big Tech \u2014 just the kind of unfair government thumb on the scale Americans have grown so sick of.</p><p> It's a giveaway tech companies don't need. Nothing stops any company from negotiating for programming rights and launching its own video service or streaming device today, just as Apple TV, HBO Go, Netflix and dozens more have already done.</p><p> Yet now the FCC thinks we need new rules for video to jump-start consumer choice? That simply makes no sense. The disconnect suggests the real reason for these regulations is something far more Washingtonian \u2014 like pleasing political allies and propping up favored constituencies \u2014 than making markets work.</p><p> Another indication that these rules aren't really about consumer choice is the dubious precedent the FCC's chairman cites to justify them \u2014 the completely inapt 1968 \"Carterfone\" decision that allowed consumers to connect any phone to the monopoly telephone network. Until Carterfone, the Bell System telephone monopoly would only permit consumers to connect telephones made by the Bell System.</p><p> Unlike the Bell System, today's competitive video service providers don't stop consumers from using their own devices to watch video. You can watch Comcast or Netflix on a host of third-party devices, including AppleTV, Google's Chromecast, Roku TV, and Samsung Smart TVs, among others.</p><p> Carterfone also didn't require fundamental changes to the way the telephone system worked. But the chairman's AllVid proposal would require at least two years of work to create government-approved technical standards that would fundamentally change the way video programming is created and delivered.</p><p> The AllVid rules would cover a lot more than just devices that are used to watch video programming \u2014 they would rework an entire segment of our economy, reshaping or overturning a complex system of programming deals and licensing arrangements, privacy regulations, copyright issues and consumer protection laws. Carterfone dealt with one thing \u2014 attaching devices to the analog telephone network \u2014 not a vast universe of live, on-demand, and recorded video content raising different technological, legal, and economic concerns. Carterfone didn't implicate the rights of content-holders at all.</p><p> The chairman's own proposal recognizes these issues are so vexing and complex they cannot be resolved at the FCC, and must be shunted into a vast new standards setting process to design new systems and technologies.</p><p> And while Carterfone proponents argued that innovation was slow moving for \"plain old telephone service,\" that's patently untrue in the video world today, which is enjoying a new \"Golden Age\" with radically innovative devices, services, and programming options flooding the market day after day. It's hard to see how forcing the video industry into a lengthy, government-mandated standards process will speed up innovation.</p><p> These differences are why the FCC itself has found that \"telephone networks do not provide a proper analogy to [video devices] due to the numerous differences in technology\" between phone and video networks.</p><p> But, apparently in the face of pressure from friendly allies in Big Tech, that conclusion is apparently no longer operative for the current FCC chairman.</p><p> Americans deserve better than this. Government shouldn't change the rules depending on who is playing the game or invent justifications to intervene in markets that are working simply to boost its favored corporate interests.</p><p> The FCC should reject the unnecessary and harmful AllVid rules.</p><p> \u2022\u00a0 Fred Campbell formerly served as chief of the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and wireless legal adviser to FCC Chairman Kevin Martin.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-15B99955D03D2E48</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J9B-0791-F0NV-F20R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>14 March 2016</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTA0MzA0M0JFQkRGNDgwRkE2QzEyNTk3MzY5NjZGMUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTFBQkJEQ0Q1MEVFNDkzNTkxQTcyNzY5MDk4RDgzQTc</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjJBNjQ3RjNENTI2NEVCQkJFMTI4RTMxNzIyM0QyNjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODRCNkU5NTg3RTNGNDUzMUFEREU0RURCMTEwMDNDMUE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Jurisdiction</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODg0OUQ4QzVBOTdFNDY2RTlBN0YwQTVBNjA4NDVGRTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODRCNkU5NTg3RTNGNDUzMUFEREU0RURCMTEwMDNDMUE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N541920CC</classCode><className>PHOTOGRAPHY SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N515120CC</classCode><className>TELEVISION INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLIG</classCode><className>DIGITAL VIDEO EQUIPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RO6</classCode><className>STREAMING MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000A4GK</classCode><className>TELEVISION EQUIPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000CYWJ</classCode><className>SMARTPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0008XWK</classCode><className>FORECLOSURE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp;

Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\" Mr. Cicilline's panel has been investigating market power for more than a year and is expected to release a report in the coming weeks.</p><p>Shaping the debate</p><p>In some ways, the hearing was a symbol of the ideological influence of antitrust groups that were founded in the wake of the 2016 presidential election and rose in prominence with each revelation of data breaches, privacy issues and disinformation campaigns.</p><p>Freedom From Facebook and Google, a coalition that counts about 19 progressive groups today, was founded to \"normalize and mainstream the idea that we need to think about power when we're dealing with problems, par-ticularly related to huge corporations,\" Sarah A. Miller, co-chair of Freedom From Facebook and Google, said in an interview.</p><p>At that time, Ms. Miller said, the coalition's goal was to tie the public's growing distrust of the tech industry to the complicated economic issue of market con-centration.</p><p>In 2018, the coalition filed a complaint against Facebook with the Federal Trade Commission after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which roughly 30 million users' personal data was harvested without consent and used for political advertising purposes.</p><p>That FTC probe resulted in a $5 billion fine, the largest in the commission's history.</p><p>\"We were relentless about framing the scandals that were plaguing Facebook in the context of their power and their business model,\" said Ms. Miller, executive director of The American Economic Liberties Project, which is one of the coalition's groups. \"Over time, we saw more and more voices come on board with that.</p><p>\"We wanted to show that it was going to come down to policy-makers acting and not Facebook changing or self-regulating itself.\"</p><p>Different competition</p><p>The century-old U.S. laws that govern monopolistic behavior can be difficult to apply to large tech companies today, said Arie Beresteanu, an economics professor at the University of Pittsburgh who studies market power and industrial organization.</p><p>The movement against monopolies harks back to the Progressive Era of the early 1900s and President Theodore Roosevelt's trust-busting crusades against industrial conglomerates like Standard Oil.</p><p>In 1911, John D. Rockefeller's mammoth oil company was found to have undercut competitors by owning every step of the production, refining and marketing, and was ordered to be split into 34 companies under the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.</p><p>Almost a decade later, U.S. Steel - which became the world's first $1 billion corporation by combining Andrew Carnegie's steel empire with other mills, coal mines and transportation networks - survived a similar challenge.</p><p>In those days, regulators assessed mergers, predatory pricing and supply chain shenanigans, Mr. Beresteanu said. Facebook's power today, by contrast, is enabled in large part because of the \"network effect\" that derives value from the number of people using it. The bigger the network, the bigger the barrier for competitors.</p><p>\"These companies are very different from companies we know from the past,\" Mr. Berest-eanu said, suggesting lawmakers may have to interpret the obsolete laws or write new ones.</p><p>One of those laws governing Big Tech falls under the purview of Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, who chairs a subcommittee on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees telecommunications policy.</p><p>Mr. Doyle has convened hearings in recent months on disinformation, taking aim at a 1996 law that allows companies to self-police their online platforms for bad actors. Mr. Doyle has argued that law, known as Section 230, has allowed hate speech - as well as false claims about COVID-19 and mail-in balloting from President Donald Trump - to flourish.</p><p>\"We said: 'Either police yourself, or you're going to bring regulation upon yourself from us, and you're not going to like it,'\" Mr. Doyle said in a recent interview. He called the antitrust efforts \"something we're all looking at and keeping an eye on.\"</p><p>Different reasons for distrust</p><p>Though antitrust advocates have found bipartisan momentum in Washington, the Trump administration and Republicans view the tech giants' power through a different lens - raising the question of how the parties could work together on any antitrust effort.</p><p>\"I'll just cut to the chase: Big Tech's out to get conservatives,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Other Republicans seemed skeptical of government overreach.</p><p>\"Big isn't inherently bad,\" Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.</p><p>\"You have enjoyed the freedom to succeed,\" said Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo. \"I do not believe big is necessarily bad. In fact, big is often a force for good.\"</p><p>Ms. Miller, in the interview, said the theory that tech platforms were censoring conservatives was unfounded. But fears of any political influence in the moderation of content would be allayed with a better distribution of power in the tech industry.</p><p>Furthermore, lawmakers from both parties asked sophisticated questions, said David Segal, executive director and co-founder of the activism organization Demand Progress and the co-chair of Freedom from Facebook and Google.</p><p>That was an improvement from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's first appearance on Capitol Hill in April 2018, when lawmakers seemed woefully unprepared and unfamiliar with social media.</p><p>\"We think we succeeded in expanding the scope of the conversation,\" Mr. Segal said.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic \"underscores the notion of how dominant they are,\" he added. \"These are very much the robber barons of our time.\"</p><p>Daniel Moore: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dmoore@post-gazette.com\">dmoore@post-gazette.com</email>, Twitter @PGdanielmoore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Associated Press: This combination of 2019-2020 photos shows Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

Rockefeller's mammoth oil company was found to have undercut competitors by owning every step of the production, refining and marketing, and was ordered to be split into 34 companies under the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.</p><p>Almost a decade later, U.S. Steel - which became the world's first $1 billion corporation by combining Andrew Carnegie's steel empire with other mills, coal mines and transportation networks - survived a similar challenge.</p><p>In those days, regulators assessed mergers, predatory pricing and supply chain shenanigans, Mr. Beresteanu said. Facebook's power today, by contrast, is enabled in large part because of the \"network effect\" that derives value from the number of people using it. The bigger the network, the bigger the barrier for competitors.</p><p>\"These companies are very different from companies we know from the past,\" Mr. Berest-eanu said, suggesting lawmakers may have to interpret the obsolete laws or write new ones.</p><p>One of those laws governing Big Tech falls under the purview of Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, who chairs a subcommittee on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees telecommunications policy.</p><p>Mr. Doyle has convened hearings in recent months on disinformation, taking aim at a 1996 law that allows companies to self-police their online platforms for bad actors. Mr. Doyle has argued that law, known as Section 230, has allowed hate speech - as well as false claims about COVID-19 and mail-in balloting from President Donald Trump - to flourish.</p><p>\"We said: 'Either police yourself, or you're going to bring regulation upon yourself from us, and you're not going to like it,'\" Mr. Doyle said in a recent interview. He called the antitrust efforts \"something we're all looking at and keeping an eye on.\"</p><p>Different reasons for distrust</p><p>Though antitrust advocates have found bipartisan momentum in Washington, the Trump administration and Republicans view the tech giants' power through a different lens - raising the question of how the parties could work together on any antitrust effort.</p><p>\"I'll just cut to the chase: Big Tech's out to get conservatives,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Other Republicans seemed skeptical of government overreach.</p><p>\"Big isn't inherently bad,\" Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.</p><p>\"You have enjoyed the freedom to succeed,\" said Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo. \"I do not believe big is necessarily bad. In fact, big is often a force for good.\"</p><p>Ms. Miller, in the interview, said the theory that tech platforms were censoring conservatives was unfounded. But fears of any political influence in the moderation of content would be allayed with a better distribution of power in the tech industry.</p><p>Furthermore, lawmakers from both parties asked sophisticated questions, said David Segal, executive director and co-founder of the activism organization Demand Progress and the co-chair of Freedom from Facebook and Google.</p><p>That was an improvement from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's first appearance on Capitol Hill in April 2018, when lawmakers seemed woefully unprepared and unfamiliar with social media.</p><p>\"We think we succeeded in expanding the scope of the conversation,\" Mr. Segal said.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic \"underscores the notion of how dominant they are,\" he added. \"These are very much the robber barons of our time.\"</p><p>Daniel Moore: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dmoore@post-gazette.com\">dmoore@post-gazette.com</email>, Twitter @PGdanielmoore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Associated Press: This combination of 2019-2020 photos shows Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

Rockefeller's mammoth oil company was found to have undercut competitors by owning every step of the production, refining and marketing, and was ordered to be split into 34 companies under the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.</p><p>Almost a decade later, U.S. Steel - which became the world's first $1 billion corporation by combining Andrew Carnegie's steel empire with other mills, coal mines and transportation networks - survived a similar challenge.</p><p>In those days, regulators assessed mergers, predatory pricing and supply chain shenanigans, Mr. Beresteanu said. Facebook's power today, by contrast, is enabled in large part because of the \"network effect\" that derives value from the number of people using it. The bigger the network, the bigger the barrier for competitors.</p><p>\"These companies are very different from companies we know from the past,\" Mr. Berest-eanu said, suggesting lawmakers may have to interpret the obsolete laws or write new ones.</p><p>One of those laws governing Big Tech falls under the purview of Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, who chairs a subcommittee on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees telecommunications policy.</p><p>Mr. Doyle has convened hearings in recent months on disinformation, taking aim at a 1996 law that allows companies to self-police their online platforms for bad actors. Mr. Doyle has argued that law, known as Section 230, has allowed hate speech - as well as false claims about COVID-19 and mail-in balloting from President Donald Trump - to flourish.</p><p>\"We said: 'Either police yourself, or you're going to bring regulation upon yourself from us, and you're not going to like it,'\" Mr. Doyle said in a recent interview. He called the antitrust efforts \"something we're all looking at and keeping an eye on.\"</p><p>Different reasons for distrust</p><p>Though antitrust advocates have found bipartisan momentum in Washington, the Trump administration and Republicans view the tech giants' power through a different lens - raising the question of how the parties could work together on any antitrust effort.</p><p>\"I'll just cut to the chase: Big Tech's out to get conservatives,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Other Republicans seemed skeptical of government overreach.</p><p>\"Big isn't inherently bad,\" Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.</p><p>\"You have enjoyed the freedom to succeed,\" said Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo. \"I do not believe big is necessarily bad. In fact, big is often a force for good.\"</p><p>Ms. Miller, in the interview, said the theory that tech platforms were censoring conservatives was unfounded. But fears of any political influence in the moderation of content would be allayed with a better distribution of power in the tech industry.</p><p>Furthermore, lawmakers from both parties asked sophisticated questions, said David Segal, executive director and co-founder of the activism organization Demand Progress and the co-chair of Freedom from Facebook and Google.</p><p>That was an improvement from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's first appearance on Capitol Hill in April 2018, when lawmakers seemed woefully unprepared and unfamiliar with social media.</p><p>\"We think we succeeded in expanding the scope of the conversation,\" Mr. Segal said.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic \"underscores the notion of how dominant they are,\" he added. \"These are very much the robber barons of our time.\"</p><p>Daniel Moore: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dmoore@post-gazette.com\">dmoore@post-gazette.com</email>, Twitter @PGdanielmoore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Associated Press: This combination of 2019-2020 photos shows Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

But Sekulow added that while the decision is ultimately up to Trump, he was strongly leaning against granting Mueller access to the president. 'Frankly it is the position of the legal team, and it's been pretty clear on this, is that there's not a constitutional basis to move an interview forward,' he said. Sekulow cited several concerns with Mueller's probe, saying it was initiated in part because of the unverified DNC-funded Steele Dossier and what he described as politically motivated leaks by fired FBI Director James Comey. </p><p>'The depth of corruption that led to this investigation, and that frankly continues to permeate this investigation, is unprecedented,' Sekulow told Sean Hannity. Sekulow also raised constitutional concerns with any federal investigation into alleged obstruction of justice by Trump, saying it was 'inappropriate' to pursue criminal charges against a president for exercising his inherent constitutional powers, such as firing an FBI director. 'If you look at the constitutional issues that are implicated by an interview, it's very serious,' Sekulow said. 'It raises very serious constitutional issues that go to the heart of the separation of powers, and [the president's] Article II authority.'  Sekulow's comments echoed those by fellow Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani,who last month said Mueller could not compel Trump's cooperation through a subpoena[3]because federal investigators could not show the requisite need for his testimony The videe and more[4]Donald and the Di-Spy[5] The point Trump should have made about Sen. Feinstein and the FBI. Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  Donald Trump couldn't resist commenting on the news that Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein was the target of Chinese spying, but he missed the main point.  'I like Dianne Feinstein, I have to tell you, but I don't like the fact she had a Chinese spy driving her, and she didn't know it,' Mr. Trump averred at a Saturday rally in Ohio, adding: 'Then she says to me: 'Well, what did you know about this and that [Russia collusion]?' I mean, give me a break, c'mon folks.' But the issue here isn't what Mrs. Feinstein says about Mr. Trump; it's what the FBI told Mrs. Feinstein but didn't tell Mr. Trump.  Foreign countries are always trying to steal U.S. secrets, and they sometimes succeed. In this case Mrs. Feinstein tweeted over the weekend that the FBI approached her five years ago with concerns about an 'administrative' staffer in her San Francisco office with 'no access to sensitive information.' She said she 'learned the facts and made sure the employee left my office immediately.' This is what the FBI should do, and the question Mr. Trump should ask is why the bureau didn't treat him as a potential President with the same customary courtesy. The FBI claims it had concerns beginning in spring 2016 that low-level Trump campaign staffers Carter Page and George Papadopoulos were colluding with Russians. Yet rather than give the Trump campaign the usual defensive briefing, the FBI launched an unprecedented counterintelligence investigation into a presidential campaign, running informants against it and obtaining surveillance warrants. The country is still enduring the polarizing fallout from that decision through special counsel Robert Mueller's probe. This disparate treatment is evidence that the FBI abused its authority in 2016, whether or not it acted with political bias. The bureau routinely warns politicians, campaigns and others about espionage threats. In Mrs. Feinstein's case, the bureau had located an actual spy\u2014and then went directly and discreetly to the Senator. In Mr. Trump's case, the FBI by its own admission was operating on nothing more than suspicions (many from the Clinton campaign-financed Steele dossier), and to this day the bureau has never presented definitive evidence of the campaign's collusion with Russia. Yet it launched a full investigation that it didn't disclose to Congress  More[6] The Enemy of the T-Shirt[7] In the name of free speech, journalists suppress a slogan. The irony here is that recent usage of the term 'fake news' began during Obama's term as a way to denigrate Fox News 'Fox News' 'Fake News' Get it? In fact, it was candidate Trump who turned the usage around and now the same people who were using it against Fox can't stand it anymore Below are some graphics from the old days that are still floating around The bottom line is that the MSM is a combination of bully and spoiled brat Dave Tunku Varadarajan The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  It took less than 24 hours for the Newseum, a Washington-based museum of news and free speech, to capitulate. Its crime, according to finger-wagging journalists? Lending support to Donald Trump in a tawdry quest for dollars. On Friday the Poynter Institute, which describes itself as 'the world's leading instructor . . . for anyone who aspires to engage and inform citizens in 21st century democracies,' published an item on its website reporting that the Newseum's gift shop was selling T-shirts with the words 'Fake News.' That phrase has become a presidential shibboleth, used by Mr. Trump to disparage news that's unhelpful to him. The Poynter report was intended to elicit outrage from readers, who were told 'you don't have to look very far to see how Trump's favorite catchphrases are being used to delegitimize the press.'  The Poynter story was picked up by the New York Times, whose own reporter repeated that 'fake news' had become 'a rallying cry for President Trump and his supporters' to heap scorn on journalists. 'So the idea that the shirt would be sold at a museum that honors journalists seemed a bit confusing to some in Washington who practice that craft.' The Times proceeded to quote CNN's Jim Acosta, 'a frequent target of the president,' who said that if the Newseum was 'that strapped for cash, I'm happy to make a donation.' The Times also quoted the chairwoman for journalism ethics at the Poynter Institute: 'I think it's very off message for a museum dedicated to press freedom to sell 'fake news' merchandise.'  The Newseum abased itself the next day. In a press release titled 'Statement on Store Merchandise,' it said it had removed the T-shirts: 'We made a mistake and we apologize. A free press is an essential part of our democracy and journalists are not the enemy of the people.' This sweeping mea culpa leads one to wonder how well the folks at the Newseum know their history. 'Fake news' isn't Mr. Trump's own coinage. He first tweeted the phrase on Dec. 10, 2016, several months after his media detractors had used it as a barb against him. The modern paternity of the phrase, in other words, lies with the people who wanted to kill off the T-shirt. That said, the main objection to the Newseum's decision isn't pedantic. It has misunderstood completely the semiotics of the T-shirt. Who takes a T-shirt's text literally? Wearers put them on for all sorts of reasons, frequently in pursuit of irony. Donning a T-shirt that blares 'Fake News' on its front can just as easily be a subversion of the idea\u2014a slap at Mr. Trump\u2014as an endorsement of it. You'd think the guardians of journalism would get that\u2014even as they strong-arm a museum dedicated to free speech to pull a T-shirt whose message they dislike More[8] CNN's Toobin: Trump Questioning Intelligence of Black People 'Racist Acts'[9] According to CNN, if a black person does something stupid it is now racist to call them stupid Dave Pam Key Breitbart News 7 Aug 2018  Tuesday at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), TMZ[10] caught up with CNN's chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin who said President Donald Trump questioning the intelligence of African-Americans were 'certainly racist acts.' When asked about Trump's criticism of LeBron James and Maxine Waters, Toobin said, 'It's not a, it's a pattern, it's black people. It's calling black people ignorant.' He continued, 'Here in L.A., the Ball family at UCLA, he went after, you know, the NFL players who, you know, kneeled during the anthem. It's one black athlete, black person after another. On questioning the intelligence of African-Americans Toobin said.'Which is a historically horrible stereotype that he is feeding into.'

Zero Transparency: 6 Questions that Tech Giants Refuse to Answer About the InfoWars Ban[13] In short, the responses from the tech giants were either standard form letters or nothing at all Dave Allum Bokhari Breitbart News 7 Aug 2018  Even though the internet is aflame with controversy over the coordinated purge of Alex Jones and InfoWars from Facebook, YouTube, Spotify, and Apple, there is no real transparency over their decision and the process by which it was made. Alex Jones and InfoWars have been top Twitter trends for hours, and even some left-wing journalists like Michael Tracey are decrying[14] Silicon Valley's Masters of the Universe appointing themselves the arbiters of free speech on the web. But Apple, Facebook, Spotify, and YouTube have offered, at most, only copy and paste explanations for why they banned InfoWars content from their platforms \u2014 or why, after months of pressure from the Democrats and CNN, they all came to the same decision on the same day. Questions about transparency have a much broader scope that just the case of InfoWars and Alex Jones. Beyond the banning[15] of other individuals such as Tommy Robinson, the same questions apply to a whole host of actions by the Masters of the Universe, including partnering with foreign governments to shut down accounts, shadowbanning[16] users to limit the scope of their engagement, and mass user purges. Breitbart News sent the following questions to Facebook, YouTube, Spotify, and Apple earlier today, and have yet to receive a real answer for most of them. Apple and YouTube chose to provide the same canned statement they provided to all other media outlets who contacted them, while Facebook and Spotify ignored our request entirely. THE QUESTIONS SILICON VALLEY WON'T ANSWER 1) What content specifically from InfoWars/Alex Jones was found to be'hate speech' and otherwise rule breaking? 2) When was the decision to ban them made? What changed over the courseof a few days from when you defended not banning Infowars content? 3) Who made the decision to take down Infowars?It's unlikely that the decision to ban InfoWars was taken by a rank-and-file content reviewer. 4) Will you provide clear guidelines on 'hate speech'including defining hate speech in a manner that is clear to all users? 5) How does big tech plan to manage the incoming wave of demands to censor andremove content from other conservative sites? Like this one, for example: These companies (Facebook, Apple, YouTube, etc) will remove Alex Jones #InfoWars[17] (and I agree) from their content offerings but not a known sexual predator? #MuteRKelly[18].

There was no apparent catalyzing event immediately prior to the censorship. Here are the responses Breitbart News received from two of the companies contacted in their entirety More[21] Farage: Treat Twitter like a biased publisher and sue[22].

UKIP Call to 'Defend Free Speech' Against 'Globalist Elite' After Social Media Purges[23] The censorship we're witnessing in the United States is actually a global phenomenon It is a coordinated action Global corporations have effectively set themselves up to be the world's thought police This must not stand They have no more right to do this than ATT has to listen in on your calls and disconnect you if they don't like what you say All the same laws apply It is time to teach them to these elitist companies Dave Liam Deacon Breitbart News 7 Aug 2018  The UK Independence Party (UKIP) has urged citizens to defend free speech in the West after big tech firms allegedly coordinated to remove right wingvoices, including InfoWars and Tommy Robinson, from social media. On Monday, Apple, Facebook, Pinterest, Spotify, and Google-owned YouTube permanently removed[24] content from InfoWars and its owner Alex Jones, saying he and the website violated their policies against hate speech and harassment. Proponents of the ban say Mr Jones is a conspiracy theorist who deserves to be silenced, whilecritics[25] have claimed[26] the purge is an attempt to interfere in the U.S. midterm elections and described it as a form of 'political censorship'. Infowars says it has been banned by Facebook for unspecified 'hate speech'. Regardless of the facts in this case, the ability of Facebook to censor rival publishers is a global anti-trust problem, which along with San Francisco cultural imperialism, reduces political diversity. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/xb5oY2JHzy\">https://t.co/xb5oY2JHzy</url>[27] \u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) August 6, 2018[28] Then on Tuesdayactivist Tommy Robinson was expunged[29] from the Facebook-owned Instagram platform.

Owens said Antifa agitators were 'inspired' to target [35]her and Charlie Kirk with harassment by a HuffPost article deriding the duo as 'racist.' Owens remarked: '[Antifa]hyperlinked to a Huffington Post article. We say it all the time, the leftist media is inciting violence and hate by calling everybody a racist and a white supremacist. They linked to a Huffington Post article which said that Turning Point USA had among its ranks a woman who tweeted something that was controversial and racist, and therefore gave Huffington Post the power to call our entire organization racist. That is what inspired the attack.' Owens continued: 'The Huffington Post inspired the attack against Charlie Kirk and I yesterday in the restaurant. The leftist media does not understand that when you smear people \u2014 when you call them Nazis, when you call them Nazi-defenders, when you call them white supremacists \u2014 you are giving permission to the people that are closest to Nazis in America \u2014 these brown shirts, these Antifa gangs and thugs \u2014 to come out and attack people. The Huffington Post has told them that they are virtuous in their actions.' Owens described politically motivated violence as a mostly left-wing phenomenon: 'The liberal people are the violent people in this country. The Democrat Party are the violent people. They are the evil party, and they proved that yesterday.' Owens said Antifa is a 'well-funded' operation linked to Democrats: 'What's really scary to note is how quickly [Antifa] managed to assemble.

Cuomo said that Trump has 'politicized ICE.' He added,'I will do nothing cooperatively with ICE. I have sent them letters asking for an investigation. I have said, if they do any criminal acts, which a police force can do, we will take criminal action against ICE. Because I believe they are politically motivated.' The video[40] America the Horrible?[41] Progressives say that the United States is racist and misogynist, but they still want everyone in the world to come here.  The Progressives only appear to be hypocrites or at least logically inconsistent In truth they are completely consistent they're just shy about telling you why They can hate America and want everyone in the world to come here because they want to overwhelm Americans with foreigners who do not assimilate destroying American culture in the process It's all so simple, isn't it? Dave Heather Mac Donald City Journal June 14, 2018  American women live under a suffocating patriarchy. Rape culture flourishes in the United States. Toxic masculinity stunts the emotional and professional growth of American females. Sexual harassment and predation are ubiquitous in American workplaces. College campuses are maelstroms of sexual violence. Female students need safe spaces where they can escape abusive male power. These propositions are self-evident to a large, interlocking establishment of government bureaucrats, progressive politicians, college administrators, faculty, 'activists,' professionals, and journalists. Yet this same establishment is up in arms over a recent declaration by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions that female aliens caught trying to enter the country illegally will no longer be automatically considered for asylum by dint of claiming that they are victims of domestic abuse. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accuses the Trump administration of 'staggering cruelty' in condemning 'vulnerable innocent women to a lifetime of violence and even death.' The American Bar Association charged that Sessions would 'further victimize those most in need of protection.' The executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, Benjamin Johnson, denounced 'this shameful chapter in our country's history,' and promised a lawsuit. Sessions was right to return asylum law to its original intent: offering protection to individuals persecuted by their government for membership in a socially distinct group. Domestic violence is a private crime, not a public one, and does not reflect general persecution of the sort that international law has codified as appropriate for asylum petitions. Asylum petitions have mushroomed 1,700 percent from 2008 to 2016, according to the New York Times, driven in significant part by domestic-abuse claims, often underwritten by extensive coaching and encouragement by hard-left advocates. But why should social-justice warriors want to subject these potential asylees to the horrors of America? In coming to the U.S., if you believe the dominant feminist narrative, the female aliens would simply be exchanging their local violent patriarchy for a new one. Indeed, it should be a mystery to these committed progressives why any Third World resident would seek to enter the United States. Not only is rape culture pervasive in the U.S., but the very lifeblood of America is the destruction of 'black bodies,' in the words of media star Ta-Nehesi Coates. Surely, a Third World person of color would be better off staying in his home country, where he is free from genocidal whiteness and the murderous legacy of Western civilization and Enlightenment values. But the same left-wing establishment that in the morning rails against American oppression of an ever-expanding number of victim groups in the afternoon denounces the U.S. for not giving unlimited access to foreign members of those same victim groups. In their open-borders afternoon mode, progressives paint the U.S. as the only source of hope and opportunity for low-skilled, low-social-capital Third Worlders; a place obligated by its immigration history to take in all comers, forever. In their America-as-the-font-of-all-evil-against-females-and-persons-of-color morning mode, progressives paint the U.S. as the place where hope and opportunity die under a tsunami of misogyny and racism. Which reality do progressives actually believe? They likely hold both mutually exclusive concepts in their heads simultaneously, unaware of the contradiction, toggling smoothly between one and the other according to context. But both claims cannot be true. And actions speak more loudly than words. In pressing for an immigration policy determined by the desire of hundreds of millions of foreigners to enter the U.S., progressives implicitly acknowledge that the left-wing narrative about America is false. In fact, there is no place on earth less governed by tribal prejudice and machismo than the United States. The left-wing narrative is simply a form of moral preening More[42] Venezuela: Where Inflation Is So Bad that $1 Can Buy You 3.5 Million Liters Of Gasoline[43]  Oh, the absurdities of a command economy[44] Also, do you think government insiders and organized crime can resist the arbitrage opportunity to buy gas this cheap and then sell it abroad? I don't think so either Dave Matt Vespa TownHall Aug 06, 2018  Venezuela is a total disaster. Inflation is through the roof. Medical supplies are low[45]. Basic commodities, like toilet paper[46], are in short supply. Readily available medicines, which we take for granted, are not around. Crime has risen. Economic destitution abounds\u2014and yet democratic socialists in America want to exportthat misery here. The people are starving[47]. It's become so bad that people are eating out of garbage cans[48]. In some cases, Venezuelan doctors, teachers[49], and even children[50] are not prostituting for food. Zoo animals[51], dogs, cats, and birds are being consumed.[52] In the meantime, waiting in line at the supermarket could land you in trouble with the police[53]. With food so scarce, people wait in line overnight to try and get something for their families. So, how bad is Venezuela's inflation problem? The International Monetary Fund says the rate could hit 1 million percent[54]. No, that's not a joke. It's on that projected path[55]. Right now, French news agency AFP reported that one U.S. dollar could buy 3.5 million liters of gasoline[56][emphasis mine]: In Venezuela's inflation-hit economy, a single US dollar can buy 3.5 million liters of gasoline- an absurdity that the government says it will tackle with a hike in the cost of state-subsidized fuel. But just how far can President Nicolas Maduro go without getting his fingers burned? Maduro announced on July 29 plans to adjust the price of gasoline and regulate sales based on the so-called 'fatherland card,' an electronic card that provides access to subsidies. As a first step the government began a census of motor vehicles, set to end on Sunday. A liter of 91-octane gasoline currently costs one bolivar, while 95-octane gas costs six. By contrast, a single egg in Venezuela's hyperinflation ravaged economy \u2014 estimated by the IMF at one million percent in 2018 \u2014 costs 200,000 bolivars. On July 31, AFP noted that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who took over from the late Hugo Chavez, admitted that the economy has failed[57]: 'Under-fire Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro admitted his economic model has 'failed' in the wake of food and medicine shortages and public service paralysis, such as Tuesday's power failure that affected 80 percent of Caracas.

A northeastern Georgia precinct located in Habersham County had 276 registered voters before the state's primary elections at the end of May, but 670 votes were recorded\u2014indicating that 276 percent of voters turned out in Georgia's primary election, McClatchy reported[60]. The recently publicized voting irregularities come as the state investigated other instances of voter fraud\u2014including one where an Atlanta City Hall staffer claimed[61] she had to 'print and deliver 500 blank absentee ballots' to an advocacy group staffer and pick up additional ballots from the Atlanta mayor's campaign office to drop them off at an office in Fulton County. Part of the reason for the increase in voter fraud claims stems from concerns about the security of Georgia's electronic voting systems, as Georgia is one of a handful[62] of states, including New Jersey, South Carolina, Delaware, and Louisiana, that uses electronic voting machines that do not produce a paper trail for voters to verify their ballots. Elections experts say the lack of a paper trail makes the ballots difficult to audit More[63] DHS Nielsen Cuts Number of 'Overstay' Illegals in 2017[64] Neil Munro Breitbart News 7 Aug 2018  PresidentDonald Trump's immigration push has gained an 8 percent cut on the number of foreigners who illegally overstayed their tourist, business or temporary work visas during 2017, says a new report by the Department of Homeland Security. In fiscal 2016 which endsOctober 1, 2016, an estimated 1.25 percent of 50.4 million visitors overstayed their visas, allowing 628,799 overstays to join the nation's population of roughly 11 million illegal migrants. In fiscal 2017, ending October 1, 2017, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen forced the number down to 607,000 overstays, or 1.15 percent of 52.6 million visitors. That means 22,000 fewer overstays from one year to the next. Also, the DHS ensured that many of the overstays returned home after several months. By May 1, 2018, almost half of the 2016 overstays had gone home, reducing the 2016 overstayrate to just 0.68 percent, said the report[65], titled 'Fiscal Year 2017 Entry/Exit Overstay report.' By May 1, 2018, one-third of the 2017 overstays were gone, dropping the 2017 rate to 0.8 percent More[66] U.S. to Reimpose Sanctions Targeting Iranian Economy[67] Measures are aimed at pressuring Tehran's leaders to stop supporting Middle East militant groups and end enrichment of uranium Michael R. Gordon The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  WASHINGTON\u2014The U.S. moved to reimpose punishing sanctions on Iran and threatened even-tougher measures for later this year as the Trump administration sought to increase pressure on the Tehran regime to negotiate or step aside. Trump administration officials publicly maintain that the campaign isn't aimed at regime change, even as thousands of Iranians protest a deteriorating economy. But senior U.S. officials have repeatedly depicted Iranian leaders as corrupt ideologues and declared that Iranians should have the right to pick their own government The video and more[68]  German central bank blocks $400 million cash delivery to Iran ahead of crippling US sanctions[69] Benjamin Weinthal Fox News August 7, 2018 The U.S. campaign to rein in Iran has scored a victoryin the German financial sector, after the Deutsche Bundesbank\u2212 the country'scentral bank\u2212 imposed a rule stopping a $400 million cash delivery to Tehran. Iran's cash-starved economy desperately needs hard currency ahead of crippling U.S. bank sanctions that will be introduced in November. Germany allows the Iranian-owned European-Iranian trade bank (EIH) to operate in Hamburg. The EIH holds more than $400 million that Tehran wants to receive in cash ahead of a second wave of U.S. sanctions due in November that impact banks and Iran's energy sector. The Deutsche Bundesbank has cooperated with the EIH in the past to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran. The U.S. and the European Union previously sanctioned the EIH for its role in advancing Iran's nuclear and missile programs. The sanctions on the EIH were lifted after the world powers reached an agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program in 2015. But President Trump effectively tore up the 'decaying and rotten' deal in May and vowed to impose greater sanctions on the regime.  Close partnership = results.

Curfews have been imposed in parts of the country amid nightly demonstrations by Iranian dissidents who have been heard chanting, 'death to the dictator' and 'Mullahs should go away.' At least one protester was shot and killed by Iranian security forces over the weekend, but that does not appear to have quelled opposition to the Iranian ruling regime, which was smacked Monday with the first portion of harsh new sanctions by the Trump administration following the president's decision to abandon the landmark nuclear deal that provided Iran's leaders with millions in cash windfalls. The ongoing protests have been percolating for weeks as dissidents take to the streets across Iran to protest the hardline ruling regime and its massive military spending, which has crippled an already weak Iranian economy. Western pressure on the Iranian financial sector heightened on Monday, as the Trump administration imposed the first wave of new sanctions on Iran's gold, coal, steel, and aluminum trade. The sanctions are being supported by new efforts by the Trump administration to warn European countries that any new business with Iran will subject them and their international banking systems to harsh new sanctions, as the Washington Free Beacon first reported[74] on Thursday after conversations with multiple senior U.S. officials. Video that emerged on social media on Sunday shows a reported 6,000 bus drivers in Tehran, Iran's capital city, sitting in long lines for nearly 24 hours to get fuel, which has been cut off due to Iran's inability to pay its debts, according to translations of the Farsi language videos[75] posted to Twitter More[76] US withdrawal from Iran deal helping wind down Yemen war, officials say[77] Hollie McKay Fox News August 7, 2018 SANA'A, Yemen - Despite Tehran's repeated denials of arming Shiite Houthi rebels in war-torn Yemen, government and military officials insist President Trump's withdrawal from the landmark Iran nuclear deal has had an immediate impact in helping bring the four-year conflict at least a step toward closure. 'There is still some support. but we have seen it drop since the U.S. pulled out,' Abd-Rabbo Moftah, deputy governor of the Yemen city, of Ma'rib told Fox News. 'Any way that support from Iran is lessened, is helpful in stopping the war. The Houthis were feeding on this deal, and legitimacy.'  Abd-Rabbo Moftah, deputy governor of the Yemen city of Ma'rib (FOX News/Hollie McKay) Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak, Ambassador of Yemen to the U.S. and Permanent Representative to the United Nations, said that after talks started between the U.S. and Iran on the deal during the Obama administration, Iran subsequently 'stepped up its military and financial support for the Houthi rebels in Yemen.' 'Nevertheless, the clear-eyed President Trump's Iran strategy, along with withdrawing from the Iran deal and demanding that Iran cease its destabilizing behavior in the region, has made clear to Iran and its proxies in Yemen that meddling in the region will not be overlooked again,' Mubarak said. He added that as a result of these 'strong and positive signals,' Iranian-backed Houthi rebels are beginning to engage more with the peace process More[78] Iran sanctions are a good start \u2014 now it's time to restore human rights to its people before it's too late[79] Jim Hanson Fox News August 7, 2018 President Trump's decision to slap what he called 'the most biting sanctions ever'[80] on Iran on Tuesday was a positive and necessary step to put pressure on the Islamic Republic's corrupt regime that deprives its citizens of basic human rights, supports terrorism, fights in support of brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, and calls for death to the U.S. and Israel. And President Trump has promised to toughen sanctions even further on Nov. 5, targeting Iran's oil industry. National Security Adviser John Bolton told Fox News on Tuesday: 'We want to see a much broader retreat by Iran from their support for international terrorism, their belligerent military activity in the Middle East, and their ballistic missile, nuclear-related programs.' The Iranian people are sick and tired of their repressive leaders who rule with an iron fist and the religious police who enforce a strict Islamist code. Protests by citizens in Iran keep getting bigger and more widespread and the regime is getting more violent[81] in trying to stop them. Citizens refuse to accept a government that can spend billions of dollars supporting terrorism, but can't feed its own citizens. Unless Iran's rulers really feel the pain of sanctions themselves, they will just apply more pain to the protesters. The Iranian economy is already a shambles and the Iranian currency is in freefall, dropping in value daily - it has lost about half its value since President Trump wisely announced in May that the U.S. would withdraw from the deeply flawed deal that was supposed to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The new U.S. economic sanctions that President Trump imposed Tuesday are specifically designed to hurt the Iranian regime's leaders, their businesses and their ability to operate Iran as a terror state. Unfortunately the Iranian people will suffer as well - that's unavoidable - but they will know their oppressive rulers are hurting as well More[82] Bring Pastor Andrew Brunson Home[83] Trump's Americans First policy prioritizes freeing our citizens held hostage abroad. William McGurn The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  When the Wicked Witch meets Dorothy in 'The Wizard of Oz,' she demands the ruby red slippers the Kansas farm girl is wearing. The Good Witch advises Dorothy otherwise. 'Their magic must be very powerful or she wouldn't want them so badly,' she says. The Magnitsky Act is something like those ruby red slippers. Originally passed by Congress in 2012 and named for the Russian accountant found dead in his jail cell after exposing fraud involving Russian officials, it authorized the president to block travel visas and freeze bank accounts of individual Russians deemed guilty of human-rights abuses. In 2016 it was expanded so it could be applied to other human-rights abusers anywhere in the world. We know its power the same way we know about the power of Dorothy's red slippers: The bad guys obsess about it.  Plainly Vladimir Putin hates it. His representatives bring it up to American officials or would-be American officials any chance they get. This includes the infamous election-year Trump Tower meeting Donald Trump Jr. attended in expectation of getting dirt on Hillary Clinton. Now it's the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who's howling. This past weekend he declared the Maginstky sanctions 'disrespectful.' He did so after Donald Trump ordered them slapped on two senior Erdogan officials\u2014his justice and interior ministers\u2014for their roles in the arrest and detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson, who is no longer in prison but remains under house arrest.  Unlike previous presidents, Mr. Trump has elevated the cases of Americans unfairly locked up abroad. For the moment, Mr. Erdogan is resisting. Turkey, he says, has never 'bowed our heads to such pressure' and never will. On Saturday, Mr. Erdogan announced Turkey would be retaliating with sanctions on two unnamed Trump officials, probably the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security. This gesture is all but meaningless unless Jeff Sessions or Kirstjen Nielsen have financial assets in Turkey or are itching to travel there.  We'll see whether Mr. Erdogan changes his mind, but it's encouraging to see the Magnitsky Act invoked on behalf of our fellow citizens. For today it isn't just American trade that is global, it's the American people. Though there are no hard figures on how many Americans live abroad, in 2016 the State Department reckoned it was at least nine million. Add to this the millions more Americans who travel. Simply by being abroad, American citizens are more vulnerable to attack by terrorists or arbitrary arrest and detention by rogue regimes. The best way the U.S. government can help keep them safe is to make clear through word and deed that messing with the liberty of an American carries a high price. Unfortunately, up to now apprehending and mistreating Americans has cost most nations very little. Iran is one of the worst offenders When there are no consequences for arbitrarily throwing an American in jail, it creates an incentive for rogue regimes simply to take another American hostage whenever a new bargaining chip is needed. So even as five hostages were freed after the nuke deal, Iran now has in custody Iranian-American businessman Siamak Namazi and his ailing, 81-year-old father, Baquer Namazi, a former Unicef representative. The elder Mr. Namazi was arrested when he returned to Iran to try to secure his son's release. The family is hoping Mr. Trump will make good on his campaign promise not to allow Iran to get away with such outrageous behavior More[84] Turkish Lira Falls to Fresh Lows Against U.S. Dollar[85] Drop follows central bank moves reducing its foreign-currency reserves while also lowering reserve requirement for banks Orla McCaffrey The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  The Turkish lira weakened to new record lows against the U.S. dollar Monday after the country's central bank attempted to stem the currency's decline by reducing the amount of foreign currency it holds in reserve while also lowering the reserve requirement for banks. The Turkish currency was recently down 4.7% against the U.S. currency, with the dollar buying about 5.331 lira. The lira has fallen more than 29% this year. The decisions about central bank foreign-exchange reserves and the bank-reserve requirements are the latest in a series of central bank moves that have alarmed investors, who are concerned about President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's increased influence over monetary policy. 'This move will take on a life of its own if they don't do anything in the next few days,' said Win Thin, global head of emerging-market strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman .... The decline comes amid a 'negative emerging-market backdrop,' Mr. Thin said, so 'the best they can hope for is to stop the massive underperformance.' The Turkish currency began to plummet in April, when a rising U.S. dollar put pressure on a number of emerging-market currencies. Turkey's considerable load of dollar-denominated debt, which becomes increasingly costly to pay with a weaker currency, made the lira particularly vulnerable in the eyes of investors More[86] The Return of James Monroe[87] Latin America's crisis turns Washington's Cold War nightmare on its head. Walter Russell Mead The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  'The era of the Monroe Doctrine is over,' then-Secretary of State John Kerry told the Organization of American States in 2013. It was, like many foreign-policy declarations of the Obama years, gloriously optimistic and utterly wrong.  President James Monroe's declaration in 1823 that the U.S. would not permit the establishment of hostile powers in the Western Hemisphere has become the most famous idea in American foreign policy. The so-called Roosevelt Corollary of 1904 adds that if other nations in the Western Hemisphere default on their international obligations or endanger their neighbors through misgovernance, the U.S. has a 'police power' to intervene. Monroe's original doctrine and Roosevelt's extension have never been popular in Latin America, but U.S. presidents from Thomas Jefferson to Bill Clinton have taken an activist role in the region when they saw fit. Latin America policy has set off one firestorm after another in U.S. politics, especially during the Cold War Yet after the Cold War it seemed that U.S.-Latin American relations could relax. The fall of the Soviet Union reduced American concerns about Latin American leftism When Mr. Kerry proclaimed the death of the Monroe Doctrine in 2013, he did so on the belief that the U.S. not only faced no great-power competition in the region, but that the leading Latin American states had achieved such stability and prosperity as to make 'policing' concerns obsolete.  The situation looks less rosy now. The main problem isn't Washington's Cold War nightmare of a triumphant Latin left spreading communism in the Western Hemisphere. It's precisely the opposite: The implosion of Venezuela's leftist government is driving a regional crisis. As waves of refugees flee the socialist utopia, bad actors ranging from Vladimir Putin to Hezbollah are nosing around in the ruins of the Bolivarian republic. This weekend's alleged assassination attempt against Venezuelan President Nicols Maduro is a harbinger of more violence to come.  In better times, Venezuela's oil wealth allowed it to lavish aid on its neighbors. Now that aid is drying up. Choices are narrowing for countries like Nicaragua, where near-civil-war conditions exist, and Cuba. Farther north in Guatemala, where some of the world's highest homicide rates coincide with severe food shortages, asylum seekers stream toward the U.S. Washington can't ignore so much instability so close to home. The growing interest in the region by revisionist powers like China, Russia and Iran adds another dimension to American concerns. With China seeking political influence through strategic investments in Argentina and elsewhere, and Hezbollah cutting deals with Venezuelan drug lords and politicians, the U.S. has to think once again about geopolitical competition in the Western Hemisphere  More[88] Sen. Rand Paul Invites Russian Lawmakers to Washington[89] Mr. Paul said Russia shouldn't be considered a friend of the U.S. but the two nations had shared interests Thomas Grove The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  MOSCOW\u2014Sen. Rand Paul met with Russian lawmakers Monday and invited them to Washington as part of a growing outreach to the Kremlin, days after a bipartisan group of U.S. senators proposed tightening sanctions against Russia [90]over findings of election interference. 'Russia shouldn't be considered our friend, but we have certain shared interests\u2014regarding Syria, terrorism and energy,' said Mr. Paul (R., Ky.) after meeting with lawmakers from the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament. The meetings marked the second U.S. delegation to Moscow led by a Republican congressman this summer and gave Russian officials a chance to promote their position on a number of issues that strain already tense relations between Washington and Moscow, from interference in elections to cyber security. 'We will continue this dialogue,' Mr. Paul said on Russian state television, adding that a visit would likely happen by the end of the year. Following President Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki[91], the U.S. president invited his Russian counterpart to Washington, though the trip has been pushed back from the fall[92] to sometime next year. A previous Republican delegation to Moscow last month included Sen. Richard Shelby, Sen. John Kennedy and Rep. Kay Granger. Russian state television, which characterizes most U.S. lawmakers as 'the Washington establishment' and 'anti-Russian,' praised Mr. Paul as an independent thinker in Congress. The senator had supported the summit between Messrs. Trump and Putin and called for better relations between Washington and Moscow. Moscow is now watching for signals that progress can be made to improve relations, even as U.S. lawmakers look to harden punitive measures against Russia[93] and consider imposing sanctions on Russian debt and energy projects. While few in Moscow believe Mr. Trump can deliver on promises to reset the relationship, Russian officials are still hopeful there can be individual gains. Russia analysts say the Kremlin is watching the course of the talks between officials from the two countries to see where gains can be made. 'The visit to Russia at this important juncture, is received as a positive step that for now could have an effect on promoting dialogue,' said Victor Olevich of the Center for Actual Politics, a Moscow-based independent research center. Talks covered subjects including the risk of a military accident in Syria\u2014where both U.S. and Russian forces operate\u2014and North Korea More[94] A Moment of Honesty From Chuck Schumer[95] He admits his mind is made up on Kavanaugh. That means his document demands are in bad faith. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  Americans trust politicians about as much as they trust used-car salesmen, and it's understandable that voters view what my colleagues and I say and do through a skeptical lens. But elected officials can also exhibit moments of exceeding honesty. On July 10, the morning after President Trump nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he'd oppose the nomination 'with everything I've got.' If the weeks since are any indicator, we should believe him. Immediately after news broke that Justice Anthony Kennedy was retiring, Democrats demanded that the president wait until the next Congress to appoint a replacement. They cited the 'Biden rule,' a precedent based on then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joe Biden's 1992 pronouncement that his committee would wait until after the heated presidential election season to consider any Supreme Court nomination. This year is a midterm election year, not a presidential one. Most Democrats have abandoned the talking point, but they haven't abandoned the goal of delaying the process. Presumably, Mr. Schumer announced that he would oppose Judge Kavanaugh's nomination before he read the judge's 307 written opinions and the many other opinions he joined. Certainly, it was before he reviewed the more than 17,000 pages Judge Kavanaugh provided to the committee in response to our bipartisan questionnaire and an estimated one million pages of documents the committee has requested from the Bush White House, where Judge Kavanaugh once worked.  It stands to reason that Senator Schumer wasn't too concerned about Judge Kavanaugh's record before he announced his opposition. Why is it so important to Senator Schumer now? Democratic leaders are demanding access to every page from every email and every paper record from every one of the hundreds of White House aides who came and went during the entire eight years of President Bush's time in office. This includes records that merely mention Judge Kavanaugh's name and records he's never seen. That is not reasonable Their objective is to delay the confirmation process until after the midterm elections, with the hope of taking control of the Senate. My Democratic counterpart on the Judiciary Committee's hometown newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle, put it quite succinctly: 'Feinstein, other Senate Dems have plan on Brett Kavanaugh nomination: Stall.'  So recent complaints from Mr. Schumer and other Democrats about the scope of records requests ring hollow, especially coming from senators who have already declared their opposition to Judge Kavanaugh and initially refused even to meet with him. Democrats' arguments have changed, but their goal hasn't. First, it was a misrepresentation of the Biden rule\u2014whose existence they denied in 2016. Now, it's a manufactured document fight. Both arguments have been made with the aim of stalling the confirmation process until after midterms More[96] A good guy with a gun has saved many lives in Florida - something the media rarely report[97] John R. Lott Fox News August 7, 2018 Thankfully, a heroic citizen with a permit to legally carry a concealed handgun was able to save countless lives in Florida Saturday when he shot a gunman[98] who opened fire on a back-to-school event attended by over 150 students at a park in Titusville, Florida. The media rarely give national news coverage to incidents like this, but responsible gun owners have stepped forward in this way many times before to save lives. In fact, concealed handgun permit holders have prevented dozens[99] of mass public shootings just in recent years, while receiving only brief mentions in local news coverage.  Fortunately, only the attacker was injured in Titusville. The gun permit holder shot him in the head to keep the attacker from shooting any children and adults in the park. Neither the permit holder nor the attacker have been identified so far by police. The attacker suffered life-threatening injuries and remains hospitalized. The presence of an armed 'good guy' prevented the Titusville shooting from turning into a tragedy like school shooting in Parkland, Florida in February. Law enforcement officers cannot be everywhere, so the presence of armed citizens is vital to provide an instant response to attackers. 'Based on the information that we've gathered,' said[100] Titusville Police Sgt. William Amos,'this person stepped in and saved a lot of people's lives.' The police responded within minutes, but the gun permit holder was right there the moment the attack started, enabling him to stop the attacker almost immediately. Law enforcement officers cannot be everywhere, so the presence of armed citizens is vital to provide an instant response to attackers More[101] Arab Leaders Need to Step Up to Avert War in Gaza[102] Hamas refuses to disarm, but pressure from outside could help strengthen the Palestinian Authority.  If history has taught us anything it is that the Islamic world will never be at peace Grievances from 1400 years ago, such as the slaughter of Husain and his family[103] which started the rift between Sunnis and Shiites, feel as fresh as if they happened yesterday In fact, a desire for revenge for past grievances[104] is one of the major driving forces of Islamic culture In their honor-based society[105], they can never forget, and they can never forgive  In their minds, to do so would be an injustice, and a dishonor that indicates weakness, inviting more abuse In fact, the only thing that unites all Muslims is a desire to avenge the insultthat the infidel West has inflicted on them by being more successful They view infidel success as a flagrant insult to Allah himself! So rather than trying to solve the Middle East's problems by trying to do things like end the hatred between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority it would be smarter to strategize on how to live with the Middle East's problems and minimize their impact on the West From that perspective, keeping Muslims turned against each other instead of forming a unified force against us is a wise strategy Especially when we minimize immigration from the Islamic world We have seen war before in Gaza, and we will surely see it again There is nothing anyone can do to prevent it Instead of trying to fix the Middle East, which we cannot do because Islamists don't respect us Infidels our number one priority should be isolate it and make the Middle East irrelevant Dave David Makovsky and Ghaith al-Omari The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  Diplomatic efforts continue to reach a cease-fire and end the current clashes between Israel and the Palestinians in Gaza. The hope is to avert what would be the fourth Israel-Hamas war in the past 10 years. Even if a cease-fire is reached, the resumption of significant international aid to Gaza will probably require a return of the Palestinian Authority, which was violently expelled by Hamas in 2007. Yahya al-Sinwar, who has been the leader of Hamas in Gaza since 2017, has said he would like the PA to come back. The catch? He wants Hamas to keep its weapons. The Palestinian Authority's President Mahmout Abbas sees a trap. He fears the PA will be stuck with all of the responsibility in Gaza while Hamas retains all of the authority - as with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Thus, he has been willing to call publicly on Hamas to surrender its weapons. An official with the Israel Defense Forces tells us Mr. Abbas has slashed the monthly funds sent to Gaza from $112 million to $84 million. This has generated some backlash, including rare demonstratiions in the West Bank city of Ramallah urging Mr. Abbas to transfer more money. The situationin Gaza is bleak. The territory gets only about four hours of electricity a day, and its economy hardly functions. United Nations officials tell us Gazans earn less than $3.50 a day on average, one-third of the West Bank wages. Israel, which sees Hamas as sworn to its destruction and has had to defend against frequent rocket fire on its cities, maintains many restrictions on Gaza. Egypt does as well, given that Hamas is part of the banned Muslim Brotherhood network and has ties to jihadists operating in Sinai. Egypt has been spearheading the effort to bring the Palestinian Authority back to Gaza. Having concluded that the immediate disarmament of Hamas is unrealistic, Cairo is focused on restoring the PA as the legitimate address for substantial aid, hoping that will alter the political dynamic. Mr. Abbas is abysmally unpopular in Gaza because residents believe he is indifferent to their suffering, but returning at the head of aid convoys could change that perception. Once sentiments turns in his favor, Egypt believes Mr. Abbas may have greater success in calling for disarmament  More[106] Saudi Arabia's Spat With Canada Risks Backlash From Investors[107]  Diplomatic dispute will also affect Saudi students currently in Canada The Crown Prince wants to dictate Saudi Arabia into being a modern state As with all absolute rulers, he tolerates no criticism, and punishes dissenters severely His approach may be summarized as, 'The beatings will continue until morale improves'  The Crown Prince's vast dictatorial powers have separated him from reality and turned him into an idiot Dave Margherita Stancati The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  Saudi Arabia's diplomatic rupture with Canada risks complicating the kingdom's efforts to woo foreign investors as it seeks to overhaul its economy. Saudi Arabia on Monday declared Canada's ambassador persona non grata, and gave him 24 hours to leave the country[108]. The decision to expel the Canadian ambassador, Dennis Horak, came after Canada's Foreign Ministry criticized Saudi Arabia for arresting human-rights activists.  In pushing back against what it described as an unacceptable attempt by Canada to interfere in its domestic affairs, the Saudi Foreign Ministry announced it 'will put on hold all new business and investment transactions with Canada.' The diplomatic spat with Canada will also affect 7,000 Saudi students who are currently in Canada on government-sponsored scholarships. The spokesman for Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Education, Mubarak al-Osaimi, on Monday said that the kingdom would stop funding scholarships and training programs in Canada, and that it would help transfer Saudis affected by the decision to other countries. Separately, Saudia airlines, the national carrier, announced it would suspend flights to Canada from Aug. 13.  Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Monday the government was 'deeply concerned' by Saudi Arabia's move to expel Canada's ambassador on the basis of statements 'in defence of human-rights activists detained in the kingdom.' At a press conference in Vancouver, she said officials were waiting to hear from Saudi Arabia about how the relationship between Canada and the kingdom unfolds given this diplomatic row. 'We stand by what we have said,' she said. 'We will always speak up for human rights and women's rights.' The eruption in tensions between allies risks fueling concerns among investors during a tumultuous period of change for the kingdom.  Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has launched a grand reform plan, called Vision 2030, that aims to transform the kingdom from a staunchly conservative petrostate to a more socially liberal country less dependent on oil. But Prince Mohammed has also made it clear he won't brook outside criticism of key decisions\u2014a stance that analysts say could threaten capital flows that Saudi Arabia needs for its overhaul. 'Branding Saudi Arabia as an attractive destination for investment and trade is one of the underlying assumptions of Saudi Vision 2030,' said Thomas Juneau, an assistant professor and Middle East expert at the University of Ottawa. 'Impulsive foreign-policy decisions like this have the exact opposite effect.' More[109] Pakistani Christian Brutally Beaten over Arm Wrestling Match[110] International Christian Concern 08/07/2018  On August 2, Vishal Masih, an 18-year-old Pakistani Christian, was severely beaten by a group of Muslims after winning an arm wrestling match in Nabipur village. Located in Sheikhupura District, 27 miles away from Lahore, Nabipur has become the latest site of religiously motivated violence in Pakistan. Waris Masih, Vishal's cousin, described the violent incident to International Christian Concern (ICC) days after it occurred. A day before the incident, Vishal was reportedly involved in an arm wrestling match with a Muslim boy who belongs to the influential family of Wirk Jutt. Vishal defeated the Muslim boy several times which infuriated his opponent. During the match, the Muslim opponent began to verbally abuse Vishal and insulted the Christian community as a whole, saying, 'How could a man of a dirty community defeat me?' He continued, 'A Choora (Untouchable) defeats a Muslim is unbearable, I will teach him a lesson.' Following the match, while Vishal was on his way home, a gang of over a dozen young Muslims followed him and attacked. The gang brutally beat Vishal, attacked his family's house, and beat his family members. Local elders tried to intervene and resolve the issue, but, after a short period of time, another gang led by Khalaq Wirk, Hassnain Wirk, and Mehboob Alam assaulted Vishal again. Waris told ICC that although Vishal survived the attack, it was as if they left him for dead. 'The Christian community is already living in a constant fear and these sorts of incidents develop insecurity and detachment from this Islamic country or society which is sad to note.' The gang then kidnapped the severely injured Vishal, locked him in a room at their residence, where they repeatedly beat him for the third time. After the assaults, Vishal was reportedly admitted to a hospital. His family is being pressured by influential Muslims to withdraw the case, otherwise they could be in more danger More[111] The post FREEDOM UPDATE: 6 Questions that Tech Giants Refuse to Answer about InfoWars Ban: Rep.

But Sekulow added that while the decision is ultimately up to Trump, he was strongly leaning against granting Mueller access to the president. 'Frankly it is the position of the legal team, and it's been pretty clear on this, is that there's not a constitutional basis to move an interview forward,' he said. Sekulow cited several concerns with Mueller's probe, saying it was initiated in part because of the unverified DNC-funded Steele Dossier and what he described as politically motivated leaks by fired FBI Director James Comey. </p><p>'The depth of corruption that led to this investigation, and that frankly continues to permeate this investigation, is unprecedented,' Sekulow told Sean Hannity. Sekulow also raised constitutional concerns with any federal investigation into alleged obstruction of justice by Trump, saying it was 'inappropriate' to pursue criminal charges against a president for exercising his inherent constitutional powers, such as firing an FBI director. 'If you look at the constitutional issues that are implicated by an interview, it's very serious,' Sekulow said. 'It raises very serious constitutional issues that go to the heart of the separation of powers, and [the president's] Article II authority.'  Sekulow's comments echoed those by fellow Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani,\u00a0who last month said Mueller could not compel Trump's cooperation through a subpoena[3]\u00a0because federal investigators could not show the requisite need for his testimony The videe and more[4]Donald and the Di-Spy[5] The point Trump should have made about Sen. Feinstein and the FBI. Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  Donald Trump couldn't resist commenting on the news that Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein was the target of Chinese spying, but he missed the main point.  'I like Dianne Feinstein, I have to tell you, but I don't like the fact she had a Chinese spy driving her, and she didn't know it,' Mr. Trump averred at a Saturday rally in Ohio, adding: 'Then she says to me: 'Well, what did you know about this and that [Russia collusion]?' I mean, give me a break, c'mon folks.' But the issue here isn't what Mrs. Feinstein says about Mr. Trump; it's what the FBI told Mrs. Feinstein but didn't tell Mr. Trump.  Foreign countries are always trying to steal U.S. secrets, and they sometimes succeed. In this case Mrs. Feinstein tweeted over the weekend that the FBI approached her five years ago with concerns about an 'administrative' staffer in her San Francisco office with 'no access to sensitive information.' She said she 'learned the facts and made sure the employee left my office immediately.' This is what the FBI should do, and the question Mr. Trump should ask is why the bureau didn't treat him as a potential President with the same customary courtesy. The FBI claims it had concerns beginning in spring 2016 that low-level Trump campaign staffers Carter Page and George Papadopoulos were colluding with Russians. Yet rather than give the Trump campaign the usual defensive briefing, the FBI launched an unprecedented counterintelligence investigation into a presidential campaign, running informants against it and obtaining surveillance warrants. The country is still enduring the polarizing fallout from that decision through special counsel Robert Mueller's probe. This disparate treatment is evidence that the FBI abused its authority in 2016, whether or not it acted with political bias. The bureau routinely warns politicians, campaigns and others about espionage threats. In Mrs. Feinstein's case, the bureau had located an actual spy and then went directly and discreetly to the Senator. In Mr. Trump's case, the FBI by its own admission was operating on nothing more than suspicions (many from the Clinton campaign-financed Steele dossier), and to this day the bureau has never presented definitive evidence of the campaign's collusion with Russia. Yet it launched a full investigation that it didn't disclose to Congress  More[6] The Enemy of the T-Shirt[7] In the name of free speech, journalists suppress a slogan. The irony here is that recent usage of the term 'fake news' began during Obama's term as a way to denigrate Fox News 'Fox News' 'Fake News' Get it? In fact, it was candidate Trump who turned the usage around and now the same people who were using it against Fox can't stand it anymore Below are some graphics from the old days that are still floating around The bottom line is that the MSM is a combination of bully and spoiled brat Dave Tunku Varadarajan The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  It took less than 24 hours for the Newseum, a Washington-based museum of news and free speech, to capitulate. Its crime, according to finger-wagging journalists? Lending support to Donald Trump in a tawdry quest for dollars. On Friday the Poynter Institute, which describes itself as 'the world's leading instructor . . . for anyone who aspires to engage and inform citizens in 21st century democracies,' published an item on its website reporting that the Newseum's gift shop was selling T-shirts with the words 'Fake News.' That phrase has become a presidential shibboleth, used by Mr. Trump to disparage news that's unhelpful to him. The Poynter report was intended to elicit outrage from readers, who were told 'you don't have to look very far to see how Trump's favorite catchphrases are being used to delegitimize the press.'  The Poynter story was picked up by the New York Times, whose own reporter repeated that 'fake news' had become 'a rallying cry for President Trump and his supporters' to heap scorn on journalists. 'So the idea that the shirt would be sold at a museum that honors journalists seemed a bit confusing to some in Washington who practice that craft.' The Times proceeded to quote CNN's Jim Acosta, 'a frequent target of the president,' who said that if the Newseum was 'that strapped for cash, I'm happy to make a donation.' The Times also quoted the chairwoman for journalism ethics at the Poynter Institute: 'I think it's very off message for a museum dedicated to press freedom to sell 'fake news' merchandise.'  The Newseum abased itself the next day. In a press release titled 'Statement on Store Merchandise,' it said it had removed the T-shirts: 'We made a mistake and we apologize. A free press is an essential part of our democracy and journalists are not the enemy of the people.' This sweeping mea culpa leads one to wonder how well the folks at the Newseum know their history. 'Fake news' isn't Mr. Trump's own coinage. He first tweeted the phrase on Dec. 10, 2016, several months after his media detractors had used it as a barb against him. The modern paternity of the phrase, in other words, lies with the people who wanted to kill off the T-shirt. That said, the main objection to the Newseum's decision isn't pedantic. It has misunderstood completely the semiotics of the T-shirt. Who takes a T-shirt's text literally? Wearers put them on for all sorts of reasons, frequently in pursuit of irony. Donning a T-shirt that blares 'Fake News' on its front can just as easily be a subversion of the idea a slap at Mr. Trump as an endorsement of it. You'd think the guardians of journalism would get that even as they strong-arm a museum dedicated to free speech to pull a T-shirt whose message they dislike More[8] CNN's Toobin: Trump Questioning Intelligence of Black People 'Racist Acts'[9] According to CNN, if a black person does something stupid it is now racist to call them stupid Dave Pam Key Breitbart News 7 Aug 2018  Tuesday at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), TMZ[10] caught up with CNN's chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin who said President Donald Trump questioning the intelligence of African-Americans were 'certainly racist acts.' When asked about Trump's criticism of LeBron James and Maxine Waters, Toobin said, 'It's not a, it's a pattern, it's black people. It's calling black people ignorant.' He continued, 'Here in L.A., the Ball family at UCLA, he went after, you know, the NFL players who, you know, kneeled during the anthem. It's one black athlete, black person after another. On questioning the intelligence of African-Americans Toobin said.'Which is a historically horrible stereotype that he is feeding into.'

Zero Transparency: 6 Questions that Tech Giants Refuse to Answer About the InfoWars Ban[13] In short, the responses from the tech giants were either standard form letters or nothing at all Dave Allum Bokhari Breitbart News 7 Aug 2018  Even though the internet is aflame with controversy over the coordinated purge of Alex Jones and InfoWars from Facebook, YouTube, Spotify, and Apple, there is no real transparency over their decision and the process by which it was made. Alex Jones and InfoWars have been top Twitter trends for hours, and even some left-wing journalists like Michael Tracey are decrying[14] Silicon Valley's Masters of the Universe appointing themselves the arbiters of free speech on the web. But Apple, Facebook, Spotify, and YouTube have offered, at most, only copy and paste explanations for why they banned InfoWars content from their platforms   or why, after months of pressure from the Democrats and CNN, they all came to the same decision on the same day. Questions about transparency have a much broader scope that just the case of InfoWars and Alex Jones. Beyond the banning[15] of other individuals such as Tommy Robinson, the same questions apply to a whole host of actions by the Masters of the Universe, including partnering with foreign governments to shut down accounts, shadowbanning[16] users to limit the scope of their engagement, and mass user purges. Breitbart News sent the following questions to Facebook, YouTube, Spotify, and Apple earlier today, and have yet to receive a real answer for most of them. Apple and YouTube chose to provide the same canned statement they provided to all other media outlets who contacted them, while Facebook and Spotify ignored our request entirely. THE QUESTIONS SILICON VALLEY WON'T ANSWER 1) What content specifically from InfoWars/Alex Jones was found to be'hate speech' and otherwise rule breaking? 2) When was the decision to ban them made? What changed over the course\u00a0of a few days from when you defended not banning Infowars content? 3) Who made the decision to take down Infowars?\u00a0It's unlikely that the decision to ban InfoWars was taken by a rank-and-file content reviewer. 4) Will you provide clear guidelines on 'hate speech'\u00a0including defining hate speech in a manner that is clear to all users? 5) How does big tech plan to manage the incoming wave of demands to censor and\u00a0remove content from other conservative sites? Like this one, for example: These companies (Facebook, Apple, YouTube, etc) will remove Alex Jones #InfoWars[17] (and I agree) from their content offerings but not a known sexual predator? #MuteRKelly[18].

UKIP Call to 'Defend Free Speech' Against 'Globalist Elite' After Social Media Purges[23] The censorship we're witnessing in the United States is actually a global phenomenon It is a coordinated action Global corporations have effectively set themselves up to be the world's thought police This must not stand They have no more right to do this than ATT has to listen in on your calls and disconnect you if they don't like what you say All the same laws apply It is time to teach them to these elitist companies Dave Liam Deacon Breitbart News 7 Aug 2018  The UK Independence Party (UKIP) has urged citizens to defend free speech in the West after big tech firms allegedly coordinated to remove right wing\u00a0voices, including InfoWars and Tommy Robinson, from social media. On Monday, Apple, Facebook, Pinterest, Spotify, and Google-owned YouTube permanently removed[24] content from InfoWars and its owner Alex Jones, saying he and the website violated their policies against hate speech and harassment. Proponents of the ban say Mr Jones is a conspiracy theorist who deserves to be silenced, while\u00a0critics[25] have claimed[26] the purge is an attempt to interfere in the U.S. midterm elections and described it as a form of 'political censorship'. Infowars says it has been banned by Facebook for unspecified 'hate speech'. Regardless of the facts in this case, the ability of Facebook to censor rival publishers is a global anti-trust problem, which along with San Francisco cultural imperialism, reduces political diversity. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/xb5oY2JHzy\">https://t.co/xb5oY2JHzy</url>[27]   WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) August 6, 2018[28] Then on Tuesday\u00a0activist Tommy Robinson was expunged[29] from the Facebook-owned Instagram platform.

Owens said Antifa agitators were 'inspired' to target [35]her and Charlie Kirk with harassment by a HuffPost article deriding the duo as 'racist.' Owens remarked: '[Antifa]\u00a0hyperlinked to a Huffington Post article. We say it all the time, the leftist media is inciting violence and hate by calling everybody a racist and a white supremacist. They linked to a Huffington Post article which said that Turning Point USA had among its ranks a woman who tweeted something that was controversial and racist, and therefore gave Huffington Post the power to call our entire organization racist. That is what inspired the attack.' Owens continued: 'The Huffington Post inspired the attack against Charlie Kirk and I yesterday in the restaurant. The leftist media does not understand that when you smear people   when you call them Nazis, when you call them Nazi-defenders, when you call them white supremacists   you are giving permission to the people that are closest to Nazis in America   these brown shirts, these Antifa gangs and thugs   to come out and attack people. The Huffington Post has told them that they are virtuous in their actions.' Owens described politically motivated violence as a mostly left-wing phenomenon: 'The liberal people are the violent people in this country. The Democrat Party are the violent people. They are the evil party, and they proved that yesterday.' Owens said Antifa is a 'well-funded' operation linked to Democrats: 'What's really scary to note is how quickly [Antifa] managed to assemble.

The video[40] America the Horrible?[41] Progressives say that the United States is racist and misogynist, but they still want everyone in the world to come here.  The Progressives only appear to be hypocrites or at least logically inconsistent In truth they are completely consistent they're just shy about telling you why They can hate America and want everyone in the world to come here because they want to overwhelm Americans with foreigners who do not assimilate destroying American culture in the process It's all so simple, isn't it? Dave Heather Mac Donald City Journal June 14, 2018  American women live under a suffocating patriarchy. Rape culture flourishes in the United States. Toxic masculinity stunts the emotional and professional growth of American females. Sexual harassment and predation are ubiquitous in American workplaces. College campuses are maelstroms of sexual violence. Female students need safe spaces where they can escape abusive male power. These propositions are self-evident to a large, interlocking establishment of government bureaucrats, progressive politicians, college administrators, faculty, 'activists,' professionals, and journalists. Yet this same establishment is up in arms over a recent declaration by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions that female aliens caught trying to enter the country illegally will no longer be automatically considered for asylum by dint of claiming that they are victims of domestic abuse. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accuses the Trump administration of 'staggering cruelty' in condemning 'vulnerable innocent women to a lifetime of violence and even death.' The American Bar Association charged that Sessions would 'further victimize those most in need of protection.' The executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, Benjamin Johnson, denounced 'this shameful chapter in our country's history,' and promised a lawsuit. Sessions was right to return asylum law to its original intent: offering protection to individuals persecuted by their government for membership in a socially distinct group. Domestic violence is a private crime, not a public one, and does not reflect general persecution of the sort that international law has codified as appropriate for asylum petitions. Asylum petitions have mushroomed 1,700 percent from 2008 to 2016, according to the New York Times, driven in significant part by domestic-abuse claims, often underwritten by extensive coaching and encouragement by hard-left advocates. But why should social-justice warriors want to subject these potential asylees to the horrors of America? In coming to the U.S., if you believe the dominant feminist narrative, the female aliens would simply be exchanging their local violent patriarchy for a new one. Indeed, it should be a mystery to these committed progressives why any Third World resident would seek to enter the United States. Not only is rape culture pervasive in the U.S., but the very lifeblood of America is the destruction of 'black bodies,' in the words of media star Ta-Nehesi Coates. Surely, a Third World person of color would be better off staying in his home country, where he is free from genocidal whiteness and the murderous legacy of Western civilization and Enlightenment values. But the same left-wing establishment that in the morning rails against American oppression of an ever-expanding number of victim groups in the afternoon denounces the U.S. for not giving unlimited access to foreign members of those same victim groups. In their open-borders afternoon mode, progressives paint the U.S. as the only source of hope and opportunity for low-skilled, low-social-capital Third Worlders; a place obligated by its immigration history to take in all comers, forever. In their America-as-the-font-of-all-evil-against-females-and-persons-of-color morning mode, progressives paint the U.S. as the place where hope and opportunity die under a tsunami of misogyny and racism. Which reality do progressives actually believe? They likely hold both mutually exclusive concepts in their heads simultaneously, unaware of the contradiction, toggling smoothly between one and the other according to context. But both claims cannot be true. And actions speak more loudly than words. In pressing for an immigration policy determined by the desire of hundreds of millions of foreigners to enter the U.S., progressives implicitly acknowledge that the left-wing narrative about America is false. In fact, there is no place on earth less governed by tribal prejudice and machismo than the United States. The left-wing narrative is simply a form of moral preening More[42] Venezuela: Where Inflation Is So Bad that $1 Can Buy You 3.5 Million Liters Of Gasoline[43]  Oh, the absurdities of a command economy[44] Also, do you think government insiders and organized crime can resist the arbitrage opportunity to buy gas this cheap and then sell it abroad? I don't think so either Dave Matt Vespa TownHall Aug 06, 2018  Venezuela is a total disaster. Inflation is through the roof. Medical supplies are low[45]. Basic commodities, like toilet paper[46], are in short supply. Readily available medicines, which we take for granted, are not around. Crime has risen. Economic destitution abounds and yet democratic socialists in America want to exportthat misery here. The people are starving[47]. It's become so bad that people are eating out of garbage cans[48]. In some cases, Venezuelan doctors, teachers[49], and even children[50] are not prostituting for food. Zoo animals[51], dogs, cats, and birds are being consumed.[52] In the meantime, waiting in line at the supermarket could land you in trouble with the police[53]. With food so scarce, people wait in line overnight to try and get something for their families. So, how bad is Venezuela's inflation problem? The International Monetary Fund says the rate could hit 1 million percent[54]. No, that's not a joke. It's on that projected path[55]. Right now, French news agency AFP reported that one U.S. dollar could buy 3.5 million liters of gasoline[56][emphasis mine]: In Venezuela's inflation-hit economy, a single US dollar can buy 3.5 million liters of gasoline- an absurdity that the government says it will tackle with a hike in the cost of state-subsidized fuel. But just how far can President Nicolas Maduro go without getting his fingers burned? Maduro announced on July 29 plans to adjust the price of gasoline and regulate sales based on the so-called 'fatherland card,' an electronic card that provides access to subsidies. As a first step the government began a census of motor vehicles, set to end on Sunday. A liter of 91-octane gasoline currently costs one bolivar, while 95-octane gas costs six. By contrast, a single egg in Venezuela's hyperinflation ravaged economy   estimated by the IMF at one million percent in 2018   costs 200,000 bolivars. On July 31, AFP noted that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who took over from the late Hugo Chavez, admitted that the economy has failed[57]: 'Under-fire Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro admitted his economic model has 'failed' in the wake of food and medicine shortages and public service paralysis, such as Tuesday's power failure that affected 80 percent of Caracas.

A northeastern Georgia precinct located in Habersham County had 276 registered voters before the state's primary elections at the end of May, but 670 votes were recorded indicating that 276 percent of voters turned out in Georgia's primary election, McClatchy reported[60]. The recently publicized voting irregularities come as the state investigated other instances of voter fraud including one where an Atlanta City Hall staffer claimed[61] she had to 'print and deliver 500 blank absentee ballots' to an advocacy group staffer and pick up additional ballots from the Atlanta mayor's campaign office to drop them off at an office in Fulton County. Part of the reason for the increase in voter fraud claims stems from concerns about the security of Georgia's electronic voting systems, as Georgia is one of a handful[62] of states, including New Jersey, South Carolina, Delaware, and Louisiana, that uses electronic voting machines that do not produce a paper trail for voters to verify their ballots. Elections experts say the lack of a paper trail makes the ballots difficult to audit More[63] DHS Nielsen Cuts Number of 'Overstay' Illegals in 2017[64] Neil Munro Breitbart News 7 Aug 2018  President\u00a0Donald Trump's immigration push has gained an 8 percent cut on the number of foreigners who illegally overstayed their tourist, business or temporary work visas during 2017, says a new report by the Department of Homeland Security. In fiscal 2016 which ends\u00a0October 1, 2016, an estimated 1.25 percent of 50.4 million visitors overstayed their visas, allowing 628,799 overstays to join the nation's population of roughly 11 million illegal migrants. In fiscal 2017, ending October 1, 2017, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen forced the number down to 607,000 overstays, or 1.15 percent of 52.6 million visitors. That means 22,000 fewer overstays from one year to the next. Also, the DHS ensured that many of the overstays returned home after several months. By May 1, 2018, almost half of the 2016 overstays had gone home, reducing the 2016 overstay\u00a0rate to just 0.68 percent, said the report[65], titled 'Fiscal Year 2017 Entry/Exit Overstay report.' By May 1, 2018, one-third of the 2017 overstays were gone, dropping the 2017 rate to 0.8 percent More[66] U.S. to Reimpose Sanctions Targeting Iranian Economy[67] Measures are aimed at pressuring Tehran's leaders to stop supporting Middle East militant groups and end enrichment of uranium Michael R. Gordon The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  WASHINGTON The U.S. moved to reimpose punishing sanctions on Iran and threatened even-tougher measures for later this year as the Trump administration sought to increase pressure on the Tehran regime to negotiate or step aside. Trump administration officials publicly maintain that the campaign isn't aimed at regime change, even as thousands of Iranians protest a deteriorating economy. But senior U.S. officials have repeatedly depicted Iranian leaders as corrupt ideologues and declared that Iranians should have the right to pick their own government The video and more[68]  German central bank blocks $400 million cash delivery to Iran ahead of crippling US sanctions[69] Benjamin Weinthal Fox News August 7, 2018 The U.S. campaign to rein in Iran has scored a victory\u00a0in the German financial sector, after the Deutsche Bundesbank  the country's\u00a0central bank  imposed a rule stopping a $400 million cash delivery to Tehran. Iran's cash-starved economy desperately needs hard currency ahead of crippling U.S. bank sanctions that will be introduced in November. Germany allows the Iranian-owned European-Iranian trade bank (EIH) to operate in Hamburg. The EIH holds more than $400 million that Tehran wants to receive in cash ahead of a second wave of U.S. sanctions due in November that impact banks and Iran's energy sector. The Deutsche Bundesbank has cooperated with the EIH in the past to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran. The U.S. and the European Union previously sanctioned the EIH for its role in advancing Iran's nuclear and missile programs. The sanctions on the EIH were lifted after the world powers reached an agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program in 2015. But President Trump effectively tore up the 'decaying and rotten' deal in May and vowed to impose greater sanctions on the regime.  Close partnership = results.

Curfews have been imposed in parts of the country amid nightly demonstrations by Iranian dissidents who have been heard chanting, 'death to the dictator' and 'Mullahs should go away.' At least one protester was shot and killed by Iranian security forces over the weekend, but that does not appear to have quelled opposition to the Iranian ruling regime, which was smacked Monday with the first portion of harsh new sanctions by the Trump administration following the president's decision to abandon the landmark nuclear deal that provided Iran's leaders with millions in cash windfalls. The ongoing protests have been percolating for weeks as dissidents take to the streets across Iran to protest the hardline ruling regime and its massive military spending, which has crippled an already weak Iranian economy. Western pressure on the Iranian financial sector heightened on Monday, as the Trump administration imposed the first wave of new sanctions on Iran's gold, coal, steel, and aluminum trade. The sanctions are being supported by new efforts by the Trump administration to warn European countries that any new business with Iran will subject them and their international banking systems to harsh new sanctions, as the Washington Free Beacon first reported[74] on Thursday after conversations with multiple senior U.S. officials. Video that emerged on social media on Sunday shows a reported 6,000 bus drivers in Tehran, Iran's capital city, sitting in long lines for nearly 24 hours to get fuel, which has been cut off due to Iran's inability to pay its debts, according to translations of the Farsi language videos[75] posted to Twitter More[76] US withdrawal from Iran deal helping wind down Yemen war, officials say[77] Hollie McKay Fox News August 7, 2018 SANA'A, Yemen - Despite Tehran's repeated denials of arming Shiite Houthi rebels in war-torn Yemen, government and military officials insist President Trump's withdrawal from the landmark Iran nuclear deal has had an immediate impact in helping bring the four-year conflict at least a step toward closure. 'There is still some support. but we have seen it drop since the U.S. pulled out,' Abd-Rabbo Moftah, deputy governor of the Yemen city, of Ma'rib told Fox News. 'Any way that support from Iran is lessened, is helpful in stopping the war. The Houthis were feeding on this deal, and legitimacy.'  Abd-Rabbo Moftah, deputy governor of the Yemen city of Ma'rib (FOX News/Hollie McKay) Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak, Ambassador of Yemen to the U.S. and Permanent Representative to the United Nations, said that after talks started between the U.S. and Iran on the deal during the Obama administration, Iran subsequently 'stepped up its military and financial support for the Houthi rebels in Yemen.' 'Nevertheless, the clear-eyed President Trump's Iran strategy, along with withdrawing from the Iran deal and demanding that Iran cease its destabilizing behavior in the region, has made clear to Iran and its proxies in Yemen that meddling in the region will not be overlooked again,' Mubarak said. He added that as a result of these 'strong and positive signals,' Iranian-backed Houthi rebels are beginning to engage more with the peace process More[78] Iran sanctions are a good start   now it's time to restore human rights to its people before it's too late[79] Jim Hanson Fox News August 7, 2018 President Trump's decision to slap what he called 'the most biting sanctions ever'[80] on Iran on Tuesday was a positive and necessary step to put pressure on the Islamic Republic's corrupt regime that deprives its citizens of basic human rights, supports terrorism, fights in support of brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, and calls for death to the U.S. and Israel. And President Trump has promised to toughen sanctions even further on Nov. 5, targeting Iran's oil industry. National Security Adviser John Bolton told Fox News on Tuesday: 'We want to see a much broader retreat by Iran from their support for international terrorism, their belligerent military activity in the Middle East, and their ballistic missile, nuclear-related programs.' The Iranian people are sick and tired of their repressive leaders who rule with an iron fist and the religious police who enforce a strict Islamist code. Protests by citizens in Iran keep getting bigger and more widespread and the regime is getting more violent[81] in trying to stop them. Citizens refuse to accept a government that can spend billions of dollars supporting terrorism, but can't feed its own citizens. Unless Iran's rulers really feel the pain of sanctions themselves, they will just apply more pain to the protesters. The Iranian economy is already a shambles and the Iranian currency is in freefall, dropping in value daily - it has lost about half its value since President Trump wisely announced in May that the U.S. would withdraw from the deeply flawed deal that was supposed to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The new U.S. economic sanctions that President Trump imposed Tuesday are specifically designed to hurt the Iranian regime's leaders, their businesses and their ability to operate Iran as a terror state. Unfortunately the Iranian people will suffer as well - that's unavoidable - but they will know their oppressive rulers are hurting as well More[82] Bring Pastor Andrew Brunson Home[83] Trump's Americans First policy prioritizes freeing our citizens held hostage abroad.

The Good Witch advises Dorothy otherwise. 'Their magic must be very powerful or she wouldn't want them so badly,' she says. The Magnitsky Act is something like those ruby red slippers. Originally passed by Congress in 2012 and named for the Russian accountant found dead in his jail cell after exposing fraud involving Russian officials, it authorized the president to block travel visas and freeze bank accounts of individual Russians deemed guilty of human-rights abuses. In 2016 it was expanded so it could be applied to other human-rights abusers anywhere in the world. We know its power the same way we know about the power of Dorothy's red slippers: The bad guys obsess about it.  Plainly Vladimir Putin hates it. His representatives bring it up to American officials or would-be American officials any chance they get. This includes the infamous election-year Trump Tower meeting Donald Trump Jr. attended in expectation of getting dirt on Hillary Clinton. Now it's the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who's howling. This past weekend he declared the Maginstky sanctions 'disrespectful.' He did so after Donald Trump ordered them slapped on two senior Erdogan officials his justice and interior ministers for their roles in the arrest and detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson, who is no longer in prison but remains under house arrest.  Unlike previous presidents, Mr. Trump has elevated the cases of Americans unfairly locked up abroad. For the moment, Mr. Erdogan is resisting. Turkey, he says, has never 'bowed our heads to such pressure' and never will. On Saturday, Mr. Erdogan announced Turkey would be retaliating with sanctions on two unnamed Trump officials, probably the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security. This gesture is all but meaningless unless Jeff Sessions or Kirstjen Nielsen have financial assets in Turkey or are itching to travel there.  We'll see whether Mr. Erdogan changes his mind, but it's encouraging to see the Magnitsky Act invoked on behalf of our fellow citizens. For today it isn't just American trade that is global, it's the American people. Though there are no hard figures on how many Americans live abroad, in 2016 the State Department reckoned it was at least nine million. Add to this the millions more Americans who travel. Simply by being abroad, American citizens are more vulnerable to attack by terrorists or arbitrary arrest and detention by rogue regimes. The best way the U.S. government can help keep them safe is to make clear through word and deed that messing with the liberty of an American carries a high price. Unfortunately, up to now apprehending and mistreating Americans has cost most nations very little. Iran is one of the worst offenders When there are no consequences for arbitrarily throwing an American in jail, it creates an incentive for rogue regimes simply to take another American hostage whenever a new bargaining chip is needed. So even as five hostages were freed after the nuke deal, Iran now has in custody Iranian-American businessman Siamak Namazi and his ailing, 81-year-old father, Baquer Namazi, a former Unicef representative. The elder Mr. Namazi was arrested when he returned to Iran to try to secure his son's release. The family is hoping Mr. Trump will make good on his campaign promise not to allow Iran to get away with such outrageous behavior More[84] Turkish Lira Falls to Fresh Lows Against U.S. Dollar[85] Drop follows central bank moves reducing its foreign-currency reserves while also lowering reserve requirement for banks Orla McCaffrey The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  The Turkish lira weakened to new record lows against the U.S. dollar Monday after the country's central bank attempted to stem the currency's decline by reducing the amount of foreign currency it holds in reserve while also lowering the reserve requirement for banks. The Turkish currency was recently down 4.7% against the U.S. currency, with the dollar buying about 5.331 lira. The lira has fallen more than 29% this year. The decisions about central bank foreign-exchange reserves and the bank-reserve requirements are the latest in a series of central bank moves that have alarmed investors, who are concerned about President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's increased influence over monetary policy. 'This move will take on a life of its own if they don't do anything in the next few days,' said Win Thin, global head of emerging-market strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman Co. The decline comes amid a 'negative emerging-market backdrop,' Mr. Thin said, so 'the best they can hope for is to stop the massive underperformance.' The Turkish currency began to plummet in April, when a rising U.S. dollar put pressure on a number of emerging-market currencies. Turkey's considerable load of dollar-denominated debt, which becomes increasingly costly to pay with a weaker currency, made the lira particularly vulnerable in the eyes of investors More[86] The Return of James Monroe[87] Latin America's crisis turns Washington's Cold War nightmare on its head. Walter Russell Mead The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  'The era of the Monroe Doctrine is over,' then-Secretary of State John Kerry told the Organization of American States in 2013. It was, like many foreign-policy declarations of the Obama years, gloriously optimistic and utterly wrong.  President James Monroe's declaration in 1823 that the U.S. would not permit the establishment of hostile powers in the Western Hemisphere has become the most famous idea in American foreign policy. The so-called Roosevelt Corollary of 1904 adds that if other nations in the Western Hemisphere default on their international obligations or endanger their neighbors through misgovernance, the U.S. has a 'police power' to intervene. Monroe's original doctrine and Roosevelt's extension have never been popular in Latin America, but U.S. presidents from Thomas Jefferson to Bill Clinton have taken an activist role in the region when they saw fit. Latin America policy has set off one firestorm after another in U.S. politics, especially during the Cold War Yet after the Cold War it seemed that U.S.-Latin American relations could relax. The fall of the Soviet Union reduced American concerns about Latin American leftism When Mr. Kerry proclaimed the death of the Monroe Doctrine in 2013, he did so on the belief that the U.S. not only faced no great-power competition in the region, but that the leading Latin American states had achieved such stability and prosperity as to make 'policing' concerns obsolete.  The situation looks less rosy now. The main problem isn't Washington's Cold War nightmare of a triumphant Latin left spreading communism in the Western Hemisphere. It's precisely the opposite: The implosion of Venezuela's leftist government is driving a regional crisis. As waves of refugees flee the socialist utopia, bad actors ranging from Vladimir Putin to Hezbollah are nosing around in the ruins of the Bolivarian republic. This weekend's alleged assassination attempt against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is a harbinger of more violence to come.  In better times, Venezuela's oil wealth allowed it to lavish aid on its neighbors. Now that aid is drying up. Choices are narrowing for countries like Nicaragua, where near-civil-war conditions exist, and Cuba. Farther north in Guatemala, where some of the world's highest homicide rates coincide with severe food shortages, asylum seekers stream toward the U.S. Washington can't ignore so much instability so close to home. The growing interest in the region by revisionist powers like China, Russia and Iran adds another dimension to American concerns. With China seeking political influence through strategic investments in Argentina and elsewhere, and Hezbollah cutting deals with Venezuelan drug lords and politicians, the U.S. has to think once again about geopolitical competition in the Western Hemisphere  More[88] Sen. Rand Paul Invites Russian Lawmakers to Washington[89] Mr. Paul said Russia shouldn't be considered a friend of the U.S. but the two nations had shared interests Thomas Grove The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  MOSCOW Sen. Rand Paul met with Russian lawmakers Monday and invited them to Washington as part of a growing outreach to the Kremlin, days after a bipartisan group of U.S. senators proposed tightening sanctions against Russia [90]over findings of election interference. 'Russia shouldn't be considered our friend, but we have certain shared interests regarding Syria, terrorism and energy,' said Mr. Paul (R., Ky.) after meeting with lawmakers from the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament. The meetings marked the second U.S. delegation to Moscow led by a Republican congressman this summer and gave Russian officials a chance to promote their position on a number of issues that strain already tense relations between Washington and Moscow, from interference in elections to cyber security. 'We will continue this dialogue,' Mr. Paul said on Russian state television, adding that a visit would likely happen by the end of the year. Following President Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki[91], the U.S. president invited his Russian counterpart to Washington, though the trip has been pushed back from the fall[92] to sometime next year. A previous Republican delegation to Moscow last month included Sen. Richard Shelby, Sen. John Kennedy and Rep. Kay Granger. Russian state television, which characterizes most U.S. lawmakers as 'the Washington establishment' and 'anti-Russian,' praised Mr. Paul as an independent thinker in Congress. The senator had supported the summit between Messrs. Trump and Putin and called for better relations between Washington and Moscow. Moscow is now watching for signals that progress can be made to improve relations, even as U.S. lawmakers look to harden punitive measures against Russia[93] and consider imposing sanctions on Russian debt and energy projects. While few in Moscow believe Mr. Trump can deliver on promises to reset the relationship, Russian officials are still hopeful there can be individual gains. Russia analysts say the Kremlin is watching the course of the talks between officials from the two countries to see where gains can be made. 'The visit to Russia at this important juncture, is received as a positive step that for now could have an effect on promoting dialogue,' said Victor Olevich of the Center for Actual Politics, a Moscow-based independent research center. Talks covered subjects including the risk of a military accident in Syria where both U.S. and Russian forces operate and North Korea More[94] A Moment of Honesty From Chuck Schumer[95] He admits his mind is made up on Kavanaugh. That means his document demands are in bad faith. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  Americans trust politicians about as much as they trust used-car salesmen, and it's understandable that voters view what my colleagues and I say and do through a skeptical lens. But elected officials can also exhibit moments of exceeding honesty. On July 10, the morning after President Trump nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he'd oppose the nomination 'with everything I've got.' If the weeks since are any indicator, we should believe him. Immediately after news broke that Justice Anthony Kennedy was retiring, Democrats demanded that the president wait until the next Congress to appoint a replacement. They cited the 'Biden rule,' a precedent based on then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joe Biden's 1992 pronouncement that his committee would wait until after the heated presidential election season to consider any Supreme Court nomination. This year is a midterm election year, not a presidential one. Most Democrats have abandoned the talking point, but they haven't abandoned the goal of delaying the process. Presumably, Mr. Schumer announced that he would oppose Judge Kavanaugh's nomination before he read the judge's 307 written opinions and the many other opinions he joined. Certainly, it was before he reviewed the more than 17,000 pages Judge Kavanaugh provided to the committee in response to our bipartisan questionnaire and an estimated one million pages of documents the committee has requested from the Bush White House, where Judge Kavanaugh once worked.  It stands to reason that Senator Schumer wasn't too concerned about Judge Kavanaugh's record before he announced his opposition. Why is it so important to Senator Schumer now? Democratic leaders are demanding access to every page from every email and every paper record from every one of the hundreds of White House aides who came and went during the entire eight years of President Bush's time in office. This includes records that merely mention Judge Kavanaugh's name and records he's never seen. That is not reasonable Their objective is to delay the confirmation process until after the midterm elections, with the hope of taking control of the Senate. My Democratic counterpart on the Judiciary Committee's hometown newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle, put it quite succinctly: 'Feinstein, other Senate Dems have plan on Brett Kavanaugh nomination: Stall.'  So recent complaints from Mr. Schumer and other Democrats about the scope of records requests ring hollow, especially coming from senators who have already declared their opposition to Judge Kavanaugh and initially refused even to meet with him. Democrats' arguments have changed, but their goal hasn't. First, it was a misrepresentation of the Biden rule whose existence they denied in 2016. Now, it's a manufactured document fight. Both arguments have been made with the aim of stalling the confirmation process until after midterms More[96] A good guy with a gun has saved many lives in Florida - something the media rarely report[97] John R. Lott Fox News August 7, 2018 Thankfully, a heroic citizen with a permit to legally carry a concealed handgun was able to save countless lives in Florida Saturday when he shot a gunman[98] who opened fire on a back-to-school event attended by over 150 students at a park in Titusville, Florida. The media rarely give national news coverage to incidents like this, but responsible gun owners have stepped forward in this way many times before to save lives. In fact, concealed handgun permit holders have prevented dozens[99] of mass public shootings just in recent years, while receiving only brief mentions in local news coverage.  Fortunately, only the attacker was injured in Titusville. The gun permit holder shot him in the head to keep the attacker from shooting any children and adults in the park. Neither the permit holder nor the attacker have been identified so far by police. The attacker suffered life-threatening injuries and remains hospitalized. The presence of an armed 'good guy' prevented the Titusville shooting from turning into a tragedy like school shooting in Parkland, Florida in February. Law enforcement officers cannot be everywhere, so the presence of armed citizens is vital to provide an instant response to attackers. 'Based on the information that we've gathered,' said[100] Titusville Police Sgt. William Amos,\u00a0'this person stepped in and saved a lot of people's lives.' The police responded within minutes, but the gun permit holder was right there the moment the attack started, enabling him to stop the attacker almost immediately. Law enforcement officers cannot be everywhere, so the presence of armed citizens is vital to provide an instant response to attackers More[101] Arab Leaders Need to Step Up to Avert War in Gaza[102] Hamas refuses to disarm, but pressure from outside could help strengthen the Palestinian Authority.  If history has taught us anything it is that the Islamic world will never be at peace Grievances from 1400 years ago, such as the slaughter of Husain and his family[103] which started the rift between Sunnis and Shiites, feel as fresh as if they happened yesterday In fact, a desire for revenge for past grievances[104] is one of the major driving forces of Islamic culture In their honor-based society[105], they can never forget, and they can never forgive  In their minds, to do so would be an injustice, and a dishonor that indicates weakness, inviting more abuse In fact, the only thing that unites all Muslims is a desire to avenge the insultthat the infidel West has inflicted on them by being more successful They view infidel success as a flagrant insult to Allah himself! So rather than trying to solve the Middle East's problems by trying to do things like end the hatred between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority it would be smarter to strategize on how to live with the Middle East's problems and minimize their impact on the West From that perspective, keeping Muslims turned against each other instead of forming a unified force against us is a wise strategy Especially when we minimize immigration from the Islamic world We have seen war before in Gaza, and we will surely see it again There is nothing anyone can do to prevent it Instead of trying to fix the Middle East, which we cannot do because Islamists don't respect us Infidels our number one priority should be isolate it and make the Middle East irrelevant Dave David Makovsky and Ghaith al-Omari The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  Diplomatic efforts continue to reach a cease-fire and end the current clashes between Israel and the Palestinians in Gaza. The hope is to avert what would be the fourth Israel-Hamas war in the past 10 years. Even if a cease-fire is reached, the resumption of significant international aid to Gaza will probably require a return of the Palestinian Authority, which was violently expelled by Hamas in 2007. Yahya al-Sinwar, who has been the leader of Hamas in Gaza since 2017, has said he would like the PA to come back. The catch? He wants Hamas to keep its weapons. The Palestinian Authority's President Mahmout Abbas sees a trap. He fears the PA will be stuck with all of the responsibility in Gaza while Hamas retains all of the authority - as with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Thus, he has been willing to call publicly on Hamas to surrender its weapons. An official with the Israel Defense Forces tells us Mr. Abbas has slashed the monthly funds sent to Gaza from $112 million to $84 million. This has generated some backlash, including rare demonstratiions in the West Bank city of Ramallah urging Mr. Abbas to transfer more money. The situationin Gaza is bleak. The territory gets only about four hours of electricity a day, and its economy hardly functions. United Nations officials tell us Gazans earn less than $3.50 a day on average, one-third of the West Bank wages. Israel, which sees Hamas as sworn to its destruction and has had to defend against frequent rocket fire on its cities, maintains many restrictions on Gaza. Egypt does as well, given that Hamas is part of the banned Muslim Brotherhood network and has ties to jihadists operating in Sinai. Egypt has been spearheading the effort to bring the Palestinian Authority back to Gaza. Having concluded that the immediate disarmament of Hamas is unrealistic, Cairo is focused on restoring the PA as the legitimate address for substantial aid, hoping that will alter the political dynamic. Mr. Abbas is abysmally unpopular in Gaza because residents believe he is indifferent to their suffering, but returning at the head of aid convoys could change that perception. Once sentiments turns in his favor, Egypt believes Mr. Abbas may have greater success in calling for disarmament  More[106] Saudi Arabia's Spat With Canada Risks Backlash From Investors[107]  Diplomatic dispute will also affect Saudi students currently in Canada The Crown Prince wants to dictate Saudi Arabia into being a modern state As with all absolute rulers, he tolerates no criticism, and punishes dissenters severely His approach may be summarized as, 'The beatings will continue until morale improves'  The Crown Prince's vast dictatorial powers have separated him from reality and turned him into an idiot Dave Margherita Stancati The Wall Street Journal Aug. 6, 2018  Saudi Arabia's diplomatic rupture with Canada risks complicating the kingdom's efforts to woo foreign investors as it seeks to overhaul its economy. Saudi Arabia on Monday declared Canada's ambassador persona non grata, and gave him 24 hours to leave the country[108]. The decision to expel the Canadian ambassador, Dennis Horak, came after Canada's Foreign Ministry criticized Saudi Arabia for arresting human-rights activists.  In pushing back against what it described as an unacceptable attempt by Canada to interfere in its domestic affairs, the Saudi Foreign Ministry announced it 'will put on hold all new business and investment transactions with Canada.' The diplomatic spat with Canada will also affect 7,000 Saudi students who are currently in Canada on government-sponsored scholarships. The spokesman for Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Education, Mubarak al-Osaimi, on Monday said that the kingdom would stop funding scholarships and training programs in Canada, and that it would help transfer Saudis affected by the decision to other countries. Separately, Saudia airlines, the national carrier, announced it would suspend flights to Canada from Aug. 13.  Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Monday the government was 'deeply concerned' by Saudi Arabia's move to expel Canada's ambassador on the basis of statements 'in defence of human-rights activists detained in the kingdom.' At a press conference in Vancouver, she said officials were waiting to hear from Saudi Arabia about how the relationship between Canada and the kingdom unfolds given this diplomatic row. 'We stand by what we have said,' she said. 'We will always speak up for human rights and women's rights.' The eruption in tensions between allies risks fueling concerns among investors during a tumultuous period of change for the kingdom.  Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has launched a grand reform plan, called Vision 2030, that aims to transform the kingdom from a staunchly conservative petrostate to a more socially liberal country less dependent on oil. But Prince Mohammed has also made it clear he won't brook outside criticism of key decisions a stance that analysts say could threaten capital flows that Saudi Arabia needs for its overhaul. 'Branding Saudi Arabia as an attractive destination for investment and trade is one of the underlying assumptions of Saudi Vision 2030,' said Thomas Juneau, an assistant professor and Middle East expert at the University of Ottawa. 'Impulsive foreign-policy decisions like this have the exact opposite effect.' More[109] Pakistani Christian Brutally Beaten over Arm Wrestling Match[110] International Christian Concern 08/07/2018  On August 2, Vishal Masih, an 18-year-old Pakistani Christian, was severely beaten by a group of Muslims after winning an arm wrestling match in Nabipur village. Located in Sheikhupura District, 27 miles away from Lahore, Nabipur has become the latest site of religiously motivated violence in Pakistan. Waris Masih, Vishal's cousin, described the violent incident to International Christian Concern (ICC) days after it occurred. A day before the incident, Vishal was reportedly involved in an arm wrestling match with a Muslim boy who belongs to the influential family of Wirk Jutt. Vishal defeated the Muslim boy several times which infuriated his opponent. During the match, the Muslim opponent began to verbally abuse Vishal and insulted the Christian community as a whole, saying, 'How could a man of a dirty community defeat me?' He continued, 'A Choora (Untouchable) defeats a Muslim is unbearable, I will teach him a lesson.' Following the match, while Vishal was on his way home, a gang of over a dozen young Muslims followed him and attacked. The gang brutally beat Vishal, attacked his family's house, and beat his family members. Local elders tried to intervene and resolve the issue, but, after a short period of time, another gang led by Khalaq Wirk, Hassnain Wirk, and Mehboob Alam assaulted Vishal again. Waris told ICC that although Vishal survived the attack, it was as if they left him for dead. 'The Christian community is already living in a constant fear and these sorts of incidents develop insecurity and detachment from this Islamic country or society which is sad to note.' The gang then kidnapped the severely injured Vishal, locked him in a room at their residence, where they repeatedly beat him for the third time. After the assaults, Vishal was reportedly admitted to a hospital. His family is being pressured by influential Muslims to withdraw the case, otherwise they could be in more danger More[111] The post FREEDOM UPDATE: 6 Questions that Tech Giants Refuse to Answer about InfoWars Ban: Rep.

Islamists, hand-in-hand with the political left, are continuing to do all they can to shut our event down. They have even started to circulate a petition on Change.org asking Hyatt to cancel our event and ban ACT for America from their hotel property. This is what these groups always do: When they don't have any argument that fits their narrative, they work to silence and shut down those with whom they disagree - usually by resorting to ugly and false name-calling. </p><p>You see, this isn't about Hyatt hosting our national conference, this is an attempt by the Islamist left to prevent our members from speaking with their elected officials on Capitol Hill. All of our conference attendees will be meeting with their Members of Congress on Wednesday, September 5th and they want to stop it. They want to silence our voice. We won't let that happen and we hope you won't either. This is why I need you to join me in Washington, DC in just 1 week to stand up and fight back against the radical leftist forces working to undermine our republic. Remember, this is going to be a star-studded event with the likes of Charlie Kirk, LTC Allen West, Tomi Lahren and myself all speaking! If you are unable to attend the entire National Conference (September 4th-5th) I encourage you to join us at our 'Back the Blue: A Night to Honor Our Nation's Law Enforcement Dinner Gala' on the night of September 5th. Click below for more information![2] There has never been a more important time to attend our National Conference and meet with your local elected officials. Our country's safety and security is at stake - I hope you will find a way to join me in Washington, DC. I look forward to seeing you there! Always Devoted, Brigitte Gabriel Founder ...airman ACT for America Someone Tell Carl Bernstein the Cover-Up Is Worse than the Crime[3] John Nolte Breitbart News 28 Aug 2018  CNN's Carl Bernstein, the man made co-famous through his historic Watergate reporting, lied to us \u2014 to all of us. And he is now engaged in a cover up to protect this lie. I am not even talking about his fake news about the Trump Tower meeting, which I will get to in a bit \u2014 I am talking about a flat-out, provable lie. In a July 27 piece of very fake news Bernstein co-wrote with CNN anchor (and former Obama official) Jim Sciutto and researcher Marshall Cohen, Bernstein declaratively informs us[4], 'Contacted by CNN, one of Cohen's attorneys, Lanny Davis, declined to comment.' That statement is a lie, a proven lie, a bald-faced lie, because we now know for a fact[5] that Lanny Davis did NOT decline to comment. What's more, Davis was a CNN source for that steaming pile of very fake news. In other words the anti-Trump Carl Bernstein did not only spread fake news, the anti-Trump Carl Bernstein published a straight-up lie in his fake news, reported something he knew was not true. Let's back up a bit On July 27, Bernstein and his two CNN co-conspirators dropped the bombshell that President Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, would testify that then-candidate Trump knew in advance about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. If true, this of course would be a very big deal because the president has denied any foreknowledge of the meeting involving his son Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner, various campaign officials, and some Russians (one of whom has deep ties tohigh-level Democrats[6]with names that rhyme with Mobama, Fillary, and Heinz Ketchup). Nevertheless, even to those of us who see the Trump Tower story as the golden snipe in the snipe hunt that is the Russian collusion hoax, Trump lying about such a thing would still be a pretty big deal. And Bernstein and Co. were certain Trump lied, and Bernstein wanted you to be certain, because Bernstein now had Trump right where he wanted him aftersources-sources-sources with knowledge told Berstein By Cohen's account, Trump approved going ahead with the meeting with the Russians, according to sources. And then Bernstein's sources-sources-sources with knowledge told Bernstein Cohen is willing to make that assertion to special counsel Robert Mueller, the sources said.

More[8] Another Very Fake News Scandal Engulfs CNN with Fake Michael Cohen Russia Story[9] Apologies for the length This case is a little complex, but it is absolutely essential that you understand what happened CNN got caught in a flat out lie, but it is a well-concealed flat out lie This is how CNN operates, and it is important for us to be able to point this out Dave Matthew Boyle Breitbart News 27 Aug 2018 Washington, D.C. - Another very fake news scandal has engulfed CNN as the network's credibility crisis reaches another fever pitch just over a year after three senior network staffers were forced to resign in disgrace over a similar scandal. This time, though, famed Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein is at the center of the scandal, and the network for now is dug in despite deep criticism from across the political and ideological spectrum as far-ranging as Breitbart News and Daily Caller among others on one side, and the Associated Press, Washington Post, BuzzFeed, and more on the other. It all began on July 27 when CNN's Bernstein shared a byline with former Barack Obama administration official[10]and chief CNN national security correspondent Jim Sciutto, along with CNN researcher and producer Marshall Cohen, with the headline: 'Cohen claims Trump knew in advance of 2016 Trump Tower meeting.' The fact that Bernstein-who along with Bob Woodward broke and chronicled the Watergate scandal that led to the eventual resignation of Richard Nixon from the presidency-was on the byline was significant, as it threw the weight and heft of his personal credibility behind the network's story. In the piece, Bernstein, Sciutto, and Cohen used anonymous 'sources' to claim that President Donald Trump's now former personal attorney Michael Cohen was willing to undercut President Trump's claims about the famed 2016 Trump Tower meeting that the president's son Donald Trump, Jr., his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort had with a Russian attorney with links to the Kremlin. 'Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, claims that then-candidate Trump knew in advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower in which Russians were expected to offer his campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton, sources with knowledge tell CNN,' Bernstein, Sciutto, and Cohen wrote. 'Cohen is willing to make that assertion to special counsel Robert Mueller, the sources said.' In the second paragraph of the CNN piece, the famed Watergate reporter, along with the former Obama official and CNN researcher, wrote about the stakes at play here: 'Cohen's claim would contradict repeated denials by Trump, Donald Trump Jr., their lawyers and other administration officials who have said that the President knew nothing about the Trump Tower meeting until he was approached about it by The New York Times in July 2017.' The third paragraph goes on to allege even more against the president: 'Cohen alleges that he was present, along with several others, when Trump was informed of the Russians' offer by Trump Jr. By Cohen's account, Trump approved going ahead with the meeting with the Russians, according to sources.' The fourth paragraph-again citing anonymous 'sources'-claims that Cohen did not have any evidence like 'audio recordings' to back up the claims attributed to the anonymous sources throughout the CNN article. But then the fifth paragraph makes yet another astounding claim: In Cohen's congressional testimony, per these anonymous CNN 'sources,' Cohen did not state in testimony before Congress that Trump himself had 'advance knowledge' of the Russia Trump Tower meeting. 'Cohen privately testified last yearto two Congressional committees investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election,' Bernstein, Sciutto, and Cohen wrote. 'A source familiar with Cohen's House testimony said he did not testify that Trump had advance knowledge. Cohen's claims weren't mentioned in separate reports issued by Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee.' The CNN piece goes on in the next paragraph to note that Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis, 'declined to comment' for the article. It was revealed later by Davis himself that was not true-Davis was in fact an anonymous source for this CNN piece, as Davis admitted on Monday evening. But more importantly, the entire thesis of the entire story is entirely fake news-completely untrue\u2014as revealed more than a week ago by Axios' Jonathan Swan CNN's Bernstein, Sciutto, and Cohen had what would have been a major story if true: That not only was Michael Cohen turning on Trump on those payments to McDougal and Daniels. but that Cohen was willing and going to testify against the president on a core component of Mueller's probe. Mueller has yet to nail down anything related to the actual mandate of his investigation: He has only gotten people on unrelated crimes, like in Manafort's case. So, when CNN reported this, it was a major deal-because it would have justified the continued existence of the Special Counsel's office despite a complete lack more than a year into this investigation since President Trump fired now former FBI director James Comey of any evidence at the center of the mandate of the probe. Fast forward nearly a month after the CNN story to Aug. 23. It was on Aug. 23 that Axios' Swan reported, citing sworn testimony Michael Cohen gave to various congressional committees under oath behind closed doors, that Cohen does not know if Trump knew about the Russia meeting in Trump Tower before it happened. 'Exclusive: Michael Cohen told Congress he doesn't know if Trump knew about Russia meeting,' Swan's headline read. 'Michael Cohen told lawmakers last year, in sworn testimony, that hedidn'tknow whether then-candidate Donald Trump had foreknowledge of the 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians, three sources with knowledge of Cohen's testimony tell Axios,' Swan's piece's lead sentence reads. In Swan's story, Cohen's attorney Lanny Davis-infamous in his own right due to his time in the administration of former President Bill Clinton-went on the record to clarify that Cohen still does not know if Trump knew about the meeting in advance: And Cohenstilldoesn't know whether Trump knew about the infamous meeting, according to Cohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis. 'Nothing has changed,' he told Axios.Newsreportslast month said Cohen was willing to assert to special counsel Robert Mueller that Trumpdidknow about the meeting in advance. Davis, when asked by Swan why he did not shoot down the original misreporting by CNN, claimed he and Cohen were 'not the source.' 'It was painful,' Davis said. 'We were not the source, we could not confirm, and we could not correct. We had to be silent because of the sensitivity needed in the middle of a criminal investigation.' This becomes extraordinarily important later as it relates to Davis' credibility, as he himself later admitted he was in fact a source for the CNN story. When Axios' piece was published, Breitbart News contacted CNN spokeswomen Emily Kuhn and Lauren Pratapas-two women who have made their bones defending the network's fake news shenanigans-and asked if the network stood by the story. Breitbart News also asked Kuhn and Pratapas if the network stood by Bernstein, Sciutto, and Cohen, the three listed on the byline, and whether there would be any consequences whatsoever for the trio caught peddling fake news. Kuhn and Pratapas did not respond. Then, on Aug. 26, under the bylines of Tom Hamburger and Rosalind Helderman, Bernstein's former newspaper the Washington Post published its own investigation[11] of the matter under this headline: 'Attorney for Michael Cohen backs away from confidence that Cohen has information about Trump's knowledge on Russian efforts.' In the Post story, which shreds its own alumnus' credibility, a CNN spokeswoman-anonymously-claims the network stands by its story: 'We stand by our story, and are confident in our reporting of it.' In the wake of this story in the Washington Post, and several days of reporting on the matter where several current and former CNN officials expressed to Breitbart News unease with the network's handling of this matter, Breitbart News re-approached Kuhn and Pratapas on Monday morning and asked for comment again on this matter. Breitbart News also asked Kuhn and Pratapas if Bernstein and Sciutto would be made available for interviews on their handling of this story, and for reaction to the fact that multiple CNN employees both current and former were disturbed with how this has been handled and how the network has lost even more credibility as a result. 'This only plays into Trump's hands,' one CNN reporter, who requested anonymity, told Breitbart News. 'We should have retracted the piece and apologized and moved on. But management's decision to dig in hurts our credibility. 'They are handling this differently than they would other stories because Carl is on the byline,' a CNN anchor, who also requested anonymity, told Breitbart News, referencing the famed Watergate reporter.

'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on why CNN is standing by a Michael Cohen story that his lawyer, Lanny Davis, says is false. CNN Dodging 'Serious Ethical and Journalistic Questions' About Lanny Davis Fake News Scandal[14] Trump was right after allagain CNN really is 'very fake news' They didn't just step in it They danced in it with a 40-minute TV expos Dave Matthew Boyle Breitbart News 28 Aug 2018 Washington, D.C. - CNN is under even more scrutiny on Tuesday morning as The Intercept's Glenn Greenwald unloaded a major story[15] about the network's public relations officials-at the direction, clearly, of management-and is refusing to be transparent about a fake news scandal that has engulfed the network and tarnished one of journalism's all-time great leaders, Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame. In an explosive piece laying out the landscape of an ethical minefield through which CNN is navigating poorly, Greenwald in the headline of the story accuses CNN of lying to its audience in a piece authored by Bernstein; former Barack Obama administration official and CNN chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto, and CNN researcher Marshall Cohen: 'CNN, Credibly Accused of Lying to its Audience About a Key Claim in its Blockbuster Cohen Story, Refuses to Comment.' As Breitbart News has reported[16], the entire core of the piece from July from Bernstein, Sciutto, and Cohen is entirely fake news. CNN reported, using anonymous sources, that Michael Cohen-President Trump's former personal attorney who just pleaded guilty to a number of charges brought by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York-was willing to testify that President Trump knew in advance of a summer 2016 meeting between several senior Trump officials and a Russian attorney with Kremlin links. Cohen's own attorney, Lanny Davis, later undercut that narrative, publicly claiming on the record nearly a month later that it was not true. Then Davis admitted he was a source for the CNN story-and that he had provided inaccurate information to the network. That is where Greenwald zones in on his story, raising 'serious ethical and journalistic questions' about CNN's 'conduct' in handling this. While CNN refuses to answer whether it has other sources other than Davis to back up its claim-it appears to not have them-Greenwald writes that CNN's claim in the original article about which Davis declined to comment, when he was, in fact, a source for the story on an anonymous basis, is extraordinarily troubling. Here's how Greenwald puts it: 'Nonetheless,it's possible that other sourcesdid tell CNN that Cohen does have this information and intends to share it with Mueller, and that Cohen's own lawyer is either unaware of this or is lying about it. It's not likely, obviously, but it's theoretically possible. Unfortunately, CNN refuses to tell us anything about what it itself said was a 'blockbuster' story, so it's impossible to know. But there's an entirely separate, and more significant, question about CNN's behavior here; namely, thevery specific claim they made about their sourcing for that blockbuster story.Last night, BuzzFeedreported[17]that Davisexplicitly confessed that he was one of the anonymous sources for CNN's July 26 story, just as he was for the stories from the Washington Post and the New York Post. Last week,CNN put Davison the airwith Anderson Cooper[18]to deny that he was the source for that CNN story - a denial Cooper did not contest - but Davis now admits he was one of CNN's sources, if not their main source. Yet remarkably, CNN, in its July 26story,specificaly claimed that Davisrefused to talk to CNNabout the story or provide any comment whatsoever.' What's more, Greenwald says, this means only one of two things can be true: Either Davis is lying to BuzzFeed when he claims he was the anonymous source for the CNN piece or, perhaps more likely, 'CNN deliberately lied to its audience about Davis refusing to comment on the story when, in fact, Davis was one of the anonymous sources on which the CNN report depended, and CNN claimed Davis refused to comment in order to hide Davis' identity as one of their anonymous sources.' 'How can CNN possibly justify refusing to address these questions, and refrain from informing the public about these critical matters on a story that they themselves hyped for days as a 'blockbuster,' one of the most significant stories yet in the Trump/Russia saga?' Greenwald wrote. 'Questions about this massive discrepancy from the Intercept to Stelter have not been answered, nor has CNN addressed this on air or with any other media outlets who have inquired. [Oliver] Darcy told the Intercept he was not aware of sourcing issues on the story and suggested inquiries be directed to CNN's Public Relations department.' Greenwald goes on to write that if CNN did, in fact, lie about Davis refusing to comment when he was an anonymous source for the piece, which appears to be the case, this is 'obviously a major journalism scandal.' Greenwald adds: 'If, by contrast, Davis - who has been treated by the U.S. media as a reliable source despite decades of lying (and who leveraged that treatment to raisemore than $150,000 in a GoFundMe 'Truth Fund' campaignfor Cohen to pay Davis)- is lying about having spoken to CNN about the July 26 report, that is also a major story.' The piece goes on to explain that despite CNN's being the only place that can truly inform the public, the network is silent on this matter. 'Yet CNN, the only ones with the ability to inform the public about what happened here, is silent,' Greenwald writes. 'This despite the incomparable importance which CNN breathlessly told its viewers the story carried.' Greenwald then includes a video whereby CNN 'breathlessly' pushed this fake story in July The video and more[19] CNN Ratings Nosedive Double Digits in August[20] What is striking about this news is that CNN supposedly is a for-profit company and yet its 'very fake news' drives viewers away I myself am a former CNN viewer, who smelled something fishy all the way back in 2003, during its coverage of the invasion of Iraq CNN is manufacturing fake news even though it drives away viewers Why would they do that?

Nielsen Media Research reports that perennial ratings loser CNN had a terrible August despite a banner news month, reports [23]the Hill. While Fox News notched its 200th consecutive month at number one in cable news and gained in primetime viewers (when compared to this same month last year), CNN lost -12 percent of its primetime viewers and a whopping -15 percent of total day viewers. Fox News averaged 1.3 million total day viewers (down -4 percent) and an incredible 2.3 million primetime viewers (up +4 percent). MSNBC averaged 1.04 million total day numbers (down -4 percent) and 1.845 million primetime viewers (up +1 percent). CNN, however, is once again well behind its competition with just 705K total day viewers (down -15 percent) and 1.05 million primetime viewers (down -12 percent), which averages to less than half of Fox's primetime viewers More[24] Rep.

That is like saying we aregoing to incriminate on one handand be the jury on the other. It just doesn't work that way.' The video[26] Gregg Jarrett: The scheme from Bruce Ohr and Comey's confederates to clear Clinton, damage Trump[27] Gregg Jarrett Fox News August 28, 2018 Director James Comey knew the FBI was incorruptible. This is precisely why he seized control of the investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's email practices covering her time as secretary of state, instead of allowing the FBI field office to conduct the probe. By commandeering control of the investigation, Comey and his confederates could twist the facts and contort the law to dictate the outcome they desired. Clinton was the beneficiary of what FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe reportedly described as the 'HQ special.' The same is true of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. The very people who cleared Clinton of crimes - despite strong evidence that she broke the law - also assumed unfettered authority over the so-called 'collusion' investigation to determine if Donald Trump's presidential campaign worked with Russia to help Trump become president. Bereft of probable cause and credible evidence, they nevertheless pursued Trump in a probe designed to damage his candidacy - and later to destroy his presidency in an effort to overturn the results of the 2016 presidential election. It was not just Comey and his abettors at the FBI who conjured this illicit scheme. There were others outside the walls of the J. Edgar Hoover Building who were both instrumental and complicit. Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee furnished the necessary funds. Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS acted as the facilitator. And ex-British spy Christopher Steele provided the fabricated 'dossier' that served as a pretext for launching the investigation of Trump. This brings us to the steps of the Justice Department and a high-ranking official who was essential to the scheme. Bruce Ohr Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr bypassed his superiors at the Justice Department and worked covertly with Steele to exploit what became known as the 'Steele dossier.' Sixty-three pages of texts, emails and handwritten notes show extensive contacts between Ohr and Steele both before and after the election. Even after Steele was fired by the FBI for lying about his contacts with reporters, Ohr maintained intensive communications with Steele. The former British spy kept feeding his bogus information while simultaneously fretting to Ohr that his actions might be 'exposed.'

One of those meetings with Fusion GPS took place just days after the Trump Tower meeting, the testimony reveals. Also, Edward Lieberman met with one Russian participant the same day of the Trump Tower meeting, according to separate testimony. Besides working for Hillary Clinton, Lieberman's late wife, Evelyn, also served as Bill Clinton's deputy chief of staff, and famously transferred Monica Lewinsky out of the White House to the Defense Department. Edward Lieberman himself has been described as working within the orbit of the Clintons. He previously served[30] as legal counsel and advisor to the Albright Group LLC, which was founded by Madeleine K. Albright, who served as Bill Clinton's Secretary of State and who would later serve as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign. Lieberman's expertise, listed on his former Albright Group bio[31], includes 'multi-billion dollar privatizations of oil and gas assets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Russia.' The Russia collusion conspiracy was sparked by the dossier produced by Fusion GPS, which was paid for its anti-Trump work by Trump's primary political opponents, namely Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie law firm. In previous testimony,[32] Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson described having several dinners with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who countered the Magnitsky Act which sanctions Russian officials accused of involvement in the death of a Russian tax accountant. All participants at the Trump Tower meeting generally agree the confab, in which Veselnitskaya did most of the talking, focused largely on the Magnitsky Act as well as talk about a Russian tax evasion scheme and alleged connections to the Democratic National Committee. Donald Trump Jr. previously explained[33] that he took the meeting thinking it was about 'opposition research' on Hillary Clinton and was disappointed that it wasn't More[34] Google Responds to Trump: 'No Political Bias in Google Search'[35] Lucas Nolan Breitbart News 28 Aug 2018  Tech giant Google has denied President Trump's recent assertions that Google purposefully manipulates search results with a political bias. President Trump claimed[36] in a series of tweets today that tech giant Google purposefully alters Google search results to show negative articles about Trump. In his tweets, Trump called the system 'rigged' and stated that Google and other tech companies were suppressing the voices of Conservatives and hiding positive news relating to the Trump administration. Google search results for 'Trump News' shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me ...hers, so that almost all stories ...ws is BAD.

This is a very serious situation-will be addressed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2018[38] Google has since responded to President Trump stating that their search results are not politically biased, but they are actively working to improve their search program: 'When users type queries into the Google Search bar, our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds. Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology. Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users' queries. We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.' However, Google's claims that it is politically unbiased have been disproved by Dr. Robert Epstein of the American Institute for Behavioral Research (AIBRT). In a series of tests, Epstein and his team examined Google's search feature[39] and performed a number of tests in order to gain a greater insight into the possible bias that the search engine may display. Epstein initially noted discrepancies in search results for Hillary Clinton: 'It is somewhat difficult to get the Google search bar to suggest negative searches related to Mrs. Clinton or to make any Clinton-related suggestions when one types a negative search term. Bing and Yahoo, on the other hand, often show a number of negative suggestions in response to the same search terms. Bing and Yahoo seem to be showing us what people are actually searching for; Google is showing us something else \u2014 but what, and for what purpose? As for Google Trends, as Lieberman reported, Google indeed withholds negative search terms for Mrs. Clinton even when such terms show high popularity in Trends. We have also found that Google often suggests positive search terms for Mrs. Clinton even when such terms are nearly invisible in Trends. The widely held belief, reinforced by Google's own documentation, that Google's search suggestions are based on 'what other people are searching for' seems to be untrue in many instances. Google tries toexplain away such findings bysaying its search bar is programmed toavoid suggesting searches that portray people ina negative light. As far aswe can tell, this claim is false; Google suppresses negative suggestions selectively, not acrossthe board. It is easy toget autocomplete tosuggest negative searches related toprominent people, one ofwhom happens tobe Mrs. Clinton's opponent.' Epstein provided the following screenshots as examples of Google's search bias in comparison to other search engines More[40] Ann Coulter Says Google Is Shadow Banning Her[41]: On Tuesday, President Trump accused Google of suppressing positive stories about him.

The mainstream media may have formed a defensive barrier around Google in response to the President, but there are many examples of Google expressing its political bias in ways both big and small. Breitbart Tech has collected ten popular examples of Google's left-wing bias in action. 1. When the company fired James Damore. Former Google engineer was fired for expressing mild criticism of Google's far-left diversity policies and political monoculture. His arguments wouldn't have been out of place in a David Brooks column or a Jonathan Haidt lecture. Despite the mildness of his arguments \u2014 which were more liberal centrist than conservative \u2014 radical leftists at the company succeeded in getting him fired, after maliciously leaking his viewpoint diversity manifesto to the press 2. When the company failed to condemn Antifa 3. When then-CEO Eric Schmidt wanted to be 'head outside adviser' to the Clinton campaign 4. When Schmidt set up a grassroots organization to put a second Clinton in the White House 5. When Google rigged its search suggestions in favor of Hillary Clinton in 2016. A video from tech news site SourceFed in 2016 reported[50] that negative search terms for Hillary Clinton did not autocomplete, despite the fact that those terms (like 'Hillary Clinton criminal') were popular, and autocompleted just fine on Bing and Yahoo 6. When its senior management broke down in tears after Trump's election win. Yes, this actually happened. A Google insider gave Breitbart News this bit of information[51] (and some other internal horror stories) back in 2017. 7. When Google employees spoke out en masse about the company's oppressive political monoculture 8. When it decided to boost Wikipedia, an encyclopedia of far-left fake news, in its search results.When you conduct a Google search, chances are you'll see a Wikipedia link at the top of your results, or information from Wikipedia in the 'knowledge panel' that appears on the right-hand side of some Google searches. The online encyclopedia is heavily favored in Google search results. The online encyclopedia is also infamous for its unreliability and far-left bias. Editors on the site added[52] ICE detention centers to a Wikipedia article on 'concentration camps.' They added[53] Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson to a list of 'neo-Nazi conspiracy theorists.' They even created an article dedicated solely to criticism of the President's handshake style, and featured it on Wikipedia's front page[54]. This is the 'encyclopedia' that Google relies on for many of its top search results. 9. When it plowed $300 million into propping up the anti-Trump legacy media. This is an initiative of Google News spread across the company's services and sister companies, including YouTube[55]. Typically of recent big tech power-grabs, the initiative was presented to the public as an effort to combat 'misinformation' online.

'You can't do it.' The president said that he had heard 'thousands' of censorship complaints from people and repeated that it was 'not fair.' He added that censorship was a 'serious charge' against the tech companies. 'I think that Google and Twitter and Facebook, they are really treading on very, very troubled territory and they have to be careful,' he said. 'It is not fair to large portions of the population.'

However, that hasn't stopped Immigration and Customs Enforcement from doing its job \u2014 even if that means arresting illegal immigrants in courtrooms. What's going on? ICE agents entered Sacramento Superior Court earlier this month to arrest an immigrant, Yovanny Ontiveros-Cebreros, according to his lawyer, Charles Pacheco Judge Lawrence Brown initially stepped in to prevent the arrest, Pacheco said. But after spending time in his judicial chambers, Brown allowed ICE agents to complete their job, telling Pacheco the agents had a warrant for his client's arrest Brown told the Bee that judges do not prevent law enforcement agencies from making lawful arrests. 'Remanding on an outstanding arrest warrant issued by another jurisdiction is the province of the Sheriff's department. It happens on a regular basis, particularly in large felony arraignments courts. The court was mindful of the concerns raised by counsel about a chilling effect on undocumented persons coming to court - one articulated far more thoughtfully by the Chief Justice of California - but such concerns could not impede enforcing a lawfully-issued warrant at the moment,' he said More[69] Here's another case of Leftist ideology being trumped by reality It is a great metaphor for Leftist ideology in general Ship of Fools 5 - Yet Another Greenie Expedition Scuppered by Ice[70]: Yet another Arctic expedition to raise awareness of 'global warming' has been frustrated by unexpectedly large quantities of ice. A Crime Against Humanity[71] Given all the suffering it has caused, is socialism a hate crime?  Scott McKay American Spectator August 27, 2018 Last week at the New Criterion, conservative scholar James Piereson posed an interesting question[72], arguing the affirmative: is socialism a hate crime? As is his custom, Piereson makes a solid case. His isn't a complex argument \u2014 Piereson simply totals up the corpses thanks to the world's chief practitioners of socialist governance in the 20thcentury, and concludes that anything which leads to the deaths of more than 110 million souls has to be a hate crime by the definition afforded us by the modern gatekeepers of the term The socialist movement has been responsible for the murder, imprisonment, and torture of many millions, and perhaps hundreds of millions, of innocent people during its heyday in the twentieth century. That history of murder and tyranny continues on a smaller scale today in the handful of countries living under the misfortune of socialism \u2014 for example, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, and (more recently) Venezuela. How do socialists escape the indictment that, in view of the historical record, they are purveyors of tyranny and mass murder? Many deny that Stalin, Mao, and the others were true socialists and, indeed, that socialism has never really been tried \u2014 a manifest absurdity. Senator Sanders and others claim that they are for something called 'democratic socialism,' a popular and peaceful version of the doctrine, but that's what Lenin, Mao, and Castro said until they seized power and immediately began to sing a different tune. Democracy and diversity are what they say when out of power; tyranny and authoritarianism are what they practice once in power. That is the tried-and-true technique of all socialist movements The question is often asked: why does the same thing happen over and over in socialist regimes? F. A. Hayek answered this question as long ago as 1944, when he published The Road to Serfdom, his classic critique of socialism The brutal history of socialism was yet fully to play out in the post-war era, but the lessons Hayek drew from Stalin and Hitler would turn out to apply perfectly to Mao, Castro, the Kim dynasty, and all of the socialist tyrants who came later. In socialist movements, as Hayek pointed out, there is a tendency for the most brutal and unscrupulous people to rise to the top because they are the types who are willing to take the necessary steps to seize power and who prize the kind of absolute power that socialism promises. Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mao, and Pol Pot Socialist policies, moreover, are always going to fail because it is impossible for central planners efficiently to allocate capital, goods, and services across a large economy. Socialism, after all, was always a political doctrine and never a plausible economic theory. When there arose shortages of food or housing or military equipment \u2014 when socialist policies failed \u2014 leaders were faced with a choice of admitting failure and abandoning the socialist path or doubling down on their policies and preserving their power. It was in their nature to choose the latter course, and thus to press forward with more extreme measures, which typically involved the identification of scapegoats and counter-revolutionary elements as causes of failure More[73] Parents Fight Back After Atlanta School Replaces 'Pledge of Allegiance' With Oath to 'Global Society'[74] Here's more proof that the activism of people like us works Dave Cristina Laila The Gateway Pundit August 27, 2018  Parents are fighting back after a charter school in Atlanta replaced the Pledge of Allegiance with an oath to 'global society.' Lara Zelski, principal of Atlanta Neighborhood Charter School recently announced that in an effort to be a more inclusive community, the students will also pledge an oath to their community and global society. Zelski proposed creating a pledge based on 'students' civic responsibility to their school family, community, country and our global society,' reported ACJ.com[75]. Thankfully the parents fought back and the controversy grabbed the attention of Georgia House Speaker David Ralston and gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp, resulting in a reversal of the anti-American policy. By about 6:15 p.m., the school issued a statement saying its policies were aligned with those of the Georgia Department of Education but ' it appears there was some miscommunication and inconsistency in the rollout. Starting next week, we will return to our original format and provide our students with the opportunity to recite the Pledge during the all-school morning meeting.' More[76] Why Palestine Became a Litmus Test for Muslim Candidate Rashida Tlaib[77] Shireen Qudosi The Clarion Project Tuesday, August 21, 2018  On August 9th, 2018, Palestine became a litmus test for Muslim candidate Rashida Tlaib over accusations that she was not vocal enough about Palestine during her campaign. Electronic Intifada[78] ran a critical piece[79] on Tlaib \u2014 a Palestinian American[80] and Democratic congressional candidate in Michigan \u2014 arguing that her words have not been 'comforting.'  Speaking to Jewish voters at a Detroit synagogue, Tlaib was quoted saying, 'We need to be honest[81] about dehumanization on both sides and more importantly, we need to not be choosing a side.'  For many Muslims (candidates and activists alike), the issue of Palestine becomes a litmus test of one's loyalty to his or her Muslim identity. This summer, writer and media personality Wajahat Ali also faced intense scrutiny over his feature in The Atlantic that explored[82] the perspective of Israeli settlers. Despite a laundry list of accomplishments that brought him immense support and a growing public platform, this one piece blacklisted him in the Muslim community (including a call to boycott Ali).  The Israel-Palestine issue is one of the most significant geopolitical multi-generational issues of our time, especially for Muslims. How Muslims respond to that conflict often determines how we respond to other issues: Will we bring dialogue or adopt a rigid[83] mentality?  Western Muslims often discuss Palestine with religious undertones, turning a geopolitical issue into a religious one. Certainly, for many non-Palestinian Muslims, Palestine has become a religious cause.  Yet, we don't see the same deep concern with Muslims over other foreign conflicts that involve Muslims, whether it be in Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Indonesia, or any other Muslim country or Muslim population facing exceptional challenges. When Islamists only care about the Palestinian issue with selective focus, the issue isn't the Palestinian people \u2014 the issue is Israel and the anti-Semitism woven into the thread of our faith by propagandists over the course of 1,400 years More[84]  We Must Defeat the Threats to Higher Education[85] Newt Gingrich Ammoland August 27, 2018  The United States is home to the world's highest-ranking colleges and universities. Indeed, our higher education system is one of our greatest assets. Yet, we do too little to defend it. In 2017, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, more than20 million[86]students planned to attend U.S. colleges and universities, and the National Science Foundation reported that more than800,000[87] international students were enrolled in institutions of higher education. Most of these international students, faculty members, and researchers are here to capitalize on America's educational opportunities, however, some are here to exploit the openness of our higher education system. According to anadvisory warning[88]released by the FBI in 2011, foreign intelligence services target American universities to recruit student and faculty to be agents of espionage and attempt to steal technical information and products. The FBI also reported that certain foreign actors illicitly exploit the student visa program and use universities hubs to spread false information and political propaganda. For example, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified in front of the Senate Committee on Intelligence inFebruary 2018[89]that China utilizes 'the use of nontraditional collectors, especially in the academic setting, whether it's professors, scientists, students, we see in almost every field office that the FBI has around the country.' He added that, '[China is] exploiting the very open research and development environment that we have, which we all revere. But they're taking advantage of it.' InMarch 2018[90], nine Iranians were charged by the Department of Justice after computer systems at 144 American universities were targeted in a cyber theft conspiracy. Additionally, back in 2014, the FBIissued[91]an advisory stating that, 'the Cuban intelligence services are known to actively target the U.S. academic world for the purposes of recruiting agents, in order to both obtain useful information and conduct influence activities.' These are only a few examples. Many other countries are looking to infiltrate and take advantage of the United States, so more must be done domestically to counteract this rising threat - while still maintaining the integrity of America's higher education institutions. One path forward is Senator Ted Cruz'sStop Higher Education Espionage and Theft Act of 2018[92](SHEET), which he introduced in the Senate onMay 22. If passed, the SHEET Act will give the Director of the FBI the authority to formally designate a foreign actor as a 'foreign intelligence threat to higher education.' In order to receive such a designation, a foreign actor must have exploited the resources of an institution to engage in illicit activities such as espionage, fraud, theft of trade secrets, or interception of communications. More[93] Mauro: US Must Wake Up to the New Turkey[94]. Director of the Clarion Intelligence Network and Shillman Fellow Ryan Mauro says[95] America must wake up to the new Turkey and not think that President Erdogan[96] is our ally. With this perspective, President Trump has the opportunity to decisively change the Middle East. Iran Signs Deal With Syria to Deepen Military Cooperation[97]  Agreement comes as U.S. and Israel push for Tehran's complete withdrawal from the country  Asa Fitch in Dubai and Sune Rasmussen in Beirut The Wall Street Journal Aug. 27, 2018  Iran said Monday that it had agreed to a deal to deepen military cooperation with Syria, reaffirming its intention to remain in the country despite moves by the U.S. and its allies to contain Tehran's military reach. Iran and Syria reached the deal following meetings Sunday between their defense ministers and Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, according to Iran's semiofficial Tasnim News Agency. The report offered no further details. Syrian state-linked media said the two sides reaffirmed the need the develop long-term cooperation, but made no mention of a new deal. Iran has sent thousands of its own and allied forces to Syria to fight alongside Mr. Assad's troops, and has also supported the Syrian regime with weaponry and oil. The move to further cement the partnership comes as the Trump administration and Israel amplify calls for Iran to withdraw completely from Syria[98]. Beating back Tehran has been a central goal of U.S. foreign policy under President Trump, who withdrew the U.S. in May from the Iran nuclear deal [99]and has started reimposing sanctions[100] that had been lifted under the Obama-era pact. Iranian forces have been involved in Syria's civil war since 2013, coming to the aid of Mr. Assad as he fended off a challenge from rebel groups and Islamic State extremists. Russia intervened to support Mr. Assad in 2015, helping him gain the upper hand in the conflict, which has now stretched more than seven years. With Mr. Assad tightening his grip, the U.S. and Israel are worried that Iranian influence is now entrenched in Syria. Mr. Trump wants to prevent Iran developing ballistic missiles and expanding a military footprint that could threaten Israel or other U.S. allies in the region. In a sign of how seriously Israel takes the threat, Israeli missiles struck Iranian targets in Syria in May[101], its largest assault inside Syria in about seven years. Israeli officials said the strikes destroyed dozens of Iranian military targets and Syrian anti-aircraft installations. Last week, White House national security adviser John Bolton said Russian President Vladimir Putin believed Russian and Iranian interests in Syria weren't aligned, 'and that [Mr. Putin] would be content to see Iranian forces all sent back to Iran,' recounting a conversation between Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump. But Mr. Bolton said Mr. Putin indicated he couldn't evict Iran from Syria by himself, suggesting the Russian president's leverage over Mr. Assad had limits. Moscow has previously offered to keep Iran and its allied militias tens of miles from the Israeli border, but its ambassador to Israel has stressed that Russia won't work to evict Iran from Syria. Iranians play a 'very, very important role in our common and joint effort to eliminate terrorists in Syria,' Anatoly Viktorov told Israeli media in July. Mr. Assad has previously said that Iran's presence in Syria wasn't negotiable and wouldn't be part of a political settlement over the country's future More[102] Nation That Sparked Arab Spring Finds Itself a Springboard for Illegal Migration[103]  Plagued by an economic crisis at home, more Tunisians are sneaking into Europe; 'They all reach a point of despair'  It's so tragic Muslims themselves suffer Islam's harmful effects the worst And they know something is wrong, yet they cannot allow themselves to blame Islam Instead, they leave whatever land Islam has ruined and move to greener pastures In doing so, they leave a blighted land, but carry the spore of the blight in their brains turning the green pastures they escape red with Islamic violence and dysfunction Dave Jared Malsin The Wall Street Journal Aug. 27, 2018  AL ATAYA, Tunisia\u2014More than seven years after Tunisians overthrew their country's dictatorship in a revolution that spawned the Arab Spring, the country's economy is in crisis[104] and thousands of people are sneaking into Europe, as part of a new wave of clandestine migration from what had been a North African success story. A fishing community here of low-slung stone houses, on the Mediterranean's Kerkennah Islands, has become a gathering point for smugglers sending young Tunisians to Italy. The young people sail by night on fishing boats, hoping to find jobs and a new life on European shores to the north. The exodus is a sign of the widespread sense of disaffection with the country following the euphoric ouster of autocrat Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011. 'They all reach a point of despair,' Zine Abdedine Warda, a 54-year-old shipbuilder and teacher in Al Ataya, said of the young men boarding the boats. 'There's nothing for them on land, so they leave by sea.' Tunisians now represent the largest population of migrants entering Italy on smugglers' boats. More than 3,300 Tunisians have arrived in Italy this year, according to the United Nations. Nearly 6,000 others have been arrested for attempting to leave the country illegally, the Tunisian government said. The surge in Tunisia's illegal migration comes as Italian and Libyan authorities corral more boats from neighboring Libya, a route frequented by people from sub-Saharan Africa. Eritreans and Sudanese people make up the second- and third-largest share of arrivals in Italy.

The migrants tried to separate the 23-year-old Portuguese woman from her boyfriend. The young Greek reacted immediately, fighting all three of them. During the fight the 25-year-old Greek fell off the cliff, resulting in fatal injuries. The gang fled due to the screams of his girlfriend. Though the hellenic police arrived immediately, the culprits managed to escape. An ambulance took the victim to a local hospital where he died despite doctors' efforts. According to the Portuguese woman's statement to police, the culprits had a dark Asian complexion More[108] Germany migrants: Merkel condemns 'vigilantes' after Chemnitz murder[109] The people of Europe have had it with being victimized in the name of multiculturalism and inclusiveness The backlash isn't going to be pretty and it won't be fair but the multiculturalists knowingly sowed the seeds of this conflict And yet Merkel still doesn't get it or at least she won't admit it Dave BBC News 27 August 2018  German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said 'vigilante justice' will not be tolerated after far-right unrest over a murder in the eastern city of Chemnitz. Scuffles have broken out during two days of protests by hundreds of people in the city centre since a German was stabbed to death early on Sunday. A Syrian man and an Iraqi man have been arrested on suspicion of murder. Police were still out in strength on Monday evening, braced for new demonstrations by both right and left. They are also investigating alleged assaults on an Afghan, a Syrian and a Bulgarian during the unrest. Reports have spoken of aggressive protesters chasing foreigners, though there are few details, and police have appealed for witnesses to the assaults to hand over any video they may have recorded. A far-right football fan group called Kaotic Chemnitz had earlier called out supporters to show 'who is in charge', while protesters on Sunday could be seen chanting 'We are the people!' and 'This is our city!'. Bottles were thrown on Sunday by protesters at police, who were reinforced by officers from other cities. What happened? It is unclear what triggered a fight which reportedly preceded the stabbing, at about 03:15 (01:15 GMT) on Sunday, on the sidelines of a street festival, which has now been cancelled. The victim, a carpenter aged 35, was mortally wounded and died in hospital. Two other German men with him, aged 33 and 38, were seriously hurt, police say. The Syrian detainee is 23 and the Iraqi 22. Police have denied rumours on social media that the fight was linked to the sexual harassment of a woman.  How did protests spread? Initially, about 100 people gathered on Sunday for a rally which passed off without incident, AFP news agency reports. However, some 800 people later gathered at the Karl Marx monument, a focal point in the centre of Chemnitz. The monument is a throwback to the city's days as a model socialist city in the former German Democratic Republic, when it was renamed Karl-Marx-Stadt. It appears that such a large, angry demonstration took police by surprise. Freelance journalist Johannes Grunert told Spiegel Online he had witnessed some protesters using bottles to attack people 'who did not look German'[110]  More[111] The post FREEDOM UPDATE: CNN Leaving a Trail of Fake News and Dirty Deeds; More[112] appeared first on Western Free Press[113].

Islamists, hand-in-hand with the political left, are continuing to do all they can to shut our event down. They have even started to circulate a petition on Change.org asking Hyatt to cancel our event and ban ACT for America from their hotel property. This is what these groups always do: When they don't have any argument that fits their narrative, they work to silence and shut down those with whom they disagree - usually by resorting to ugly and false name-calling. </p><p>You see, this isn't about Hyatt hosting our national conference, this is an attempt by the Islamist left to prevent our members from speaking with their elected officials on Capitol Hill. All of our conference attendees will be meeting with their Members of Congress on Wednesday, September 5th and they want to stop it. They want to silence our voice. We won't let that happen and we hope you won't either. This is why I need you to join me in Washington, DC in just 1 week to stand up and fight back against the radical leftist forces working to undermine our republic. Remember, this is going to be a star-studded event with the likes of Charlie Kirk, LTC Allen West, Tomi Lahren and myself all speaking! If you are unable to attend the entire National Conference (September 4th-5th) I encourage you to join us at our 'Back the Blue: A Night to Honor Our Nation's Law Enforcement Dinner Gala' on the night of September 5th.

Our country's safety and security is at stake - I hope you will find a way to join me in Washington, DC. I look forward to seeing you there! Always Devoted, Brigitte Gabriel Founder Chairman ACT for America Someone Tell Carl Bernstein the Cover-Up Is Worse than the Crime[3] John Nolte Breitbart News 28 Aug 2018  CNN's Carl Bernstein, the man made co-famous through his historic Watergate reporting, lied to us   to all of us. And he is now engaged in a cover up to protect this lie. I am not even talking about his fake news about the Trump Tower meeting, which I will get to in a bit   I am talking about a flat-out, provable lie. In a July 27 piece of very fake news Bernstein co-wrote with CNN anchor (and former Obama official) Jim Sciutto and researcher Marshall Cohen, Bernstein declaratively informs us[4], 'Contacted by CNN, one of Cohen's attorneys, Lanny Davis, declined to comment.' That statement is a lie, a proven lie, a bald-faced lie, because we now know for a fact[5] that Lanny Davis did NOT decline to comment. What's more, Davis was a CNN source for that steaming pile of very fake news. In other words the anti-Trump Carl Bernstein did not only spread fake news, the anti-Trump Carl Bernstein published a straight-up lie in his fake news, reported something he knew was not true. Let's back up a bit On July 27, Bernstein and his two CNN co-conspirators dropped the bombshell that President Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, would testify that then-candidate Trump knew in advance about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. If true, this of course would be a very big deal because the president has denied any foreknowledge of the meeting involving his son Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner, various campaign officials, and some Russians (one of whom has deep ties to\u00a0high-level Democrats[6]\u00a0with names that rhyme with Mobama, Fillary, and Heinz Ketchup). Nevertheless, even to those of us who see the Trump Tower story as the golden snipe in the snipe hunt that is the Russian collusion hoax, Trump lying about such a thing would still be a pretty big deal. And Bernstein and Co. were certain Trump lied, and Bernstein wanted you to be certain, because Bernstein now had Trump right where he wanted him after\u00a0sources-sources-sources with knowledge told Berstein By Cohen's account, Trump approved going ahead with the meeting with the Russians, according to sources. And then Bernstein's sources-sources-sources with knowledge told Bernstein Cohen is willing to make that assertion to special counsel Robert Mueller, the sources said. And Bernstein swears on a stack of Bob Woodward's best-sellers that those sources-sources-sources were not Lanny Davis Contacted by CNN, one of Cohen's attorneys, Lanny Davis, declined to comment. Except Lanny Davis was CNN's source, and we know this because Davis burned himself and\u00a0admitted he was the source.[7] Which begs the question: Why did Bernstein lie? Why Did Bernstein tell us Davis was not the source when Davis was the source?  More[8] Another Very Fake News Scandal Engulfs CNN with Fake Michael Cohen Russia Story[9] Apologies for the length This case is a little complex, but it is absolutely essential that you understand what happened CNN got caught in a flat out lie, but it is a well-concealed flat out lie This is how CNN operates, and it is important for us to be able to point this out Dave Matthew Boyle Breitbart News 27 Aug 2018 Washington, D.C. - Another very fake news scandal has engulfed CNN as the network's credibility crisis reaches another fever pitch just over a year after three senior network staffers were forced to resign in disgrace over a similar scandal. This time, though, famed Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein is at the center of the scandal, and the network for now is dug in despite deep criticism from across the political and ideological spectrum as far-ranging as Breitbart News and Daily Caller among others on one side, and the Associated Press, Washington Post, BuzzFeed, and more on the other. It all began on July 27 when CNN's Bernstein shared a byline with former Barack Obama administration official[10]\u00a0and chief CNN national security correspondent Jim Sciutto, along with CNN researcher and producer Marshall Cohen, with the headline: 'Cohen claims Trump knew in advance of 2016 Trump Tower meeting.' The fact that Bernstein-who along with Bob Woodward broke and chronicled the Watergate scandal that led to the eventual resignation of Richard Nixon from the presidency-was on the byline was significant, as it threw the weight and heft of his personal credibility behind the network's story. In the piece, Bernstein, Sciutto, and Cohen used anonymous 'sources' to claim that President Donald Trump's now former personal attorney Michael Cohen was willing to undercut President Trump's claims about the famed 2016 Trump Tower meeting that the president's son Donald Trump, Jr., his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort had with a Russian attorney with links to the Kremlin. 'Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, claims that then-candidate Trump knew in advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower in which Russians were expected to offer his campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton, sources with knowledge tell CNN,' Bernstein, Sciutto, and Cohen wrote. 'Cohen is willing to make that assertion to special counsel Robert Mueller, the sources said.' In the second paragraph of the CNN piece, the famed Watergate reporter, along with the former Obama official and CNN researcher, wrote about the stakes at play here: 'Cohen's claim would contradict repeated denials by Trump, Donald Trump Jr., their lawyers and other administration officials who have said that the President knew nothing about the Trump Tower meeting until he was approached about it by The New York Times in July 2017.' The third paragraph goes on to allege even more against the president: 'Cohen alleges that he was present, along with several others, when Trump was informed of the Russians' offer by Trump Jr. By Cohen's account, Trump approved going ahead with the meeting with the Russians, according to sources.' The fourth paragraph-again citing anonymous 'sources'-claims that Cohen did not have any evidence like 'audio recordings' to back up the claims attributed to the anonymous sources throughout the CNN article. But then the fifth paragraph makes yet another astounding claim: In Cohen's congressional testimony, per these anonymous CNN 'sources,' Cohen did not state in testimony before Congress that Trump himself had 'advance knowledge' of the Russia Trump Tower meeting. 'Cohen privately testified last year\u00a0to two Congressional committees investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election,' Bernstein, Sciutto, and Cohen wrote. 'A source familiar with Cohen's House testimony said he did not testify that Trump had advance knowledge. Cohen's claims weren't mentioned in separate reports issued by Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee.' The CNN piece goes on in the next paragraph to note that Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis, 'declined to comment' for the article. It was revealed later by Davis himself that was not true-Davis was in fact an anonymous source for this CNN piece, as Davis admitted on Monday evening. But more importantly, the entire thesis of the entire story is entirely fake news-completely untrue as revealed more than a week ago by Axios' Jonathan Swan CNN's Bernstein, Sciutto, and Cohen had what would have been a major story if true: That not only was Michael Cohen turning on Trump on those payments to McDougal and Daniels. but that Cohen was willing and going to testify against the president on a core component of Mueller's probe. Mueller has yet to nail down anything related to the actual mandate of his investigation: He has only gotten people on unrelated crimes, like in Manafort's case. So, when CNN reported this, it was a major deal-because it would have justified the continued existence of the Special Counsel's office despite a complete lack more than a year into this investigation since President Trump fired now former FBI director James Comey of any evidence at the center of the mandate of the probe. Fast forward nearly a month after the CNN story to Aug. 23. It was on Aug. 23 that Axios' Swan reported, citing sworn testimony Michael Cohen gave to various congressional committees under oath behind closed doors, that Cohen does not know if Trump knew about the Russia meeting in Trump Tower before it happened. 'Exclusive: Michael Cohen told Congress he doesn't know if Trump knew about Russia meeting,' Swan's headline read. 'Michael Cohen told lawmakers last year, in sworn testimony, that he\u00a0didn't\u00a0know whether then-candidate Donald Trump had foreknowledge of the 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians, three sources with knowledge of Cohen's testimony tell Axios,' Swan's piece's lead sentence reads. In Swan's story, Cohen's attorney Lanny Davis-infamous in his own right due to his time in the administration of former President Bill Clinton-went on the record to clarify that Cohen still does not know if Trump knew about the meeting in advance: And Cohen\u00a0still\u00a0doesn't know whether Trump knew about the infamous meeting, according to Cohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis. 'Nothing has changed,' he told Axios.\u00a0Newsreports\u00a0last month said Cohen was willing to assert to special counsel Robert Mueller that Trump\u00a0did\u00a0know about the meeting in advance. Davis, when asked by Swan why he did not shoot down the original misreporting by CNN, claimed he and Cohen were 'not the source.' 'It was painful,' Davis said. 'We were not the source, we could not confirm, and we could not correct. We had to be silent because of the sensitivity needed in the middle of a criminal investigation.' This becomes extraordinarily important later as it relates to Davis' credibility, as he himself later admitted he was in fact a source for the CNN story. When Axios' piece was published, Breitbart News contacted CNN spokeswomen Emily Kuhn and Lauren Pratapas-two women who have made their bones defending the network's fake news shenanigans-and asked if the network stood by the story. Breitbart News also asked Kuhn and Pratapas if the network stood by Bernstein, Sciutto, and Cohen, the three listed on the byline, and whether there would be any consequences whatsoever for the trio caught peddling fake news. Kuhn and Pratapas did not respond. Then, on Aug. 26, under the bylines of Tom Hamburger and Rosalind Helderman, Bernstein's former newspaper the Washington Post published its own investigation[11] of the matter under this headline: 'Attorney for Michael Cohen backs away from confidence that Cohen has information about Trump's knowledge on Russian efforts.' In the Post story, which shreds its own alumnus' credibility, a CNN spokeswoman-anonymously-claims the network stands by its story: 'We stand by our story, and are confident in our reporting of it.' In the wake of this story in the Washington Post, and several days of reporting on the matter where several current and former CNN officials expressed to Breitbart News unease with the network's handling of this matter, Breitbart News re-approached Kuhn and Pratapas on Monday morning and asked for comment again on this matter. Breitbart News also asked Kuhn and Pratapas if Bernstein and Sciutto would be made available for interviews on their handling of this story, and for reaction to the fact that multiple CNN employees both current and former were disturbed with how this has been handled and how the network has lost even more credibility as a result. 'This only plays into Trump's hands,' one CNN reporter, who requested anonymity, told Breitbart News. 'We should have retracted the piece and apologized and moved on. But management's decision to dig in hurts our credibility. 'They are handling this differently than they would other stories because Carl is on the byline,' a CNN anchor, who also requested anonymity, told Breitbart News, referencing the famed Watergate reporter.

'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on why CNN is standing by a Michael Cohen story that his lawyer, Lanny Davis, says is false. CNN Dodging 'Serious Ethical and Journalistic Questions' About Lanny Davis Fake News Scandal[14] Trump was right after allagain CNN really is 'very fake news' They didn't just step in it They danced in it with a 40-minute TV expos\u00e9 Dave Matthew Boyle Breitbart News 28 Aug 2018 Washington, D.C. - CNN is under even more scrutiny on Tuesday morning as The Intercept's Glenn Greenwald unloaded a major story[15] about the network's public relations officials-at the direction, clearly, of management-and is refusing to be transparent about a fake news scandal that has engulfed the network and tarnished one of journalism's all-time great leaders, Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame. In an explosive piece laying out the landscape of an ethical minefield through which CNN is navigating poorly, Greenwald in the headline of the story accuses CNN of lying to its audience in a piece authored by Bernstein; former Barack Obama administration official and CNN chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto, and CNN researcher Marshall Cohen: 'CNN, Credibly Accused of Lying to its Audience About a Key Claim in its Blockbuster Cohen Story, Refuses to Comment.' As Breitbart News has reported[16], the entire core of the piece from July from Bernstein, Sciutto, and Cohen is entirely fake news. CNN reported, using anonymous sources, that Michael Cohen-President Trump's former personal attorney who just pleaded guilty to a number of charges brought by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York-was willing to testify that President Trump knew in advance of a summer 2016 meeting between several senior Trump officials and a Russian attorney with Kremlin links. Cohen's own attorney, Lanny Davis, later undercut that narrative, publicly claiming on the record nearly a month later that it was not true. Then Davis admitted he was a source for the CNN story-and that he had provided inaccurate information to the network. That is where Greenwald zones in on his story, raising 'serious ethical and journalistic questions' about CNN's 'conduct' in handling this. While CNN refuses to answer whether it has other sources other than Davis to back up its claim-it appears to not have them-Greenwald writes that CNN's claim in the original article about which Davis declined to comment, when he was, in fact, a source for the story on an anonymous basis, is extraordinarily troubling. Here's how Greenwald puts it: 'Nonetheless,\u00a0it's possible that other sources\u00a0did tell CNN that Cohen does have this information and intends to share it with Mueller, and that Cohen's own lawyer is either unaware of this or is lying about it. It's not likely, obviously, but it's theoretically possible. Unfortunately, CNN refuses to tell us anything about what it itself said was a 'blockbuster' story, so it's impossible to know. But there's an entirely separate, and more significant, question about CNN's behavior here; namely, the\u00a0very specific claim they made about their sourcing for that blockbuster story.\u00a0Last night, BuzzFeed\u00a0reported[17]\u00a0that Davis\u00a0explicitly confessed that he was one of the anonymous sources for CNN's July 26 story, just as he was for the stories from the Washington Post and the New York Post. Last week,\u00a0CNN put Davis\u00a0on the air\u00a0with Anderson Cooper[18]\u00a0to deny that he was the source for that CNN story - a denial Cooper did not contest - but Davis now admits he was one of CNN's sources, if not their main source. Yet remarkably, CNN, in its July 26\u00a0story,\u00a0specificaly claimed that Davis\u00a0refused to talk to CNN\u00a0about the story or provide any comment whatsoever.' What's more, Greenwald says, this means only one of two things can be true: Either Davis is lying to BuzzFeed when he claims he was the anonymous source for the CNN piece or, perhaps more likely, 'CNN deliberately lied to its audience about Davis refusing to comment on the story when, in fact, Davis was one of the anonymous sources on which the CNN report depended, and CNN claimed Davis refused to comment in order to hide Davis' identity as one of their anonymous sources.' 'How can CNN possibly justify refusing to address these questions, and refrain from informing the public about these critical matters on a story that they themselves hyped for days as a 'blockbuster,' one of the most significant stories yet in the Trump/Russia saga?' Greenwald wrote. 'Questions about this massive discrepancy from the Intercept to Stelter have not been answered, nor has CNN addressed this on air or with any other media outlets who have inquired. [Oliver] Darcy told the Intercept he was not aware of sourcing issues on the story and suggested inquiries be directed to CNN's Public Relations department.' Greenwald goes on to write that if CNN did, in fact, lie about Davis refusing to comment when he was an anonymous source for the piece, which appears to be the case, this is 'obviously a major journalism scandal.' Greenwald adds: 'If, by contrast, Davis - who has been treated by the U.S. media as a reliable source despite decades of lying (and who leveraged that treatment to raise\u00a0more than $150,000 in a GoFundMe 'Truth Fund' campaign\u00a0for Cohen to pay Davis)\u00a0- is lying about having spoken to CNN about the July 26 report, that is also a major story.' The piece goes on to explain that despite CNN's being the only place that can truly inform the public, the network is silent on this matter. 'Yet CNN, the only ones with the ability to inform the public about what happened here, is silent,' Greenwald writes. 'This despite the incomparable importance which CNN breathlessly told its viewers the story carried.' Greenwald then includes a video whereby CNN 'breathlessly' pushed this fake story in July The video and more[19] CNN Ratings Nosedive Double Digits in August[20] What is striking about this news is that CNN supposedly is a for-profit company and yet its 'very fake news' drives viewers away I myself am a former CNN viewer, who smelled something fishy all the way back in 2003, during its coverage of the invasion of Iraq CNN is manufacturing fake news even though it drives away viewers Why would they do that? It is because of the gray area that lies between objective news and infomercials Advertisers have boycotted top-rated shows like Glenn Beck[21] and the O'Reilly Factor[22] and driven them off the air, despite their millions of viewers while CNN's fake news continues to get advertiser supportno matter how few people watch it CNN's advertising dollars are effectively a money laundering operation which pays for propaganda masquerading as news The advertisers aren't really advertising; they paying for political infomercials Dave John Nolte Breitbart News 28 Aug 2018  Far-left CNN took a double-digit ratings dive in August even as Fox News and MSNBC grew parts of their respective audiences. Nielsen Media Research reports that perennial ratings loser CNN had a terrible August despite a banner news month, reports [23]the Hill. While Fox News notched its 200th consecutive month at number one in cable news and gained in primetime viewers (when compared to this same month last year), CNN lost -12 percent of its primetime viewers and a whopping -15 percent of total day viewers. Fox News averaged 1.3 million total day viewers (down -4 percent) and an incredible 2.3 million primetime viewers (up +4 percent). MSNBC averaged 1.04 million total day numbers (down -4 percent) and 1.845 million primetime viewers (up +1 percent). CNN, however, is once again well behind its competition with just 705K total day viewers (down -15 percent) and 1.05 million primetime viewers (down -12 percent), which averages to less than half of Fox's primetime viewers More[24] Rep. Meadows: People at FBI, DOJ Used Their Own Press Leaks to Further Investigations[25] Pam Key Breitbart News 28 Aug 2018  Tuesday on Fox News Channel's 'America's Newsroom,' Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) accused people at the Department of Justice and FBI of giving 'information to the\u00a0media,' and then using those media report to 'justify further\u00a0investigations.' When asked if the FBI and DOJ leaked\u00a0info to the press and then use\u00a0those stories to justify\u00a0FISA warrants,\u00a0Meadows said, 'I\u00a0believe they did. We know that some people at the Department of Justice and FBI actually gave information to the\u00a0media then the stories were\u00a0reported, then they use those\u00a0reports to justify further\u00a0investigations. That is like saying we are\u00a0going to incriminate on one hand\u00a0and be the jury on the other. It just doesn't work that way.' The video[26] Gregg Jarrett: The scheme from Bruce Ohr and Comey's confederates to clear Clinton, damage Trump[27] Gregg Jarrett Fox News August 28, 2018 Director James Comey knew the FBI was incorruptible. This is precisely why he seized control of the investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's email practices covering her time as secretary of state, instead of allowing the FBI field office to conduct the probe. By commandeering control of the investigation, Comey and his confederates could twist the facts and contort the law to dictate the outcome they desired. Clinton was the beneficiary of what FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe reportedly described as the 'HQ special.' The same is true of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. The very people who cleared Clinton of crimes - despite strong evidence that she broke the law - also assumed unfettered authority over the so-called 'collusion' investigation to determine if Donald Trump's presidential campaign worked with Russia to help Trump become president. Bereft of probable cause and credible evidence, they nevertheless pursued Trump in a probe designed to damage his candidacy - and later to destroy his presidency in an effort to overturn the results of the 2016 presidential election. It was not just Comey and his abettors at the FBI who conjured this illicit scheme. There were others outside the walls of the J. Edgar Hoover Building who were both instrumental and complicit. Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee furnished the necessary funds. Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS acted as the facilitator. And ex-British spy Christopher Steele provided the fabricated 'dossier' that served as a pretext for launching the investigation of Trump. This brings us to the steps of the Justice Department and a high-ranking official who was essential to the scheme.\u00a0 Bruce Ohr Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr bypassed his superiors at the Justice Department and worked covertly with Steele to exploit what became known as the 'Steele dossier.' Sixty-three pages of texts, emails and handwritten notes show extensive contacts between Ohr and Steele both before and after the election. Even after Steele was fired by the FBI for lying about his contacts with reporters, Ohr maintained intensive communications with Steele. The former British spy kept feeding his bogus information while simultaneously fretting to Ohr that his actions might be 'exposed.'  The video and more[28] Witness: Fusion GPS, Trump Tower Participants Met with Clinton Associate Ed Lieberman[29] Aaron Klein Breitbart News 28 Aug 2018  Attorney Edward Lieberman, whose late wife Evelyn previously served as Hillary Clinton's chief of staff when she was First Lady, was present at one and possibly two dinner meetings between the controversial Fusion GPS firm and key participants in the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, according to witness testimony reviewed by Breitbart News. One of those meetings with Fusion GPS took place just days after the Trump Tower meeting, the testimony reveals. Also, Edward Lieberman met with one Russian participant the same day of the Trump Tower meeting, according to separate testimony. Besides working for Hillary Clinton, Lieberman's late wife, Evelyn, also served as Bill Clinton's deputy chief of staff, and famously transferred Monica Lewinsky out of the White House to the Defense Department. Edward Lieberman himself has been described as working within the orbit of the Clintons. He previously served[30] as legal counsel and advisor to the Albright Group LLC, which was founded by Madeleine K. Albright, who served as Bill Clinton's Secretary of State and who would later serve as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign. Lieberman's expertise, listed on his former Albright Group bio[31], includes 'multi-billion dollar privatizations of oil and gas assets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Russia.' The Russia collusion conspiracy was sparked by the dossier produced by Fusion GPS, which was paid for its anti-Trump work by Trump's primary political opponents, namely Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie law firm. In previous testimony,[32] Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson described having several dinners with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who countered the Magnitsky Act which sanctions Russian officials accused of involvement in the death of a Russian tax accountant. All participants at the Trump Tower meeting generally agree the confab, in which Veselnitskaya did most of the talking, focused largely on the Magnitsky Act as well as talk about a Russian tax evasion scheme and alleged connections to the Democratic National Committee. Donald Trump Jr. previously explained[33] that he took the meeting thinking it was about 'opposition research' on Hillary Clinton and was disappointed that it wasn't More[34] Google Responds to Trump: 'No Political Bias in Google Search'[35] Lucas Nolan Breitbart News 28 Aug 2018  Tech giant Google has denied President Trump's recent assertions that Google purposefully manipulates search results with a political bias. President Trump claimed[36] in a series of tweets today that tech giant Google purposefully alters Google search results to show negative articles about Trump. In his tweets, Trump called the system 'rigged' and stated that Google and other tech companies were suppressing the voices of Conservatives and hiding positive news relating to the Trump administration. Google search results for 'Trump News' shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me others, so that almost all stories news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative Fair Media is shut out. Illegal? 96% of.   Donald J.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2018[38] Google has since responded to President Trump stating that their search results are not politically biased, but they are actively working to improve their search program: 'When users type queries into the Google Search bar, our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds. Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology. Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users' queries. We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.' However, Google's claims that it is politically unbiased have been disproved by Dr. Robert Epstein of the American Institute for Behavioral Research (AIBRT). In a series of tests, Epstein and his team examined Google's search feature[39] and performed a number of tests in order to gain a greater insight into the possible bias that the search engine may display. Epstein initially noted discrepancies in search results for Hillary Clinton: 'It is somewhat difficult to get the Google search bar to suggest negative searches related to Mrs. Clinton or to make any Clinton-related suggestions when one types a negative search term. Bing and Yahoo, on the other hand, often show a number of negative suggestions in response to the same search terms. Bing and Yahoo seem to be showing us what people are actually searching for; Google is showing us something else   but what, and for what purpose? As for Google Trends, as Lieberman reported, Google indeed withholds negative search terms for Mrs. Clinton even when such terms show high popularity in Trends. We have also found that Google often suggests positive search terms for Mrs. Clinton even when such terms are nearly invisible in Trends. The widely held belief, reinforced by Google's own documentation, that Google's search suggestions are based on 'what other people are searching for' seems to be untrue in many instances. Google tries to\u00a0explain away such findings by\u00a0saying its search bar is programmed to\u00a0avoid suggesting searches that portray people in\u00a0a negative light. As far as\u00a0we can tell, this claim is false; Google suppresses negative suggestions selectively, not across\u00a0the board. It is easy to\u00a0get autocomplete to\u00a0suggest negative searches related to\u00a0prominent people, one of\u00a0whom happens to\u00a0be Mrs. Clinton's opponent.'

Dave Charlie Nash Breitbart News 28 Aug 2018  The top story on Google News Tuesday afternoon was a CNN article defending Google News, following President Trump's criticism of Google's biased news results. When users visit Google News' 'Top stories' section in the United States, the top headline this afternoon was a CNN article titled, 'Trump slams Google search as 'rigged'\u00a0  but it's not.' The story is fluctuating between the top and second spot at the time of this writing. Top story on Google News is that Google isn't rigged. pic.twitter.com/HeSN8xiCFF[43]   James Taranto (@jamestaranto) August 28, 2018[44]; After a report[45] revealed this week that Google News results for the term 'Trump' were overwhelmingly left-wing, with CNN being the most linked news outlet, followed by the New York Times, the Guardian, the Washington Post, the BBC, USA Today, CNBC, and HuffPost\u00a0  while conservative sources were absent\u00a0  President Trump called out Google on Twitter More[46] 10 Times Google's Far-Left, Anti-Trump Bias Was Exposed[47] Allum Bokhari Breitbart News 28 Aug 2018  The far-left mainstream media is dutifully defending its ideological allies in Silicon Valley to do, arguing that President Trump's criticism[48] of bias in Google's products is a 'conspiracy theory[49].' The mainstream media may have formed a defensive barrier around Google in response to the President, but there are many examples of Google expressing its political bias in ways both big and small. Breitbart Tech has collected ten popular examples of Google's left-wing bias in action. 1. When the company fired James Damore. Former Google engineer was fired for expressing mild criticism of Google's far-left diversity policies and political monoculture. His arguments wouldn't have been out of place in a David Brooks column or a Jonathan Haidt lecture. Despite the mildness of his arguments   which were more liberal centrist than conservative   radical leftists at the company succeeded in getting him fired, after maliciously leaking his viewpoint diversity manifesto to the press 2. When the company failed to condemn Antifa 3. When then-CEO Eric Schmidt wanted to be 'head outside adviser' to the Clinton campaign 4. When Schmidt set up a grassroots organization to put a second Clinton in the White House 5. When Google rigged its search suggestions in favor of Hillary Clinton in 2016. A video from tech news site SourceFed in 2016 reported[50] that negative search terms for Hillary Clinton did not autocomplete, despite the fact that those terms (like 'Hillary Clinton criminal') were popular, and autocompleted just fine on Bing and Yahoo 6. When its senior management broke down in tears after Trump's election win. Yes, this actually happened. A Google insider gave Breitbart News this bit of information[51] (and some other internal horror stories) back in 2017. 7. When Google employees spoke out en masse about the company's oppressive political monoculture 8. When it decided to boost Wikipedia, an encyclopedia of far-left fake news, in its search results.\u00a0When you conduct a Google search, chances are you'll see a Wikipedia link at the top of your results, or information from Wikipedia in the 'knowledge panel' that appears on the right-hand side of some Google searches. The online encyclopedia is heavily favored in Google search results. The online encyclopedia is also infamous for its unreliability and far-left bias. Editors on the site added[52] ICE detention centers to a Wikipedia article on 'concentration camps.' They added[53] Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson to a list of 'neo-Nazi conspiracy theorists.' They even created an article dedicated solely to criticism of the President's handshake style, and featured it on Wikipedia's front page[54]. This is the 'encyclopedia' that Google relies on for many of its top search results. 9. When it plowed $300 million into propping up the anti-Trump legacy media. This is an initiative of Google News spread across the company's services and sister companies, including YouTube[55]. Typically of recent big tech power-grabs, the initiative was presented to the public as an effort to combat 'misinformation' online. Google will do this by funding misinformation at news organizations like far-left Vox, a website that claims the Clinton email scandal is fake news[56]. 10. When it let a far-left academic give a talk on 'white fragility' while blocking Jordan Peterson More[57] Flashback: Dr. Robert Epstein, Peter Schweizer Warned About Powers of Big Tech at 'Masters of the Universe' Town Hall[58] Charlie Nash Breitbart News 28 Aug 2018  During Breitbart News' Masters of the Universe town hall in April, psychologist Dr. Robert Epstein, author Peter Schweizer, author Ann Coulter, and Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow warned the audience about Big Tech's influence over society. Here are some of the revelations from the event. Dr. Robert Epstein: Silicon Valley could swing an election 'with no-one knowing that they had done this.' Peter Schweizer: Google and Facebook are 'not just Internet companies They steer the national debate in ways that are unimaginable.' Dr. Robert Epstein: Everything that goes through your email account is 'record, analyzed' by Google, and becomes 'part of your profile.' Peter Schweizer: 'You don't know, ultimately, what information you're not getting.'

Donald Trump: Google, Facebook, and Twitter 'Better Be Careful'[61] Charlie Spiering Breitbart News 28 Aug 2018  President Donald Trump continued challenging big tech companies on Tuesday, warning them about censoring content from conservatives. 'I think what Google and what others are doing - if you look at what is going on with Twitter and if you look at what's going on in Facebook, they better be careful because you can't do that to people,' Trump said. 'You can't do it.' The president said that he had heard 'thousands' of censorship complaints from people and repeated that it was 'not fair.' He added that censorship was a 'serious charge' against the tech companies. 'I think that Google and Twitter and Facebook, they are really treading on very, very troubled territory and they have to be careful,' he said. 'It is not fair to large portions of the population.' The president has recently ramped up his criticisms of the social media companies after reports of conservative content being downgraded, removed, or deleted from their platforms More[62] Kudlow: 'We're Taking a Look at' Regulating Google[63] Speaking as someone whose company once used Google to create awareness I know for a fact that Google monetizes its search results That is, if you want to appear high in the list, you have to pay for it Otherwise you'll be stuck at the bottom even though other results don't match the search criteria as well as you do Google doesn't have to do this simply for money, though  They can do it to reward or punish politicians too according to their whim It is even possible for one political group to pay Googleto put another political group at the bottom of the list This would be easy for Google, and if it makes money or serves their interestswhy wouldn't they do it? Dave Ian Hanchett Breitbart News 28 Aug 2018  While speaking to reporters on Tuesday, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow stated that the Trump administration is 'taking a look at' whether there needs to be some form of government regulation of Google and will let people know what they plan to do. One of the reporters asked Kudlow, 'Does the president believe, or does the administration feel that there needs to be some form of regulation for Google, or what exactly was the president referring to?' Kudlow responded, 'We'll let you know. We're taking a look at it. We'll let you know.' More[64] Newt Gingrich: The left in this country doesn't negotiate[65].

In top California sanctuary city, ICE agents take matters into their own hands to enforce the law[67] Chris Enloe The Blaze August 26, 2018 California lawmakers last year declared 'sanctuary state' status [68]for the entire state, adding to the dozens of cities that already had 'sanctuary city' laws on the books. However, that hasn't stopped Immigration and Customs Enforcement from doing its job   even if that means arresting illegal immigrants in courtrooms. What's going on? ICE agents entered Sacramento Superior Court earlier this month to arrest an immigrant, Yovanny Ontiveros-Cebreros, according to his lawyer, Charles Pacheco Judge Lawrence Brown initially stepped in to prevent the arrest, Pacheco said. But after spending time in his judicial chambers, Brown allowed ICE agents to complete their job, telling Pacheco the agents had a warrant for his client's arrest Brown told the Bee that judges do not prevent law enforcement agencies from making lawful arrests. 'Remanding on an outstanding arrest warrant issued by another jurisdiction is the province of the Sheriff's department. It happens on a regular basis, particularly in large felony arraignments courts. The court was mindful of the concerns raised by counsel about a chilling effect on undocumented persons coming to court - one articulated far more thoughtfully by the Chief Justice of California - but such concerns could not impede enforcing a lawfully-issued warrant at the moment,' he said More[69] Here's another case of Leftist ideology being trumped by reality It is a great metaphor for Leftist ideology in general Ship of Fools 5 - Yet Another Greenie Expedition Scuppered by Ice[70]: Yet another Arctic expedition to raise awareness of 'global warming' has been frustrated by unexpectedly large quantities of ice. A Crime Against Humanity[71] Given all the suffering it has caused, is socialism a hate crime?  Scott McKay American Spectator August 27, 2018 Last week at the New Criterion, conservative scholar James Piereson posed an interesting question[72], arguing the affirmative: is socialism a hate crime? As is his custom, Piereson makes a solid case. His isn't a complex argument   Piereson simply totals up the corpses thanks to the world's chief practitioners of socialist governance in the 20th\u00a0century, and concludes that anything which leads to the deaths of more than 110 million souls has to be a hate crime by the definition afforded us by the modern gatekeepers of the term The socialist movement has been responsible for the murder, imprisonment, and torture of many millions, and perhaps hundreds of millions, of innocent people during its heyday in the twentieth century. That history of murder and tyranny continues on a smaller scale today in the handful of countries living under the misfortune of socialism   for example, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, and (more recently) Venezuela. How do socialists escape the indictment that, in view of the historical record, they are purveyors of tyranny and mass murder? Many deny that Stalin, Mao, and the others were true socialists and, indeed, that socialism has never really been tried   a manifest absurdity. Senator Sanders and others claim that they are for something called 'democratic socialism,' a popular and peaceful version of the doctrine, but that's what Lenin, Mao, and Castro said until they seized power and immediately began to sing a different tune. Democracy and diversity are what they say when out of power; tyranny and authoritarianism are what they practice once in power. That is the tried-and-true technique of all socialist movements The question is often asked: why does the same thing happen over and over in socialist regimes? F. A. Hayek answered this question as long ago as 1944, when he published The Road to Serfdom, his classic critique of socialism The brutal history of socialism was yet fully to play out in the post-war era, but the lessons Hayek drew from Stalin and Hitler would turn out to apply perfectly to Mao, Castro, the Kim dynasty, and all of the socialist tyrants who came later. In socialist movements, as Hayek pointed out, there is a tendency for the most brutal and unscrupulous people to rise to the top because they are the types who are willing to take the necessary steps to seize power and who prize the kind of absolute power that socialism promises. Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mao, and Pol Pot Socialist policies, moreover, are always going to fail because it is impossible for central planners efficiently to allocate capital, goods, and services across a large economy. Socialism, after all, was always a political doctrine and never a plausible economic theory. When there arose shortages of food or housing or military equipment   when socialist policies failed   leaders were faced with a choice of admitting failure and abandoning the socialist path or doubling down on their policies and preserving their power. It was in their nature to choose the latter course, and thus to press forward with more extreme measures, which typically involved the identification of scapegoats and counter-revolutionary elements as causes of failure More[73] Parents Fight Back After Atlanta School Replaces 'Pledge of Allegiance' With Oath to 'Global Society'[74] Here's more proof that the activism of people like us works Dave Cristina Laila The Gateway Pundit August 27, 2018  Parents are fighting back after a charter school in Atlanta replaced the Pledge of Allegiance with an oath to 'global society.' Lara Zelski, principal of Atlanta Neighborhood Charter School recently announced that in an effort to be a more inclusive community, the students will also pledge an oath to their community and global society. Zelski proposed creating a pledge based on 'students' civic responsibility to their school family, community, country and our global society,' reported ACJ.com[75]. Thankfully the parents fought back and the controversy grabbed the attention of Georgia House Speaker David Ralston and gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp, resulting in a reversal of the anti-American policy. By about 6:15 p.m., the school issued a statement saying its policies were aligned with those of the Georgia Department of Education but ' it appears there was some miscommunication and inconsistency in the rollout. Starting next week, we will return to our original format and provide our students with the opportunity to recite the Pledge during the all-school morning meeting.' More[76] Why Palestine Became a Litmus Test for Muslim Candidate Rashida Tlaib[77] Shireen Qudosi The Clarion Project Tuesday, August 21, 2018  On August 9th, 2018, Palestine became a litmus test for Muslim candidate Rashida Tlaib over accusations that she was not vocal enough about Palestine during her campaign. Electronic Intifada[78] ran a critical piece[79] on Tlaib   a Palestinian American[80] and Democratic congressional candidate in Michigan   arguing that her words have not been 'comforting.'  Speaking to Jewish voters at a Detroit synagogue, Tlaib was quoted saying, 'We need to be honest[81] about dehumanization on both sides and more importantly, we need to not be choosing a side.'  For many Muslims (candidates and activists alike), the issue of Palestine becomes a litmus test of one's loyalty to his or her Muslim identity. This summer, writer and media personality Wajahat Ali also faced intense scrutiny over his feature in The Atlantic that explored[82] the perspective of Israeli settlers. Despite a laundry list of accomplishments that brought him immense support and a growing public platform, this one piece blacklisted him in the Muslim community (including a call to boycott Ali).  The Israel-Palestine issue is one of the most significant geopolitical multi-generational issues of our time, especially for Muslims. How Muslims respond to that conflict often determines how we respond to other issues: Will we bring dialogue or adopt a rigid[83] mentality?  Western Muslims often discuss Palestine with religious undertones, turning a geopolitical issue into a religious one. Certainly, for many non-Palestinian Muslims, Palestine has become a religious cause.  Yet, we don't see the same deep concern with Muslims over other foreign conflicts that involve Muslims, whether it be in Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Indonesia, or any other Muslim country or Muslim population facing exceptional challenges. When Islamists only care about the Palestinian issue with selective focus, the issue isn't the Palestinian people   the issue is Israel and the anti-Semitism woven into the thread of our faith by propagandists over the course of 1,400 years More[84]  We Must Defeat the Threats to Higher Education[85] Newt Gingrich Ammoland August 27, 2018  The United States is home to the world's highest-ranking colleges and universities. Indeed, our higher education system is one of our greatest assets. Yet, we do too little to defend it. In 2017, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, more than\u00a020 million[86]\u00a0students planned to attend U.S. colleges and universities, and the National Science Foundation reported that more than\u00a0800,000[87] international students were enrolled in institutions of higher education. Most of these international students, faculty members, and researchers are here to capitalize on America's educational opportunities, however, some are here to exploit the openness of our higher education system. According to an\u00a0advisory warning[88]\u00a0released by the FBI in 2011, foreign intelligence services target American universities to recruit student and faculty to be agents of espionage and attempt to steal technical information and products. The FBI also reported that certain foreign actors illicitly exploit the student visa program and use universities hubs to spread false information and political propaganda. For example, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified in front of the Senate Committee on Intelligence in\u00a0February 2018[89]\u00a0that China utilizes 'the use of nontraditional collectors, especially in the academic setting, whether it's professors, scientists, students, we see in almost every field office that the FBI has around the country.' He added that, '[China is] exploiting the very open research and development environment that we have, which we all revere. But they're taking advantage of it.' In\u00a0March 2018[90], nine Iranians were charged by the Department of Justice after computer systems at 144 American universities were targeted in a cyber theft conspiracy. Additionally, back in 2014, the FBI\u00a0issued\u00a0[91]an advisory stating that, 'the Cuban intelligence services are known to actively target the U.S. academic world for the purposes of recruiting agents, in order to both obtain useful information and conduct influence activities.' These are only a few examples. Many other countries are looking to infiltrate and take advantage of the United States, so more must be done domestically to counteract this rising threat - while still maintaining the integrity of America's higher education institutions. One path forward is Senator Ted Cruz's\u00a0Stop Higher Education Espionage and Theft Act of 2018\u00a0[92](SHEET), which he introduced in the Senate on\u00a0May 22. If passed, the SHEET Act will give the Director of the FBI the authority to formally designate a foreign actor as a 'foreign intelligence threat to higher education.' In order to receive such a designation, a foreign actor must have exploited the resources of an institution to engage in illicit activities such as espionage, fraud, theft of trade secrets, or interception of communications. More[93] Mauro: US Must Wake Up to the New Turkey[94]. Director of the Clarion Intelligence Network and Shillman Fellow Ryan Mauro says[95] America must wake up to the new Turkey and not think that President Erdogan[96] is our ally. With this perspective, President Trump has the opportunity to decisively change the Middle East. Iran Signs Deal With Syria to Deepen Military Cooperation[97]  Agreement comes as U.S. and Israel push for Tehran's complete withdrawal from the country  Asa Fitch in Dubai and Sune Rasmussen in Beirut The Wall Street Journal Aug. 27, 2018  Iran said Monday that it had agreed to a deal to deepen military cooperation with Syria, reaffirming its intention to remain in the country despite moves by the U.S. and its allies to contain Tehran's military reach. Iran and Syria reached the deal following meetings Sunday between their defense ministers and Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, according to Iran's semiofficial Tasnim News Agency. The report offered no further details. Syrian state-linked media said the two sides reaffirmed the need the develop long-term cooperation, but made no mention of a new deal. Iran has sent thousands of its own and allied forces to Syria to fight alongside Mr. Assad's troops, and has also supported the Syrian regime with weaponry and oil. The move to further cement the partnership comes as the Trump administration and Israel amplify calls for Iran to withdraw completely from Syria[98]. Beating back Tehran has been a central goal of U.S. foreign policy under President Trump, who withdrew the U.S. in May from the Iran nuclear deal [99]and has started reimposing sanctions[100] that had been lifted under the Obama-era pact. Iranian forces have been involved in Syria's civil war since 2013, coming to the aid of Mr. Assad as he fended off a challenge from rebel groups and Islamic State extremists. Russia intervened to support Mr. Assad in 2015, helping him gain the upper hand in the conflict, which has now stretched more than seven years. With Mr. Assad tightening his grip, the U.S. and Israel are worried that Iranian influence is now entrenched in Syria. Mr. Trump wants to prevent Iran developing ballistic missiles and expanding a military footprint that could threaten Israel or other U.S. allies in the region. In a sign of how seriously Israel takes the threat, Israeli missiles struck Iranian targets in Syria in May[101], its largest assault inside Syria in about seven years. Israeli officials said the strikes destroyed dozens of Iranian military targets and Syrian anti-aircraft installations. Last week, White House national security adviser John Bolton said Russian President Vladimir Putin believed Russian and Iranian interests in Syria weren't aligned, 'and that [Mr. Putin] would be content to see Iranian forces all sent back to Iran,' recounting a conversation between Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump. But Mr. Bolton said Mr. Putin indicated he couldn't evict Iran from Syria by himself, suggesting the Russian president's leverage over Mr. Assad had limits. Moscow has previously offered to keep Iran and its allied militias tens of miles from the Israeli border, but its ambassador to Israel has stressed that Russia won't work to evict Iran from Syria. Iranians play a 'very, very important role in our common and joint effort to eliminate terrorists in Syria,' Anatoly Viktorov told Israeli media in July. Mr. Assad has previously said that Iran's presence in Syria wasn't negotiable and wouldn't be part of a political settlement over the country's future More[102] Nation That Sparked Arab Spring Finds Itself a Springboard for Illegal Migration[103]  Plagued by an economic crisis at home, more Tunisians are sneaking into Europe; 'They all reach a point of despair'  It's so tragic Muslims themselves suffer Islam's harmful effects the worst And they know something is wrong, yet they cannot allow themselves to blame Islam Instead, they leave whatever land Islam has ruined and move to greener pastures In doing so, they leave a blighted land, but carry the spore of the blight in their brains turning the green pastures they escape red with Islamic violence and dysfunction Dave Jared Malsin The Wall Street Journal Aug. 27, 2018  AL ATAYA, Tunisia More than seven years after Tunisians overthrew their country's dictatorship in a revolution that spawned the Arab Spring, the country's economy is in crisis[104] and thousands of people are sneaking into Europe, as part of a new wave of clandestine migration from what had been a North African success story. A fishing community here of low-slung stone houses, on the Mediterranean's Kerkennah Islands, has become a gathering point for smugglers sending young Tunisians to Italy. The young people sail by night on fishing boats, hoping to find jobs and a new life on European shores to the north. The exodus is a sign of the widespread sense of disaffection with the country following the euphoric ouster of autocrat Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011. 'They all reach a point of despair,' Zine Abdedine Warda, a 54-year-old shipbuilder and teacher in Al Ataya, said of the young men boarding the boats. 'There's nothing for them on land, so they leave by sea.' Tunisians now represent the largest population of migrants entering Italy on smugglers' boats. More than 3,300 Tunisians have arrived in Italy this year, according to the United Nations. Nearly 6,000 others have been arrested for attempting to leave the country illegally, the Tunisian government said. The surge in Tunisia's illegal migration comes as Italian and Libyan authorities corral more boats from neighboring Libya, a route frequented by people from sub-Saharan Africa. Eritreans and Sudanese people make up the second- and third-largest share of arrivals in Italy.

The young Greek reacted immediately, fighting all three of them. During the fight the 25-year-old Greek fell off the cliff, resulting in fatal injuries. The gang fled due to the screams of his girlfriend. Though the hellenic police arrived immediately, the culprits managed to escape. An ambulance took the victim to a local hospital where he died despite doctors' efforts. According to the Portuguese woman's statement to police, the culprits had a dark Asian complexion More[108] Germany migrants: Merkel condemns 'vigilantes' after Chemnitz murder[109] The people of Europe have had it with being victimized in the name of multiculturalism and inclusiveness The backlash isn't going to be pretty and it won't be fair but the multiculturalists knowingly sowed the seeds of this conflict And yet Merkel still doesn't get it or at least she won't admit it Dave BBC News 27 August 2018  German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said 'vigilante justice' will not be tolerated after far-right unrest over a murder in the eastern city of Chemnitz. Scuffles have broken out during two days of protests by hundreds of people in the city centre since a German was stabbed to death early on Sunday. A Syrian man and an Iraqi man have been arrested on suspicion of murder. Police were still out in strength on Monday evening, braced for new demonstrations by both right and left. They are also investigating alleged assaults on an Afghan, a Syrian and a Bulgarian during the unrest. Reports have spoken of aggressive protesters chasing foreigners, though there are few details, and police have appealed for witnesses to the assaults to hand over any video they may have recorded. A far-right football fan group called Kaotic Chemnitz had earlier called out supporters to show 'who is in charge', while protesters on Sunday could be seen chanting 'We are the people!' and 'This is our city!'. Bottles were thrown on Sunday by protesters at police, who were reinforced by officers from other cities. What happened? It is unclear what triggered a fight which reportedly preceded the stabbing, at about 03:15 (01:15 GMT) on Sunday, on the sidelines of a street festival, which has now been cancelled. The victim, a carpenter aged 35, was mortally wounded and died in hospital. Two other German men with him, aged 33 and 38, were seriously hurt, police say. The Syrian detainee is 23 and the Iraqi 22. Police have denied rumours on social media that the fight was linked to the sexual harassment of a woman.  How did protests spread? Initially, about 100 people gathered on Sunday for a rally which passed off without incident, AFP news agency reports. However, some 800 people later gathered at the Karl Marx monument, a focal point in the centre of Chemnitz. The monument is a throwback to the city's days as a model socialist city in the former German Democratic Republic, when it was renamed Karl-Marx-Stadt. It appears that such a large, angry demonstration took police by surprise. Freelance journalist Johannes Grunert told Spiegel Online he had witnessed some protesters using bottles to attack people 'who did not look German'[110]  More[111] The post FREEDOM UPDATE: CNN Leaving a Trail of Fake News and Dirty Deeds; More[112] appeared first on Western Free Press[113].

Since CNN's article published, Davis has admitted to the Washington Post, CNN's Anderson Cooper, and now Buzzfeed that he actually has no such knowledge of Cohen knowing such a thing. He also said he regretted lying about it on CNN's air last week. Davis had told[2] CNN's Anderson Cooper last Wednesday, 'I think the reporting of the story got mixed up in the course of a criminal investigation,' but denied being the source of CNN's original story. </p><p>That turned out to be a lie. 'I made a mistake,' Davis told[3] Buzzfeed. 'I did not mean to be cute,' he said regarding his interview with Cooper. The original CNN report[4], by Jim Sciutto, Carl Bernstein, and Marshall Cohen, claimed that Cohen had personally witnessed Donald Trump, Jr. informing Trump about the meeting, which would contradict the president's statements that he did not know about it. Trump denied the report at the time: ..I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary's lawyer. Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice!   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2018[5] Now, Davis is backtracking. In recent days, he has admitted that he acted as an anonymous source for multiple news outlets who were seeking to confirm the CNN article, and has backed away from his original claim. The New York Post[6]\u00a0and the Washington Post[7]\u00a0has outed him as their confirming source, and published apologies from Davis. CNN   which cited 'sources with knowledge' in its original report, has refused to back down. The report also said Davis had 'declined to comment.' When contacted by Buzzfeed, CNN said, 'We stand by our story, and are confident in our reporting of it.' More[8] Another Very Fake News Scandal Engulfs CNN with Fake Michael Cohen Russia Story[9] Matthew Boyle 27 Aug 2018 Washington, D.C. - Another very fake news scandal has engulfed CNN as the network's credibility crisis reaches another fever pitch just over a year after three senior network staffers were forced to resign in disgrace over a similar scandal. This time, though, famed Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein is at the center of the scandal, and the network for now is dug in despite deep criticism from across the political and ideological spectrum as far-ranging as Breitbart News and Daily Caller among others on one side, and the Associated Press, Washington Post, BuzzFeed, and more on the other. It all began on July 27 when CNN's Bernstein shared a byline with former Barack Obama administration official[10]\u00a0and chief CNN national security correspondent Jim Sciutto, along with CNN researcher and producer Marshall Cohen, with the headline: 'Cohen claims Trump knew in advance of 2016 Trump Tower meeting.' The fact that Bernstein-who along with Bob Woodward broke and chronicled the Watergate scandal that led to the eventual resignation of Richard Nixon from the presidency-was on the byline was significant, as it threw the weight and heft of his personal credibility behind the network's story. In the piece, Bernstein, Sciutto, and Cohen used anonymous 'sources' to claim that President Donald Trump's now former personal attorney Michael Cohen was willing to undercut President Trump's claims about the famed 2016 Trump Tower meeting that the president's son Donald Trump, Jr., his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort had with a Russian attorney with links to the Kremlin More[11] Roger Stone: Ronan Farrow Preparing Report Claiming I Knew Contents of WikiLeaks Emails Before Release[12] We're supposed to take mainstream media reports from anonymous sources seriously??? This would be pathetic, except for it being so dangerous If we accepted allegations from anonymous sources, how could they be cross-examined? Each of us would become fair game for outrageous slander Dave Joshua Caplan Breitbart News 27 Aug 2018  In a video posted to Instagram Monday, Roger Stone revealed Ronan Farrow of The New Yorker will soon publish a report alleging the\u00a0longtime Republican operative\u00a0personally briefed then-candidate Donald Trump in October 2016 on the contents of a series of emails published by WikiLeaks in the run-up to the presidential election. 'Somebody has been pushing a fake news story.' Stone begins. 'First with the New York Times, then the Washington Post, and now with Ronan Farrow of the New Yorker. Someone is saying that they overheard a conversation, which I told Donald Trump in October of 2016 what exactly would be in the WikiLeaks disclosures and when they would be disclosed.' The Trump ally denied the veracity of the forthcoming story predicated on a second-hand account about the alleged conversation between Stone and then-candidate Trump, characterizing it as 'categorically false,' and 'exactly the epitome of fake news.' 'Let whoever is pushing this false narrative come forward and say it for the record, with their name on it,' Stone dared. 'They won't because it is false.'

Camerota, during a New Day segment led by the chyron 'Remembering John McCain,' repeatedly requested Sununu's comment on reports   based on anonymous sources from CNN and the Washington Post   that the White House had rejected a proposal to release a statement regarding 'John McCain's service and sacrifice.' Sununu charged Camerota with playing 'political games' to 'exploit' allegations related to McCain's death. He chided the anchor for pushing this narrative instead of just letting him pay tribute to his dead friend. Partial transcript below [emphases added]. CAMEROTA: So governor, what do you think about President Trump rejecting the practice of putting out an official White House statement about John McCain's service and sacrifice? SUNUNU: Look, that was printed in the Washington Post, and I have to be honest with you, I don't put much credence to what I read in the Post. CAMEROTA: We also have that reporting. SUNUNU: Yeah, well. Same thing applies, Alisyn. CAMEROTA: Governor, you come on CNN and we appreciate you coming on CNN and we appreciate your take on it, but I don't appreciate you denigrating our reporting. I think that you know we have excellent reporters here, but are you saying that you don't want to believe that? You don't want to believe that President Trump would do that about John McCain? SUNUNU: I'm saying that I don't want to comment on a report that I haven't satisfied myself is correct. CAMEROTA: And if that report were true? SUNUNU: I'm not going to answer the hypothetical. CAMEROTA: It's not a hypothetical. This is our reporting. We have rock-solid sources in the White House SUNUNU: I think this effort to create a cleavage between the White House and those that are mourning John McCain really does disturb me. It is this effort by the press to accentuate the negative that I think have created the climate that prevents, in the long term, the bipartisanship that John McCain supported. I don't want to be a part of rubbing whatever salt there in whatever wound there may be, because I think that just adds to the division. I'm here because I lost a good friend. I wanted to express my concern about that. I'm not here to play the political games that some in the press want to play at this moment of great sorrow for the country. CAMEROTA: To be clear, we don't see it as a game SUNUNU: I'm here to talk about my friend, John McCain. You appear to be here to talk about something that you think you can exploit, and I find that rather unpleasant. The video[15] Jake Tapper Praises 'Golden Age of Journalism,' Trump Policies 'Built' on 'Racism'[16] CNN has to praise itself because everyone else knows it is a fraud See the bolded section where Tapper completely contradicts himself It is as if he were saying'Cheating is dishonest, cheating undermines trust, cheating is destructive but if we didn't cheat we wouldn't win!' Where is this 'horrific' 'white supremacy' of Trump's that Tapper points to as his excuse for tossing objective journalism out the window? Where are the cases? Notice that he doesn't cite any He's just making stuff up! Dave Robert Kraychik Breitbart News 27 Aug 2018  CNN's Jake Tapper described some of President Donald Trump's policies as being built on 'racism' while praising what he said was today's 'golden age of journalism.' He made his remarks last Thursday at\u00a0the American Society of Travel Agents convention in Washington, DC. Tapper said that some of Trump's policies are occasionally built on 'racism,' 'in the views of many people' [emphasis added]: 'How are these policy disruptions being implemented? Just from a purely journalistic standpoint, I think it's fair to say that bureaucratically   I don't mean that pejoratively, but just the idea of how it's functioning   a lot of times these proposals are done impulsively, a lot of times they're done without explaining why they're being done, a lot of times they're done without interagency discussion, a lot of times they're done without any sense of diplomacy, a lot of time they're done without any sort of communication with experts or even cabinet secretaries that are relevant to the policy, and sometimes they're built on foundations that are, shall we say, made of sand. Whether it is built on lies, facts that are not accurate, or racism, in the views of many people, callousness, or even just a lack of understanding.' Tapper framed himself as a voice for 'basic facts, basic truth, and basic decency,' while implicitly accusing Trump of not condemning 'white supremacy': 'Where it is difficult to be a journalist today is when it comes to what I perceive as standing up for basic facts, basic truth, and basic decency. These are the only things and principles I try to take a stance on, because as a journalist, I don't think it's my position to say, 'This tax bill is good. This tax bill is bad. This candidate is good. This candidate is bad.' But when it comes to basic decency, I think we can all agree that white supremacy is horrific and an outdated and anachronistic ideology that should be condemned by polite society.' Tapper cast Trump as a violator of 'norms' and 'decency': 'I've never seen this kind of disregard for norms as pervasive as it is. In my lifetime, I have never seen the disregard for norms of this is true, this is not true, this is decent, this is not decency.' Tapper praised the broader news media landscape, describing today as a 'golden age of journalism': 'I see a lot of excellent journalism being done. This is a golden age of journalism in a lot of ways. The New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times; there's some really great journalism being done, right now. I think we're doing a lot of great journalism at CNN.'

D. Adler Breitbart News 27 Aug 2018  Editors on Wikipedia, the site relied on by the Masters of the Universe for reliable and accurate information, have added President Trump to a list of advocates for the 'white genocide conspiracy theory' due to his recent tweets about South Africa farm attacks and government land expropriation. Other prominent conservatives were also added to the list including Donald Trump Jr., Tucker Carlson, and Ann Coulter. Last Wednesday, President Trump tweeted[19] about the regular attacks on white-owned farms in South Africa and recent government plans to expropriate land from white farmers without compensation. Following media criticism of his statement, the President was added[20] to a Wikipedia list of 'advocates' for the 'white genocide conspiracy theory' described there as 'a neo-Nazi, alt-right, conservative, white nationalist, and supremacist conspiracy theory.' At the same time President Trump was branded as an advocate of a 'conspiracy theory,' South African politician Julius Malema was added to a list of 'critics' of the 'conspiracy theory' due to his criticism of Trump's tweets.\u00a0Malema[21], head of South Africa's Economic Freedom Fighters party and advocate[22] of expropriation of white land without compensation, is well known for his\u00a0own remarks[23] flirting with the idea of genocide as noted on his Wikipedia page[24]. Such remarks include singing[25] 'Shoot the Boer', a reference to descendants of Dutch settlers in the country, and stating[26] they were not 'for now' calling for the slaughter of whites. The article's intro was also changed[27] to claim Trump 'made the conspiracy theory a part of United States foreign policy' with his tweets. One editor repeatedly[28]\u00a0removed[29] the addition[30] of Trump to the article, but his edits were undone by several[31] established[32] editors[33]. An editor did\u00a0alter the material[34] to clarify Trump was merely accused of being an advocate. At the discussion page for the article, another editor objected[35] that Trump was not an advocate of a conspiracy theory, but merely stating facts. Current and former members of the site's powerful Arbitration Committee, previously involved[36] in defending the violent far-left Antifa, responded to cite sources[37] mentioning Trump in connection with this 'conspiracy theory' and endorse[38] his inclusion on the list. One of them, administrator Drmies, did express some annoyance[39] citing policies stating Wikipedia is not a news site[40]. Drmies, however, also told[41] the editor objecting to Trump's inclusion he was 'treading on really thin ice' with his objection. Drmies has previously threatened and made questionable bans[42] on similar topics. Many other conservative figures were included on the list due mostly to comments about South Africa, which was initially added[43] to the page by editor Carpatho, whose contributions[44] appear to be focused[45] entirely on the subject. Carpatho made[46] numerous[47] expansions[48] to the list. Among those added were conservative commentator Ann Coulter, libertarian philosopher, and previous subject[49] of Wikipedia smear campaigns Stefan Molyneux, Lauren Southern due to her documentary\u00a0Farmlands\u00a0about South Africa farm attacks, Katie Hopkins of Rebel Media, and Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes.

The president suggested that the tech giant may be behaving in an illegal manner by skewing its search results, and promised that Google's biased search results 'will be addressed.' Trump previously[54] called out Google's search bias during his 2016 election campaign. Google search results for 'Trump News' shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake New Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me others, so that almost all stories news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative Fair Media is shut out. Illegal? 96% of results on 'Trump News' are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2018[55] This followed a report[56] from a conservative columnist that 96 of her search results for 'Trump' in Google News were from establishment and left-leaning news sources. Trump has turned his fire on Silicon Valley in recent weeks, following an unprecedented crackdown by platforms like Twitter and YouTube against conservative and anti-establishment content. He has said[57] it is 'dangerous' for social media platforms to ban accounts, and has accused social media platforms of discrimination[58] against conservatives and Republicans. His comments echo recent criticism of Silicon Valley made by other top Republicans, including GOP majority leader Kevin McCarthy, Texas Senator Ted Cruz,\u00a0RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, and Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale. Although search bias is harder to detect than the bans of prominent conservatives on social media platforms, it can potentially have a far greater impact on elections  More[59] Tiger Woods' 'respect the office' statement about Trump blasted by ESPN host Max Kellerman[60] According to the mainstream media a neutral and nonpolitical answer to a question about a personal friend is now grounds for being the target of a furious rant Why? Because Tiger Woods' friendship with President Trump undermines the entire 'Trump is a racist neo-Nazi' narrative that the MSM echo chamber is trying to manufacture as justification for removing Trump from office Dave Ryan Gaydos Fox News August 28, 2018 ESPN's Max Kellerman said Monday on 'First Take' that Tiger Woods' response to questions about President Trump made him 'angry.' Woods was asked after the final round of The Northern Trust[61] on Sunday about his relationship with Trump and he urged people to respect the office of the president. 'He's the president of the United States. You have to respect the office. No matter who is in the office, you may like, dislike personality or the politics, but we all must respect the office,' he said. Kellerman blasted Woods' remarks, saying it was a 'thoughtless statement dressed up as a thoughtful statement And it either holds in contempt the intelligence of people who hear it or else it's just a stupid thing to say. To say you must have respect for the office   Tiger, be clear. Are you saying that the office, therefore, confers respect onto its present temporary occupant? No. Having respect for the office means principally, in my view, is the office holder should have respect for the office,' The co-host continued: 'We are held to a standard of behavior, we at our jobs, right, people in their daily lives. The president, if anything, is held to a higher standard of behavior. It is not such that we have such great respect for the office that no matter what the behavior of its occupant, we must respect the occupant because of the office. No. Tiger Woods is being slick. We must respect the office therefore that confers respect to the occupant. Tiger, is that is what you are saying? If that is what you are saying, that is a stupid comment.' Trump and Woods have been golfing partners for years and have remained in touch since Trump took office. 'Well, I've known Donald for a number of years,' Woods said. 'We've played golf together. We've had dinner together. I've known him pre-presidency and obviously during his presidency.'

A researcher from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, uncovered[64] last week that Google had access to data for users opting to use the private browsing mode on the Google Chrome web browser. 'If you don't want Google Chrome to remember your activity, you can browse the web privately in Incognito mode,' a Google Chrome help page[65] reads. But apparently, that doesn't mean that Google can't obtain the data from private browsing sessions. 'While such data is collected with user-anonymous identifiers, Google has the ability to connect this collected information with a user's personal credentials stored in their Google Account,' the Vanderbilt researcher wrote in the report. More than half of all internet users use the Google Chrome browser. Chrome has been installed on over 2 billion machines, across both desktop, laptop, and mobile devices. Reports from earlier in August revealed[66] that Google was tracking all user's locations even after users had turned the location tracking feature off.\u00a0According to the\u00a0Associated Press, who launched an investigation into the tracking, computer scientists 'found that many Google services on Android devices and iPhones store your location data even if you've used a privacy setting that says it will prevent Google from doing so.' A Google spokesperson gave a non-answer when asked about user tracking. 'There are a number of different ways that Google may use location to improve people's experience, including: Location, History, Web and App Activity, and through device-level Location Services,' the spokesperson said.\u00a0'We provide clear descriptions of these tools, and robust controls so people can turn them on or off, and delete their histories at any time.' New browsers like Brave are attempting to fill the market gap by providing users with a totally private web browsing experience. It remains unclear whether or not Google will adjust their Chrome product to offer their users more privacy.

More[77] Social Media Platforms Don't Actually Need to Ban Anyone[78] Glad to see President Trump saying what Freedom Update has been saying all along As with telephone conversations, it is not the job of the service provider to listen in and interfere with communications If it is anyone's job at all, it is the job of the federal government for the restricted purposes of law enforcement and national security and constrained by judicial oversight to prevent abuse We all know government oversight is far from perfect but this is true for law enforcement and national security in general Imperfect as it is, it is still better than allowing service providers to act as censors When they do, we go back into the days of 'Whites only' lunch counters And that is where we are today, where far Left messages spread without hindrance while conservative messages are quashed The social media companies' rules don't protect usWhy then should they protect the Left? Dave Allum Bokhari Breitbart News 27 Aug 2018  President Trump's recent comments on social media censorship suggest he doesn't think social media platforms should be allowed to ban anyone for any reason. Some would call this a radical proposal, but they're\u00a0wrong. Social media companies could easily move to a 'no bans' policy, with little disruption to their users. Trump ramped up his public denunciations of big tech's far-left bias in recent weeks, following the unprecedented censorship[79] of prominent conservatives in the run-up to the midterm elections. In a series of tweets [80]on August 18, the President accused social media giants of 'totally discriminating' against conservatives and Republicans, and called on tech giants to 'Let everybody participate, good bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!' He reiterated his comments a few days later, in an interview[81] with Reuters, stating\u00a0'I think it's a very dangerous thing when they are their own regulator in terms of who's going to be on Facebook and who's going to be on Twitter. I think that whether it's conservative or liberal, I think that it's very dangerous.' At a rally in West Virginia the following day, the President said[82] that social media users have, in effect, converted ordinary citizens into journalists who deserved no fewer free speech protections than CNN. 'Every one of us is sort of like a newspaper, you have Twitter Facebook you can't have censorship.\u00a0I'd rather have fake news like CNN than have anybody - including liberals, socialists than have anybody stopped and censored.' The implication of Trump's words is clear   social media companies should be prohibited\u00a0from banning anyone for lawful speech. It should instead be up to users to decide what content they want to see on social media ('we will all just have to figure it out!'). This sounds like a radical proposal, but Trump is perfectly correct. There is no reason for a social media company to ban\u00a0any\u00a0content on behalf of its users More[83] Online Propaganda Builds Islamic State Brand in the Face of Military Losses[84] Extremist group uses claims of attacks to maintain relevance as it faces pressure in Syria and Iraq Speaking of censorship, here is a perfect exampleof a case where all the powers of the federal government would be appropriate for a crackdown on an on-line presence The Islamic State is in a state of war with us and yet online service providers treat its presence no differently from other sites They simply take them down when reported to have violated company standards In fact, one could argue that service providershave been more permissive with the Islamic State than they have been with those who speak out against the Islamist threat When censorship is reserved to the executive branch of government it won't be done to hammer down lawful speech (without a means of recourse) and better resources can be applied to hammer down national security threats Final point: The Islamic State can project itself across the internet because it is fundamentally an ideology, not an organization We can only defeat IS once we set out to defeat its Islamist ideology Dave Sune Engel Rasmussen The Wall Street Journal Aug. 26, 2018  Islamic State has lost most of the territory it once held in Syria and Iraq. It is vying for survival with other, sometimes stronger, extremist groups. But one sphere where Islamic State still reigns supreme among terrorists is in cyberspace. The group's vast online presence is a critical recruitment and marketing tool that has helped it build a brutish brand using propaganda and sometimes false claims. Maintaining the perception that Islamic State can shape the actions of loyalists has become all the more important as its territorial control, or self-declared caliphate, has almost completely collapsed. The latest example of the role of such online propaganda came on Thursday, when Islamic State's official news outlet claimed that a man who stabbed his mother and sister to death in France had responded to its calls to attack citizens of countries that are part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting the group. French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb disputed the statement, saying the perpetrator was mentally unstable. That claim came a day after Islamic State released what it said was a recording of its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi[85], the first in nearly a year, calling for supporters abroad to continue attacks on Western cities. In October, the group claimed to have inspired the Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock[86], who killed 59 people attending a country-music concert. A month earlier, Islamic State said it had planted a bomb on a U.K.-bound flight that was held in Paris for what officials called a 'direct security threat.' Authorities in both cases rebuffed the group's assertions. Islamic State also claimed that a man who attacked a casino in the Philippine capital of Manila in June 2017 was a soldier of its caliphate, despite local authorities saying that the perpetrator was an indebted gambler [87]trying to make off with $2 million in chips. In internal field guides, Islamic State regards its propaganda as 'projectiles' fired into mainstream media. Threats and claims of attacks are intended to intimidate and destroy the morale of the enemy. In many cases, even if authorities don't establish specific links between an attacker in the West and Islamic State, the perpetrator has turned out to have been a consumer of the group's propaganda. The group, widely known as ISIS, frequently describes 'information wars' as important as its military battles, according to Charlie Winter, senior research fellow with the Institute for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence, a London-based think tank. 'ISIS uses propaganda as an extension of its military methods,' Mr. Winter said in an interview earlier this year. 'Terrorism is a way of communication more than anything else.'

'His courage and his strength [are] what I admire, and the results that he's already brought to this country in the 18 months that he's been in office,' Owens said, adding that Trump is 'producing results' as president despite the media's efforts to label him as a racist.

Trump should respond by doing this[108] Cal Thomas Fox News August 28, 2018 Finding someone in Washington who is nonpartisan and puts the nation's interests ahead of their own is so rare these days that he or she, if found, might well qualify as an endangered species. But once in a while   call it the law of averages   someone speaks the truth. It happened last week when Mark Penn, former adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton, wrote a column for The Hill[109] newspaper in which he claimed there is a big difference between how Hillary Clinton and President Trump have been treated when it comes to allegations of criminal behavior. Penn then appeared on Fox News[110] where he spoke of the 'double standard' applied to Trump and his associates compared to how Clinton was exonerated by FBI Director James Comey over her private email server and her handling of classified information. 'The investigations related to the email were handled with kid gloves, and the investigations related to Trump with all-out prosecutorial force of government and deep state might,' Penn said. It doesn't matter. The long knives have been drawn by those who want to reverse the results of the 2016 election and put themselves back in power. They will not be sheathed until blood is drawn, preferably the blood of the president, whose personality might not win him any good deportment citations on a grade school report card, but whose policies are making the nation stronger.  Neither does it matter that no evidence of Russian 'collusion' by the Trump campaign has yet to be uncovered. That train seems to have long ago left the station, replaced by other strategies to bring down the president, none of which were part of the special counsel's original mandate. Indeed, on July 13 when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced[111] the indictment of 12 Russians for their alleged roles in hacking computers at the Democratic National Committee and other sites, he said: 'There's no allegation in this document that any American citizen committed a crime. There's no allegation that the conspiracy changed the vote count or affected any election result.' Rosenstein knows the indicted Russians will never be extradited and tried, so it looks to most conservatives like a public relations stunt designed to show that Robert Mueller was pursuing what he had been tasked with discovering. Having failed to achieve that objective, the tentacles of his office have spread out in other directions, now reaching the Trump organization where its CEO has been granted full federal immunity and will likely be required to divulge anything   perhaps even those long-hidden Trump income tax returns, which Democrats have wanted made public since the 2016 campaign. President Trump needs to refocus and stop attacking his political enemies, and even his friends, and start worrying about his most pressing problem.

The spreadsheet, reported[115] by Axios, predicts Democrats will launch at least 18 probes of the Trump administration, including at least three related to Russia. One is 'Trump's dealings with Russia, including the president's preparation for his meeting with Vladimir Putin.' In a preview of Russia-related requests, House Intelligence Committee Democrats unsuccessfully raised a motion during a hearing in June on China to subpoena the U.S. interpreter who was present during President Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The motion was voted down by Republicans and failed, but if Democrats control the committee, they could succeed the next time they try. Another predicted probe is 'James Comey's firing.' Trump fired Comey on the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, but told NBC's Lester Holt that he was thinking about the 'Russia thing' when he did it.\u00a0Special Counsel Robert Mueller is already probing whether the president tried to obstruct the Russia investigation. GOP members predict Democrats will also investigate 'election security and hacking attempts'   clearly related to Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign aides during the 2016 presidential election, which the Clinton campaign blames for losing the election. The spreadsheet also reportedly compiles requests Democrats have already made for administration officials to testify, hearings to be scheduled, and communications about controversial policies and personnel decisions. Republicans have so far rejected them. 'These demands would turn the Trump White House into a 24/7 legal defense operation,' Axios reporter Jonathan Swan wrote. More[116] Venezuela's Tyranny of Bad Ideas[117] Socialism was a proven failure, but Hugo Ch\u00e1vez got his countrymen to try it. Daniel Pipes The Wall Street Journal Aug. 26, 2018  Ideas run the world. Good ones create freedom and wealth; bad ones, oppression and poverty. You are not what you eat, but what you think. Politicians in particular fall under the sway of ideas. As John Maynard Keynes put it, 'Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back. .\u00a0.\u00a0. It is ideas, not vested interests, which are dangerous for good or evil.' The story of Venezuela makes this point with singular clarity. In 1914 the discovery of oil brought the country vast revenues and produced a relatively free economy. By 1950 Venezuela enjoyed the fourth-highest per capita income in the world, behind only the U.S., Switzerland and New Zealand. As late as 1980, it boasted the world's fastest-growing[118] economy in the 20th century. In 2001 Venezuela still ranked as Latin America's wealthiest country. Venezuela's troubles, however, had begun long before. Starting around 1958, government interference in the economy, including price and exchange controls, higher taxes, and restrictions on property rights, led to decades of stagnation, with per capita real income declining[119] 0.13% from 1960-97. Still, it remained a normal, functioning country. Today the country with the world's largest oil reserves suffers from a severely contracting economy, runaway inflation, despotism, mass emigration, criminality, disease, hunger and starvation, with circumstances deteriorating daily. Venezuela's economy contracted by 16% in 2016, 14% last year and a predicted 15% in 2018. Inflation was at 112% in 2015 and 2,800% at the end of last year. Economist Steve Hanke finds[120] an annualized rate of around 65,000% for 2018, making Venezuela's one of the most severe hyperinflations ever. Food shortages led[121] to an average weight loss among Venezuelans of 18 pounds in 2016 and 24 pounds in 2017. What caused this crisis? Foreign invasion, civil war, natural disaster, substitutes for oil, or agricultural plagues? No, bad ideas, pure and simple. Socialism might have been a proven failure globally, but Hugo Ch\u00e1vez convinced Venezuelans to try it Bad ideas have always existed, but they acquired new importance with the advent of liberalism in the late 17th century. Before then, conservatism respecting tradition while adapting it to new circumstances had prevailed. An individual king's or religious leader's besotted vision could progress only so far before convention rolled it back. Liberalism rendered tradition optional by optimistically deeming each person capable to think through the great issues from first principles on his own. Radical theories proliferated, especially during the French Revolution. The floodgates were opened for ideas unmoored from experience and common sense, such as conspiracy theories. These ideas incubated through the 19th century and came to terrible fruition after World War I with fascism, Nazism, socialism and communism. As historian Paul Johnson notes, 'The worst of all despotisms is the heartless tyranny of ideas.' At a moment when many Democrats are ignoring the lessons of Venezuela and swooning over socialism, it's back to the barricades in the war of ideas.  More[122] Who Is Linda Sarsour's Mentor?[123] Alex VanNess The Clarion Project Wednesday, August 22, 2018  Sharia[124]-apologist and Islamist activist Linda Sarsour is a controversial figure in her own right. But, who is Linda Sarsour's mentor? Last year, Linda Sarsour[125] addressed[126] the 54th ISNA Convention. Sarsour, who is one of\u00a0the most prominent Muslim activists in America, was widely criticized for calling on Muslims to wage 'jihad' against President Trump. [127]However, the most controversial remarks in her 22-minute speech came within the first two minutes when she gave a shout-out to her 'favorite person in this room,' radical imam[128] Siraj Wahhaj, who Sarsour called her 'mentor, motivator and encourager.' Recently, police raided[129] an extremist Islamist compound in New Mexico where compound leaders were training children to become school shooters. One of the leaders of this terrorist camp was none other than Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, son of Siraj Wahhaj. Siraj Ibn Wahhaj also kidnapped his own physically disabled child - the child was later found dead due to being deprived of his medicine and an exorcism ritual. Siraj Ibn Wahhaj attributed his son's condition to demonic possession. Ibn Wahhaj's compound was not a complete aberration; there are other cultish Islamist encampments in the U.S. In January 2018,\u00a0Clarion Project reported on FBI documents[130]\u00a0confirming Jamaat ul-Fuqra is training members in dozens of isolated communes across America and Canada. Fuqra, which now goes by the name of the Muslims of the Americas (MOA) among other titles, is a cultish Islamist group with a history of crime and terrorism. Fuqra conducts[131] basic paramilitary training in their camps in America (as well as elsewhere). Wahhaj, Sr. is no stranger to Fuqra/MOA. A number of former congregants at Wahhaj's Al-Taqwa mosque are involved with MOA, including Ali Abdelaziz[132] and Clement Rodney Hampton-El[133]. After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, Wahhaj gave a sermon[134] asking the question, 'Who are the real terrorists?' He named three entities: The U.S. government, big business and the media. Wahhaj served as a\u00a0character witness[135] for the 'Blind Sheikh[136],' Omar Abdel-Rahman, who was found guilty of masterminding terrorist plots against the United States, including his role in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Linda Sarsour's Mentor Called for Armed Jihad In 1992, Wahhaj\u00a0gave a sermon[137]\u00a0in which he\u00a0advocated[138]\u00a0for armed jihad[139] in streets for the benefit of Islam. Is it a stretch to hypothesize that\u00a0Ibn Wahhaj's actions were in some way influenced by his father and MOA members at his mosque? Sarsour has been a steadfast 'mentee' of Siraj Wahhaj. This is not to suggest that one day we'll find Sarsour running a compound in New Mexico, but Sarsour has a long history of distasteful views and associations with extremist figures. In 2017, for example, she attended a summit run by the radical left-wing group Jewish Voice for Peace, where she sat alongside[140] the convicted Palestinian terrorist, Rasmea Odeh[141], and gave her a\u00a0warm embrace[142]. While speaking,\u00a0Sarsour said[143] she was 'honored and privileged to be here in this space, and honored to be on this stage with Rasmea.' Sarsour has also called for people to\u00a0show solidarity[144]\u00a0with Muhammad Allan, a member of the terror group Islamic Jihad. Allan has a\u00a0history[145]\u00a0of recruiting suicide bombers. Sarsour also associates with the organization Al-Awda and its co-founder (an open and unapologetic Hezbollah\u00a0supporter[146]) Abbas Hamideh. Sarsour has\u00a0attended[147]\u00a0numerous rallies sponsored by Al-Awda, promoted[148]\u00a0and\u00a0solicited donations[149]\u00a0for their events, and spoken[150]\u00a0at their rallies More[151] Iranians in US Charged With Spying for Iran[152] Clarion Project Tuesday, August 21, 2018  Two Iranians in the U.S. were charged with spying for Iran.[153] The Justice Department, along with the FBI, announced the indictments saying Ahmadreza Mohammadi-Doostdar, 38, who holds dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship, and Majid Ghorbani, 59, a resident of California, were spying for Iran by conducting covert surveillance of Israeli and Jewish facilities in the United States. The two were also charged with collecting identifying information about American citizens and U.S. nationals who are members of the Iranian opposition group Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK). 'The National Security Division is committed to protecting the United States from individuals within our country who unlawfully act on behalf of hostile foreign nations,' said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers.\u00a0'Doostdar and Ghorbani are alleged to have acted on behalf of Iran, including by conducting surveillance of political opponents and engaging in other activities that could put Americans at risk.' Jessie K. Liu, United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, added, 'This indictment demonstrates the commitment of the Department of Justice to hold accountable agents of foreign governments who act illegally within the United States, especially where those agents are conducting surveillance of individuals and constitutionally-protected activities in this country.' According to the indictment, Doostdar traveled to the United States from Iran in the summer of 2017 to collect intelligence information about entities and individuals considered by the government of Iran to be their enemies, namely, Israeli and Jewish interests. Doostdar is alleged to have conducted surveillance of the Rohr Chabad House, a Jewish institution in Chicago, including photographing the security features surrounding the facility. Ghorbani is alleged to have attended a MEK rally in New York City in September 2017, during which he photographed individuals protesting against the Iranian regime. Later that year, Doostdar returned to the United States from Iran, made contact with Ghorbani and paid him close to $2,000 in cash for 28 pictures Ghorbani had taken at the rally. Many of the pictures contained hand-written notes identifying the participants. The indictment also alleges that Ghorbani traveled to Iran around March 2018 for an 'in-person briefing.'

Six Reasons Why AG Jeff Sessions is Trump's Hammer in the Fight Against Illegal Migration[159] Niel Munro Breitbart News 27 Aug 2018  Attorney General Jeff Sessions is using his legal expertise and his authority to aggressively implement President Donald Trump's policy against illegal immigration, even as he is\u00a0getting flak\u00a0from the President for recusing\u00a0himself from Democratic-cheered investigations into the President's campaign and business activities. The next step for Sessions, says source, is the release of federal regulations that will replace the 2015\u00a0Flores settlement which requires officials to release migrants within 20 days if they bring children with them over the border. The catch-and-release settlement was\u00a0created in 2015 by a judge, the ACLU, and\u00a0officials working for former President Barack Obama, and it has forced officials to release hundreds of thousands of Central American migrants who bring their children into the United States. But the pending Flores\u00a0regulation is just one of several major regulatory changes which Sessions which are shutting the various border loopholes which were created by pro-migration judges, advocacy groups and agency officials over the last 20 years. 'These changes are really possible because Jeff Sessions is Attorney General,' said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. Krikorian continued: 'He both knows what has to be done, and is committed to making sure it happens. A different AG, even if he means well, would be unlikely to have both the knowledge and commitment to get these kinds of change though, and that assumes he even wanted to do so.

The Budapest-based university, founded by Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, said Tuesday that the decision came due to uncertainty over how it would be legally and financially affected by the 25 percent levy imposed by the government on activities that it says assist immigration. Some 55 refugees or asylum seekers were to take part in the CEU programs, launched in 2016. The surtax, part of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's strong anti-immigration policy, affects 'all programs, actions and activities which directly or indirectly aim to promote immigration,' including networking, media campaigns, education activities and activities 'showing immigration in a positive light.'

Since CNN's article published, Davis has admitted to the Washington Post, CNN's Anderson Cooper, and now Buzzfeed that he actually has no such knowledge of Cohen knowing such a thing. He also said he regretted lying about it on CNN's air last week. Davis had told[2] CNN's Anderson Cooper last Wednesday, 'I think the reporting of the story got mixed up in the course of a criminal investigation,' but denied being the source of CNN's original story. </p><p>That turned out to be a lie. 'I made a mistake,' Davis told[3] Buzzfeed. 'I did not mean to be cute,' he said regarding his interview with Cooper. The original CNN report[4], by Jim Sciutto, Carl Bernstein, and Marshall Cohen, claimed that Cohen had personally witnessed Donald Trump, Jr. informing Trump about the meeting, which would contradict the president's statements that he did not know about it. Trump denied the report at the time: ..I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary's lawyer. Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2018[5] Now, Davis is backtracking. In recent days, he has admitted that he acted as an anonymous source for multiple news outlets who were seeking to confirm the CNN article, and has backed away from his original claim. The New York Post[6]and the Washington Post[7]has outed him as their confirming source, and published apologies from Davis. CNN \u2014 which cited 'sources with knowledge' in its original report, has refused to back down. The report also said Davis had 'declined to comment.' When contacted by Buzzfeed, CNN said, 'We stand by our story, and are confident in our reporting of it.' More[8] Another Very Fake News Scandal Engulfs CNN with Fake Michael Cohen Russia Story[9] Matthew Boyle 27 Aug 2018 Washington, D.C. - Another very fake news scandal has engulfed CNN as the network's credibility crisis reaches another fever pitch just over a year after three senior network staffers were forced to resign in disgrace over a similar scandal. This time, though, famed Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein is at the center of the scandal, and the network for now is dug in despite deep criticism from across the political and ideological spectrum as far-ranging as Breitbart News and Daily Caller among others on one side, and the Associated Press, Washington Post, BuzzFeed, and more on the other. It all began on July 27 when CNN's Bernstein shared a byline with former Barack Obama administration official[10]and chief CNN national security correspondent Jim Sciutto, along with CNN researcher and producer Marshall Cohen, with the headline: 'Cohen claims Trump knew in advance of 2016 Trump Tower meeting.' The fact that Bernstein-who along with Bob Woodward broke and chronicled the Watergate scandal that led to the eventual resignation of Richard Nixon from the presidency-was on the byline was significant, as it threw the weight and heft of his personal credibility behind the network's story. In the piece, Bernstein, Sciutto, and Cohen used anonymous 'sources' to claim that President Donald Trump's now former personal attorney Michael Cohen was willing to undercut President Trump's claims about the famed 2016 Trump Tower meeting that the president's son Donald Trump, Jr., his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort had with a Russian attorney with links to the Kremlin More[11] Roger Stone: Ronan Farrow Preparing Report Claiming I Knew Contents of WikiLeaks Emails Before Release[12] We're supposed to take mainstream media reports from anonymous sources seriously??? This would be pathetic, except for it being so dangerous If we accepted allegations from anonymous sources, how could they be cross-examined? Each of us would become fair game for outrageous slander Dave Joshua Caplan Breitbart News 27 Aug 2018  In a video posted to Instagram Monday, Roger Stone revealed Ronan Farrow of The New Yorker will soon publish a report alleging thelongtime Republican operativepersonally briefed then-candidate Donald Trump in October 2016 on the contents of a series of emails published by WikiLeaks in the run-up to the presidential election. 'Somebody has been pushing a fake news story.' Stone begins. 'First with the New York Times, then the Washington Post, and now with Ronan Farrow of the New Yorker. Someone is saying that they overheard a conversation, which I told Donald Trump in October of 2016 what exactly would be in the WikiLeaks disclosures and when they would be disclosed.' The Trump ally denied the veracity of the forthcoming story predicated on a second-hand account about the alleged conversation between Stone and then-candidate Trump, characterizing it as 'categorically false,' and 'exactly the epitome of fake news.' 'Let whoever is pushing this false narrative come forward and say it for the record, with their name on it,' Stone dared. 'They won't because it is false.'

Camerota, during a New Day segment led by the chyron 'Remembering John McCain,' repeatedly requested Sununu's comment on reports \u2014 based on anonymous sources from CNN and the Washington Post \u2014 that the White House had rejected a proposal to release a statement regarding 'John McCain's service and sacrifice.' Sununu charged Camerota with playing 'political games' to 'exploit' allegations related to McCain's death. He chided the anchor for pushing this narrative instead of just letting him pay tribute to his dead friend. Partial transcript below [emphases added]. CAMEROTA: So governor, what do you think about President Trump rejecting the practice of putting out an official White House statement about John McCain's service and sacrifice? SUNUNU: Look, that was printed in the Washington Post, and I have to be honest with you, I don't put much credence to what I read in the Post. CAMEROTA: We also have that reporting. SUNUNU: Yeah, well. Same thing applies, Alisyn. CAMEROTA: Governor, you come on CNN and we appreciate you coming on CNN and we appreciate your take on it, but I don't appreciate you denigrating our reporting. I think that you know we have excellent reporters here, but are you saying that you don't want to believe that? You don't want to believe that President Trump would do that about John McCain? SUNUNU: I'm saying that I don't want to comment on a report that I haven't satisfied myself is correct. CAMEROTA: And if that report were true? SUNUNU: I'm not going to answer the hypothetical. CAMEROTA: It's not a hypothetical. This is our reporting. We have rock-solid sources in the White House SUNUNU: I think this effort to create a cleavage between the White House and those that are mourning John McCain really does disturb me. It is this effort by the press to accentuate the negative that I think have created the climate that prevents, in the long term, the bipartisanship that John McCain supported. I don't want to be a part of rubbing whatever salt there in whatever wound there may be, because I think that just adds to the division. I'm here because I lost a good friend. I wanted to express my concern about that. I'm not here to play the political games that some in the press want to play at this moment of great sorrow for the country. CAMEROTA: To be clear, we don't see it as a game SUNUNU: I'm here to talk about my friend, John McCain. You appear to be here to talk about something that you think you can exploit, and I find that rather unpleasant. The video[15] Jake Tapper Praises 'Golden Age of Journalism,' Trump Policies 'Built' on 'Racism'[16] CNN has to praise itself because everyone else knows it is a fraud See the bolded section where Tapper completely contradicts himself It is as if he were saying'Cheating is dishonest, cheating undermines trust, cheating is destructive but if we didn't cheat we wouldn't win!' Where is this 'horrific' 'white supremacy' of Trump's that Tapper points to as his excuse for tossing objective journalism out the window? Where are the cases? Notice that he doesn't cite any He's just making stuff up! Dave Robert Kraychik Breitbart News 27 Aug 2018  CNN's Jake Tapper described some of President Donald Trump's policies as being built on 'racism' while praising what he said was today's 'golden age of journalism.' He made his remarks last Thursday atthe American Society of Travel Agents convention in Washington, DC. Tapper said that some of Trump's policies are occasionally built on 'racism,' 'in the views of many people' [emphasis added]: 'How are these policy disruptions being implemented? Just from a purely journalistic standpoint, I think it's fair to say that bureaucratically \u2014 I don't mean that pejoratively, but just the idea of how it's functioning \u2014 a lot of times these proposals are done impulsively, a lot of times they're done without explaining why they're being done, a lot of times they're done without interagency discussion, a lot of times they're done without any sense of diplomacy, a lot of time they're done without any sort of communication with experts or even cabinet secretaries that are relevant to the policy, and sometimes they're built on foundations that are, shall we say, made of sand. Whether it is built on lies, facts that are not accurate, or racism, in the views of many people, callousness, or even just a lack of understanding.' Tapper framed himself as a voice for 'basic facts, basic truth, and basic decency,' while implicitly accusing Trump of not condemning 'white supremacy': 'Where it is difficult to be a journalist today is when it comes to what I perceive as standing up for basic facts, basic truth, and basic decency. These are the only things and principles I try to take a stance on, because as a journalist, I don't think it's my position to say, 'This tax bill is good. This tax bill is bad. This candidate is good. This candidate is bad.' But when it comes to basic decency, I think we can all agree that white supremacy is horrific and an outdated and anachronistic ideology that should be condemned by polite society.' Tapper cast Trump as a violator of 'norms' and 'decency': 'I've never seen this kind of disregard for norms as pervasive as it is. In my lifetime, I have never seen the disregard for norms of this is true, this is not true, this is decent, this is not decency.' Tapper praised the broader news media landscape, describing today as a 'golden age of journalism': 'I see a lot of excellent journalism being done. This is a golden age of journalism in a lot of ways. The New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times; there's some really great journalism being done, right now. I think we're doing a lot of great journalism at CNN.'

D. Adler Breitbart News 27 Aug 2018  Editors on Wikipedia, the site relied on by the Masters of the Universe for reliable and accurate information, have added President Trump to a list of advocates for the 'white genocide conspiracy theory' due to his recent tweets about South Africa farm attacks and government land expropriation. Other prominent conservatives were also added to the list including Donald Trump Jr., Tucker Carlson, and Ann Coulter. Last Wednesday, President Trump tweeted[19] about the regular attacks on white-owned farms in South Africa and recent government plans to expropriate land from white farmers without compensation. Following media criticism of his statement, the President was added[20] to a Wikipedia list of 'advocates' for the 'white genocide conspiracy theory' described there as 'a neo-Nazi, alt-right, conservative, white nationalist, and supremacist conspiracy theory.' At the same time President Trump was branded as an advocate of a 'conspiracy theory,' South African politician Julius Malema was added to a list of 'critics' of the 'conspiracy theory' due to his criticism of Trump's tweets.Malema[21], head of South Africa's Economic Freedom Fighters party and advocate[22] of expropriation of white land without compensation, is well known for hisown remarks[23] flirting with the idea of genocide as noted on his Wikipedia page[24]. Such remarks include singing[25] 'Shoot the Boer', a reference to descendants of Dutch settlers in the country, and stating[26] they were not 'for now' calling for the slaughter of whites. The article's intro was also changed[27] to claim Trump 'made the conspiracy theory a part of United States foreign policy' with his tweets. One editor repeatedly[28]removed[29] the addition[30] of Trump to the article, but his edits were undone by several[31] established[32] editors[33]. An editor didalter the material[34] to clarify Trump was merely accused of being an advocate. At the discussion page for the article, another editor objected[35] that Trump was not an advocate of a conspiracy theory, but merely stating facts. Current and former members of the site's powerful Arbitration Committee, previously involved[36] in defending the violent far-left Antifa, responded to cite sources[37] mentioning Trump in connection with this 'conspiracy theory' and endorse[38] his inclusion on the list. One of them, administrator Drmies, did express some annoyance[39] citing policies stating Wikipedia is not a news site[40]. Drmies, however, also told[41] the editor objecting to Trump's inclusion he was 'treading on really thin ice' with his objection. Drmies has previously threatened and made questionable bans[42] on similar topics. Many other conservative figures were included on the list due mostly to comments about South Africa, which was initially added[43] to the page by editor Carpatho, whose contributions[44] appear to be focused[45] entirely on the subject. Carpatho made[46] numerous[47] expansions[48] to the list. Among those added were conservative commentator Ann Coulter, libertarian philosopher, and previous subject[49] of Wikipedia smear campaigns Stefan Molyneux, Lauren Southern due to her documentaryFarmlandsabout South Africa farm attacks, Katie Hopkins of Rebel Media, and Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., was added based on media speculation about his beliefs More[50] Seth Rogen's AMC Series 'Preacher' Features Nazi Wearing MAGA Hat[51] The Liberal media's echo chamber is now trying to convince the publicthat President Trump is a neo-Nazi This falsehood is now being repeated and reinforced all over the place As Hitler's Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels said'If you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes the truth' Dave Warner Todd Hudson Breitbart News 27 Aug 2018  The Seth Rogen-produced AMC series Preacher went out on a political note by dressing a character in a Nazi uniform wearing one of President Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' caps in the season finale More[52] Trump Slams Google for Biased Search Results[53] Allum Bokhari Breitbart News 28 Aug 2018  President Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday to condemn Google, criticizing the search engine as 'rigged' for favoring liberal and establishment news publications in its search results. The president suggested that the tech giant may be behaving in an illegal manner by skewing its search results, and promised that Google's biased search results 'will be addressed.' Trump previously[54] called out Google's search bias during his 2016 election campaign. Google search results for 'Trump News' shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake New Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me ...hers, so that almost all stories ...ws is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative ...ir Media is shut out. Illegal? 96% of results on 'Trump News' are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google ...hers are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can ...nnot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2018[55] This followed a report[56] from a conservative columnist that 96 of her search results for 'Trump' in Google News were from establishment and left-leaning news sources. Trump has turned his fire on Silicon Valley in recent weeks, following an unprecedented crackdown by platforms like Twitter and YouTube against conservative and anti-establishment content. He has said[57] it is 'dangerous' for social media platforms to ban accounts, and has accused social media platforms of discrimination[58] against conservatives and Republicans. His comments echo recent criticism of Silicon Valley made by other top Republicans, including GOP majority leader Kevin McCarthy, Texas Senator Ted Cruz,RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, and Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale. Although search bias is harder to detect than the bans of prominent conservatives on social media platforms, it can potentially have a far greater impact on elections  More[59] Tiger Woods' 'respect the office' statement about Trump blasted by ESPN host Max Kellerman[60] According to the mainstream media a neutral and nonpolitical answer to a question about a personal friend is now grounds for being the target of a furious rant Why? Because Tiger Woods' friendship with President Trump undermines the entire 'Trump is a racist neo-Nazi' narrative that the MSM echo chamber is trying to manufacture as justification for removing Trump from office Dave Ryan Gaydos Fox News August 28, 2018 ESPN's Max Kellerman said Monday on 'First Take' that Tiger Woods' response to questions about President Trump made him 'angry.' Woods was asked after the final round of The Northern Trust[61] on Sunday about his relationship with Trump and he urged people to respect the office of the president. 'He's the president of the United States. You have to respect the office. No matter who is in the office, you may like, dislike personality or the politics, but we all must respect the office,' he said. Kellerman blasted Woods' remarks, saying it was a 'thoughtless statement dressed up as a thoughtful statement And it either holds in contempt the intelligence of people who hear it or else it's just a stupid thing to say. To say you must have respect for the office \u2014 Tiger, be clear. Are you saying that the office, therefore, confers respect onto its present temporary occupant? No. Having respect for the office means principally, in my view, is the office holder should have respect for the office,' The co-host continued: 'We are held to a standard of behavior, we at our jobs, right, people in their daily lives. The president, if anything, is held to a higher standard of behavior. It is not such that we have such great respect for the office that no matter what the behavior of its occupant, we must respect the occupant because of the office. No. Tiger Woods is being slick. We must respect the office therefore that confers respect to the occupant. Tiger, is that is what you are saying? If that is what you are saying, that is a stupid comment.' Trump and Woods have been golfing partners for years and have remained in touch since Trump took office. 'Well, I've known Donald for a number of years,' Woods said. 'We've played golf together. We've had dinner together. I've known him pre-presidency and obviously during his presidency.' The video and more[62] Google Collects Data on Users in Private 'Incognito Mode'[63] More proof that you can't trust Google Dave Tom Ciccotta Breitbart News 27 Aug 2018  New reports out last week claim that the Google Chrome web browser collects data on users even when they are in the private 'incognito mode.' A researcher from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, uncovered[64] last week that Google had access to data for users opting to use the private browsing mode on the Google Chrome web browser. 'If you don't want Google Chrome to remember your activity, you can browse the web privately in Incognito mode,' a Google Chrome help page[65] reads. But apparently, that doesn't mean that Google can't obtain the data from private browsing sessions. 'While such data is collected with user-anonymous identifiers, Google has the ability to connect this collected information with a user's personal credentials stored in their Google Account,' the Vanderbilt researcher wrote in the report. More than half of all internet users use the Google Chrome browser. Chrome has been installed on over 2 billion machines, across both desktop, laptop, and mobile devices. Reports from earlier in August revealed[66] that Google was tracking all user's locations even after users had turned the location tracking feature off.According to theAssociated Press, who launched an investigation into the tracking, computer scientists 'found that many Google services on Android devices and iPhones store your location data even if you've used a privacy setting that says it will prevent Google from doing so.' A Google spokesperson gave a non-answer when asked about user tracking. 'There are a number of different ways that Google may use location to improve people's experience, including: Location, History, Web and App Activity, and through device-level Location Services,' the spokesperson said.'We provide clear descriptions of these tools, and robust controls so people can turn them on or off, and delete their histories at any time.' New browsers like Brave are attempting to fill the market gap by providing users with a totally private web browsing experience. It remains unclear whether or not Google will adjust their Chrome product to offer their users more privacy.

More[77] Social Media Platforms Don't Actually Need to Ban Anyone[78] Glad to see President Trump saying what Freedom Update has been saying all along As with telephone conversations, it is not the job of the service provider to listen in and interfere with communications If it is anyone's job at all, it is the job of the federal government for the restricted purposes of law enforcement and national security and constrained by judicial oversight to prevent abuse We all know government oversight is far from perfect but this is true for law enforcement and national security in general Imperfect as it is, it is still better than allowing service providers to act as censors When they do, we go back into the days of 'Whites only' lunch counters And that is where we are today, where far Left messages spread without hindrance while conservative messages are quashed The social media companies' rules don't protect usWhy then should they protect the Left? Dave Allum Bokhari Breitbart News 27 Aug 2018  President Trump's recent comments on social media censorship suggest he doesn't think social media platforms should be allowed to ban anyone for any reason. Some would call this a radical proposal, but they'rewrong. Social media companies could easily move to a 'no bans' policy, with little disruption to their users. Trump ramped up his public denunciations of big tech's far-left bias in recent weeks, following the unprecedented censorship[79] of prominent conservatives in the run-up to the midterm elections. In a series of tweets [80]on August 18, the President accused social media giants of 'totally discriminating' against conservatives and Republicans, and called on tech giants to 'Let everybody participate, good ...d, and we will all just have to figure it out!' He reiterated his comments a few days later, in an interview[81] with Reuters, stating'I think it's a very dangerous thing when they are their own regulator in terms of who's going to be on Facebook and who's going to be on Twitter. I think that whether it's conservative or liberal, I think that it's very dangerous.' At a rally in West Virginia the following day, the President said[82] that social media users have, in effect, converted ordinary citizens into journalists who deserved no fewer free speech protections than CNN. 'Every one of us is sort of like a newspaper, you have Twitter Facebook you can't have censorship.I'd rather have fake news like CNN than have anybody - including liberals, socialists than have anybody stopped and censored.' The implication of Trump's words is clear \u2014 social media companies should be prohibitedfrom banning anyone for lawful speech. It should instead be up to users to decide what content they want to see on social media ('we will all just have to figure it out!'). This sounds like a radical proposal, but Trump is perfectly correct.

It is vying for survival with other, sometimes stronger, extremist groups. But one sphere where Islamic State still reigns supreme among terrorists is in cyberspace. The group's vast online presence is a critical recruitment and marketing tool that has helped it build a brutish brand using propaganda and sometimes false claims. Maintaining the perception that Islamic State can shape the actions of loyalists has become all the more important as its territorial control, or self-declared caliphate, has almost completely collapsed. The latest example of the role of such online propaganda came on Thursday, when Islamic State's official news outlet claimed that a man who stabbed his mother and sister to death in France had responded to its calls to attack citizens of countries that are part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting the group. French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb disputed the statement, saying the perpetrator was mentally unstable. That claim came a day after Islamic State released what it said was a recording of its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi[85], the first in nearly a year, calling for supporters abroad to continue attacks on Western cities. In October, the group claimed to have inspired the Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock[86], who killed 59 people attending a country-music concert. A month earlier, Islamic State said it had planted a bomb on a U.K.-bound flight that was held in Paris for what officials called a 'direct security threat.' Authorities in both cases rebuffed the group's assertions. Islamic State also claimed that a man who attacked a casino in the Philippine capital of Manila in June 2017 was a soldier of its caliphate, despite local authorities saying that the perpetrator was an indebted gambler [87]trying to make off with $2 million in chips. In internal field guides, Islamic State regards its propaganda as 'projectiles' fired into mainstream media. Threats and claims of attacks are intended to intimidate and destroy the morale of the enemy. In many cases, even if authorities don't establish specific links between an attacker in the West and Islamic State, the perpetrator has turned out to have been a consumer of the group's propaganda. The group, widely known as ISIS, frequently describes 'information wars' as important as its military battles, according to Charlie Winter, senior research fellow with the Institute for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence, a London-based think tank. 'ISIS uses propaganda as an extension of its military methods,' Mr. Winter said in an interview earlier this year. 'Terrorism is a way of communication more than anything else.'

Special Agent Jonathan Moffa, who worked with controversial former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, testified last Friday behind closed doors before the House Judiciary Committee and House Oversight Committee.A source with knowledge of his testimony confirmed to Fox News that Moffa said FBI personnel would use media reports based on information they leaked to justify applications for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants. The source told Fox News that Moffa acknowledged this 'had been a practice in the past.' Republicans have long questioned to what extent leaked information, related to the unverified anti-Trump dossier, was used as a basis for surveillance warrants against former Trump adviser Carter Page in 2016 \u2014 when the bureau was led by James Comey and deputy Andrew McCabe. The source told Fox News that Moffa did not specifically confirm the practice of using leaked information to bolster warrant applications was employed with regard to the dossier.But, when pressed by the committees on whether this was common practice at the FBI, Moffa acknowledged the FBI had at least engaged in this activity in other cases The videos and more[98] Photos: Left-Wing Activists Launch Brett Kavanaugh Protests Across the Country[99] Justin Caruso Breitbart News 27 Aug 2018  The Handmaid's Tale???

Trump should respond by doing this[108] Cal Thomas Fox News August 28, 2018 Finding someone in Washington who is nonpartisan and puts the nation's interests ahead of their own is so rare these days that he or she, if found, might well qualify as an endangered species. But once in a while \u2014 call it the law of averages \u2014 someone speaks the truth. It happened last week when Mark Penn, former adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton, wrote a column for The Hill[109] newspaper in which he claimed there is a big difference between how Hillary Clinton and President Trump have been treated when it comes to allegations of criminal behavior. Penn then appeared on Fox News[110] where he spoke of the 'double standard' applied to Trump and his associates compared to how Clinton was exonerated by FBI Director James Comey over her private email server and her handling of classified information. 'The investigations related to the email were handled with kid gloves, and the investigations related to Trump with all-out prosecutorial force of government and deep state might,' Penn said. It doesn't matter. The long knives have been drawn by those who want to reverse the results of the 2016 election and put themselves back in power. They will not be sheathed until blood is drawn, preferably the blood of the president, whose personality might not win him any good deportment citations on a grade school report card, but whose policies are making the nation stronger.  Neither does it matter that no evidence of Russian 'collusion' by the Trump campaign has yet to be uncovered. That train seems to have long ago left the station, replaced by other strategies to bring down the president, none of which were part of the special counsel's original mandate. Indeed, on July 13 when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced[111] the indictment of 12 Russians for their alleged roles in hacking computers at the Democratic National Committee and other sites, he said: 'There's no allegation in this document that any American citizen committed a crime. There's no allegation that the conspiracy changed the vote count or affected any election result.' Rosenstein knows the indicted Russians will never be extradited and tried, so it looks to most conservatives like a public relations stunt designed to show that Robert Mueller was pursuing what he had been tasked with discovering. Having failed to achieve that objective, the tentacles of his office have spread out in other directions, now reaching the Trump organization where its CEO has been granted full federal immunity and will likely be required to divulge anything \u2014 perhaps even those long-hidden Trump income tax returns, which Democrats have wanted made public since the 2016 campaign. President Trump needs to refocus and stop attacking his political enemies, and even his friends, and start worrying about his most pressing problem.

The spreadsheet, reported[115] by Axios, predicts Democrats will launch at least 18 probes of the Trump administration, including at least three related to Russia. One is 'Trump's dealings with Russia, including the president's preparation for his meeting with Vladimir Putin.' In a preview of Russia-related requests, House Intelligence Committee Democrats unsuccessfully raised a motion during a hearing in June on China to subpoena the U.S. interpreter who was present during President Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The motion was voted down by Republicans and failed, but if Democrats control the committee, they could succeed the next time they try. Another predicted probe is 'James Comey's firing.' Trump fired Comey on the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, but told NBC's Lester Holt that he was thinking about the 'Russia thing' when he did it.Special Counsel Robert Mueller is already probing whether the president tried to obstruct the Russia investigation. GOP members predict Democrats will also investigate 'election security and hacking attempts' \u2014 clearly related to Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign aides during the 2016 presidential election, which the Clinton campaign blames for losing the election. The spreadsheet also reportedly compiles requests Democrats have already made for administration officials to testify, hearings to be scheduled, and communications about controversial policies and personnel decisions. Republicans have so far rejected them. 'These demands would turn the Trump White House into a 24/7 legal defense operation,' Axios reporter Jonathan Swan wrote. More[116] Venezuela's Tyranny of Bad Ideas[117] Socialism was a proven failure, but Hugo Chvez got his countrymen to try it. Daniel Pipes The Wall Street Journal Aug. 26, 2018  Ideas run the world. Good ones create freedom and wealth; bad ones, oppression and poverty. You are not what you eat, but what you think. Politicians in particular fall under the sway of ideas. As John Maynard Keynes put it, 'Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back. ... It is ideas, not vested interests, which are dangerous for good or evil.' The story of Venezuela makes this point with singular clarity. In 1914 the discovery of oil brought the country vast revenues and produced a relatively free economy. By 1950 Venezuela enjoyed the fourth-highest per capita income in the world, behind only the U.S., Switzerland and New Zealand. As late as 1980, it boasted the world's fastest-growing[118] economy in the 20th century. In 2001 Venezuela still ranked as Latin America's wealthiest country. Venezuela's troubles, however, had begun long before. Starting around 1958, government interference in the economy, including price and exchange controls, higher taxes, and restrictions on property rights, led to decades of stagnation, with per capita real income declining[119] 0.13% from 1960-97. Still, it remained a normal, functioning country. Today the country with the world's largest oil reserves suffers from a severely contracting economy, runaway inflation, despotism, mass emigration, criminality, disease, hunger and starvation, with circumstances deteriorating daily. Venezuela's economy contracted by 16% in 2016, 14% last year and a predicted 15% in 2018. Inflation was at 112% in 2015 and 2,800% at the end of last year. Economist Steve Hanke finds[120] an annualized rate of around 65,000% for 2018, making Venezuela's one of the most severe hyperinflations ever. Food shortages led[121] to an average weight loss among Venezuelans of 18 pounds in 2016 and 24 pounds in 2017. What caused this crisis? Foreign invasion, civil war, natural disaster, substitutes for oil, or agricultural plagues? No, bad ideas, pure and simple. Socialism might have been a proven failure globally, but Hugo Chvez convinced Venezuelans to try it Bad ideas have always existed, but they acquired new importance with the advent of liberalism in the late 17th century. Before then, conservatism\u2014respecting tradition while adapting it to new circumstances\u2014had prevailed. An individual king's or religious leader's besotted vision could progress only so far before convention rolled it back. Liberalism rendered tradition optional by optimistically deeming each person capable to think through the great issues from first principles on his own. Radical theories proliferated, especially during the French Revolution. The floodgates were opened for ideas unmoored from experience and common sense, such as conspiracy theories. These ideas incubated through the 19th century and came to terrible fruition after World War I with fascism, Nazism, socialism and communism. As historian Paul Johnson notes, 'The worst of all despotisms is the heartless tyranny of ideas.' At a moment when many Democrats are ignoring the lessons of Venezuela and swooning over socialism, it's back to the barricades in the war of ideas.  More[122] Who Is Linda Sarsour's Mentor?[123] Alex VanNess The Clarion Project Wednesday, August 22, 2018  Sharia[124]-apologist and Islamist activist Linda Sarsour is a controversial figure in her own right. But, who is Linda Sarsour's mentor? Last year, Linda Sarsour[125] addressed[126] the 54th ISNA Convention. Sarsour, who is one ofthe most prominent Muslim activists in America, was widely criticized for calling on Muslims to wage 'jihad' against President Trump. [127]However, the most controversial remarks in her 22-minute speech came within the first two minutes when she gave a shout-out to her 'favorite person in this room,' radical imam[128] Siraj Wahhaj, who Sarsour called her 'mentor, motivator and encourager.' Recently, police raided[129] an extremist Islamist compound in New Mexico where compound leaders were training children to become school shooters. One of the leaders of this terrorist camp was none other than Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, son of Siraj Wahhaj. Siraj Ibn Wahhaj also kidnapped his own physically disabled child - the child was later found dead due to being deprived of his medicine and an exorcism ritual. Siraj Ibn Wahhaj attributed his son's condition to demonic possession. Ibn Wahhaj's compound was not a complete aberration; there are other cultish Islamist encampments in the U.S. In January 2018,Clarion Project reported on FBI documents[130]confirming Jamaat ul-Fuqra is training members in dozens of isolated communes across America and Canada. Fuqra, which now goes by the name of the Muslims of the Americas (MOA) among other titles, is a cultish Islamist group with a history of crime and terrorism. Fuqra conducts[131] basic paramilitary training in their camps in America (as well as elsewhere). Wahhaj, Sr. is no stranger to Fuqra/MOA. A number of former congregants at Wahhaj's Al-Taqwa mosque are involved with MOA, including Ali Abdelaziz[132] and Clement Rodney Hampton-El[133]. After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, Wahhaj gave a sermon[134] asking the question, 'Who are the real terrorists?' He named three entities: The U.S. government, big business and the media. Wahhaj served as acharacter witness[135] for the 'Blind Sheikh[136],' Omar Abdel-Rahman, who was found guilty of masterminding terrorist plots against the United States, including his role in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Linda Sarsour's Mentor Called for Armed Jihad In 1992, Wahhajgave a sermon[137]in which headvocated[138]for armed jihad[139] in streets for the benefit of Islam. Is it a stretch to hypothesize thatIbn Wahhaj's actions were in some way influenced by his father and MOA members at his mosque? Sarsour has been a steadfast 'mentee' of Siraj Wahhaj. This is not to suggest that one day we'll find Sarsour running a compound in New Mexico, but Sarsour has a long history of distasteful views and associations with extremist figures. In 2017, for example, she attended a summit run by the radical left-wing group Jewish Voice for Peace, where she sat alongside[140] the convicted Palestinian terrorist, Rasmea Odeh[141], and gave her awarm embrace[142]. While speaking,Sarsour said[143] she was 'honored and privileged to be here in this space, and honored to be on this stage with Rasmea.' Sarsour has also called for people toshow solidarity[144]with Muhammad Allan, a member of the terror group Islamic Jihad. Allan has ahistory[145]of recruiting suicide bombers. Sarsour also associates with the organization Al-Awda and its co-founder (an open and unapologetic Hezbollahsupporter[146]) Abbas Hamideh. Sarsour hasattended[147]numerous rallies sponsored by Al-Awda, promoted[148]andsolicited donations[149]for their events, and spoken[150]at their rallies More[151] Iranians in US Charged With Spying for Iran[152] Clarion Project Tuesday, August 21, 2018  Two Iranians in the U.S. were charged with spying for Iran.[153] The Justice Department, along with the FBI, announced the indictments saying Ahmadreza Mohammadi-Doostdar, 38, who holds dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship, and Majid Ghorbani, 59, a resident of California, were spying for Iran by conducting covert surveillance of Israeli and Jewish facilities in the United States. The two were also charged with collecting identifying information about American citizens and U.S. nationals who are members of the Iranian opposition group Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK). 'The National Security Division is committed to protecting the United States from individuals within our country who unlawfully act on behalf of hostile foreign nations,' said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers.'Doostdar and Ghorbani are alleged to have acted on behalf of Iran, including by conducting surveillance of political opponents and engaging in other activities that could put Americans at risk.' Jessie K. Liu, United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, added, 'This indictment demonstrates the commitment of the Department of Justice to hold accountable agents of foreign governments who act illegally within the United States, especially where those agents are conducting surveillance of individuals and constitutionally-protected activities in this country.' According to the indictment, Doostdar traveled to the United States from Iran in the summer of 2017 to collect intelligence information about entities and individuals considered by the government of Iran to be their enemies, namely, Israeli and Jewish interests. Doostdar is alleged to have conducted surveillance of the Rohr Chabad House, a Jewish institution in Chicago, including photographing the security features surrounding the facility. Ghorbani is alleged to have attended a MEK rally in New York City in September 2017, during which he photographed individuals protesting against the Iranian regime. Later that year, Doostdar returned to the United States from Iran, made contact with Ghorbani and paid him close to $2,000 in cash for 28 pictures Ghorbani had taken at the rally. Many of the pictures contained hand-written notes identifying the participants. The indictment also alleges that Ghorbani traveled to Iran around March 2018 for an 'in-person briefing.'

Six Reasons Why AG Jeff Sessions is Trump's Hammer in the Fight Against Illegal Migration[159] Niel Munro Breitbart News 27 Aug 2018  Attorney General Jeff Sessions is using his legal expertise and his authority to aggressively implement President Donald Trump's policy against illegal immigration, even as he isgetting flakfrom the President for recusinghimself from Democratic-cheered investigations into the President's campaign and business activities. The next step for Sessions, says source, is the release of federal regulations that will replace the 2015Flores settlement which requires officials to release migrants within 20 days if they bring children with them over the border. The catch-and-release settlement wascreated in 2015 by a judge, the ACLU, andofficials working for former President Barack Obama, and it has forced officials to release hundreds of thousands of Central American migrants who bring their children into the United States. But the pending Floresregulation is just one of several major regulatory changes which Sessions which are shutting the various border loopholes which were created by pro-migration judges, advocacy groups and agency officials over the last 20 years. 'These changes are really possible because Jeff Sessions is Attorney General,' said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. Krikorian continued: 'He both knows what has to be done, and is committed to making sure it happens. A different AG, even if he means well, would be unlikely to have both the knowledge and commitment to get these kinds of change though, and that assumes he even wanted to do so.

The newsletter reads[2]: 'CNN's critics continued to lampoon the network on Tuesday over itsJuly story[3] about the infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting. The story, written byJim Sciutto, Carl Bernstein,andMarshall Cohen, cited sources who said Michael Cohen was prepared to tellRobert Muellerthat Trump knew in advance of the meeting that the Russians were expected to offer dirt onHillary Clinton.' 'Over the past week, Cohen lawyerLanny Davishas publicly said he was one of the sources who confirmed the news to CNN and other media organizations,' it also adds. </p><p>'Davis now says he cannot confirm the news. Davis' walk back has prompted critics \u2014 a good chunk of whom belong to the right-wing media universe \u2014 to unleash a torrent of criticism on CNN.' The newsletter, which was put together by CNN reporter Oliver Darcy (the usual writer of the newsletter, Brian Stelter, is currently on 'vaycay[4]'), reminds readers that 'Davis walking back his claims doesn't necessarily debunk CNN's story.' The newsletter then points to a statement from a CNN spokesperson, who said, 'We stand by our story, which had more than one source, and are confident in our reporting of it' Now, this could be true. If CNN actually has another solid source or sources for their story, then Davischanging his story[5]-which he might have done simply to save his client, Michael Cohen, from possible legal trouble-may not necessarily prove the story false. However, that is not the only issue. As The Intercept's Glenn Greenwald points out[6], it may well be the case that CNN lied to readers completely by writing that Lanny Davis did not want to comment in its original story, when he was, in fact, a source. As Greenwald wrote[7] in The Intercept Tuesday: 'Last night, BuzzFeedreported[8]that Davisexplicitly confessed that he was one of the anonymous sources for CNN's July 26 story, just as he was for the stories from the Washington Post and the New York Post. Last week,CNN put Davison the airwith Anderson Cooper[9]to deny that he was the source for that CNN story - a denial Cooper did not contest - but Davis now admits he was one of CNN's sources, if not their main source.' Yet remarkably, CNN, in its July 26story,specifically claimed that Davisrefused to talk to CNNabout the story or provide any comment whatsoever. Greenwald continued: 'Only one of two things can be true here, and either is extremely significant:(1)CNN deliberately lied to its audience about Davis refusing to comment on the story when, in fact, Davis was one of the anonymous sources on which the CNN report depended, and CNN claimed Davis refused to comment in order to hide Davis' identity as one of their anonymous sources; or(2)Davis is lying now to BuzzFeed when he confessed to having been one of CNN's sources for the story.' Indeed, as Greenwald writes, either CNN is lying or Davis is lying about his being a source for the story. But think about it-if Davis really was lying, going around and telling other news outlets that he was a source for the CNN story when he actually was not, then wouldn't CNN correct the record immediately and state that Davis was not a source? Why has CNN not done this? More[10] Trump: CNN's Trump Tower Story Source 'Doesn't Exist,' 'Credibility Is Now Gone'[11] John Nolte Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  President Donald Trump mocked CNN and Carl Bernstein Thursday claiming their 'credibility is now gone' and there is no 'source' for the far-left network's Trump Tower story, a story that collapsed into a pile of fake news[12] this week. 'CNN is working frantically to find their 'source.' Look hard because it doesn't exist,' Trump tweeted. 'Whatever was left of CNN's credibility is now gone!' On July 27, CNN's Carl Bernstein and Jim Sciutto were two of three bylined reporters behind a bombshell report that claimed Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, would testify Trump knew in advance of a meeting at Trump Tower that took place during the 2016 election between Trump's campaign senior staff and a Russian lawyer. The story also said that Cohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis, refused comment on the story. As has been the case with CNN 'bombshells' too many times before, nothing published by CNN ended up being true. Not only has Lanny Davis said Cohen knows nothing about Trump having any foreknowledge of the meeting, Davis also admits he was a CNN source. This,of course, means Bernstein intentionally misled the public when he reported Davis was not a source for the story. Nevertheless, even though the story has imploded, CNN has not only refused to correct or retract the false report but continues to stand by it, as does the now-disgraced Bernstein[13]. With Davis admitting he was the source, CNN has been claiming it has a another source, which is what Trump means when he is mocking their search for that 'source.' Even so, even if CNN has another source, that source should be outed by CNN as a liar. If that source even exists, he or she is guilty of giving CNN bad information. Back in the good old days, when the media was somewhat concerned about its credibility and deterring 'sources' from lying, sources guilty of lying were named and shamed. This Trump Tower story was CNN's biggest of the year and the biggest story the hapless Bernstein has had since he and Bob Woodward parted ways 40 years ago. To have something like this implode is a massive humiliation, even for a shameless outlet like CNN More[14] On CNN, Carl Bernstein Forgets He Once Tried to Keep CIA 'Propaganda' *Out* of the Newsroom[15] Curtis Ellis Breitbart News 29 Aug 2018  President Trump is slamming CNN for being caught in a major lie and refusing to admit its mistake, and Carl Bernstein for 'living in the past.' Bernstein, the investigative journalist of Watergate fame, is at the center of CNN's (latest) fake news scandal: a 'bombshell' story carrying Bernstein's byline that's been thoroughly debunked. But 'The Most Trusted Name in News' refuses to retract it. The dud story would be enough of a problem, but the legendary reporter has another problem: Carl Bernstein has forgotten his own past. The evidence? The company he keeps in the present, specifically his fellow CNN contributor James Clapper, the former Director of National Intelligence. Let's set the way back machine to 1977, in Carl's past when he wrote the 25,000 word cover story for Rolling Stone magazine, 'The CIA and the Media[16].' The investigative piece details how the CIA used the New York Times, Washington Post, CBS and other American news organizations during the Cold War to gather intelligence, provide cover for its agents and even shape news reports. Bernstein's piece focused mainly on the agency's foreign intelligence operations, but he raised the specter that the CIA may have colored the news Americans read and watch. 'Many journalists and some CIA officials dispute the agency's claim that it has been scrupulous in respecting the editorial integrity of American publications and broadcast outlets,' Bernstein noted, adding 'CIA-generated black propaganda' could be turning up in American publications. 'The traditional line separating the American press corps and government,' as Bernstein put it, as inviolable as the separation of church and state, had been blurred. The thrust of Bernstein's story was clear: Intelligence agencies are expert in disinformation, deception and duplicity. There should be no suspicion they are using their tradecraft to shape American public opinion and public policy. Bernstein reserved his greatest contempt for publishers and editors who allowed their newspapers and networks 'to become handmaidens to the intelligence services.' He didn't spare his former employer, the Washington Post. That was then. Today, the same Carl Bernstein who was concerned about intelligence operatives compromising American journalism has no problem with James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence, being paid by CNN to tell the American public what he wants them to think. Bernstein even sits next to Clapper on set while he does it. James Clapper, you may recall is guilty of perjury[17], having lied to Congress[18] to cover up the NSA's mass surveillance of American citizens More[19] Donald Trump Rips CNN's Jeff Zucker: 'Little Jeff Z' and CNN's Ratings 'Suck'[20] These media frauds used to get away with their false narratives because most people are too polite and conflict-avoiding to confront them on it That's not happening with this President Dave Charlie Spiering Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  President Donald Trump ripped CNN's president, Jeff Zucker, on Thursday, taunting him for bad ratings and bad journalism. 'Little Jeff Z has done a terrible job, his ratings suck, ......hould fire him to save credibility!' Trump wrote on Twitter. The president blamed the media's 'hatred' and 'bias' for their dishonesty about his administration despite great economic news for the country. 'The hatred and extreme bias of me by CNN has clouded their thinking and made them unable to function,' he wrote. 'But actually, as I have always said, this has been going on for a long time.' Trump seemed particularly angry with the morning news coverage on Thursday which included a New York Times report[21]that Ivanka Trump, his daughter, and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, were forcing out White House counsel Don McGahn. 'The Fake News Media has it, purposely, so wrong!' Trump said in response to the story. 'They love to portray chaos in the White House when they know that chaos doesn't exist-just a 'smooth running machine' with changing parts!' He also appeared to refer to reporter Bob Woodward's upcoming book, which is likely to further the narrative of chaos in the White House. 'I just cannot state strongly enough how totally dishonest much of the Media is. Truth doesn't matter to them, they only have their hatred ...enda,' he wrote. 'This includes fake books, which come out about me all the time, always anonymous sources, and are pure fiction. Enemy of the People!' Trump signaled frustration with NBC News as well, sharing rumors that Andy Lack would be fired. 'What's going on at CNN is happening, to different degrees, at other networks - with NBC News being the worst,' he wrote. 'The good news is that Andy Lack(y) is about to be fired(?) for incompetence and much worse.' The New York Post reported[22]that Comcast executives are quietly seeking a replacement for Lack.

The post showed an image of naked, emaciated children who were starved at the hands of the Nazi regime Google Is Trump's Most Dangerous Enemy[25] Allum Bokhari Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  After criticizing social media platforms for mass-censoring conservatives and the alternative media earlier this month, President Trump has turned his attention to Google.[26] Not a moment too soon \u2014 of all the politically biased tech giants, Google is by far the most dangerous. Trump's critical comments about Google referenced statistics from a report[27] in PJ Media which found that a staggering 96 percent of search results for 'Trump' return results from news sites that are hostile to the President. Breitbart News' own investigation[28] found the same result. As Google search results are personalized, this wasn't a strictly scientific study \u2014 that would require tests on hundreds, if not thousands of Google users. But the fact that aconservative columnistreceived search results that were 96 percent liberal should be deeply worrying. If that's what a conservative with a (presumably) conservative search history sees, what kind of results are being sent to swing-voters? The fact that it could be a problem of all search engines[29], not just Google, due to the way search algorithms detect 'trustworthy' content is true, but Google holds a stranglehold on the search market. It's closest english-language competitor, Bing, holds 7 percent of the market for searches according to NetMarketShare[30]. Another obvious problem with Google search is how its algorithm repeatedly surfaces information from Wikipedia at the top of search results. Wikipedia is an 'online encyclopedia' that relies on a mass of anonymous, unaccountable editors to create its myriad of pages. The encyclopedia's citation rules, which favor academic and establishment media sources while excluding sources like Breitbart News and the Daily Caller as 'unreliable' inherently favor the left. So too does its cabal of unaccountable left-wing editors, who are slowly but surely turning the purportedly non-partisan encyclopedia into a platform for anti-Trump propaganda. Wikipedia editors recently[31] added Trump to a list of advocates of the 'white genocide conspiracy theory' following his comments on the racially motivated murders of white farmers in South Africa. They previously[32] included ICE detention centers on a Wikipedia list of 'concentration camps.' The result of Google's reliance on a far-left encyclopedia is that false information - fake news, you could say - has the potential to reach the top of the search engine's results, like the time when the California GOP were labeled a 'Nazi' party on Wikipedia, a categorization that then made its way to Google.[33].. More[34] Donald Trump: We Will Not Tolerate Censorship, Blacklisting, Rigged Search from Big Tech[35] Charlie Spiering Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  President Donald Trump vowed to stand for free speech on Thursday, warning Big Tech against censoring conservative voices. 'I've made it clear that we as a country cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting, and rigged search results,' Trump said, calling out social media companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter. The president commented on the issue at his campaign rally in Indiana on Thursday night, ahead of the midterm elections in November. Trump said his administration would always stand up for free speech for 'all Americans,' warning the left that their own voices could someday be censored. 'We will not let large corporations silence conservative voices,' he said. Trump suggested that such activities were un-American, reiterating the principle of free speech. 'We're not going to let them control what we can and cannot see, read, and learn from, we can't do that,' Trump said. 'America is a free country and we're going to stay always a free country.' More[36] Over 1,000 Big Tech Executives Donated to Democratic Super PAC ActBlue Since 2015[37] Lucas Nolan Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  According to a recent report, more than 1,000 executives and employees from the Silicon Valley Masters of the Universe have donated to a pro-Democrat super PAC since 2015. A report from BigLeaguePolitics.com[38] claims that since 2015, over 1,000 executives and employees from tech giants such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Apple have all donated to ActBlue, a pro-Democrat super PAC that has raised $1.5 billion since 2015. Details of the super PAC's fundraising activities were gathered by the Federal Elections Commission[39] and compiled by watchdog website Campaign Money[40]. The data shows that executives, vice presidents, managers, and regular employees at major tech firms were behind a large number of donations to the PAC. According to Big League Politics reporter Tom Pappert, some of the donors to the PAC include: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg Twitter co-Founder Evan Williams Google senior executives Urs Holzle, Vinton Cerf, and Jennifer Fitzpatrick Apple senior executives Angela Ahrendts and Lisa Jackson Between 2015 and 2016 alone, a large list of names from tech giants appears across the super PAC's donation rolls, with approximately 600 names from Google, 271 from Apple, 108 from Facebook, and 34 from Twitter. USA Today reported[41] on August 5 that ActBlue had raised more than $1 billion this election cycle ahead of the November midterms More[42] Trump: Big Tech in 'Very Anti-Trust Situation'[43] What we're going through right now with the 'Masters of the Universe' parallels the 'robber baron' days of the late 1800s Back then, monopolies like Standard Oil and Bell Telephone were infamous for influencing politicians and heavy-handed manipulation The government responded with two solutions Standard Oil[44] was broken up, while Bell Telephone[45] became a regulated utility (although Ma Bell was finally broken up in 1984) Both actions were designed to reign in monopoly power Bell Telephone, with its network of communication points is a closer analogy to the social networks of today The solution is to treat the Facebooks, Twitters, and Googles of this world as utilities that must provide service to all unless national security or law enforcement concerns say otherwise In other words, it is the government's job to monitor and censornot private companies that are free toto reward their friends and punish their enemies Dave Ben Kew Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  President Donald Trump has suggested major technology firms such as Amazon and Facebook could be in a 'very anti-trust situation,' but declined to comment on whether they should be broken up. 'I won't comment on the breaking up, of whether it's that or Amazon or Facebook,' Trump said about big tech in a Thursday interview[46]with Bloomberg. 'As you know, many people think it is a very anti-trust situation, the three of them. But I just, I won't comment on that.' Trump's comments come after he warned repeatedly this week of the threat posed byGoogle and other major technology companies over growing evidence of political bias, who he claims of manipulating search results in favor of left-leaning news outlets. On Wednesday, he even tweeted a video with the hashtag #StopTheBias,showing that Google promoted President Barack Obama's annual State of the Union address on its homepage but did not do the same for Trump's. #StopTheBias[47] pic.twitter.com/xqz599iQZw[48] \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 29, 2018[49] The company recently denied all allegations of political bias within their search results, arguing[50] that it is 'not used to set a political agenda' and that they 'don't bias our results toward any political ideology.' More[51] Alternative Social Network 'Minds' Debuts Digital Bill of Rights[52] While we wait for the government to act against the 'Masters of the Universe' here's a service we can use instead of the modern day 'robber barons' Dave Charlie Nash Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  Alternative social network Minds has debuted a digital bill of rights amid accusations of bias and political manipulation at Google, Facebook, and other Big Tech companies.  'Minds is officially adopting the Manila Principles On Intermediary Liability, a digital bill of rights, outlined by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other leading digital rights organizations,' the social network announced[53], Thursday. 'The principles have been endorsed by nearly 300 leading press freedom and technology policy organizations and individuals. They act as a guideline for protecting freedom of expression and create an open environment for innovation.' The bill of rights are as follows: 1. Intermediaries should be shielded from liability for third-party content. 2. Content must NOT be required to be removed without an order by a judicial authority. 3. Requests for restrictions of content must be clear, be unambiguous, and follow due process. 4. Laws and content restriction orders and practices must comply with the tests of necessity and proportionality. 5. Laws and content restriction policies and practices must respect due process. 6. Transparency and accountability must be built into laws and content restriction policies and practices. 'Our decision to adopt a digital bill of rights stems from our strong conviction that freedom of speech is an inalienable right and required for healthy societies to flourish,' declared a Minds spokesperson to Breitbart News. 'The implementation of these rights is a way to demonstrate our starkly different beliefs from those of other service providers and social networks like Google and Facebook regarding censorship, bias, and political manipulation.' 'We believe freedoms of expression and opinion are essential to our humanity, and that those freedoms need to extend across the entire ideological spectrum, rather than solely to those whose ideas are considered 'within the norm'. This is not an issue we see impacting one side of the political spectrum or the other\u2014non-conformist ideas are being censored every day on both the left and the right,' she continued. 'It is crucially important, now more than ever, to be able to discuss and share our ideas without fear of being silenced or censored by those with the most power.'

Because they were the ones who orchestrated the meetingin order to lure Papadopoulos into a trap!!! The whole meeting was a fake! This is the very sort of 'crime' that Mueller has been trying to set for Trump Asking questions that the FBI already knows the answers to for the sole purpose of criminalizing any inaccuracy that might be said Dave Kristina Wong Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide, will stick with his decision to plead guilty to one charge of making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigations, his wife Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos told Breitbart News on Wednesday. 'George will take responsibility for some inaccuracies during the interview with the FBI. I hope though that the judge will take into account the irrelevance of those 'inaccuracies' at the purposes of the investigation and the lack of 'criminal intention,'' she said in a statement. She had hinted[56] about the possibility of the withdrawal of his guilty plea of making false statements to the FBI, after new information surfaced that suggested he was potentially set up by the FBI. He is set to be sentenced on September 7. Papadopoulos agreed in October 2017 to plead guilty to one count of making false statements to the FBI about when he had met a Maltese professor, Joseph Mifsud, who had told him that the Russians had thousands of 'emails of Clinton.' He had told FBI agents in January 2017 that he met Mifsud before he joined the campaign, but he had actually met Mifsud a week afterward. The FBI allegedly launched its investigation into the Trump campaign because of Papadopoulos' conversation with Mifsud, but new information suggests he might have been set up More[57] DOJ's Bruce Ohr kept Mueller deputy 'in the loop' about anti-Trump dossier, sources say[58] This is the beginning of the end of Mueller's investigation The video puts it all together Dave Catherine Herridge Fox News August 30, 2018 Embattled Justice Department official Bruce Ohr had contact in 2016 with then-colleague Andrew Weissmann, who is now a top Robert Mueller deputy, as well as other senior FBI officials about the controversial anti-Trump dossier and the individuals behind it, two sources close to the matter told Fox News. The sources said Ohr's outreach about the dossier - as well as its author, ex-British spy Christopher Steele; the opposition research firm behind it, Glenn Simpson's Fusion GPS; and his wife Nellie Ohr's work for Fusion - occurred before and after the FBI fired Steele as a source over his media contacts. Ohr's network of contacts on the dossier included: former FBI agent Peter Strzok; former FBI lawyer Lisa Page; former deputy director Andrew McCabe; Weissmann and at least one other DOJ official; and a current FBI agent who worked with Strzok on the Russia case. Weissmann was kept 'in the loop' on the dossier, a source said, while he was chief of the criminal fraud division. He is now assigned to Special Counsel Mueller's team.  The list includes several figures who have since attracted the scorn of President Trump as he decries the Russia probe and those involved in its early stages. Trump has been particularly tough on Ohr, given his wife Nellie's past work for Fusion GPS, as the president alleges bias against him inside the department. Just Thursday morning, Trump complained on Twitter about Nellie Ohr's Fusion work and exclaimed, 'Bruce was a boss at the Department of Justice and is, unbelievably, still there!' Ohr's broad circle of contacts indicates members of FBI leadership knew about his backchannel activities regarding the dossier and Steele. Congressional Republicans are still trying to get to the bottom of Ohr's role in circulating the unverified dossier, which became a critical piece of evidence in obtaining a surveillance warrant for then-Trump campaign aide Carter Page in October 2016. Ohr was grilled by House committees behind closed doors for seven hours earlier this week The video and more[59] Email Logs Reveal Correspondence Between Clinton Associate, Fusion GPS, and Russians at Trump Tower Meeting[60] Aaron Klein Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  NEW YORK \u2014 Attorney Edward Lieberman, whose late wife Evelyn served as Hillary Clinton's chief of staff, exchanged numerous emails with the co-founder of the controversial Fusion GPS firm and Russian participants in the infamous June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting, documentation provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee shows. The correspondence, part of a series of exhibits provided to Senate investigators and reviewed by Breitbart News, took place in the weeks leading up to the Trump Tower meeting. Earlier this week, Breitbart News cited[61] witness testimony saying Lieberman was present at one and possibly two dinner meetings between the controversial Fusion GPS firm and key participants in the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. Also, Lieberman met with one Russian participant the same day of the Trump Tower meeting, according to separate testimony. Now the email logs provide a paper trail connection between Lieberman, Fusion GPS, and two of the Russian participants in the Trump Tower confab. Besides working for Hillary Clinton while she was First Lady, Lieberman's late wife, Evelyn, also served as Bill Clinton's deputy chief of staff, and famously transferred Monica Lewinsky out of the White House to the Defense Department. Edward Lieberman himself has been described as working within the orbit of the Clintons. He previously served[62] as legal counsel and advisor to the Albright Group LLC, which was founded by Madeleine K. Albright, who served as Bill Clinton's Secretary of State and who would later serve as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign. Lieberman's expertise, listed on his former Albright Group bio[63], includes 'multi-billion dollar privatizations of oil and gas assets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Russia.' The Russia collusion conspiracy was sparked by the dossier produced by Fusion GPS, which was paid for its anti-Trump work by Trump's primary political opponents, namely Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie law firm. As part of his interview with the Senate Judiciary Committee last August, Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson produced documentation requested by Senate investigators, including 'privilege logs' of the emails in question. The logs contained the names of the recipients of the emails as well as the dates and the subjects. The actual email texts were not provided by Simpson citing confidentiality due to 'attorney work product.' The documentation was given new scrutiny in light of this reporter's recent articles on Lieberman's ties toTrump Tower meeting participants More[64] Gohmert doubles down after FBI dismisses claim of Clinton server hack[65] Brooke Singman, Adam Shaw Fox News August 30, 2018 Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert doubled down after the FBI dismissed claims that a Chinese state-owned company hacked former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server. '[P]artisan politics, sadly, are very much at play within some of the leadership at the FBI,' the Texas congressman said in a statement[66] late Wednesday. The Daily Caller[67] first reported that the FBI was notified of the purported hack in 2015, when the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) warned the bureau of the intrusion.The hack reportedly implanted code that generated a 'courtesy copy' for almost all Clinton's emails \u2014 which was then forwarded to the Chinese company. A source briefed on the matter confirmed to Fox News the details of the Caller's reporting.Gohmert also had told Fox News on Tuesday that the emails were obtained by a foreign country's intelligence, though he declined to name the country in question. But on Wednesday, the FBI sharply disputed the claims, saying it 'has not found any evidence the servers were compromised.' In his overnight statement, Gohmert argued it was the ICIG \u2014 not the FBI \u2014 that discovered the breach. He said the FBI conveniently omitted that detail The video and more[68] Trump threatens DOJ, FBI to 'start doing their job' or he'll 'get involved' during Indiana rally[69] Elizabeth Zwirz Fox News August 30, 2018 President Trump tells supporters in Evansville, Indiana that the Justice Department and the FBI have to 'start doing their job,' and warns if it doesn't 'straighten out properly' he will have to get involved. President Trump on Thursday night seemingly issued an ultimatum to the Justice Department and the FBI - either they 'start doing their job' or he will 'get involved.' The president's pointed remarks came as he took the stage at a rally in Indiana in support of GOP Senate candidate Mike Braun, who is seeking to unseat Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly. 'All I can say is, our Justice Department and our FBI, at the top of each because inside they have incredible people, but our Justice Department and our FBI have to start doing their job and doing it right and doing it now because people are angry,' Trump said. 'What's happening is a disgrace.

Ambassador Haley joined the Foundation for Defense of Democracies to accept the Jeane Kirkpatrick Award for her defense of Israel at the U.N.While accepting the award, Haley called the U.N.'s treatment of Israel 'pathetic,' but added that she is making progress 'I knew there was a bias against Israel, but I hadn't really put a lot of thought into it until I attended my first session. And when I saw, literally, how abusive all of those countries were being to Israel, in a way that was pathetic. Really, I had no choice but to get up and say this is completely wrong.' Haley referred to the U.N.'s monthly sessions on the Middle East as 'Israel bashing sessions,' but she quickly started to make things right after arriving at the U.N.'Now we're makingthem talk about other areas in the Middle East,' said Haley. 'Now, frankly, they're scared to say anything negative about Israel because they don't want me to yell at them.' Haley also discussed the Trump administration's policies around foreignaid, adding that countries that chant 'death to America[75]' shouldn't get a 'single penny.' 'The countries that we give money to, do they believe what we believe? Are they still actually wanting to be our partner and work with us. If they're not and they're shouting 'death to America,' why would we give them a single penny? And so, you are seeing those efforts of defunding those things that are not helpful to us and that aren't in the United States' interests.'

Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestinian refugees\u2014 an amount that made up approximately one-quarter of their total funding.Tensions between the Palestinian Authority and the United States have been high since President Donald Trump moved the U.S. Embassy to Israel'scapital, Jerusalem[77].Following that move, the U.N. voted[78] in favor of a resolution condemning the embassy move.

'If you are a US government official and you are deporting Americans be warned,' Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego tweeted early Thursday. 'When the worm turns you will not be safe because you were just following orders. You do not have to take part in illegal acts ordered by this President's administration.'

An early ObamaCare misdirection out of Wisconsin is one that Republicans nationwide will have to anticipate.  Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Tony Evers is running an ad blaming Governor Scott Walker for high health-care premiums in the Badger State. Mr. Walker's supposed sin: Not taking the Affordable Care Act's bribe to expand Medicaid to able-bodied adults up to 138% of the poverty line. 'Minnesota's governor took the funds,' the ad says, and 'Wisconsin families now pay nearly 50% more than Minnesotans for the same health care.' The Evers free association compares the 2018 price of a mid-level ObamaCare exchange plan in Wisconsin and Minnesota\u2014a wildly misleading comparison. Premiums are increasing across the country thanks to ObamaCare's design. A Health and Human Services study last year found premiums doubled between 2013 and 2017 in an analysis of 39 states. No Governor could stop this trend alone, and a GOP Congress failed to repeal the law. In 2017 a Minnesota benchmark plan ran $412 a month, according to the same Kaiser Family Foundation data Mr. Evers cites. That's more than the $368 for 2017 in Wisconsin. Premiums in Minnesota ticked down to $385 a month in 2018. That's in part because the state instituted a 'reinsurance' program that defrays the costs of the sickest patients, which can lower premiums for everyone. Irony alert: This is what Mr. Walker is doing now. Wisconsin won federal approval for a reinsurance program for 2019. The Governor's office predicts an average 3.5% decrease in premiums next year, and 11% compared to what would have happened without the cash infusion. The relief simply hasn't hit insurance markets yet. Then there's the half-baked claim that Medicaid expansion lowers costs for folks trapped on the ObamaCare exchanges. Minnesota expanded Medicaid in 2013, and premiums for benchmark exchange plans still increased from $182 a month in 2014 to $412 in 2017. Wisconsin covers able-bodied adults up to the poverty line in a partial expansion, and premiums are hardly better in states that expanded fully like Illinois and Iowa. Democrats think they can bludgeon Republicans who haven't availed themselves of the 'free' Medicaid money from the feds, though that funding can't last forever. Minnesota predicted at most 141,000 folks would sign up for Medicaid expansion, but more than 200,000 showed up. That will soon crunch Minnesota's budget as the state's share of the expansion tab ticks up to 10% by 2020, and if other states are a guide Minnesota will have to spend less on schools or public safety or limit health services for the poorest. Mr. Evers isn't trying to debate the merits of Medicaid expansion so much as claim that somehow he can keep health costs down. He can't. The deliberate obfuscation is part of the left's tactic to persuade voters that health care is so complicated that resources must be commanded by government (single payer). More[93] Neil Armstrong Movie Starring Canadian Ryan Gosling Doesn't Feature American Flag[94] This may be the most flagrant act of revising history for globalism yet I remember witnessing that moon landing back when I was 7 years old and one of the most prominent thing we saw on those staticky TV images was the American Flag See for yourself in this video[95] The history revisionists of the liberal media want us to delete our memories This movie deserves to crash and burn Dave Justin Caruso Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  A new movie starring Canadian actor Ryan Gosling tells of the story of Neil Armstrong landing on the moon-but omits the American flag.  The Telegraph reports[96]that the flag is not shown in the new movie First Man, with star Ryan Gosling saying that the American moon landing 'transcended countries and borders,' and that instead of being an American achievement, it was a 'human achievement.' The Canadian actor also acknowledged[97] his own 'cognitive bias' due to his nationality. First Man is slated for an October 12, 2018 release date. It's unclear exactly why the movie would omit the iconic image of Buzz Aldrin standing on the moon with the American flag planted in the surface, even if the producers do consider it a 'human achievement' and not solely an American one. Although, it is solely an American one, as the United States is, to this day, the only nation that sent a man to the moon More[98] Turkish Lira Weakens as Central Bank Fails to Assuage Investors[99] Analysts think the move won't cure financial problems; increasing interest rates viewed as controversial David Gauthier-Villars The Wall Street Journal Aug. 29, 2018  ISTANBUL\u2014Turkey's central bank took steps to undo some of the emergency support it provided to its banks in recent weeks, reviving investor concerns over the nation's financial stability as the Turkish lira continued its slide against the dollar. Ratings firm Moody's also rattled investors by downgrading 18 Turkish banks[100] on fears they will face growing difficulties in difficulties in refinancing foreign-currency loans.  'There is a heightened risk of a downside funding scenario,' the ratings agency said in a research note.  Turkey's Finance Minister Berat Albayrak\u2014the son-in-law of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan[101]\u2014remained unconcerned on Wednesday. 'We do not see a big risk about Turkey's economy or financial system,' he told reporters on a plane returning from Paris, according to Turkish media. Mr. Albayrak has said he would announce a package of economic measures next month to address debt issues and inflation, which reached 16% last month. The collapse of the lira[102]\u2014it has lost 40% of its value against the dollar this year\u2014has sent ripples through the global financial system, raising concerns about the exposure of some European banks and denting investor appetite for emerging markets[103]. Analysts now fear that mass defaults will weigh on Turkish banks[104]. In early afternoon European trading, $1 bought 6.45 lira.  Turkey's central bank had pledged[105] to provide banks with all the liquidity they needed earlier this month, after the lira had tumbled[106] to its lowest reading ever against the dollar, said it had reintroduced a ceiling on such borrowing, in effect limiting banks access to short-term funding.  Analysts said the move would do little to cure Turkey's acute financial problems[107], which range from galloping inflation to growing fears that the nation's banks and corporations won't be able to cope with hefty foreign-currency debt.

While the talks are at an early stage and may not result in any aid, the possibilities being discussed range from a coordinated European bailout similar to the kind deployed during the eurozone debt crisis to project-specific loans by state-controlled development banks and bilateral aid. Berlin fears a meltdown of the Turkish economy could spill over into Europe, cause further unrest in the Middle East and trigger a new wave of immigration toward the north.  'We would do a lot to try to stabilize Turkey,' a senior German official said. 'We don't have much choice.' Other European governments have grown equally concerned. Hosting his Turkish counterpart in Paris on Monday, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said it was important to support Turkey's efforts to repair its economy.

No one made eye contact. Andy Ngo The Wall Street Journal Aug. 29, 2018  Residents of Luton, England, 30 miles north of London. Photo: Andy Ngo London - Other tourists may remember London for its spectacular sights and history, but I remember it for Islam. When I was visiting the U.K. as a teenager in 2006, I got lost in an East London market. There I saw a group of women wearing head-to-toe black cloaks. I froze, confused and intimidated by the faceless figures. It was my first encounter with the niqab, which covers everything but a woman's eyes. This summer, I found myself heading back to the U.K. as it was plunging into a debate over Islamic dress. Boris Johnson, the country's former foreign secretary and London's ex-mayor, wrote a column opposing attempts to ban face-covering veils. Nonetheless, he added, 'it is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes.' The responses could hardly have been more heated. I wanted to cut past the polemics and experience London's Muslim communities for myself. My first visit was to Tower Hamlets, an East London borough that is about 38% Muslim, among the highest in the U.K. As I walked down Whitechapel Road, the adhan, or call to prayer, echoed through the neighborhood. Muslims walked in one direction for jumu'ah, Friday prayer, while non-Muslims went the opposite way. Each group kept its distance and avoided eye contact with the other. A sign was posted on a pole: 'Alcohol restricted zone.' Women and girls were dressed in hijabs, niqabs and abayas (robes) The scene could have been lifted out of Riyadh, a testament to the Arabization of Britain's South Asian Muslims. At the barbershop, women waited outside under the hot sun while their sons and husbands were groomed. Inside the East London Mosque, visitors were expected to dress 'modestly.' Headscarves were provided at reception for any woman who showed up without one. A kind mangave me a bag filled with booklets about Islam. In one, Muslims are encouraged to 're-establish the Shari'ah,' or Islamic law. Those who ignore this mandate are 'of little worth to any society.' Forty-eight hours later, I woke up to the news that a car had rammed a Westminster security barrier. Police arrested Salih Khater, a 29-year-old Sudanese refugee who had been given asylum and British citizenship. Three people were injured in the attack. London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, expressed support for banning vehicles from parts of Parliament Square. Next I visited Leyton, another district in East London where some Muslim social norms prevail. An Arab cafe near the Tube station was filled with men; no women were inside. An Islamic bookstore sold hijab-wearing dolls for children. The dolls had blank, featureless faces, since human depictions are prohibited in conservative Islam. I stopped outside the Masjid al-Tawhid, a South Asian Salafi mosque and madrassa (school) A group of girls in robes and veils walked around back, toward the dumpsters, where the women's entrance is located. I later saw the Islamic Shari'a Council of Leyton. This community has religious, educational, business and legal institutions to maintain a separate identity. All this gave me pause. But I was unprepared for what I would see next in Luton, a small town 30 miles north of London and the birthplace of the English Defense League, which has held unruly anti-Muslim demonstrations. At the Central Mosque, I met a friendly group of Punjabi-speaking young men. 'You've come to see Luton?' one struggled to ask me in English. The young men asked me to follow them through the town center We passed a church, which was closed and decrepit, with a window that had been vandalized with eggs More[112] Macron Tells Denmark 'No Such Thing as a True Dane, True Frenchman'[113] By destroying national identity globalist politicians like Macron set Europe up for Islamification If there is no national identity - or national heritage then how can anyone complain that their national identity is being drowned out by Muslim immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East? Dave Virginia Hale Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  French politicians have reacted with anger after Emmanuel Macron asserted that 'true' Frenchmen and Danes 'do not exist', and attacked the people he rules over as stubbornly resistant to change while on an official visit to Denmark. The French president made the remarks while on a three-day tour of Denmark and Finland, where he is hoping to establish a 'progressive arc' of nations supporting his vision[114] of a globalised EU superstate, which would revolve around a liberal conception of human rights, ahead of European Parliament elections next year. Speaking before a gala lobster dinner on Wednesday, at which Denmark's Queen Margaret was in attendance, Macron praised[115] the Scandinavian nation as one which is 'completely open to the rest of the world' compared with a France whose people he said showed a 'Gaulish stubborn resistance to change' France has a 'deep and complex identity, which has always been thought of as universalism', the former investment banker said, before stating he believes he has succeeded in provoking 'cultural change' in the native since his election last year. 'People are changing their minds, they are much more open to risk,' he told the event, which was broadcast on Danish television. 'You will see France transformed by its people.' Asked by a Danish student about the future of national identities in Europe, Macron said that 'the 'true Dane' does not exist \u2014 he is a European Even your language is not just Danish \u2014 it is European. The same is true for the French'  The president's performance overseas attracted ire from French politicians including far-left populist Alexis Corbire, who accused him of having 'not only shown contempt towards his own people' but also of displaying 'an astounding level of stupidity', tweeting[116] that Macron was 'ignorant of the fact the Gauls were great inventors'. Meanwhile, National Rally leader Marine Le Pen commented: 'In Denmark, Macron castigates the 'Gaulish stubborn resistance to change'. As usual, he despises the French from abroad! The 'Gauls' will be happy to respond to his arrogance and contempt!'

'To avoid the risk of victims of Islamic violence, I have decided not to let the cartoon contest go ahead,' Geert Wilders said in a written statement, noting he did not want others endangered by the contest he had planned for November. The contest was to have been held at the tightly guarded offices of his Party for Freedom in the Dutch parliament building. 'It's not just about me,' Wilders, who has a history of inflammatory statements about Islam, said in the statement. Strong opponents of the event 'see not only me, but the entire Netherlands as a target.' He followed up the statement later in the day with a tweet saying: 'Islam showed its true face once again with death threats, fatwas and violence. However, the safety and security of my fellow countrymen comes first.'

For Beijing, that could be a good thing. The investigators' report, released this week by the U.N.'s human-rights agency, gives China a fresh chance to shelter Myanmar's military and political leaders from international pressure, drawing them further into Beijing's orbit as the U.S. retreats from the region, analysts say.

The newsletter reads[2]: 'CNN's critics continued to lampoon the network on Tuesday over its\u00a0July story[3] about the infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting. The story, written by\u00a0Jim Sciutto, Carl Bernstein,\u00a0and\u00a0Marshall Cohen, cited sources who said Michael Cohen was prepared to tell\u00a0Robert Mueller\u00a0that Trump knew in advance of the meeting that the Russians were expected to offer dirt on\u00a0Hillary Clinton.' 'Over the past week, Cohen lawyer\u00a0Lanny Davis\u00a0has publicly said he was one of the sources who confirmed the news to CNN and other media organizations,' it also adds. </p><p>'Davis now says he cannot confirm the news. Davis' walk back has prompted critics   a good chunk of whom belong to the right-wing media universe   to unleash a torrent of criticism on CNN.' The newsletter, which was put together by CNN reporter Oliver Darcy (the usual writer of the newsletter, Brian Stelter, is currently on 'vaycay[4]'), reminds readers that 'Davis walking back his claims doesn't necessarily debunk CNN's story.' The newsletter then points to a statement from a CNN spokesperson, who said, 'We stand by our story, which had more than one source, and are confident in our reporting of it' Now, this could be true. If CNN actually has another solid source or sources for their story, then Davis\u00a0changing his story[5]-which he might have done simply to save his client, Michael Cohen, from possible legal trouble-may not necessarily prove the story false. However, that is not the only issue. As The Intercept's Glenn Greenwald points out[6], it may well be the case that CNN lied to readers completely by writing that Lanny Davis did not want to comment in its original story, when he was, in fact, a source. As Greenwald wrote[7] in The Intercept Tuesday: 'Last night, BuzzFeed\u00a0reported[8]\u00a0that Davis\u00a0explicitly confessed that he was one of the anonymous sources for CNN's July 26 story, just as he was for the stories from the Washington Post and the New York Post. Last week,\u00a0CNN put Davis\u00a0on the air\u00a0with Anderson Cooper[9]\u00a0to deny that he was the source for that CNN story - a denial Cooper did not contest - but Davis now admits he was one of CNN's sources, if not their main source.' Yet remarkably, CNN, in its July 26\u00a0story,\u00a0specifically claimed that Davis\u00a0refused to talk to CNN\u00a0about the story or provide any comment whatsoever. Greenwald continued: 'Only one of two things can be true here, and either is extremely significant:\u00a0(1)\u00a0CNN deliberately lied to its audience about Davis refusing to comment on the story when, in fact, Davis was one of the anonymous sources on which the CNN report depended, and CNN claimed Davis refused to comment in order to hide Davis' identity as one of their anonymous sources; or\u00a0(2)\u00a0Davis is lying now to BuzzFeed when he confessed to having been one of CNN's sources for the story.' Indeed, as Greenwald writes, either CNN is lying or Davis is lying about his being a source for the story. But think about it-if Davis really was lying, going around and telling other news outlets that he was a source for the CNN story when he actually was not, then wouldn't CNN correct the record immediately and state that Davis was not a source? Why has CNN not done this? More[10] Trump: CNN's Trump Tower Story Source 'Doesn't Exist,' 'Credibility Is Now Gone'[11] John Nolte Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  President Donald Trump mocked CNN and Carl Bernstein Thursday claiming their 'credibility is now gone' and there is no 'source' for the far-left network's Trump Tower story, a story that collapsed into a pile of fake news[12] this week. 'CNN is working frantically to find their 'source.' Look hard because it doesn't exist,' Trump tweeted. 'Whatever was left of CNN's credibility is now gone!' On July 27, CNN's Carl Bernstein and Jim Sciutto were two of three bylined reporters behind a bombshell report that claimed Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, would testify Trump knew in advance of a meeting at Trump Tower that took place during the 2016 election between Trump's campaign senior staff and a Russian lawyer. The story also said that Cohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis, refused comment on the story. As has been the case with CNN 'bombshells' too many times before, nothing published by CNN ended up being true. Not only has Lanny Davis said Cohen knows nothing about Trump having any foreknowledge of the meeting, Davis also admits he was a CNN source. This,\u00a0of course, means Bernstein intentionally misled the public when he reported Davis was not a source for the story. Nevertheless, even though the story has imploded, CNN has not only refused to correct or retract the false report but continues to stand by it, as does the now-disgraced Bernstein[13]. With Davis admitting he was the source, CNN has been claiming it has a another source, which is what Trump means when he is mocking their search for that 'source.' Even so, even if CNN has another source, that source should be outed by CNN as a liar. If that source even exists, he or she is guilty of giving CNN bad information. Back in the good old days, when the media was somewhat concerned about its credibility and deterring 'sources' from lying, sources guilty of lying were named and shamed. This Trump Tower story was CNN's biggest of the year and the biggest story the hapless Bernstein has had since he and Bob Woodward parted ways 40 years ago. To have something like this implode is a massive humiliation, even for a shameless outlet like CNN More[14] On CNN, Carl Bernstein Forgets He Once Tried to Keep CIA 'Propaganda' *Out* of the Newsroom[15] Curtis Ellis Breitbart News 29 Aug 2018  President Trump is slamming CNN for being caught in a major lie and refusing to admit its mistake, and Carl Bernstein for 'living in the past.' Bernstein, the investigative journalist of Watergate fame, is at the center of CNN's (latest) fake news scandal: a 'bombshell' story carrying Bernstein's byline that's been thoroughly debunked. But 'The Most Trusted Name in News' refuses to retract it. The dud story would be enough of a problem, but the legendary reporter has another problem: Carl Bernstein has forgotten his own past. The evidence? The company he keeps in the present, specifically his fellow CNN contributor James Clapper, the former Director of National Intelligence. Let's set the way back machine to 1977, in Carl's past when he wrote the 25,000 word cover story for Rolling Stone magazine, 'The CIA and the Media[16].' The investigative piece details how the CIA used the New York Times, Washington Post, CBS and other American news organizations during the Cold War to gather intelligence, provide cover for its agents and even shape news reports. Bernstein's piece focused mainly on the agency's foreign intelligence operations, but he raised the specter that the CIA may have colored the news Americans read and watch. 'Many journalists and some CIA officials dispute the agency's claim that it has been scrupulous in respecting the editorial integrity of American publications and broadcast outlets,' Bernstein noted, adding 'CIA-generated black propaganda' could be turning up in American publications. 'The traditional line separating the American press corps and government,' as Bernstein put it, as inviolable as the separation of church and state, had been blurred. The thrust of Bernstein's story was clear: Intelligence agencies are expert in disinformation, deception and duplicity. There should be no suspicion they are using their tradecraft to shape American public opinion and public policy. Bernstein reserved his greatest contempt for publishers and editors who allowed their newspapers and networks 'to become handmaidens to the intelligence services.' He didn't spare his former employer, the Washington Post. That was then. Today, the same Carl Bernstein who was concerned about intelligence operatives compromising American journalism has no problem with James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence, being paid by CNN to tell the American public what he wants them to think. Bernstein even sits next to Clapper on set while he does it. James Clapper, you may recall is guilty of perjury[17], having lied to Congress[18] to cover up the NSA's mass surveillance of American citizens More[19] Donald Trump Rips CNN's Jeff Zucker: 'Little Jeff Z' and CNN's Ratings 'Suck'[20] These media frauds used to get away with their false narratives because most people are too polite and conflict-avoiding to confront them on it That's not happening with this President Dave Charlie Spiering Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  President Donald Trump ripped CNN's president, Jeff Zucker, on Thursday, taunting him for bad ratings and bad journalism. 'Little Jeff Z has done a terrible job, his ratings suck, ATT should fire him to save credibility!' Trump wrote on Twitter. The president blamed the media's 'hatred' and 'bias' for their dishonesty about his administration despite great economic news for the country. 'The hatred and extreme bias of me by CNN has clouded their thinking and made them unable to function,' he wrote. 'But actually, as I have always said, this has been going on for a long time.' Trump seemed particularly angry with the morning news coverage on Thursday which included a New York Times report[21]\u00a0that Ivanka Trump, his daughter, and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, were forcing out White House counsel Don McGahn. 'The Fake News Media has it, purposely, so wrong!' Trump said in response to the story. 'They love to portray chaos in the White House when they know that chaos doesn't exist-just a 'smooth running machine' with changing parts!' He also appeared to refer to reporter Bob Woodward's upcoming book, which is likely to further the narrative of chaos in the White House. 'I just cannot state strongly enough how totally dishonest much of the Media is. Truth doesn't matter to them, they only have their hatred agenda,' he wrote. 'This includes fake books, which come out about me all the time, always anonymous sources, and are pure fiction. Enemy of the People!' Trump signaled frustration with NBC News as well, sharing rumors that Andy Lack would be fired. 'What's going on at CNN is happening, to different degrees, at other networks - with NBC News being the worst,' he wrote. 'The good news is that Andy Lack(y) is about to be fired(?) for incompetence and much worse.' The New York Post reported[22]\u00a0that Comcast executives are quietly seeking a replacement for Lack.

The post showed an image of naked, emaciated children who were starved at the hands of the Nazi regime Google Is Trump's Most Dangerous Enemy[25] Allum Bokhari Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  After criticizing social media platforms for mass-censoring conservatives and the alternative media earlier this month, President Trump has turned his attention to Google.[26] Not a moment too soon   of all the politically biased tech giants, Google is by far the most dangerous. Trump's critical comments about Google referenced statistics from a report[27] in PJ Media which found that a staggering 96 percent of search results for 'Trump' return results from news sites that are hostile to the President. Breitbart News' own investigation[28] found the same result. As Google search results are personalized, this wasn't a strictly scientific study   that would require tests on hundreds, if not thousands of Google users. But the fact that a\u00a0conservative columnist\u00a0received search results that were 96 percent liberal should be deeply worrying. If that's what a conservative with a (presumably) conservative search history sees, what kind of results are being sent to swing-voters? The fact that it could be a problem of all search engines[29], not just Google, due to the way search algorithms detect 'trustworthy' content is true, but Google holds a stranglehold on the search market. It's closest english-language competitor, Bing, holds 7 percent of the market for searches according to NetMarketShare[30]. Another obvious problem with Google search is how its algorithm repeatedly surfaces information from Wikipedia at the top of search results. Wikipedia is an 'online encyclopedia' that relies on a mass of anonymous, unaccountable editors to create its myriad of pages. The encyclopedia's citation rules, which favor academic and establishment media sources while excluding sources like Breitbart News and the Daily Caller as 'unreliable' inherently favor the left. So too does its cabal of unaccountable left-wing editors, who are slowly but surely turning the purportedly non-partisan encyclopedia into a platform for anti-Trump propaganda. Wikipedia editors recently[31] added Trump to a list of advocates of the 'white genocide conspiracy theory' following his comments on the racially motivated murders of white farmers in South Africa. They previously[32] included ICE detention centers on a Wikipedia list of 'concentration camps.' The result of Google's reliance on a far-left encyclopedia is that false information - fake news, you could say - has the potential to reach the top of the search engine's results, like the time when the California GOP were labeled a 'Nazi' party on Wikipedia, a categorization that then made its way to Google.[33].. More[34] Donald Trump: We Will Not Tolerate Censorship, Blacklisting, Rigged Search from Big Tech[35] Charlie Spiering Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  President Donald Trump vowed to stand for free speech on Thursday, warning Big Tech against censoring conservative voices. 'I've made it clear that we as a country cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting, and rigged search results,' Trump said, calling out social media companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter. The president commented on the issue at his campaign rally in Indiana on Thursday night, ahead of the midterm elections in November. Trump said his administration would always stand up for free speech for 'all Americans,' warning the left that their own voices could someday be censored. 'We will not let large corporations silence conservative voices,' he said. Trump suggested that such activities were un-American, reiterating the principle of free speech. 'We're not going to let them control what we can and cannot see, read, and learn from, we can't do that,' Trump said. 'America is a free country and we're going to stay always a free country.' More[36] Over 1,000 Big Tech Executives Donated to Democratic Super PAC ActBlue Since 2015[37] Lucas Nolan Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  According to a recent report, more than 1,000 executives and employees from the Silicon Valley Masters of the Universe have donated to a pro-Democrat super PAC since 2015. A report from BigLeaguePolitics.com[38] claims that since 2015, over 1,000 executives and employees from tech giants such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Apple have all donated to ActBlue, a pro-Democrat super PAC that has raised $1.5 billion since 2015. Details of the super PAC's fundraising activities were gathered by the Federal Elections Commission[39] and compiled by watchdog website Campaign Money[40]. The data shows that executives, vice presidents, managers, and regular employees at major tech firms were behind a large number of donations to the PAC. According to Big League Politics reporter Tom Pappert, some of the donors to the PAC include: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg Twitter co-Founder Evan Williams Google senior executives Urs Holzle, Vinton Cerf, and Jennifer Fitzpatrick Apple senior executives Angela Ahrendts and Lisa Jackson Between 2015 and 2016 alone, a large list of names from tech giants appears across the super PAC's donation rolls, with approximately 600 names from Google, 271 from Apple, 108 from Facebook, and 34 from Twitter. USA Today reported[41] on August 5 that ActBlue had raised more than $1 billion this election cycle ahead of the November midterms More[42] Trump: Big Tech in 'Very Anti-Trust Situation'[43] What we're going through right now with the 'Masters of the Universe' parallels the 'robber baron' days of the late 1800s Back then, monopolies like Standard Oil and Bell Telephone were infamous for influencing politicians and heavy-handed manipulation The government responded with two solutions Standard Oil[44] was broken up, while Bell Telephone[45] became a regulated utility (although Ma Bell was finally broken up in 1984) Both actions were designed to reign in monopoly power Bell Telephone, with its network of communication points is a closer analogy to the social networks of today The solution is to treat the Facebooks, Twitters, and Googles of this world as utilities that must provide service to all unless national security or law enforcement concerns say otherwise In other words, it is the government's job to monitor and censornot private companies that are free toto reward their friends and punish their enemies Dave Ben Kew Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  President Donald Trump has suggested major technology firms such as Amazon and Facebook could be in a 'very anti-trust situation,' but declined to comment on whether they should be broken up. 'I won't comment on the breaking up, of whether it's that or Amazon or Facebook,' Trump said about big tech in a Thursday interview[46]\u00a0with Bloomberg. 'As you know, many people think it is a very anti-trust situation, the three of them. But I just, I won't comment on that.' Trump's comments come after he warned repeatedly this week of the threat posed by\u00a0Google and other major technology companies over growing evidence of political bias, who he claims of manipulating search results in favor of left-leaning news outlets. On Wednesday, he even tweeted a video with the hashtag #StopTheBias,\u00a0showing that Google promoted President Barack Obama's annual State of the Union address on its homepage but did not do the same for Trump's. #StopTheBias[47] pic.twitter.com/xqz599iQZw[48]   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 29, 2018[49] The company recently denied all allegations of political bias within their search results, arguing[50] that it is 'not used to set a political agenda' and that they 'don't bias our results toward any political ideology.'

'Minds is officially adopting the Manila Principles On Intermediary Liability, a digital bill of rights, outlined by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other leading digital rights organizations,' the social network announced[53], Thursday. 'The principles have been endorsed by nearly 300 leading press freedom and technology policy organizations and individuals. They act as a guideline for protecting freedom of expression and create an open environment for innovation.' The bill of rights are as follows: 1. Intermediaries should be shielded from liability for third-party content. 2. Content must NOT be required to be removed without an order by a judicial authority. 3. Requests for restrictions of content must be clear, be unambiguous, and follow due process. 4. Laws and content restriction orders and practices must comply with the tests of necessity and proportionality. 5. Laws and content restriction policies and practices must respect due process. 6. Transparency and accountability must be built into laws and content restriction policies and practices. 'Our decision to adopt a digital bill of rights stems from our strong conviction that freedom of speech is an inalienable right and required for healthy societies to flourish,' declared a Minds spokesperson to Breitbart News. 'The implementation of these rights is a way to demonstrate our starkly different beliefs from those of other service providers and social networks like Google and Facebook regarding censorship, bias, and political manipulation.' 'We believe freedoms of expression and opinion are essential to our humanity, and that those freedoms need to extend across the entire ideological spectrum, rather than solely to those whose ideas are considered 'within the norm'. This is not an issue we see impacting one side of the political spectrum or the other non-conformist ideas are being censored every day on both the left and the right,' she continued. 'It is crucially important, now more than ever, to be able to discuss and share our ideas without fear of being silenced or censored by those with the most power.'

Because they were the ones who orchestrated the meetingin order to lure Papadopoulos into a trap!!! The whole meeting was a fake! This is the very sort of 'crime' that Mueller has been trying to set for Trump Asking questions that the FBI already knows the answers to for the sole purpose of criminalizing any inaccuracy that might be said Dave Kristina Wong Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide, will stick with his decision to plead guilty to one charge of making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigations, his wife Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos told Breitbart News on Wednesday. 'George will take responsibility for some inaccuracies during the interview with the FBI. I hope though that the judge will take into account the irrelevance of those 'inaccuracies' at the purposes of the investigation and the lack of 'criminal intention,'' she said in a statement. She had hinted[56] about the possibility of the withdrawal of his guilty plea of making false statements to the FBI, after new information surfaced that suggested he was potentially set up by the FBI. He is set to be sentenced on September 7. Papadopoulos agreed in October 2017 to plead guilty to one count of making false statements to the FBI about when he had met a Maltese professor, Joseph Mifsud, who had told him that the Russians had thousands of 'emails of Clinton.' He had told FBI agents in January 2017 that he met Mifsud before he joined the campaign, but he had actually met Mifsud a week afterward. The FBI allegedly launched its investigation into the Trump campaign because of Papadopoulos' conversation with Mifsud, but new information suggests he might have been set up More[57] DOJ's Bruce Ohr kept Mueller deputy 'in the loop' about anti-Trump dossier, sources say[58] This is the beginning of the end of Mueller's investigation The video puts it all together Dave Catherine Herridge Fox News August 30, 2018 Embattled Justice Department official Bruce Ohr had contact in 2016 with then-colleague Andrew Weissmann, who is now a top Robert Mueller deputy, as well as other senior FBI officials about the controversial anti-Trump dossier and the individuals behind it, two sources close to the matter told Fox News. The sources said Ohr's outreach about the dossier - as well as its author, ex-British spy Christopher Steele; the opposition research firm behind it, Glenn Simpson's Fusion GPS; and his wife Nellie Ohr's work for Fusion - occurred before and after the FBI fired Steele as a source over his media contacts. Ohr's network of contacts on the dossier included: former FBI agent Peter Strzok; former FBI lawyer Lisa Page; former deputy director Andrew McCabe; Weissmann and at least one other DOJ official; and a current FBI agent who worked with Strzok on the Russia case. Weissmann was kept 'in the loop' on the dossier, a source said, while he was chief of the criminal fraud division. He is now assigned to Special Counsel Mueller's team.  The list includes several figures who have since attracted the scorn of President Trump as he decries the Russia probe and those involved in its early stages. Trump has been particularly tough on Ohr, given his wife Nellie's past work for Fusion GPS, as the president alleges bias against him inside the department. Just Thursday morning, Trump complained on Twitter about Nellie Ohr's Fusion work and exclaimed, 'Bruce was a boss at the Department of Justice and is, unbelievably, still there!' Ohr's broad circle of contacts indicates members of FBI leadership knew about his backchannel activities regarding the dossier and Steele. Congressional Republicans are still trying to get to the bottom of Ohr's role in circulating the unverified dossier, which became a critical piece of evidence in obtaining a surveillance warrant for then-Trump campaign aide Carter Page in October 2016. Ohr was grilled by House committees behind closed doors for seven hours earlier this week The video and more[59] Email Logs Reveal Correspondence Between Clinton Associate, Fusion GPS, and Russians at Trump Tower Meeting[60] Aaron Klein Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  NEW YORK   Attorney Edward Lieberman, whose late wife Evelyn served as Hillary Clinton's chief of staff, exchanged numerous emails with the co-founder of the controversial Fusion GPS firm and Russian participants in the infamous June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting, documentation provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee shows. The correspondence, part of a series of exhibits provided to Senate investigators and reviewed by Breitbart News, took place in the weeks leading up to the Trump Tower meeting. Earlier this week, Breitbart News cited[61] witness testimony saying Lieberman was present at one and possibly two dinner meetings between the controversial Fusion GPS firm and key participants in the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. Also, Lieberman met with one Russian participant the same day of the Trump Tower meeting, according to separate testimony. Now the email logs provide a paper trail connection between Lieberman, Fusion GPS, and two of the Russian participants in the Trump Tower confab. Besides working for Hillary Clinton while she was First Lady, Lieberman's late wife, Evelyn, also served as Bill Clinton's deputy chief of staff, and famously transferred Monica Lewinsky out of the White House to the Defense Department. Edward Lieberman himself has been described as working within the orbit of the Clintons. He previously served[62] as legal counsel and advisor to the Albright Group LLC, which was founded by Madeleine K. Albright, who served as Bill Clinton's Secretary of State and who would later serve as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign. Lieberman's expertise, listed on his former Albright Group bio[63], includes 'multi-billion dollar privatizations of oil and gas assets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Russia.' The Russia collusion conspiracy was sparked by the dossier produced by Fusion GPS, which was paid for its anti-Trump work by Trump's primary political opponents, namely Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie law firm. As part of his interview with the Senate Judiciary Committee last August, Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson produced documentation requested by Senate investigators, including 'privilege logs' of the emails in question. The logs contained the names of the recipients of the emails as well as the dates and the subjects. The actual email texts were not provided by Simpson citing confidentiality due to 'attorney work product.' The documentation was given new scrutiny in light of this reporter's recent articles on Lieberman's ties to\u00a0Trump Tower meeting participants More[64] Gohmert doubles down after FBI dismisses claim of Clinton server hack[65] Brooke Singman, Adam Shaw Fox News August 30, 2018 Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert doubled down after the FBI dismissed claims that a Chinese state-owned company hacked former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server. '[P]artisan politics, sadly, are very much at play within some of the leadership at the FBI,' the Texas congressman said in a statement[66] late Wednesday.\u00a0 The Daily Caller[67] first reported that the FBI was notified of the purported hack in 2015, when the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) warned the bureau of the intrusion.\u00a0The hack reportedly implanted code that generated a 'courtesy copy' for almost all Clinton's emails   which was then forwarded to the Chinese company.\u00a0 A source briefed on the matter confirmed to Fox News the details of the Caller's reporting.\u00a0Gohmert also had told Fox News on Tuesday that the emails were obtained by a foreign country's intelligence, though he declined to name the country in question. But on Wednesday, the FBI sharply disputed the claims, saying it 'has not found any evidence the servers were compromised.'\u00a0 In his overnight statement, Gohmert argued it was the ICIG   not the FBI   that discovered the breach. He said the FBI conveniently omitted that detail The video and more[68] Trump threatens DOJ, FBI to 'start doing their job' or he'll 'get involved' during Indiana rally[69] Elizabeth Zwirz Fox News August 30, 2018 President Trump tells supporters in Evansville, Indiana that the Justice Department and the FBI have to 'start doing their job,' and warns if it doesn't 'straighten out properly' he will have to get involved. President Trump on Thursday night seemingly issued an ultimatum to the Justice Department and the FBI - either they 'start doing their job' or he will 'get involved.' The president's pointed remarks came as he took the stage at a rally in Indiana in support of GOP Senate candidate Mike Braun, who is seeking to unseat Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly. 'All I can say is, our Justice Department and our FBI, at the top of each because inside they have incredible people, but our Justice Department and our FBI have to start doing their job and doing it right and doing it now because people are angry,' Trump said. 'What's happening is a disgrace.

And when I saw, literally, how abusive all of those countries were being to Israel, in a way that was pathetic. Really, I had no choice but to get up and say this is completely wrong.' Haley referred to the U.N.'s monthly sessions on the Middle East as 'Israel bashing sessions,' but she quickly started to make things right after arriving at the U.N.\u00a0'Now we're making\u00a0them talk about other areas in the Middle East,' said Haley. 'Now, frankly, they're scared to say anything negative about Israel because they don't want me to yell at them.' Haley also discussed the Trump administration's policies around foreign\u00a0aid, adding that countries that chant 'death to America[75]' shouldn't get a 'single penny.' 'The countries that we give money to, do they believe what we believe? Are they still actually wanting to be our partner and work with us. If they're not and they're shouting 'death to America,' why would we give them a single penny? And so, you are seeing those efforts of defunding those things that are not helpful to us and that aren't in the United States' interests.'

'When the worm turns you will not be safe because you were just following orders. You do not have to take part in illegal acts ordered by this President's administration.'

An early ObamaCare misdirection out of Wisconsin is one that Republicans nationwide will have to anticipate.  Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Tony Evers is running an ad blaming Governor Scott Walker for high health-care premiums in the Badger State. Mr. Walker's supposed sin: Not taking the Affordable Care Act's bribe to expand Medicaid to able-bodied adults up to 138% of the poverty line. 'Minnesota's governor took the funds,' the ad says, and 'Wisconsin families now pay nearly 50% more than Minnesotans for the same health care.' The Evers free association compares the 2018 price of a mid-level ObamaCare exchange plan in Wisconsin and Minnesota a wildly misleading comparison. Premiums are increasing across the country thanks to ObamaCare's design. A Health and Human Services study last year found premiums doubled between 2013 and 2017 in an analysis of 39 states. No Governor could stop this trend alone, and a GOP Congress failed to repeal the law. In 2017 a Minnesota benchmark plan ran $412 a month, according to the same Kaiser Family Foundation data Mr. Evers cites. That's more than the $368 for 2017 in Wisconsin. Premiums in Minnesota ticked down to $385 a month in 2018. That's in part because the state instituted a 'reinsurance' program that defrays the costs of the sickest patients, which can lower premiums for everyone. Irony alert: This is what Mr. Walker is doing now. Wisconsin won federal approval for a reinsurance program for 2019. The Governor's office predicts an average 3.5% decrease in premiums next year, and 11% compared to what would have happened without the cash infusion. The relief simply hasn't hit insurance markets yet. Then there's the half-baked claim that Medicaid expansion lowers costs for folks trapped on the ObamaCare exchanges. Minnesota expanded Medicaid in 2013, and premiums for benchmark exchange plans still increased from $182 a month in 2014 to $412 in 2017. Wisconsin covers able-bodied adults up to the poverty line in a partial expansion, and premiums are hardly better in states that expanded fully like Illinois and Iowa. Democrats think they can bludgeon Republicans who haven't availed themselves of the 'free' Medicaid money from the feds, though that funding can't last forever. Minnesota predicted at most 141,000 folks would sign up for Medicaid expansion, but more than 200,000 showed up. That will soon crunch Minnesota's budget as the state's share of the expansion tab ticks up to 10% by 2020, and if other states are a guide Minnesota will have to spend less on schools or public safety or limit health services for the poorest. Mr. Evers isn't trying to debate the merits of Medicaid expansion so much as claim that somehow he can keep health costs down. He can't. The deliberate obfuscation is part of the left's tactic to persuade voters that health care is so complicated that resources must be commanded by government (single payer).

The Telegraph reports[96]\u00a0that the flag is not shown in the new movie First Man, with star Ryan Gosling saying that the American moon landing 'transcended countries and borders,' and that instead of being an American achievement, it was a 'human achievement.' The Canadian actor also acknowledged[97] his own 'cognitive bias' due to his nationality. First Man is slated for an October 12, 2018 release date. It's unclear exactly why the movie would omit the iconic image of Buzz Aldrin standing on the moon with the American flag planted in the surface, even if the producers do consider it a 'human achievement' and not solely an American one. Although, it is solely an American one, as the United States is, to this day, the only nation that sent a man to the moon More[98] Turkish Lira Weakens as Central Bank Fails to Assuage Investors[99] Analysts think the move won't cure financial problems; increasing interest rates viewed as controversial David Gauthier-Villars The Wall Street Journal Aug. 29, 2018  ISTANBULTurkey's central bank took steps to undo some of the emergency support it provided to its banks in recent weeks, reviving investor concerns over the nation's financial stability as the Turkish lira continued its slide against the dollar. Ratings firm Moody's also rattled investors by downgrading 18 Turkish banks[100] on fears they will face growing difficulties in difficulties in refinancing foreign-currency loans.  'There is a heightened risk of a downside funding scenario,' the ratings agency said in a research note.  Turkey's Finance Minister Berat Albayrak the son-in-law of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan[101] remained unconcerned on Wednesday. 'We do not see a big risk about Turkey's economy or financial system,' he told reporters on a plane returning from Paris, according to Turkish media. Mr. Albayrak has said he would announce a package of economic measures next month to address debt issues and inflation, which reached 16% last month. The collapse of the lira[102] it has lost 40% of its value against the dollar this year has sent ripples through the global financial system, raising concerns about the exposure of some European banks and denting investor appetite for emerging markets[103]. Analysts now fear that mass defaults will weigh on Turkish banks[104]. In early afternoon European trading, $1 bought 6.45 lira.  Turkey's central bank had pledged[105] to provide banks with all the liquidity they needed earlier this month, after the lira had tumbled[106] to its lowest reading ever against the dollar, said it had reintroduced a ceiling on such borrowing, in effect limiting banks access to short-term funding.  Analysts said the move would do little to cure Turkey's acute financial problems[107], which range from galloping inflation to growing fears that the nation's banks and corporations won't be able to cope with hefty foreign-currency debt.

While the talks are at an early stage and may not result in any aid, the possibilities being discussed range from a coordinated European bailout similar to the kind deployed during the eurozone debt crisis to project-specific loans by state-controlled development banks and bilateral aid. Berlin fears a meltdown of the Turkish economy could spill over into Europe, cause further unrest in the Middle East and trigger a new wave of immigration toward the north.  'We would do a lot to try to stabilize Turkey,' a senior German official said. 'We don't have much choice.' Other European governments have grown equally concerned. Hosting his Turkish counterpart in Paris on Monday, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said it was important to support Turkey's efforts to repair its economy.

No one made eye contact. Andy Ngo The Wall Street Journal Aug. 29, 2018  Residents of Luton, England, 30 miles north of London. Photo: Andy Ngo London - Other tourists may remember London for its spectacular sights and history, but I remember it for Islam. When I was visiting the U.K. as a teenager in 2006, I got lost in an East London market. There I saw a group of women wearing head-to-toe black cloaks. I froze, confused and intimidated by the faceless figures. It was my first encounter with the niqab, which covers everything but a woman's eyes. This summer, I found myself heading back to the U.K. as it was plunging into a debate over Islamic dress. Boris Johnson, the country's former foreign secretary and London's ex-mayor, wrote a column opposing attempts to ban face-covering veils. Nonetheless, he added, 'it is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes.' The responses could hardly have been more heated. I wanted to cut past the polemics and experience London's Muslim communities for myself. My first visit was to Tower Hamlets, an East London borough that is about 38% Muslim, among the highest in the U.K. As I walked down Whitechapel Road, the adhan, or call to prayer, echoed through the neighborhood. Muslims walked in one direction for jumu'ah, Friday prayer, while non-Muslims went the opposite way. Each group kept its distance and avoided eye contact with the other. A sign was posted on a pole: 'Alcohol restricted zone.' Women and girls were dressed in hijabs, niqabs and abayas (robes) The scene could have been lifted out of Riyadh, a testament to the Arabization of Britain's South Asian Muslims. At the barbershop, women waited outside under the hot sun while their sons and husbands were groomed. Inside the East London Mosque, visitors were expected to dress 'modestly.' Headscarves were provided at reception for any woman who showed up without one. A kind mangave me a bag filled with booklets about Islam. In one, Muslims are encouraged to 're-establish the Shari'ah,' or Islamic law. Those who ignore this mandate are 'of little worth to any society.' Forty-eight hours later, I woke up to the news that a car had rammed a Westminster security barrier. Police arrested Salih Khater, a 29-year-old Sudanese refugee who had been given asylum and British citizenship. Three people were injured in the attack. London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, expressed support for banning vehicles from parts of Parliament Square. Next I visited Leyton, another district in East London where some Muslim social norms prevail. An Arab cafe near the Tube station was filled with men; no women were inside. An Islamic bookstore sold hijab-wearing dolls for children. The dolls had blank, featureless faces, since human depictions are prohibited in conservative Islam. I stopped outside the Masjid al-Tawhid, a South Asian Salafi mosque and madrassa (school) A group of girls in robes and veils walked around back, toward the dumpsters, where the women's entrance is located. I later saw the Islamic Shari'a Council of Leyton. This community has religious, educational, business and legal institutions to maintain a separate identity. All this gave me pause. But I was unprepared for what I would see next in Luton, a small town 30 miles north of London and the birthplace of the English Defense League, which has held unruly anti-Muslim demonstrations. At the Central Mosque, I met a friendly group of Punjabi-speaking young men. 'You've come to see Luton?' one struggled to ask me in English. The young men asked me to follow them through the town center We passed a church, which was closed and decrepit, with a window that had been vandalized with eggs More[112] Macron Tells Denmark 'No Such Thing as a True Dane, True Frenchman'[113] By destroying national identity globalist politicians like Macron set Europe up for Islamification If there is no national identity - or national heritage then how can anyone complain that their national identity is being drowned out by Muslim immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East? Dave Virginia Hale Breitbart News 30 Aug 2018  French politicians have reacted with anger after Emmanuel Macron asserted that 'true' Frenchmen and Danes 'do not exist', and attacked the people he rules over as stubbornly resistant to change while on an official visit to Denmark. The French president made the remarks while on a three-day tour of Denmark and Finland, where he is hoping to establish a 'progressive arc' of nations supporting his vision[114] of a globalised EU superstate, which would revolve around a liberal conception of human rights, ahead of European Parliament elections next year. Speaking before a gala lobster dinner on Wednesday, at which Denmark's Queen Margaret was in attendance, Macron praised[115] the Scandinavian nation as one which is 'completely open to the rest of the world' compared with a France whose people he said showed a 'Gaulish stubborn resistance to change' France has a 'deep and complex identity, which has always been thought of as universalism', the former investment banker said, before stating he believes he has succeeded in provoking 'cultural change' in the native since his election last year. 'People are changing their minds, they are much more open to risk,' he told the event, which was broadcast on Danish television. 'You will see France transformed by its people.' Asked by a Danish student about the future of national identities in Europe, Macron said that 'the 'true Dane' does not exist   he is a European Even your language is not just Danish   it is European. The same is true for the French'  The president's performance overseas attracted ire from French politicians including far-left populist Alexis Corbi\u00e8re, who accused him of having 'not only shown contempt towards his own people' but also of displaying 'an astounding level of stupidity', tweeting[116] that Macron was 'ignorant of the fact the Gauls were great inventors'. Meanwhile, National Rally leader Marine Le Pen commented: 'In Denmark, Macron castigates the 'Gaulish stubborn resistance to change'. As usual, he despises the French from abroad! The 'Gauls' will be happy to respond to his arrogance and contempt!' More[117] Dutch anti-Islam lawmaker cancels Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest[118] Frank Miles Fox News August 30, 2018 A far-right opposition Dutch lawmaker, who for years has lived under round-the-clock protection because of death threats sparked by his fierce anti-Islam rhetoric, canceled a planned Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest Thursday, following concerns of extreme threat. 'To avoid the risk of victims of Islamic violence, I have decided not to let the cartoon contest go ahead,' Geert Wilders said in a written statement, noting he did not want others endangered by the contest he had planned for November. The contest was to have been held at the tightly guarded offices of his Party for Freedom in the Dutch parliament building. 'It's not just about me,' Wilders, who has a history of inflammatory statements about Islam, said in the statement. Strong opponents of the event 'see not only me, but the entire Netherlands as a target.' He followed up the statement later in the day with a tweet saying: 'Islam showed its true face once again with death threats, fatwas and violence. However, the safety and security of my fellow countrymen comes first.'

Elizabeth Heng, who is running for California's 16th congressional district seat, made[2] the video about her parent's escape from mass-murder by the Khmer Rouge communists in the 1970s. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/elizabethheng/videos/1886765958288459/\">https://www.facebook.com/elizabethheng/videos/1886765958288459/</url>[3] However, according to the Christian Post[4], Facebook deemed the video to be 'shocking, disrespectful or sensational,' and refused to allow her to run the video as an ad on the platform. .@facebook[5] rejected my video because it was 'too shocking' for their platform, referring to the scenes of horrific events my parents survived in Cambodia.

This is why I wake up every single day with the fight and determination to have a voice and make a difference in my community.' 'Neither Facebook nor any other company in the tech industry get to silence our stories,' she continued. 'We've seen it over and over again with Republican candidates and organizations.' As reported by the Christian Post, 'The Cambodian Civil War, which ended in 1975, killed an estimated 275,000-310,000 people and displaced two million others from rural areas.' Facebook has censored political ads before. The platform blocked[10] an ad from Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), leading her to testify in front of Congress about censorship More[11] Facebook, Apple Purge InfoWars for 'Hate Speech'[12] Lucas Nolan Breitbart News 6 Aug 2018  The Masters of the Universe at Facebook and Apple have censored InfoWars pages and podcasts on their platforms, both claiming Alex Jones and company engage in 'hate speech.' Following the recent suspension of Alex Jones'[13] Facebook page and the removal of InfoWars podcasts[14] from Spotify, Facebook has permanently removed multiple InfoWars pages from its site while Apple has taken steps to remove InfoWars podcasts from its podcast directory. Facebook has removed the following InfoWars pages from their platform: the Alex Jones Channel Page, the Alex Jones Page, the Infowars Page and the Infowars Nightly News Page. A blog post related to Facebook Community Standards discusses the decision to remove InfoWars related pages stating More[15] YouTube Deletes InfoWars, Alex Jones Channel[16] Lucas Nolan Breitbart News 6 Aug 2018  Master of the Universe Google's video platform YouTube has deleted the channel of InfoWars host Alex Jones shortly after Facebook and Apple removed InfoWars content from their platforms. YouTube has reportedly deleted InfoWars host Alex Jones channel from their platform. This comes shortly after Facebook removed[17] multiple InfoWars\u00a0pages from their website and Apple removed the majority of InfoWars podcasts from their podcast directory. InfoWars\u00a0Editor Paul Joseph Watson tweeted about the permanent deletion of Alex Jones' YouTube channel, calling the move a 'coordinated purge' on the part of Silicon Valley tech companies. The Alex Jones Channel has been permanently DELETED by YouTube. This is a coordinated PURGE. This is political censorship. pic.twitter.com/gyYiSSYFwI[18]   Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) August 6, 2018[19] Apple, Spotify, Facebook and now Google (which owns YouTube) - all within 12 hours of each other. A coordinated purge. This is a total abuse of power.   Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) August 6, 2018[20] Facebook explained their direction to remove InfoWars related pages saying More[21] InfoWars Ban: CNN, Democrats Successfully Lobby Big Tech to Censor Their Critics[22] Allum Bokhari Breitbart News 6 Aug 2018  Big tech's coordinated purge of InfoWars\u00a0  which was hit by bans from Apple, Facebook, Spotify and YouTube in rapid succession\u00a0  did not occur in a vacuum. On this issue, Silicon Valley bowed to CNN journalists and Democrat politicians who ceaselessly lobbied for the site to be censored. It's a sign of how the concentration of power in America has shifted from big government to big tech that politicians are now lobbying tech companies rather than the other way round, but that's exactly what happened over the course of the past few months, as Democrats\u00a0applied relentless pressure on Facebook and other Silicon Valley giants to censor InfoWars. Chief among them was Democratic Congressman Ted Deutch (D-FL), who demanded that a Facebook representative 'explain' their decision not to ban InfoWars at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on social media censorship last month. Calling Jones as 'well-known conspiracy theorist' whose 'brand is bullying,' Deutch also demanded Google's representative explain how many strikes it would take for a channel on Google-owned YouTube to be deleted. He then asked Google's representative if they thought conspiracy theories were a 'problem,' and asked her to explain the company's planned solutions. It seems that YouTube has now come up with a solution: ban the channels that Rep. Deutch objects to. At a previous hearing on social media censorship, Deutch, who represents Parkland, Florida, attacked[23] tech companies for allowing 'vile and outrageous and offensive garbage' on their platforms. Multiple other congressional Democrats[24], including Reps. Jerrold Nadler, Jim Hines, and Ted Lieu have attacked the very idea of big tech censorship, calling Republican concerns a 'conspiracy theory' and defending the right of tech giants to censor whomever they want. Far-left media also played a role in demanding tech giants appoint themselves as the arbiters of free speech. Here's[25]\u00a0the Guardian\u00a0attacking Facebook for continuing to host InfoWars, and here's[26] BuzzFeed's Joe Bernstein wondering why Twitter hasn't followed Facebook, YouTube, Spotify and Apple in today's purge More[27] Hollywood Celebrates Masters of the Universe Banning Alex Jones: 'It's About Damn Time'[28] The fools They don't even realize that by endorsing this kind of censorship they are putting their own necks on the media chopping block It's just a matter of time Dave Jerome Hudson Breitbart News 6 Aug 2018  A handful of Hollywood personalities took to Twitter on Monday to celebrate tech giants Apple, Facebook, and YouTube's decision to purge radio host Alex Jones and his Infowars properties from their platforms. 'Good news: YouTube, Facebook, Apple and Spotify are all banning Alex Jones and Infowars. Bad news: He'll either get a job offer from Fox News or Donald Trump,' Actress and Former Netflix talk show host Chelsea Handler wrote 'YESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!! Thank you @Apple!' Will Grace star Debra Messing tweeted More[29] West Hollywood passes resolution to remove President Trump's Hollywood Walk of Fame star[30] This is just vicious Unhinged President Trump is being dishonored for what?  Winning the election? Speaking uncomfortable truths? Dave Julius Young Fox News August 7, 2018 LOS ANGELES - The West Hollywood City Council passed a resolution Monday night to have President Trump's star removed from the Hollywood Walk of Fame, according to a tweet by the city's mayor. 'West Hollywood City council unanimously passes resolution asking the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to remove the Donald Trump star on Hollywood Walk of Fame,' announced Mayor John Duran on Twitter.  Trump was awarded his star on the prestigious stretch of Hollywood Blvd in Los Angeles, Calif. in 2007 during the height of his 'Apprentice' fame, and it has been defaced and vandalized numerous times since he has been in office More[31] The Attack on Alex Jones Is An Attack on Free Speech[32] Joel B. Pollack Breitbart News 6 Aug 2018  Internet provocateur and InfoWars proprietor Alex Jones is being systematically excluded from social media platforms. This is, plainly, an attack on free speech. Over the weekend, Facebook removed[33] several Alex Jones-related pages, and Apple deleted many of his podcasts. On Monday, YouTube followed suit by deleting[34] his video channel. Pinterest closed[35] its InfoWars page. Twitter may soon do the same[36]. The timing is no coincidence: all of these outlets are responding to a campaign by left-wing activists who are determined to shut down conservative voices   including Breitbart. It is a\u00a0shameful[37]\u00a0effort   which is why some of those responsible for the boycotts have tried to maintain their anonymity. Today, they are circulating 'copy/paste[38]' talking points that argue they are not abusing freedom of speech or the press by pushing companies to ban Jones, because 'free speech protects you from your government.' Jones is being censored by private companies, not the government. He has no right, after all, to force anyone to carry his content. It is true that\u00a0the\u00a0First Amendment is not implicated by private censorship, but\u00a0free speech certainly is damaged by it. From the point of view of the person being silenced, it makes absolutely no difference whether the censor is a policeman or a mob. And freedom of speech is a social value, a characteristic of an open and democratic society that has exists quite independently of the government. It is   or ought to be   sustained by civil society, even and especially when the views expressed are objectionable. We have the right to express contrary views   or to ignore those who seek to offend. That is the traditional American approach, and it has made us the freest and most creative nation in history More[39] Gary Cohn Warns: Facebook Bigger Threat Than Banks Before Great Recession[40] Joshua Caplan Breitbart News 6 Aug 2018  Former\u00a0White House economic adviser Gary Cohn believes that big tech companies pose a larger threat to Americans than big banks before the financial crisis of 2007-2008. In an\u00a0interview[41] with Bloomberg Business, the former Goldman Sachs executive and former Trump administration official said the influence of large U.S. financial institutions pales in comparison to technology behemoths such as Facebook. Gary Cohn, formerly president of Goldman Sachs, says social media companies are a larger societal danger than big banks before the financial crisis      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/XEAGOTEyHY\">https://t.co/XEAGOTEyHY</url>[42] pic.twitter.com/WlpE0NHwWc[43]   Axios (@axios) August 6, 2018[44]; 'In '08 Facebook was one of those companies that was a big platform to criticize banks, they were very out front of criticizing banks for not being responsible citizens,' Cohn said[45]. 'I think banks were more responsible citizens in '08 than some of the social media companies are today. And it affects everyone in the world. The banks have never had that much pull.' More[46] Rosie O'Donnell: Most of the People at Trump's Rallies Are 'Paid to Be There'[47] And Rosie knows this how???  This is pure propaganda, presented without critical cross-examination on MSNBC News Dave Pam Key Breitbart News 6 Aug 2018  Monday on MSNBC's 'The Beat,' comedian\u00a0Rosie O'Donnell said most of the people at rallies that President Donald Trump headlines were 'paid to be there.' O'Donnell said, 'This man is like a joke and mainstream media treated him as a legitimate candidate as if they were two equals, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. It was a falsehood from the start. I think the best thing we can do is encourage people to vote. Come November. We will save democracy or lose it. That is the whole thing. If we save democracy and turn the House, he's gone. It will take however long it takes to have the impeachment trial, but we will start the healing in America and not being on different sides and understand what this man did was unfair and inhumane and even to the people who trusted him the most. That's what's heartbreaking.' She added, 'You see these people at these rallies, most paid to be there, screaming he's right and letting the racist deep dark corners of their soul flourish. It's so against everything American. It really is. I hope we can flip this and save democracy. If we can't, I have to believe fascism will take over in America. That will be the death of democracy, this 200 something-year-old experiment.'

CNN's Jim Acosta took to Twitter on Wednesday night to describe Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity as a 'propagandist' who is damaging American perceptions of the news media. Yes, Acosta, you are the enemy of the people as are all so-called newscasters who deliberately try to warp the public's perception of reality and destroy a president, on the basis of false narratives that they themselves manufactured CNN's Acosta: All Journalists Should Make Bumper Stickers, Buttons, Chant 'We're Not the Enemy of the People'[50]. Thursday on CNN's 'Newsroom,' network chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta discussed his unsuccessful attempts to get White House press secretary Sarah Sanders to say the press was not the 'enemy of the people' at today's briefing. A Response To Online Shadow Banning[51] 'Common carriage' law points to a solution for the problem of censorship on social media. Adam Candeub The Wall Street Journal Aug. 5, 2018  Have you been shadow banned? That's the term for Twitter's limiting the reach of disfavored accounts. The company can, for instance, remove your name from its autopopulated drop-down search box, making it harder to find you.  Twitter is alleged to have shadow-banned Republican National Committee Chairman Ronna McDaniel, Donald Trump Jr. spokesman Andrew Surabian, and GOP Reps. Mark Meadows (N.C.), Jim Jordan (Ohio), Devin Nunes (Calif.) and Matt Gaetz (Fla.). President Trump took to Twitter on July 26 to denounce shadow banning, vowing to 'look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once!' Mr. Trump is on solid ground, supported by centuries of common-law precedent. To this day, mail service, telephones and airlines operated under 'common carriage' law and must serve all customers regardless of their political, religious or social views. The se protections have a long history. Precedents from the 17th century outlawed discrimination by docks, ferries and bailors. Common-law courts extended the idea, as technology developed, to railroads and telegraphs, and then eventually to telephones and air travel. Administration agencies later codified the protections into regulation More[52] Exclusive Fred Campbell: 'We the People Should Decide Whether' Google, Facebook Can Censor[53] Sean Moran Breitbart News 6 Aug 2018  Former FCC Wireless Bureau Chief Fred Campbell told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Monday that 'We the people should decide' whether Google, Facebook, and Twitter can censor and block content. Silicon Valley giants Apple, Facebook, YouTube, and Spotify banned [54]Infowars from their platforms on Monday, which has raised concerns about the free state of the Internet. In an interview in April, the former Federal Communications Commission (FCC) wireless bureau chief told[55] Breitbart News that the Safe Harbor provision in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act allows social media giants to censor at will. Internet service providers (ISPs) and edge providers such as Facebook and Google can host or publish other users' content without being legally liable for their users' content. Campbell called for the Safe Harbor provision to be repealed, contending that it violates the First Amendment and overrides common law protections against libel and other falsehoods. The former FCC executive said on Monday: 'If they want the ability to edit the Internet and take down Alex Jones, then they should not have Section 230 immunity. If they're acting like a publisher, which is what they're doing, they're doing the same sort of editorial decision making that newspapers and other print publications have been doing since immemorial, if they want to do that why are they not subject to the same rules that the print media is subject to?' 'They're subject to a legislative exception that is a couple decades old, overturning a century of law. If they want to play editor, great, then comply with the laws that all of the others editors comply with and give up your special exemption,' he added. The former FCC executive continued, suggesting that could solve the issue of Silicon Valley censorship without regulation by using antitrust action. 'It's about holding the largest companies in the world to the same legal antitrust standards that have been applied since the 19th\u00a0century,' he said.\u00a0Campbell said More[56] Former 'Doctor Who' David Tennant Attacks Trump on 'Behalf of the Scottish Nation'[57]: Former Doctor Who star David Tennant has claimed to speak on 'behalf of the Scottish nation' by declaring that the entire nation hates President Donald Trump. America's Better Than This[58] Terry Paulson TownHall Aug 06, 2018  When I first heard reports and saw Facebook posts calling for violence, it seemed a sensational fringe suffering from Trump derangement syndrome, but recent polls are showing that more and more leftists are seeing 'civil war' as the only answer to save America. Trump is delivering on his promises to reverse President Obama's leftist 'transformation,' and the left hates him for it. Trump's recent appointment of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and his threat to close down government if he doesn't get funding for his border wall has just further stirred up the left's hornet's nest! Demonstrations no longer seem to be enough. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her pro-Trump colleagues were thrown out by the owner of the Red Hen Restaurant in Virginia mid-meal. Florida's Attorney General Pam Bondi was followed and harassed by a leftist mob as she and her husband left a movie theater after watching the Mister Rogers documentary stressing goodness and love for one's neighbor. Antifa continues to call for violence against the right. Outspoken Rep. Maxine Waters, chieftain of the Trump impeachment brigade, called for attacks on the Trump administration: 'If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.' A recent\u00a0Rasmussen Reports\u00a0national telephone and online survey found that many voters fear that political violence is coming from opponents of the president. Nearly one-in-three think a civil war is next. Thirty-one percent (31%) of likely U.S. voters say it's likely that the United States will experience a second civil war sometime in the next five years, with 11% saying it's 'Very Likely.' Sure, 59% consider a second civil war unlikely, but it doesn't take many to create strategic attacks. More realistically, 59% of all voters are concerned that those opposed to President Trump's policies will resort to violence, with 33% being 'Very Concerned.  Thomas W. Chittum warns in 'Civil War II:' 'To understand the future, study the past. Throughout world history, all multi-ethnic empires have broken up, and almost always in cataclysmic violence. Therefore, the question is not if the multi-ethnic American Empire will shatter, but when and under what circumstances.' More[59] NeverTrump's insane foreign policy[60] Carolyn Glick 08/05/2018 George Orwell once\u00a0quipped[61], referring to a conspiracy theory that American soldiers had been brought to England in World War II to put down a working-class rebellion rather than to fight Nazi Germany:\u00a0'One has to belong to the intelligentsia to believe things like that: no ordinary man could be such a fool.' His insight is certainly valid in connection to the 'NeverTrump' intellectuals today. Case in point is a recent\u00a0article[62]\u00a0published by Never Trump super-intellectual, the Brookings Institute's Robert Kagan. Earlier in the summer, Kagan wrote an oped in the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0where he laid out his best case against President Donald Trump's foreign policy. Not to put too sharp a point on things: It was unhinged. Titled\u00a0'Trump's America does not care[63],' Kagan made a contention that was wrong and then made two additional assertions which were also wrong   and which, even worse, contradicted one another. Kagan's basic contention was that Trump has transformed the United States from a moral actor and a great power into an immoral actor and a 'rogue power.' Trump did this, apparently, by committing the unpardonable offense of basing his foreign policy on U.S. interests. It used to be that outside the confines of a marginal groups of Communists and their fellow travelers, no one in Washington would ever argue that it is immoral for the United States to use its foreign policy to advance its national interests. But at a time when Trump Derangement Syndrome spreads like the plague through intellectual circles, Kagan wrote that under Trump, the 'United States [behaves like a] rogue superpower, neither isolationist nor internationalist, neither withdrawing nor in decline, but active, powerful and entirely out for itself.' And what has happened as a result of Trump acting entirely on behalf of his nation? How has Trump's America First foreign policy transformed America into a rogue superpower? For the answer, we come to Kagan's two further assertions. First, Kagan said that it is immoral for the U.S. to use foreign policy to advance its national interests as Trump is doing. Second, Kagan wrote that the U.S. is only allowed to advance its national interests by adhering to the post-World War II alliance system the U.S. constructed 70 years ago (because it advanced the U.S's primary national interest at the time of defeating the Soviet Union in the Cold War). Before considering the veracity of these assertions, it is important to mention that they cannot both be true. Obviously, if it is immoral for the U.S. to use its foreign policy as a means to advance its national interest, then it is immoral for the U.S. to advance its interests through the Cold War alliance system. As it works out, neither of Kagan's assumptions is true More[64] Progressive Insurance advertising supports Huffington Post's vitriolic articles that promote dangerous Islamist propaganda and inflame repulsive attitudes towards Christians, Jews and American troops and white people[65] Florida Family Association Click here to send your email to encourage Progressive Insurance officials to stop supporting Huffingtonpost.com who publishes vitriolic articles that promote dangerous Islamist propaganda and inflame repulsive attitudes towards Christians, Jews and American troops.[66] Post message at:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/progressive\">https://www.facebook.com/progressive</url>/[67] Huffington Post is feeding its 'hate America' audience with vitriolic articles that promote dangerous Islamist propaganda and inflame repulsive attitudes towards Christians, Jews, American troops white people. Huffingtonpost.com published a column on its home page titled[68]: White Evangelicals Are The Most Fragile Of All White People. The column is a sordid collection of unsubstantiated attacks on the character of 'white evangelicals' and Christians. The author of this hideous racist, column wrote the following and many more insults without any supporting facts:   White Evangelical Christians are particularly fragile, with whiteness being normalized and pandered to in society and theologized in the church.   Christians are taught that what they perceive of what is inside of them is the most important factor in any scenario   race not excluded.   White supremacy ensures that white feelings will always trump the lived experiences of people of color.    When situations arise where race and privilege are questioned and criticized, often times white people free fall into fear, anger, silence, denial or guilt. Huffington Post has published many articles that defend Islamist doctrine. The harshest tenets of Islamist doctrine, aka Sharia law, are antithetical to the rights afforded under the United States Constitution and pose threats to public safety. Huffington Post articles have defended the Muslim Brotherhood, fundraised for the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), blamed Christian Islamophobia for worldwide conflict with Muslims, promoted an anti-Semitic blog, encouraged Islamist demagoguery, and promoted other Islamist propaganda. The Huffington Post has former Al Jazeera journalists writing articles and Huffington Post Arabic is led by hard line Islamists from Al Jazeera.

The new sanctions limit dealings in Iran's currency and with its automotive industry. They also threaten U.S. penalties for banks that finance the precious-metals trade with Iran and against anyone who sells precious metals to the Iranian government. And, as The Wall Street Journal reports,[73] worries about a shaky economy and enticed by government sales of gold coins, Iranians have converted savings into gold recently even as prices skyrocketed\u00a0 More[74] Trump Defends Son's Meeting With Russians as 'Totally Legal'[75] NewsMax Sunday, 05 August 2018  President Donald Trump repeated that he didn't know about his son's meeting with Russians at Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign, while asserting that such meetings are a routine part of politics   'totally legal and done all the time.' Trump has said similar things about the June 2016 meeting. On July 27, Trump said on Twitter that 'I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr,' in response to reports that his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, was ready to tell authorities that Trump had known. 'Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam,' Trump said of Cohen. CNN reported that Cohen was prepared to tell federal investigators that the president knew ahead of time about the meeting, at which a Russian lawyer with links to the Kremlin was expected to deliver damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Such testimony by Cohen, a longtime fixer for Trump, would contradict the testimony and public denials of the president, his son, and other campaign officials who've repeatedly said the president wasn't aware of the meeting until more than a year later. The Trump Tower meeting was attended by the president's son as well as Paul Manafort, then chairman of Trump's presidential campaign; Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and several Russians, including the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, and their representatives. Appearing on ABC's 'This Week' on Sunday less than an hour after the president tweeted, Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said nobody had identified any law potentially violated by Trump's son in participating in the meeting. 'The question is, how would it be illegal?' he said. ABC correspondent George Stephanopoulos noted that conspiracy to defraud the U.S. has been suggested as a possible charge. Sekulow, who's not representing Trump Jr., also said he had no knowledge of the president's son being told he's a target of the special counsel's investigation, or whether he's been interviewed by the special counsel More[76] Was there anything illegal about the Trump Tower meeting?[77] Critics attack the president for admitting that the 2016 meeting with Russians was meant to get dirt on Hillary Clinton.

Illegal Aliens Self Deporting to Canada Due to Trump's Crackdown[80] John Binder Breitbart News 6 Aug 2018  Illegal aliens are self deporting to Canada, moving across the northern border due to President Trump's crackdown on immigration. A new report[81] by the Washington Post chronicles the stories of multiple illegal aliens who were living in the United States and have now decided to self deport to Canada in order to avoid deportation. In one case highlighted by the Washington Post, an illegal alien single mother from Eritrea with two U.S.-born anchor babies decided to flee Las Vegas and head to Canada after she was denied asylum. 'So now I am here just hoping it gets better,' Mesfin said as she pushed the stroller, while trying to manage her toddler, toward Canada More[82] Sessions rips federal judge for 'improperly' reinstating DACA, 'eviscerating' executive power[83] Gregg ReFox News August 6, 2018 Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday unloaded on a federal judge who ordered the administration to reinstate the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy last week, saying the ruling was 'improper' and vowing to keep up enforcement efforts against illegal immigration 'aggressively.' Sessions added that the judge had effectively 'eviscerated' the legal authority of the executive branch and Congress, and strongly suggested the administration would appeal the ruling More[84] Names of non-US citizens increasingly found on voter rolls[85] THIS is what we call foreign interference in American elections Dave Lukas Mikelionis Fox News August 2, 2018 and the right to vote??? Dave Non-American citizens are increasingly found on voter rolls thanks to covert registration methods, with nothing actually stopping them from casting a ballot in an election. Elizaveta Shuvalova, a Russian citizen who became a U.S. citizen only last year, was registered as an eligible voter in 2012 and added to the San Francisco voter rolls, the Washington Times[86] reported. She was perplexed to find herself in the voter rolls, saying she wasn't an American citizen and didn't even register to vote. 'I've never registered for anything in my entire life,' Shuvalova told the paper. 'This is news to me.'  The woman's voter log shows that she signed up as a Democrat in July 2012. In 2016, her registration was canceled after she informed election authorities that she wasn't eligible to vote because she wasn't yet a U.S. citizen. 'This is definitely a shocker to me. It is like an identity fraud because this is not coming from my end,' the woman, who identifies as a Democrat, said. 'Like I told you, I haven't even been a citizen during that time frame. So what can we do about it?'  But the case of Shuvalova is part of a larger concern some groups have when it comes integrity of elections. They claim that stories like hers are a common occurrence in many parts of the country. The Public Interest Legal Foundation, a nonprofit specializing in election integrity, found[87] that non-Americans are being added to voter rolls in states such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Virginia. The group says that a large portion of the non-citizens even managed to cast their ballots in elections as well. For instance, in 2017, the group found[88] that nearly 5,600 people on the voter rolls in Virginia were deemed as non-citizens, with a third of them voting in previous elections.

Fakrol Islam, 26, was charged with arson, reckless endangerment and criminal mischief.\u00a0The incident took place at a 7-Eleven gas station at about 1:50 a.m. on Monday, July 30, according to the New York Police Department.  Video footage released by the NYPD shows Islam putting gas in a gas can, pouring the gasoline around a pump, then torching a piece of paper and igniting a fire that spread around nearby pumps.

U.S. District Judge Lawrence J. O'Neill issued the sentence Monday, which came after Everitt Aaron Jameson of Modesto, California, admitted under a plea deal in June that he tried to aid a terrorist organization. Jameson could have received 40 years in prison. The 27-year-old planned the attack during talks with undercover FBI agents, including one he thought was with the Islamic State terror group. Jameson told undercover federal agents that he planned to use pipe bombs to channel victims into part of Pier 39 so he could shoot them.

Safaa Boular, 18, of Vauxhall, London, was convicted of preparing acts of terrorism and attempting to travel to Syria to join Islamic State militants.  Prosecutors said one of the possible targets for an attack by Boular was the British Museum. She had been groomed online for terrorist activity by her fiance, Naweed Hussain, an Islamic\u00a0State fighter, who later died, prosecutors said. She originally hoped to marry in Raqqa, the ISIS proclaimed capital in Syria, but was prevented from traveling there by police in April 2017.\u00a0Hussain, 32, died in an airstrike. In passing sentence, Judge Mark Dennis QC told Boular her views were 'deeply entrenched' and 'she was old enough to make her own decisions, and her own choices,'\u00a0the BBC reports. 'However much she may have been influenced and drawn into extremism, it appeared she knew what she was doing and acted with open eyes,' the judge added.

This is why I wake up every single day with the fight and determination to have a voice and make a difference in my community.' 'Neither Facebook nor any other company in the tech industry get to silence our stories,' she continued. 'We've seen it over and over again with Republican candidates and organizations.' As reported by the Christian Post, 'The Cambodian Civil War, which ended in 1975, killed an estimated 275,000-310,000 people and displaced two million others from rural areas.' Facebook has censored political ads before. The platform blocked[10] an ad from Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), leading her to testify in front of Congress about censorship More[11] Facebook, Apple Purge InfoWars for 'Hate Speech'[12] Lucas Nolan Breitbart News 6 Aug 2018  The Masters of the Universe at Facebook and Apple have censored InfoWars pages and podcasts on their platforms, both claiming Alex Jones and company engage in 'hate speech.' Following the recent suspension of Alex Jones'[13] Facebook page and the removal of InfoWars podcasts[14] from Spotify, Facebook has permanently removed multiple InfoWars pages from its site while Apple has taken steps to remove InfoWars podcasts from its podcast directory. Facebook has removed the following InfoWars pages from their platform: the Alex Jones Channel Page, the Alex Jones Page, the Infowars Page and the Infowars Nightly News Page. A blog post related to Facebook Community Standards discusses the decision to remove InfoWars related pages stating More[15] YouTube Deletes InfoWars, Alex Jones Channel[16] Lucas Nolan Breitbart News 6 Aug 2018  Master of the Universe Google's video platform YouTube has deleted the channel of InfoWars host Alex Jones shortly after Facebook and Apple removed InfoWars content from their platforms. YouTube has reportedly deleted InfoWars host Alex Jones channel from their platform. This comes shortly after Facebook removed[17] multiple InfoWarspages from their website and Apple removed the majority of InfoWars podcasts from their podcast directory. InfoWarsEditor Paul Joseph Watson tweeted about the permanent deletion of Alex Jones' YouTube channel, calling the move a 'coordinated purge' on the part of Silicon Valley tech companies. The Alex Jones Channel has been permanently DELETED by YouTube. This is a coordinated PURGE. This is political censorship. pic.twitter.com/gyYiSSYFwI[18] \u2014 Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) August 6, 2018[19] Apple, Spotify, Facebook and now Google (which owns YouTube) - all within 12 hours of each other. A coordinated purge. This is a total abuse of power. \u2014 Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) August 6, 2018[20] Facebook explained their direction to remove InfoWars related pages saying More[21] InfoWars Ban: CNN, Democrats Successfully Lobby Big Tech to Censor Their Critics[22] Allum Bokhari Breitbart News 6 Aug 2018  Big tech's coordinated purge of InfoWars\u2014 which was hit by bans from Apple, Facebook, Spotify and YouTube in rapid succession\u2014 did not occur in a vacuum. On this issue, Silicon Valley bowed to CNN journalists and Democrat politicians who ceaselessly lobbied for the site to be censored. It's a sign of how the concentration of power in America has shifted from big government to big tech that politicians are now lobbying tech companies rather than the other way round, but that's exactly what happened over the course of the past few months, as Democratsapplied relentless pressure on Facebook and other Silicon Valley giants to censor InfoWars. Chief among them was Democratic Congressman Ted Deutch (D-FL), who demanded that a Facebook representative 'explain' their decision not to ban InfoWars at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on social media censorship last month. Calling Jones as 'well-known conspiracy theorist' whose 'brand is bullying,' Deutch also demanded Google's representative explain how many strikes it would take for a channel on Google-owned YouTube to be deleted. He then asked Google's representative if they thought conspiracy theories were a 'problem,' and asked her to explain the company's planned solutions. It seems that YouTube has now come up with a solution: ban the channels that Rep. Deutch objects to. At a previous hearing on social media censorship, Deutch, who represents Parkland, Florida, attacked[23] tech companies for allowing 'vile and outrageous and offensive garbage' on their platforms. Multiple other congressional Democrats[24], including Reps. Jerrold Nadler, Jim Hines, and Ted Lieu have attacked the very idea of big tech censorship, calling Republican concerns a 'conspiracy theory' and defending the right of tech giants to censor whomever they want. Far-left media also played a role in demanding tech giants appoint themselves as the arbiters of free speech. Here's[25]the Guardianattacking Facebook for continuing to host InfoWars, and here's[26] BuzzFeed's Joe Bernstein wondering why Twitter hasn't followed Facebook, YouTube, Spotify and Apple in today's purge More[27] Hollywood Celebrates Masters of the Universe Banning Alex Jones: 'It's About Damn Time'[28] The fools They don't even realize that by endorsing this kind of censorship they are putting their own necks on the media chopping block It's just a matter of time Dave Jerome Hudson Breitbart News 6 Aug 2018  A handful of Hollywood personalities took to Twitter on Monday to celebrate tech giants Apple, Facebook, and YouTube's decision to purge radio host Alex Jones and his Infowars properties from their platforms. 'Good news: YouTube, Facebook, Apple and Spotify are all banning Alex Jones and Infowars. Bad news: He'll either get a job offer from Fox News or Donald Trump,' Actress and Former Netflix talk show host Chelsea Handler wrote 'YESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!! Thank you @Apple!' Will ...ace star Debra Messing tweeted More[29] West Hollywood passes resolution to remove President Trump's Hollywood Walk of Fame star[30] This is just vicious Unhinged President Trump is being dishonored for what?  Winning the election? Speaking uncomfortable truths? Dave Julius Young Fox News August 7, 2018 LOS ANGELES - The West Hollywood City Council passed a resolution Monday night to have President Trump's star removed from the Hollywood Walk of Fame, according to a tweet by the city's mayor. 'West Hollywood City council unanimously passes resolution asking the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to remove the Donald Trump star on Hollywood Walk of Fame,' announced Mayor John Duran on Twitter.  Trump was awarded his star on the prestigious stretch of Hollywood Blvd in Los Angeles, Calif. in 2007 during the height of his 'Apprentice' fame, and it has been defaced and vandalized numerous times since he has been in office More[31] The Attack on Alex Jones Is An Attack on Free Speech[32] Joel B. Pollack Breitbart News 6 Aug 2018  Internet provocateur and InfoWars proprietor Alex Jones is being systematically excluded from social media platforms. This is, plainly, an attack on free speech. Over the weekend, Facebook removed[33] several Alex Jones-related pages, and Apple deleted many of his podcasts. On Monday, YouTube followed suit by deleting[34] his video channel. Pinterest closed[35] its InfoWars page. Twitter may soon do the same[36]. The timing is no coincidence: all of these outlets are responding to a campaign by left-wing activists who are determined to shut down conservative voices \u2014 including Breitbart. It is ashameful[37]effort \u2014 which is why some of those responsible for the boycotts have tried to maintain their anonymity. Today, they are circulating 'copy/paste[38]' talking points that argue they are not abusing freedom of speech or the press by pushing companies to ban Jones, because 'free speech protects you from your government.' Jones is being censored by private companies, not the government. He has no right, after all, to force anyone to carry his content. It is true thattheFirst Amendment is not implicated by private censorship, butfree speech certainly is damaged by it. From the point of view of the person being silenced, it makes absolutely no difference whether the censor is a policeman or a mob. And freedom of speech is a social value, a characteristic of an open and democratic society that has exists quite independently of the government. It is \u2014 or ought to be \u2014 sustained by civil society, even and especially when the views expressed are objectionable. We have the right to express contrary views \u2014 or to ignore those who seek to offend.

In aninterview[41] with Bloomberg Business, the former Goldman Sachs executive and former Trump administration official said the influence of large U.S. financial institutions pales in comparison to technology behemoths such as Facebook.

This is pure propaganda, presented without critical cross-examination on MSNBC News Dave Pam Key Breitbart News 6 Aug 2018  Monday on MSNBC's 'The Beat,' comedianRosie O'Donnell said most of the people at rallies that President Donald Trump headlines were 'paid to be there.' O'Donnell said, 'This man is like a joke and mainstream media treated him as a legitimate candidate as if they were two equals, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. It was a falsehood from the start. I think the best thing we can do is encourage people to vote. Come November. We will save democracy or lose it. That is the whole thing. If we save democracy and turn the House, he's gone. It will take however long it takes to have the impeachment trial, but we will start the healing in America and not being on different sides and understand what this man did was unfair and inhumane and even to the people who trusted him the most. That's what's heartbreaking.' She added, 'You see these people at these rallies, most paid to be there, screaming he's right and letting the racist deep dark corners of their soul flourish. It's so against everything American. It really is. I hope we can flip this and save democracy. If we can't, I have to believe fascism will take over in America.

A Response To Online Shadow Banning[51] 'Common carriage' law points to a solution for the problem of censorship on social media. Adam Candeub The Wall Street Journal Aug. 5, 2018  Have you been shadow banned? That's the term for Twitter's limiting the reach of disfavored accounts. The company can, for instance, remove your name from its autopopulated drop-down search box, making it harder to find you.  Twitter is alleged to have shadow-banned Republican National Committee Chairman Ronna McDaniel, Donald Trump Jr. spokesman Andrew Surabian, and GOP Reps. Mark Meadows (N.C.), Jim Jordan (Ohio), Devin Nunes (Calif.) and Matt Gaetz (Fla.). President Trump took to Twitter on July 26 to denounce shadow banning, vowing to 'look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once!' Mr. Trump is on solid ground, supported by centuries of common-law precedent. To this day, mail service, telephones and airlines operated under 'common carriage' law and must serve all customers regardless of their political, religious or social views. The se protections have a long history. Precedents from the 17th century outlawed discrimination by docks, ferries and bailors. Common-law courts extended the idea, as technology developed, to railroads and telegraphs, and then eventually to telephones and air travel. Administration agencies later codified the protections into regulation More[52] Exclusive\u2014Fred Campbell: 'We the People Should Decide Whether' Google, Facebook Can Censor[53] Sean Moran Breitbart News 6 Aug 2018  Former FCC Wireless Bureau Chief Fred Campbell told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Monday that 'We the people should decide' whether Google, Facebook, and Twitter can censor and block content. Silicon Valley giants Apple, Facebook, YouTube, and Spotify banned [54]Infowars from their platforms on Monday, which has raised concerns about the free state of the Internet. In an interview in April, the former Federal Communications Commission (FCC) wireless bureau chief told[55] Breitbart News that the Safe Harbor provision in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act allows social media giants to censor at will. Internet service providers (ISPs) and edge providers such as Facebook and Google can host or publish other users' content without being legally liable for their users' content. Campbell called for the Safe Harbor provision to be repealed, contending that it violates the First Amendment and overrides common law protections against libel and other falsehoods. The former FCC executive said on Monday: 'If they want the ability to edit the Internet and take down Alex Jones, then they should not have Section 230 immunity. If they're acting like a publisher, which is what they're doing, they're doing the same sort of editorial decision making that newspapers and other print publications have been doing since immemorial, if they want to do that why are they not subject to the same rules that the print media is subject to?' 'They're subject to a legislative exception that is a couple decades old, overturning a century of law. If they want to play editor, great, then comply with the laws that all of the others editors comply with and give up your special exemption,' he added. The former FCC executive continued, suggesting that could solve the issue of Silicon Valley censorship without regulation by using antitrust action. 'It's about holding the largest companies in the world to the same legal antitrust standards that have been applied since the 19thcentury,' he said.Campbell said More[56] Former 'Doctor Who' David Tennant Attacks Trump on 'Behalf of the Scottish Nation'[57]: Former Doctor Who star David Tennant has claimed to speak on 'behalf of the Scottish nation' by declaring that the entire nation hates President Donald Trump. America's Better Than This[58] Terry Paulson TownHall Aug 06, 2018  When I first heard reports and saw Facebook posts calling for violence, it seemed a sensational fringe suffering from Trump derangement syndrome, but recent polls are showing that more and more leftists are seeing 'civil war' as the only answer to save America. Trump is delivering on his promises to reverse President Obama's leftist 'transformation,' and the left hates him for it. Trump's recent appointment of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and his threat to close down government if he doesn't get funding for his border wall has just further stirred up the left's hornet's nest! Demonstrations no longer seem to be enough. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her pro-Trump colleagues were thrown out by the owner of the Red Hen Restaurant in Virginia mid-meal. Florida's Attorney General Pam Bondi was followed and harassed by a leftist mob as she and her husband left a movie theater after watching the Mister Rogers documentary stressing goodness and love for one's neighbor. Antifa continues to call for violence against the right. Outspoken Rep. Maxine Waters, chieftain of the Trump impeachment brigade, called for attacks on the Trump administration: 'If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.' A recentRasmussen Reportsnational telephone and online survey found that many voters fear that political violence is coming from opponents of the president. Nearly one-in-three think a civil war is next. Thirty-one percent (31%) of likely U.S. voters say it's likely that the United States will experience a second civil war sometime in the next five years, with 11% saying it's 'Very Likely.' Sure, 59% consider a second civil war unlikely, but it doesn't take many to create strategic attacks. More realistically, 59% of all voters are concerned that those opposed to President Trump's policies will resort to violence, with 33% being 'Very Concerned.  Thomas W. Chittum warns in 'Civil War II:' 'To understand the future, study the past. Throughout world history, all multi-ethnic empires have broken up, and almost always in cataclysmic violence. Therefore, the question is not if the multi-ethnic American Empire will shatter, but when and under what circumstances.' More[59] NeverTrump's insane foreign policy[60] Carolyn Glick 08/05/2018 George Orwell oncequipped[61], referring to a conspiracy theory that American soldiers had been brought to England in World War II to put down a working-class rebellion rather than to fight Nazi Germany:'One has to belong to the intelligentsia to believe things like that: no ordinary man could be such a fool.' His insight is certainly valid in connection to the 'NeverTrump' intellectuals today. Case in point is a recentarticle[62]published by Never Trump super-intellectual, the Brookings Institute's Robert Kagan. Earlier in the summer, Kagan wrote an oped in theWashington Postwhere he laid out his best case against President Donald Trump's foreign policy. Not to put too sharp a point on things: It was unhinged. Titled'Trump's America does not care[63],' Kagan made a contention that was wrong and then made two additional assertions which were also wrong \u2014 and which, even worse, contradicted one another. Kagan's basic contention was that Trump has transformed the United States from a moral actor and a great power into an immoral actor and a 'rogue power.' Trump did this, apparently, by committing the unpardonable offense of basing his foreign policy on U.S. interests. It used to be that outside the confines of a marginal groups of Communists and their fellow travelers, no one in Washington would ever argue that it is immoral for the United States to use its foreign policy to advance its national interests. But at a time when Trump Derangement Syndrome spreads like the plague through intellectual circles, Kagan wrote that under Trump, the 'United States [behaves like a] rogue superpower, neither isolationist nor internationalist, neither withdrawing nor in decline, but active, powerful and entirely out for itself.' And what has happened as a result of Trump acting entirely on behalf of his nation? How has Trump's America First foreign policy transformed America into a rogue superpower? For the answer, we come to Kagan's two further assertions. First, Kagan said that it is immoral for the U.S. to use foreign policy to advance its national interests as Trump is doing. Second, Kagan wrote that the U.S. is only allowed to advance its national interests by adhering to the post-World War II alliance system the U.S. constructed 70 years ago (because it advanced the U.S's primary national interest at the time of defeating the Soviet Union in the Cold War). Before considering the veracity of these assertions, it is important to mention that they cannot both be true. Obviously, if it is immoral for the U.S. to use its foreign policy as a means to advance its national interest, then it is immoral for the U.S. to advance its interests through the Cold War alliance system. As it works out, neither of Kagan's assumptions is true More[64] Progressive Insurance advertising supports Huffington Post's vitriolic articles that promote dangerous Islamist propaganda and inflame repulsive attitudes towards Christians, Jews and American troops and white people[65] Florida Family Association Click here to send your email to encourage Progressive Insurance officials to stop supporting Huffingtonpost.com who publishes vitriolic articles that promote dangerous Islamist propaganda and inflame repulsive attitudes towards Christians, Jews and American troops.[66] Post message at:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/progressive\">https://www.facebook.com/progressive</url>/[67] Huffington Post is feeding its 'hate America' audience with vitriolic articles that promote dangerous Islamist propaganda and inflame repulsive attitudes towards Christians, Jews, American troops white people. Huffingtonpost.com published a column on its home page titled[68]: White Evangelicals Are The Most Fragile Of All White People. The column is a sordid collection of unsubstantiated attacks on the character of 'white evangelicals' and Christians. The author of this hideous racist, column wrote the following and many more insults without any supporting facts: \u2022 White Evangelical Christians are particularly fragile, with whiteness being normalized and pandered to in society and theologized in the church. \u2022 Christians are taught that what they perceive of what is inside of them is the most important factor in any scenario \u2015 race not excluded. \u2022 White supremacy ensures that white feelings will always trump the lived experiences of people of color.  \u2022 When situations arise where race and privilege are questioned and criticized, often times white people free fall into fear, anger, silence, denial or guilt. Huffington Post has published many articles that defend Islamist doctrine. The harshest tenets of Islamist doctrine, aka Sharia law, are antithetical to the rights afforded under the United States Constitution and pose threats to public safety. Huffington Post articles have defended the Muslim Brotherhood, fundraised for the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), blamed Christian Islamophobia for worldwide conflict with Muslims, promoted an anti-Semitic blog, encouraged Islamist demagoguery, and promoted other Islamist propaganda.

The new sanctions limit dealings in Iran's currency and with its automotive industry. They also threaten U.S. penalties for banks that finance the precious-metals trade with Iran and against anyone who sells precious metals to the Iranian government.

Trump has said similar things about the June 2016 meeting. On July 27, Trump said on Twitter that 'I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr,' in response to reports that his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, was ready to tell authorities that Trump had known. 'Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam,' Trump said of Cohen. CNN reported that Cohen was prepared to tell federal investigators that the president knew ahead of time about the meeting, at which a Russian lawyer with links to the Kremlin was expected to deliver damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Such testimony by Cohen, a longtime fixer for Trump, would contradict the testimony and public denials of the president, his son, and other campaign officials who've repeatedly said the president wasn't aware of the meeting until more than a year later. The Trump Tower meeting was attended by the president's son as well as Paul Manafort, then chairman of Trump's presidential campaign; Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and several Russians, including the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, and their representatives. Appearing on ABC's 'This Week' on Sunday less than an hour after the president tweeted, Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said nobody had identified any law potentially violated by Trump's son in participating in the meeting. 'The question is, how would it be illegal?' he said. ABC correspondent George Stephanopoulos noted that conspiracy to defraud the U.S. has been suggested as a possible charge. Sekulow, who's not representing Trump Jr., also said he had no knowledge of the president's son being told he's a target of the special counsel's investigation, or whether he's been interviewed by the special counsel More[76] Was there anything illegal about the Trump Tower meeting?[77] Critics attack the president for admitting that the 2016 meeting with Russians was meant to get dirt on Hillary Clinton.

In one case highlighted by the Washington Post, an illegal alien single mother from Eritrea with two U.S.-born anchor babies decided to flee Las Vegas and head to Canada after she was denied asylum.

Dave Non-American citizens are increasingly found on voter rolls thanks to covert registration methods, with nothing actually stopping them from casting a ballot in an election. Elizaveta Shuvalova, a Russian citizen who became a U.S. citizen only last year, was registered as an eligible voter in 2012 and added to the San Francisco voter rolls, the Washington Times[86] reported. She was perplexed to find herself in the voter rolls, saying she wasn't an American citizen and didn't even register to vote. 'I've never registered for anything in my entire life,' Shuvalova told the paper. 'This is news to me.'  The woman's voter log shows that she signed up as a Democrat in July 2012. In 2016, her registration was canceled after she informed election authorities that she wasn't eligible to vote because she wasn't yet a U.S. citizen. 'This is definitely a shocker to me. It is like an identity fraud because this is not coming from my end,' the woman, who identifies as a Democrat, said. 'Like I told you, I haven't even been a citizen during that time frame. So what can we do about it?'  But the case of Shuvalova is part of a larger concern some groups have when it comes integrity of elections. They claim that stories like hers are a common occurrence in many parts of the country. The Public Interest Legal Foundation, a nonprofit specializing in election integrity, found[87] that non-Americans are being added to voter rolls in states such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Virginia. The group says that a large portion of the non-citizens even managed to cast their ballots in elections as well. For instance, in 2017, the group found[88] that nearly 5,600 people on the voter rolls in Virginia were deemed as non-citizens, with a third of them voting in previous elections.

U.S. District Judge Lawrence J. O'Neill issued the sentence Monday, which came after Everitt Aaron Jameson of Modesto, California, admitted under a plea deal in June that he tried to aid a terrorist organization. Jameson could have received 40 years in prison. The 27-year-old planned the attack during talks with undercover FBI agents, including one he thought was with the Islamic State terror group.

Along with glass scattered[2] in front of its entrance, at least four bullet holes were discovered inside the office. Law enforcement is investigating the scene, where the office is part of a strip mall close by the Reed Canal Park.South Daytona police Capt. Mark Cheatham says no one was injured during the vandalism. </p><p>Cheatham believes the shooting likely occurredbetween 4 p.m. EST Sunday and early Monday morning.'At this point we can confirm that at least four rounds were fired into the building,' the police captain told[3] reporters. 'We are working to see if we can get video from nearby businesses but so far we have no witnesses.' 'We have never had any kind of vandalism before at a Republican Headquarters,' Volusia County Republican Party chairmanTony Ledbetter told[4] theDaytona Beach News-Journal. 'It's a small strip center and no other business was vandalized, so it was obviously politically motivated.' Reacting to the incident, Florida State Rep. Tom Leek issued[5] the following statement:'The state of our political discourse in America is an embarrassment to all parties and those involved in the political process. Neither Democrats nor Republicans own the high ground on this issue. Sooner or later, both parties are going to have to stop suffering idiots within their own party, and cast them out on their own.' Earlier this month,Antifa activists targeted[6] theMetropolitan Republican Club in Manhattan in a politically motivated attack. The far-left vandalsspray-painted ananarchist symbol on the club's doors and smashed its windows.'Our attack is merely a beginning. We are not passive, we are not civil, and we will not apologize,' a letter left by Antifa read. 'Those of good conscience and clear mind know this state of oppression cannot remain.'  The vandalstargeted the building in an attempt to protest a scheduled talk by conservative pundit Gavin McInnes More[7] Tree of Life Rabbi to CNN: Trump 'Always Welcome' at Our Synagogue, 'He Is My President'[8] Trent Baker Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018  Rabbi Jeffrey Myers on Monday refused to blame anyone for the shooting that took 11 worshipers at theTree of Life Synagogue over the weekend. CNN 'New Day' host Alisyn Camerota asked the Tree of Life rabbi if he blamed anyone 'beyond the gunman' for the attack. Myers instead blamed hate. 'I don't really foist blame upon any person,' Myers told Camerota. 'Hate does not know religion, race, creed, political party. It's not a political issue in any way, shape, or form. Hate does not know any of those things.' Camerota then questioned, 'What lights the match of hate?' Myers replied, 'I think you're raising one of those great questions that people far smarter than I can answer.' Later in the interview, Camerota pressed the rabbi and asked if he wanted President Donald Trump to come. 'The president of the United States is always welcome,' said Myers. 'I'm a citizen, he is my president. He is certainly welcome.'

MSNBC's Heilemann: Trump 'Is Obviously a Racist'   He 'Obviously Condones Anti-Semitism'[12] Pam Key Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 Monday on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe,' network political analyst John Heilemann declared President Donald Trump was 'obviously a racist.' During the discussion of the mail bombs sent to political figures and CNN's offices, hostJoe Scarborough said, 'I can't even call him president, this demagogue, this nationalist, he refused to even try to temper his crowds. Refused to even call the former presidents and secretaries of states and CIA directors to offer condolences and assurances that he was going to do his job as president to protect all Americans.' Heilemann said, 'What he said was  and they are, I believe, the two most kinds of landmark signal repulsive words of last week, which were 'I'll pass.' When the president was asked on Friday after the bomber had been, or the alleged bomber had been arrested, when asked whether he was planning to call Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and the other people who had bombs sent to them, the president stood on White House grounds and said 'I'll pass.' That's what he said about that. That sends a signal that is as profound as anything that the president could say.' He continued, 'The president is obviously a racist, he's obviously a demagogue. He obviously condones anti-Semitism, stokes up nationalist hatred.' He added, 'You asked what's happened at Fox News? What's happened is the same thing that's happened to the Republican Party. What's happened to it is they were both corrupt, bankrupt institutions that were hollowed out and waiting to be taken over by Donald Trump. They have now been taken over by Donald Trump, and they are in a much worse, much uglier place than they were five years ago, ten years ago.' The video[13] Democrat Menendez Supporter Hurls Racial Slurs at African-American, Latino Republicans[14] Oh, the hypocrisy Dave Kyle Morris Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 A supporter of Democrat Bob Menendez (D-NJ) was caught on camera spewing racist insults at African-American and Latino Republicans at a New Jersey Senate debate last Wednesday in Newark, NJ. The video, captured by the Republican National Committee, shows an African-American man holding a Menendez campaign sign telling a Latino Republican,'You're going to be deported. You're going to be sent back to your hometown. Believe that.' 'You are a coon, man. You have to go,' said the Menedez supporter to the African-American Republican. 'You gotta go. You have to go.' Amidst the racial slurs, the African-American Republican asks the Menendez supporter to 'name one stance' of Menendez's that he supports. The Menendez supporter does not respond and continues to hurl insults at the Republican. Near the end of the video, the Menendez supporter can be heard saying, 'I'm gonna stand here, but you gotta go.' The video[15] Democrat Running in Mollie Tibbetts District Voted to Keep Sanctuary Cities[16] John Binder Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 DemocratAbby Finkenauer, running against Rep.

While Blum has opposed sanctuary cities, illegal immigration, and supports President Trump's proposed border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border,Finkenauer joined[17] her Democrat colleagues in Iowa's state House by voting to keep sanctuary jurisdictions in the state that gave protection to criminal illegal aliens.

Fitton: 'Elaborately Planned' Caravan Attracts Human Traffickers and Gangbangers[22] This report raises an interesting point that few in the U.S. have consideredThis orchestrated 'caravan' is also a destabilizing force in the countriesthe 'migrants' originate from  It basically labels these countries as uninhabitable, which is not true Dave Tom Fitton Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 Washington, DC - The caravan moving north toward our border is a serious threat to the sovereignty of the United States. It is a blatant challenge to the rule of law. For this reason, we sent our Director of Investigations and Research Chris Farrell and Judicial Watch Investigator Reporter Irene Garcia to Guatemala to uncover the truth about 'caravan.' Here is theirfirst report[23]in our Corruption Chronicles blog: The migrant caravan marching northbound through Central America is an 'elaborately planned' movement that's benefiting human smugglers and bringing disturbing numbers of violent gang members and other criminal elements through Guatemala, according to government sources in the capital city. 'MS-13 gang members have been detained and coyotes (human smugglers) are joining the march with clients who pay to get smuggled into the United States,' a Guatemalan official told Judicial Watch. People from Asian countries waiting to get smuggled into the U.S. through Central America are also integrating with poor Hondurans in the caravan, a high-level Guatemalan government source confirmed. Among them are nationals of Bangladesh, a south Asian Islamic country that's well known as a recruiting ground for terrorist groups such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda Indian Subcontinent (AQIS). 'There are lots of dirty businesses associated with this,' Guatemalan authorities told Judicial Watch. 'There's lots of human trafficking.' Between Honduras and Mexico, Guatemala has been overrun with the onslaught of migrants that began their journey last week in the northern Honduran city of San Pedro Sula. At last count around 7,000 have participated in the trek, a great deal of themrowdy, angry men ages 17 to 40[24].[25]President Jimmy Morales has ordered the military and police to detain all of the migrants and facilitate their safe return back to Honduras, though thousands have already reached the Mexican border. In a morning interview with Judicial Watch at the Guatemalan Ministry of Defense, Secretary of Defense General Luis Miguel Ralda Moreno said more than 2,000 Hondurans have been sent back home on buses. 'We're doing everything possible to stop the caravan while still respecting human rights,' General Moreno said. During an afternoon interview at the National Palace, President Morales said that Guatemala has absorbed the huge cost of mobilizing police and military to return thousands of people to Honduras. He would like the United States to help him find the organizers of the caravan so they can face legal consequences. 'Mass immigration like this endangers lives,' Morales said. 'This is unprecedented. We are in the process of investigating who is behind the caravan.' Morales assures that Guatemala is doing everything possible to curb illegal immigration and asked for cooperation from the United States. It has been a delicate and complicated task, Guatemalan officials say, because the caravan is a very organized movement that has been well orchestrated. There are rest points along the route with food, water and shelter for the migrants as well as medical care in some areas. 'It's very strategic and extremely organized,' a Guatemalan government source told Judicial Watch. 'It is very complex, not a simple march. There is nothing spontaneous about it.' During a visit to the Guatemalan-Honduran border this week Judicial Watch interviewed multiple migrants who repeated the same rehearsed line when asked who organized the caravan, insisting it was a spontaneous event even though there were clearly organizers shouting instructions in Spanish and putting select persons in front of cameras for interviews. All of them said the caravan was not about politics but rather poverty. Guatemalan officials disagree, estimating that the caravan is a movement of radicalized forces to destabilize Central American countries. Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernndez, a conservative, echoes that assessment. In a localnewspaper report[26]published last week Hernndez asserted that leftist interests seeking to destabilize the country are manipulating migrants.Women and children are being used without regard to the risks to their lives, Hernndez said. 'The irregular mobilization was organized for political reasons to negatively affect the governance and image of Honduras and to destabilize the peace of neighboring countries,' the president said, adding that many have returned to the country after realizing they've been fooled More[27]  Donald Trump Warns Caravan Migrants: 'Our Military Is Waiting for You'[28] Charlie Spiering Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 President Donald Trump issued another warning on Monday to migrants in the caravan traveling through Mexico, telling them they would not be allowed into the United States. 'This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!' Trump warned on Twitter. Trump commented after the Pentagon revealed[29]that up to 5,000 active duty troops would be deployed to the Southern border to stop the caravan, now estimated to include 7,000 people from various South American countries. 'Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border,' Trump wrote. He urged the migrants in the caravan to return to their home countries and apply for legal entry into the United States. 'Please go back, you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process,' he wrote More[30] Trump to Expand Military Border Deployment from 800 to 5,000[31] Bob Price Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 Reports on Monday indicate that President Donald Trump will order an expansion of the U.S. military deployment to the U.S. southwest border. The order is expected to increase the number of troops being deployed from 800 to 5,000. TheWall Street Journal reported[32] on Monday morning that the U.S. military plans to deploy 5,000 troops to the southwest border region in response to the caravan of 'would-be asylum seekers.' The plans reportedly call for 1,800 troops to deploy to Texas, 1,700 to Arizona, and 1,500 to California Under 'Operation FaithfulPatriot,' troops are expected to be assigned to ports of entry in the early phase. They are expected to support Border Patrol agents and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers in dealing with the anticipated migrant caravan arrivals. The troops are expected to come from about ten U.S. Army installations. The composition of the forces is expected to include military police, engineers, and medical personnel. CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said his agency is updating 'longstanding plans to deal with a mass migration situation.' Those plans include temporary holding and processing facilities, he said. McAleenan plans to ensure the CBP can 'secure the ports and prevent a large group from coming at one time.' Over the weekend, Mexican authorities offered to provide asylum, jobs, and education and health benefits to the migrants in the Central American caravan headed north from Guatemala, Breitbart News' Ildefonso Ortiz and Brandon Darby reported[33]. The migrants soundly rejected the offer   instead, they stated their intention to migrate to the U.S. Thank you but no was the response from a group of migrants in Arriaga, Mexico. 'No, we're heading north.' On Sunday, Ortiz reported[34] that another caravan of migrants violently stormed the Guatemalan northern border in an attempt to force their way into Mexico. Video reports from the border showed the migrants throwing rocks and other projectiles at Guatemalan border authorities. The group eventually broke through the Guatemalan border gate but appeared to be blocked from entering the Mexican port of entry More[35] Pentagon Deploying Over 5,200 Troops to Southwestern Border to Stop Migrant Caravans[36] Kristina Wong Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 The Pentagon is deploying more than 5,200 active duty troops to the southwestern U.S. border to stop caravans of migrants from crossing over illegally, U.S. officials announced Monday at a press conference. 'By the end of this week will we deploy over 5,200 soldiers to the southwest border. That is just the start of this operation. We'll continue to adjust the numbers and inform you of those,' Air Force Gen.Terrence O'Shaughnessy, commander of U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, said. The 5,200 troops would add to the 2,092 National Guard members already deployed to the border earlier this year. Officials confirmed that the troops who would normally carry weapons will bring their weapons with them to the border. Officials say there are at least two migrant caravans headed to the U.S. border. 'As of this afternoon, we continue to track a large group of approximately 3,500 traveling through southern Mexico with the stated intent to reach the U.S. border,' saidKevin McAleenan, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner. He said the group was near the Chiapas-Oaxaca border in southern Mexico. 'We are also aware of a second large group[37] of migrants at the CiudadHidalgo border crossing between Guatemala and Mexico. Size estimate for the second group is around 3,000,' he said. 'They're incentivized to try to cross our border by the gaps in our legal framework, and the expectation that they will be allowed to stay. This means, at any given moment, there are tens of thousands of intending migrants between the Guatemala border and the U.S. border moving towards us.' McAleenan said within that flow were about 17,000 criminals last year, along with 'hardened smugglers' and people from over 100 different countries from around the world. But he said the caravan phenomenon 'new and challenging.' More[38] Trump: We Will Hold Asylum Seekers in Tent Cities Until Their Trial[39] Ian Hanchett Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018  During an interview broadcast on Monday's edition of the Fox News Channel's 'Ingraham Angle,' President Trump stated that asylum applicants will be held in tent cities until their hearing takes place, and people with rejected asylum applications will 'get out.'  Trump stated, 'If they apply for asylum, we're going to hold them until such time as their trial takes place We're going to put up   we're going to build tent cities. We're going to have tents. They're going to be very nice, and they're going to wait, and if they don't get asylum, they get out.'

As Breitbart News has chronicled, migrants with an at least 7,000-strong caravan have repeatedly admitted that they are traveling to the U.S. toseek jobs[43], re-enter the U.S. as previouslydeported[44]illegal aliens, andflee crime[45]. One previously deported illegal alien with the caravan even admitted that he was convicted[46] of attempted murder in the U.S. None of these cases are eligible asylum claims. The UN Refugee Agency, though, is commanding Trump to accept the caravan of refugees, which some estimates now put at 10,000-strong. In an interview[47] with Voice of America, a spokesman for the UN Refugee Agency said: 'Our position globally is that the individuals who are fleeing persecution and violence need to be given access to territory and protection including refugee status and determination procedure. And, if the people who are fleeing persecution and violence enter Mexico, they need to be provided access to the Mexican asylum system and those entering the United States need to be provided access to the American asylum system.' [Emphasis added] As Breitbart News[48] reported, the UN Refugee Agency is aiding the caravan of migrants, putting 45 UN workers on the ground with the group of Central Americans. President Trump is expected to sign an executive order this week that will halt the caravan entering the U.S. on the legal grounds of national security. Currently, the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million legal and illegal immigrants every year, with more than 70 percent coming to the country through theprocess[49]known as 'chain migration,' whereby newly naturalized citizens are allowed to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country. Since 2000,more than 1.5 million[50]foreign refugees have been resettled across the U.S.   outpacing the population of Philadelphia. Also, there have been more than4.1 million[51]legal immigrants admitted to the U.S. from refugee-producing countries since 2000 More[52] Trump Plans Executive Order to End Birthright Citizenship in US[53]: The move will likely provoke legal challenges, and it escalates the president's tough stance on immigration ahead of the midterm elections Khashoggi's Killing Should Be a Nuclear Red Flag[54]: The Saudis can't be trusted to enrich uranium and reprocess spent fuel. Jamie Fly and Henry Sokolski The Wall Street Journal Oct. 28, 2018  If the Saudi government's prevarications about Jamal Khashoggi's murder teach us anything, it should be that there are limits to how far the U.S. can trust Riyadh. In particular, America shouldn't trust Saudi Arabia with nuclear technology. The Obama administration's nuclear agreement with Iran allowed Tehran to possess and develop nuclear power and uranium-enrichment technology and expertise. President Trump rightly scrapped the Iran nuclear deal. But last fall, in its desire to improve relations with Riyadh, the administration began negotiating a deal with Saudi Arabia that would grant it similar nuclear privileges.  Some have argued that the administration should exploit the U.S. friendship with the kingdom to challenge Iran the way President Reagan challenged the Soviet Union. Yet the brutal murder of Khashoggi and the government's ever-changing explanations are a reminder that in the Middle East of 2018, America lacks the strong network of democratic allies united in common purpose that helped bring down the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union. Washington needs to temper its confidence in certain regional partners that share U.S. concerns about Iran. Like Cold War allies, America's Arab friends are on the front lines. But because of their political systems, their primary goal is maintaining an authoritarian grip on their populations. Their interests and America's will thus, at times, diverge. Their actions, such as the killing of Khashoggi, can also significantly undermine the strategic and moral case the U.S. makes against Iranian aggression. Consider, too, the risk of regime change if there is nuclear power in Saudi Arabia. Nuclear reactors operate for 40 years or more and are far more dangerous than any conventional arms sales. In the 1970s, the U.S. considered selling the shah of Iran 23 reactors. That would have been a colossal mistake. Saudi officials, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, have publicly threatened to violate the Kingdom's Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty commitment not to acquire nuclear weapons if they believe Iran is acquiring them. The U.S. has never negotiated a nuclear cooperation agreement with a country threatening to get nuclear weapons More[55] NBC's Kate Snow Says Info Clearing Kavanaugh Wasn't 'Newsworthy' Before Confirmation[56] John Nolte Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 NBC's Kate Snow offers only falsehoods and double talk to explain why she and her employer hid crucial facts that would have cleared then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of gang rape allegations. On Friday, Breitbart News reported[57] that, although NBC had the information a full week prior to his October 6 confirmation, NBC covered up news that would have cleared Kavanaugh when it mattered most   during those intense final days of the confirmation process. During that week, here is the information NBC News hid from the public and those senators deciding on whether or not to confirm Kavanaugh: On September 30, the woman who signed a sworn statement corroborating Julie Swetnick's gang rape allegations against Kavanaugh (the statement was publicly released by attorney Michael Avenatti on October 2), not only told NBC she had never witnessed Kavanaugh spike punch or rape anyone, she also became something of a character witness for Kavanaugh when she told NBC she had never once seen him behave inappropriately. This second witness then told NBC on October 3 (three days prior to Kavanaugh's confirmation) that Aven-atti had fabricated her sworn statement. During this crucial time, Avenatti was playing games with NBC to conceal all of this   what NBC itself describes as 'an apparent effort to thwart the reporting process[.]' Nothing was stopping NBC from reporting the above facts as they came in. There was no valid reason for NBC to withhold this relevant and crucial information, either from the public or from those senators still deciding Kavanaugh's fate. What's more, had NBC released this story as it broke, NBC would have owned a major scoop, a story of national consequence. Instead, NBC chose not to reveal the truth until October 26, more than three weeks after it mattered. The only plausible explanation for this is partisanship. NBC did not want Kavanaugh confirmed, so the truth was withheld and the public misled, even as   and this is important   NBC chose to spread a number of uncorroborated smears and hoaxes against Kavanaugh (which I will detail below).

Julia Ioffe Apologizes After Saying Trump Radicalized More People than ISIS[61] Justin Caruso Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 GQ writer Julia Ioffe quickly apologized Monday after claiming that President Trump had radicalized more people than ISIS on CNN's The Lead with Jake Tapper.  'I think, you know, this president, one of the things that he really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic radicalization, and this president has radicalized so many more people than ISIS ever did,' Julia Ioffe said. 'That's justit's unconscionable for you to say that,' CNN's David Urban shot back. 'The way he talks-the way that he allows thesethe way he winks and nods to these groups. The way he says, 'I know I'm not supposed to say it, but I'm a nationalist.' The way that he hems and haws, when he has to condemn these people, and kind of, gritting his teeth, kind of, says, fine, okay, 'I condemn this.'' 'For you not to push back on that, is irresponsible,' Urban said to Jake Tapper. 'That'sirresponsible. For her to say that the President of the United States has radicalized more people than ISIS is irresponsible.' Urban continued to push Ioffe on what she based her claim on. She responded, 'ISIS had, like 10,000 members. I think the president has far more supporters who espouse an equally hateful ideology.' Tapper, as panelist David Urban pointed out on air, did not push back on Ioffe's assertion whatsoever More[62] Watch: Sarah Sanders Battles CNN's Acosta-CNN Responds in Tweet Attacking Sanders[63] Justin Caruso Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 White House press secretary Sarah Sanders battled CNN's Jim Acosta during the press briefing Monday over President Trump's tweets about the 'fake news media' being 'the enemy of the people,' leading to CNN's PR team coming after Sanders on Twitter. Acosta asked Sanders if Trump'sclaim[64] that the 'fake news media' is the 'enemy of the people' would include CNN. 'There is great anger in our Country caused in part by inaccurate, and even fraudulent, reporting of the news. The Fake News Media, the true Enemy of the People, must stop the open obvious hostility report the news accurately fairly,' Trump tweeted Monday 'Would that include my outlet, which received bombs last week?' he asked. 'I don't think it's necessarily specific to a general, broad generalization of a full outlet. At times, I think there's individuals that the president would be referencing,' Sanders said. Acosta: 'So you're not going to state for the record, then-I mean, if the president is going to say the fake news media are the 'enemy of the people' and if you're going to stand there and continue to say that there are some journalists, some news outlets in this country that meet that characterization, shouldn't you have the guts, Sarah, to state, which outlets, which journalists are the enemy of the people?' 'I think it's, irresponsible of a news organization like yours to blame responsibility of a pipe bomb that was not sent by the president-not just blame the president, but blame members of his administration for those heinous acts. I think that is outrageous and I think it's irresponsible,' Sanders said CNN's communications department then hit back against Sanders' claims on their Twitter account. 'No @PressSec, CNN did not say @realDonaldTrump was directly responsible for the bomb sent to our office by his ardent and emboldened supporter. We did say that he, and you, should understand your words matter. Every single one of them. But so far, you don't seem to get that,' CNN PR tweeted Conservative Twitter users criticized CNN for the misleading statement, pointing out that the network's chryons and commentators pointedto Trump as inspiring the bomber. Laughably false. You guys have spent every day since last Wednesday offering rhetoric winks at your viewers whenever you use the word 'but' as a turn of phrase to then blame the President.

The campaign manager, Michelle Davidson, made clear that Kyrsten Sinema's approach is to avoid talking about her gun control positions until the election is over. Davidson said[81]: 'We can't be talking about an assault weapon ban. We can't, right? The conversation that she can lead is how do we get to a place where we can, background checks, right? Can we fix that system? We've got to fix the gun show loophole, we have to fix the background check system.

We were told to email her communications director, Nick Zeller, which we did numerous times to no avail. In the emails, we asked Zeller if Sinema still wants to require a license for all gun owners   On The Issuesreports[86]that she expressed support for 'gun licenses' in 2006   and we also asked if she supported an 'assault weapons' ban. Zeller did not respond. We also asked if she still wanted to expand background checks, as she was one of 194 Democrats whocosponsored[87]background check gun control in 2017. Zeller did not answer that question either. But Davidson, Sinema's campaign manager, unwittingly answered the question in a Project Veritas undercover video.

More[93] Left-Wing 'Deplatform Hate' Threatens Payment Processor Stripe over Terms of Service[94] Charlie Nash Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 Deplatform Hate, a far-left Twitter account, seemed to blackmail Big Tech payment processing service Stripe on Saturday, threatening the company unless it changed its terms of service to the account's liking, and posting messages with Stripe' General Counsel showing the two parties discussing the blacklisting of free speech social network Gab. Deplatform Hate claimed it would release all communications with the company unless it changed its terms of service to the account's liking  which would most likely be aimed at removing more conservatives from utilizing the payment processor's services. 'We're releasing all comms with @stripe, and [Stripe general counsel Jon Zieger] Tuesday unless they make a statement changing their terms of service,' warned[95] the account. 'They have several violent orgs they're supporting and blood will be on their hands again.' The account also released[96] several friendly messages with Stripe general counsel Jon Zieger, showing Zieger and Deplatform Hate talking about blacklisting Gab (which was recently banned[97] from the service), and revealing Zieger's interest in further talking to Deplatform Hate via a phone call. 'I'd be interested in learning more about your concerns and how you think we can do better,' declared Zieger in one message to Deplatform Hate. 'Would you have any time for a phone call in the next few days?' In another message, Deplatform Hate wrote to Zieger, 'Good call on gab You dropping them was a big precondition of chatting. If this was goodwill I can meet you halfway and chat. Goodwill on my side is that there's going to be two more big hits this October you should know about.' 'I'd be happy to chat and would certainly appreciate the heads up,' replied Zieger. 'Let me know what would be a good way to connect.' The exchange did not clarify what the two 'big hits' Deplatform Hate referred to are. Shortly after making the posts, Deplatform Hate set its account to private, however, despite the clear evidence of a threat, Twitter has yet to suspend the account More[98] As Israel Targets Iran in Syria, U.S. Officials Warn of Reprisals[99]: White House applauds strikes but military worries about retaliation against American forces Gordon Lubold and Felicia Schwartz The Wall Street Journal Oct. 28, 2018  WASHINGTON Israel has been conducting an aggressive military campaign across Syria against Iran-backed militia groups, an effort that has been encouraged by the White House but aroused the concern of many U.S. military officials. While the White House has applauded Israel's assertiveness against Iran inside Syria, the military officials say they fear it could backfire if Iran's belief that the U.S. is behind many of the strikes prompts Iran-backed groups to attack American troops in Syria or Iraq. 'It's a growing concern for us,' said a senior military official. Israel has struck about 200 targets in Syria[100] over the past 18 months, Israeli officials disclosed recently, both to block weapons shipments from Iran to Lebanese group Hezbollah and to prevent Iran from establishing a permanent military presence inside Syria. The targets included shipments of advanced weapons, military bases and infrastructure, the officials said. The Pentagon said Israel is working on its own. 'Israeli operations are independent,' said Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman, in response to questions about the issue. 'However, we support Israel's inherent right to self-defense against imminent threats.' Cmdr. Robertson said that if an action on the battlefield puts U.S. military personnel at risk, commanders 'would take appropriate measures,' and that 'U.S. forces are always prepared to defend themselves.'  The White House position has been that Israel has the right to defend itself and, further, that the U.S. welcomes Israel's attempt to thwart Iran's effort to create an 'arc of control' leading from Iran west through Iraq, Syria and, ultimately, Lebanon. 'Iran and Hezbollah cannot be allowed to build an arsenal of weapons on Israel's border that threatens the region,' a White House spokeswoman said in a statement At the Pentagon, however, U.S. military officials have expressed greater alarm. Their concern is that Iran believes the Israeli strikes stem from American intelligence fed to the Israelis specifically so they will launch the attacks. If convinced of U.S. involvement, Iran could orchestrate reprisal attacks against American forces, particularly in Iraq, these officials said, where there are more than 5,000 U.S. troops stationed in the fight against Islamic State More[101] Iranian Port Project Poses a Dilemma for US[102]: Chabahar facility is the type of project Washington aims to curb, but doing so would hinder efforts to bolster India and Afghanistan Bill Spindle and Rajesh Roy The Wall Street Journal Oct. 28, 2018  A port being developed in the southern Iranian city of Chabahar underscores some of the dilemmas U.S. policy makers face in implementing sanctions against Tehran. Strategically located on the Gulf of Oman and named for an Iranian revolutionary war hero, the Shahid Beheshti Port is exactly the sort of Iranian economic development the Trump administration wants to stop with sanctions that kick in on Nov. 5. Those measures aim to punish Iran for what the U.S. sees as unacceptable behavior in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere. They follow the Trump administration's decision this year to withdraw from an international deal struck with Iran in 2015 to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Once completed, the port a small part of which started initial operations in December could help Iran by strengthening economic ties with South and Central Asia, providing an export point for its oil beyond the Persian Gulf and functioning as a strategic military asset. But it could also be a critical economic lifeline for Afghanistan, where the U.S. has tried for 16 years to strengthen and stabilize the government so thousands of U.S. troops can come home. The port also could be a big boon to India, an increasingly close partner of the U.S. in Asia. India wants Chabahar port activities exempted from sanctions. Indian companies are mostly equipping and operating the facility. If the port is completed, they are expected to be among the biggest users of the port in order to participate in the reconstruction of Afghanistan something the Trump administration has asked India to get more involved in and establish a stronger economic presence in Central Asia. 'There's such a strong case to be made in terms of India's ability to create lines of communications and transport up to Afghanistan,' said Richard Rossow, a South Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 'But you just never know if it's going to pique interest in the White House one day and suddenly things change.' Sanctions law allows the president to grant exemptions for projects intended to help reconstruct Afghanistan, one way the port development could continue. The Trump administration hasn't decided whether to grant exemptions, but has said the intent of sanctions isn't to punish Afghanistan or India. High-level Iranian, Indian and Afghan officials also have been shuttling among their respective capitals in recent months to find ways to carry on the work even if no exemptions are granted. That may include making payments through a mechanism European countries are trying to devise to continue doing business with Iran despite U.S. sanctions. The Chabahar port has long been seen as a potential way around Pakistan, a sworn enemy of India that believes holding sway over Afghanistan is critical to its own security. Pakistan has squelched trade between India and Afghanistan across its territory. It wants Afghanistan to eventually transport goods through a competing Pakistani port on the Gulf of Oman that is being developed with China More[103] Expert: 'Significant Risk' Libya Will Become Second Islamic State 'Caliphate'[104] Libya is in bad, bad shape Isn't it interesting that Obama's Libyan intervention debaclenever gets attention in the mainstream media? Dave Edwin Mora Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 Libya, located a few hundred miles from the European coast, is facing a 'significant risk' of becoming the 'new' home of the Islamic State's 'caliphate,' a London-based expert from the Chatham House think-tank's Royal Institute of International Affairs cautioned in an editorial published by the Dallas Morning News on Sunday. Frank Kryza wrote[105]: 'Boots on the ground' is a phrase rarely used by the Trump Administration. And with good reason: 6,251 American soldiers have been killed since 2001; some 45,170 have been wounded. That is a heavy price. We are already too involved in combating ISIS in Syria and Iraq. But if we do nothing, Libya will cease to exist as a country. Imagine, if you can, an Islamic caliphate on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea not far from Italy. It is a grim vision. Kryza's warning came as suspected fighters from the Islamic State, or ISIS, killed four people and wounded seven in central Libya on Sunday, according[106] to Nigeria's Punch newspaper. Soon after U.S.-backed forces pushed ISIS out of its former stronghold in the coastal Libyan city of Sirte, once considered the group's largest bastion outside Iraq and Syria, American[107] and Libyan[108] officials warned about a potential resurgence[109] of the terrorist group, noting that the jihadists were regrouping elsewhere in Libya, namely the desert valleys and inland hills southeast of the country.  In April, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) cautioned that ISIS remains a 'potent[110]' menace in Libya. Kryza, who serves as Tunisia's honorary consul resident in Dallas, pointed out on Sunday that Libya's descent into chaos following the U.S.-backed overthrow and execution of dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 is providing a fertile ground for ISIS to flourish More[111] Claim: Germany's Angela Merkel To Step Down From Party Leadership After Humiliating Elections[112].
