The presenter of the proposal, a representative of Students for a Free Tibet, urged the company to take steps now rather than waiting for antitrust regulators to act. As the internet giant faces possible U.S. antitrust inquiries and calls to break it up, she said the company has grown to a complexity that is unmanageable.</p><p>Another proposal that failed urged the company to study and share an assessment of the human rights implications of Project Dragonfly, Googles reported plan to once again operate a search engine in China.</p><p>As weve said, we have no plans to open a search engine in China, said Kent Walker, senior vice president for global affairs and chief legal officer for Google, during the meetings Q&amp;A session.

A proposal for a clawback policy, in which an executive would be forced to pay the company back in case of misconduct, did not pass, either.</p><p>After the proposal to install a non-executive employee representative on the board of directors failed, a Google employee said during the Q&amp;A: Whats really stuck out to me recently is this shift when we're challenged, she said. I've seen executives feign powerlessness as if we're not a company the size of some countries. We're told we can't take dramatic action. When we respond this way it's disingenuous. We're choosing to use our power to solve the wrong problems, and we can do better.</p><p>Yolanda Chavez, who spoke at the meeting as a representative of Silicon Valley Rising, expressed concerns about Googles plan for a giant campus in San Jose.</p><p>Yesterday's announcement (a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/18/1-billion-google-plan-ease-bay-area-housing-crisis-tech/\">$1 billion pledge</url> by the company to help with Bay Area housing) was a positive sign that Google is listening to the community, she said through a translator. But Chavez noted that the 5,000 in affordable-housing units Pichai mentioned in a blog post as part of the plan are needed in San Jose alone, according to a study she cited. What's your plan to mitigate Google's impact on San Jose?</p><p>Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat answered that our announcement really underscores our commitment to Bay Area, and pointed to other initiatives by the company, including its philanthropic arm Google.org, which she said is working on housing, and in trying to teach digital skills.</p><p>One shareholder complained that Alphabet CEO Larry Page wasnt present. Page and Google co-founder Sergey Brin are seldom seen at public company events.</p><p>Maybe one year he's sick, the shareholder said. But year after year, there's no CEO here.</p><p>Because of the companys multi-class stock structure, Page and Brin together have 51 percent of voting shares, a reason shareholder resolutions fail year after year.</p><p>But theyre a way to keep putting pressure on Google, which needs it, said Don Heider, executive director of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University.</p><p>There are pockets of Google working on ethics, but not an overarching commitment that's taking place, Heider said.</p><p>Heider said big tech companies including Google have asked ethicists to talk to them in the past year as theyve increasingly come under fire, and one member of the center is working half-time with the company to try to help build ethics into the companys products and designs.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/28/google-grabs-more-sites-across-from-downtown-san-jose-train-hub/\">        Google grabs more sites across from downtown San Jose train hub     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/27/help-desk-how-to-fight-the-spies-in-chrome-browser/\">        How to fight the spies in Chrome browser     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/26/tech-mega-campus-gets-underway-downtown-san-jose-google-adobe/\">        Tech mega-campus getting underway in downtown San Jose     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/26/google-to-stay-in-sf-pride-parade-despite-employees-call-to-kick-it-out/\">        Google to stay in SF Pride parade despite employees call to kick it out     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/25/google-to-employees-dont-protest-on-our-float-at-sf-pride-parade/\">        Google to employees: Dont protest on our float at SF Pride parade     </url></p><p>It has to include the C-suite, he said.

Facebook friendly: Lawmakers praised Facebook for announcing it would crack down on any misinformation on its platform relating to the 2020 U.S. Census</p><p>FULL BRIEFING</p><p>1. Congress asks Pentagon if U.S. needs a cybersecurity branch of armed forces</p><p>Lawmakers are using the fiscal 2020 defense authorization bill to ask the Pentagon to study whether a separate uniformed service dedicated to cybersecurity should be created, my colleague Gopal Ratnam writes.</p><p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to sign the NDAA bill Friday night at Andrews Air Force Base.</p><p>The National Defense Authorization Act (S 1970) asks the Defense Department to assess \"the potential costs, benefits, and value, if any, of establishing a cyber force as a separate uniformed service.\"</p><p>If it comes to pass, a future cyber force would become the seventh branch of the U.S. armed forces, alongside the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, and a new Space Force currently taking shape.</p><p>The congressional directive comes as lawmakers are increasingly worried that the overwhelming U.S. strength in conventional and nuclear forces is unlikely to deter future adversaries that are likely to resort to cyberattacks on U.S. military and civilian infrastructure to undermine American strength.</p><p>Lawmakers also included a variety of other cybersecurity related provisions in the defense policy bill.</p><p>One of the measures tightens the accountability screws on the Pentagon by asking the department to submit written reports for why major U.S. weapons systems have not undergone a cyber vulnerability assessment.</p><p>In the 2016 Pentagon policy bill (PL 114-92) lawmakers had asked the department to complete \"an evaluation of the cyber vulnerabilities of each major weapon system\" by Dec. 31, 2019. It's unclear if the Pentagon completed the assessment either in part or in full.</p><p>In this year's bill, lawmakers said if the Defense secretary \"determines that the Department will not complete an evaluation of the cyber vulnerabilities of each major weapon system\" then the secretary must provide congressional committees a \"justification for the inability to complete\" such an assessment.</p><p>Once an assessment is complete, lawmakers want to see what cyber weaknesses were identified in each weapon, steps to mitigate those, and a deadline by which the fixes would be applied.</p><p>The U.S. Government Accountability Office in a report last year said that despite the Pentagon's plans to spend as much as $1.66 trillion to develop major weapons, adversaries could render them useless by attacking the underlying computers.</p><p>\"Automation and connectivity are fundamental enablers of DOD's modern military capabilities,\" the GAO said. \"However, they make weapon systems more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Although GAO and others have warned of cyber risks for decades, until recently, DOD did not prioritize weapon systems cybersecurity. Finally, DOD is still determining how best to address weapon systems cybersecurity.\"</p><p>Read Gopal's full report on cybersecurity provisions in this year's NDAA here. </p><p>2. Facial recognition use in public housing questioned by lawmakers</p><p>A group of House and Senate Democrats are asking Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson to provide information on the use of facial recognition technology in public housing.</p><p>In a letter to Carson on Thursday, the Democrats, led by Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon, expressed concern that use of the technology in federally subsidized housing could lead to unwarranted government surveillance and civil liberties concerns. </p><p>The Democrats also said that because facial recognition algorithms have been shown to be inaccurate when dealing with vulnerable communities, use of facial recognition could have unintended consequences \"such as the over-criminalization of people of color and transgender individuals.\"</p><p>\"When public housing and federally assisted property owners install facial recognition security camera systems, they could be used to enable invasive, unnecessary and harmful government surveillance of their residents,\" the Democrats wrote. \"Those who cannot afford more do not deserve less in basic privacy and protections. They should not have to compromise their civil rights and liberties nor accept the condition of indiscriminate, sweeping government surveillance to find an affordable place to live.\"</p><p>Wyden was joined by Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Kamala Harris of California, and Edward J Markey of Massachusetts. House members co-signing the letter included Reps. Yvette D. Clarke of New York, Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.</p><p>Booker has introduced legislation (S 2689) that would ban the use of facial recognition technology in public housing. Clarke, Pressley and Tlaib have introduced a companion bill (HR 4008) in the House.</p><p>The lawmakers asked Carson for a full list of housing units that have used facial recognition technology in the past five years and information on the use of federal dollars to purchase facial recognition technology for housing. They asked for a response by Jan. 24.</p><p>Read the full letter from Wyden and his colleagues here. </p><p>3. Rules, privacy issues loom for fintech industry in 2020</p><p>The nascent financial technology industry started the year faintly optimistic that the 116th Congress would pass bills in its favor. But as 2019 comes to an end without legislation, the industry isn't even expecting action in 2020. </p><p>And for that, they're feeling relieved, not disappointed, my colleague Jim Saksa writes.</p><p>Facebook Inc.'s midyear announcement that it planned to launch a cryptocurrency, Libra, upended the industry's focus, tilting the legislative strategy from pressing hard for beneficial bills to staying clear of measures aimed at checking the social media giant's ambitions to transform commerce.</p><p>Now, with the possible exception of a data privacy bill and a smattering of smaller measures, congressional observers in the fintech world expect 2020 will maintain the statutory status quo.</p><p>\"Towards the end of the year, we started to see a couple different proposals circulated in the House that would go after Libra,\" said Kristin Smith of the Blockchain Association, an industry trade group.</p><p>But those proposals, such as a bill from Rep. Sylvia R. Garcia, D-Texas, that would have regulated managed stable coins like Libra as securities, were narrowly tailored, Smith said, calling it a positive sign.</p><p>\"The fact that this is looking at a subset of crypto known as managed stable coins is pretty remarkable,\" she said, noting the bill could have targeted all cryptocurrencies. \"It's a very nuanced approach and answering a very targeted question.\"</p><p>That's a far cry from the spring, when the Blockchain Association hoped a bill that would have prevented digital tokens from being labeled as securities would make it to a House Financial Services Committee markup at the least.</p><p>Smith said she expects to see more measures aimed at discouraging Silicon Valley from moving onto Wall Street's turf than those doing the opposite. She said the House Financial Services Committee could still mark up Garcia's bill next year along with similar proposals with names like the \"Keep Big Tech Out of Financial Services Act.\"</p><p>The fintech world \"dodged a bullet\" with that bill, said Jonah Crane, a former Treasury Department staffer and aide to Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, who now advises fintech firms. \"I don't see high odds that those kind of bills will go anywhere, but they are the kind of bills that, if they start to get momentum, could be hard to stop because of the general antipathy towards Big Tech these days.\"</p><p>Read Jim's full report on the 2020 fintech forecast here.</p><p>4. Census data shows much of country still lacks internet access</p><p>Rural areas and inner cities share a common thread, according to census data released Thursday: a lack of access to the internet, a gap that has closed slowly over the years, my colleague Michael Macagnone writes.</p><p>Nationally, more than 80 percent of households reported having access to broadband internet of some kind in 2018, according to the data released Thursday. That's up from about 74 percent who had it five years earlier. However, inner cities and rural areas have a large number of the households without a wired or mobile internet subscription of any kind, despite years of federal programs building out capacity in those regions.</p><p>The percentage of households without internet access goes up considerably in rural areas. More than half the households in rural Echols County, Ga., don't have an internet subscription, for instance. </p><p>Republican Rep. Earl L. \"Buddy\" Carter said the challenges for his district, which includes Echols, are not substantially different from other rural areas. He said internet access came up at an agriculture convention in his district earlier this year, but that expanding access also will be critical in helping other businesses thrive.</p><p>\"Precision agriculture just begs for this, this type of service, so it is going to be really important, there's no question about that,\" Carter said.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum is Michigan's densely populated Wayne County, which includes Detroit. </p><p>More than 180,000 Wayne County households -- just more than a quarter of all the homes -- have no internet subscription of any kind, according to census data. Despite having less than 2 million people, the county ranks among the top 10 nationwide for households without internet access. </p><p>The data released Thursday showed that homes that lack internet access also tend to have lower incomes. For instance, more than half the Wayne County households that earned less than $20,000 a year did not have an internet subscription. </p><p>A report from Pew Research released in May found that rural areas lagged behind their suburban and urban counterparts in getting an internet connection at home. About 63 percent of the Pew respondents in rural areas said they had internet at home, compared to 75 percent of urban respondents and 79 percent of suburban ones.</p><p>Access to the internet can help businesses find customers, customers find products, and increase communications between and within businesses. A 2016 Council of Economic Advisers report found that internet access spurs more than $30 billion in economic activity, as well as access to services like telemedicine and online education.</p><p>Read Michael's full report on the new census data here. </p><p>5. Facebook will take down misleading information on U.S. Census</p><p>The same day Congress prepared to send the White House a sweeping spending package that includes $7.6 billion for the Census Bureau, Facebook announced it would remove incorrect or misleading census information from its platform next year.</p><p>The social media giant's announcement follows steps by Google and the Census Bureau itself to keep online outreach efforts on track for the 2020 count.</p><p>Members of Congress pushing for more active involvement from social media companies, including Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, took a \"trust but verify\" approach to Facebook's move on Thursday.</p><p>\"I have been a real critic of these internet platforms, and let me take this opportunity to say that in this instance they appear to be doing the right thing,\" Schatz said.</p><p>Facebook joined several other internet companies by announcing it would remove information from its platform that misrepresents the census or the census process, even if posted by a politician. The company also said it would work with the Census Bureau and local officials to help track any distortion about the census online.</p><p>Next month, the agency will start its count, beginning with residents of rural Alaska. It also will kick off a $500 million advertising campaign before efforts to count more than 300 million American residents start in the spring. The agency has invested more than $5 billion in information technology and computer upgrades for a series of innovations, including the nation's first primarily online census count.</p><p>Part of those funds will go toward online efforts to promote the census process. The agency announced on Tuesday that its \"Trust &amp; Safety\" team also will act as a clearinghouse for efforts to stop the online spread of misinformation.</p><p>Rep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat who heads the House Oversight and Reform Committee panel that oversees the census, praised the Facebook announcement as \"good news\" and commended the Census Bureau's efforts.</p><p>\"The government has a responsibility to defend our elections and defend a civic process like the census, so that's good news,\" Raskin said.</p><p>Read Michael Macagnone's full report on Facebook and the Census here. </p><p>SCHEDULES</p><p>Check out CQ Roll Call's up-to-date daily schedule of congressional hearings and more.

Mezrich spoke with The Chronicle about his new book, scheduled for release Tuesday, May 21, and how it serves as both a corrective origin story of the Winklevoss twins and a thrilling primer on the future of currency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q: What led you back to the Winklevoss twins for this book?</p><p>A: For the past couple years, people have been calling me and emailing me saying, you should write about bitcoin, because I write about that sort of thing. But it's never interested me. . But I read the New York Times headline that the Winklevii twins were the \"Bitcoin Billionaires.\" It blew my mind. Because these were the same guys who were the bad guys in \"The Social Network,\" and suddenly they were standing sort of at the beginning of another revolution.</p><p>Q: Part of the perception of them as 'bad guys' comes from your book \"The Accidental Billionaires.\" But in this new book, you re-evaluate them. What was initially wrong about your understanding of the twins?</p><p>A: When I wrote \"The Accidental Billionaires,\" the twins were one of my main sources. I had gotten to know them pretty well. But I had judged them. They were easy to judge. ... But at the same time, there was this kind of really incredible streak of 1950s kind of morality that I think their characters always had. They really believe in this sort of \"Men of Harvard\" and this idea of right and wrong, and this idea of - you get knocked down and you get back up. They really felt that Mark Zuckerberg screwed them. It wasn't about money. It was about being betrayed. And I think there's something very respectable about that, even in the initial telling of the story.</p><p>I really do think that as much as we got Mark Zuckerberg right in the original telling, we got the Winklevii twins wrong. They are those guys. They are the mirror twins rowing together. They are the big men on campus, and they are the guys who wore suits to meet with Larry Summers. But at the same time, they speak multiple languages and they studied Latin. They can computer code, and they understand economics. They weren't part of these two revolutions by accident.</p><p>Q: Zuckerberg's own public standing has shifted dramatically in his relationship to issues of privacy and the choices he's made with Facebook. What are your thoughts on this narrative shift?</p><p>A: I do think this is who he's been all along. I really think from the very beginning, he set out to dominate and change the social order. He believed from the very beginning that the walls we build of privacy are bad. And that the more we share and the more our data is out there, the better the world is. </p><p>Q: Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, recently wrote an opinion piece that called for breaking up the \"monopoly\" that is Facebook. What was your reaction? </p><p>A: The idea of breaking up Facebook - I don't even know what that really means. Cut out Instagram so we all either join Facebook or Instagram? That doesn't make any difference. And I don't know how breaking it up really changes anything. The problem with these technologies is they need to dominate. They have to be a monopoly for them to work. If everyone's not on Facebook, then Facebook is kind of useless, right? I think what Chris Hughes is really trying to say is there shouldn't be a Facebook anymore. And I don't know if that's the answer either. </p><p>Q: What do you see as an answer?</p><p>A: I think a simple fix to Facebook is it becomes a subscription, that you pay a certain fee to be on Facebook that gets rid of the whole idea of selling data. You can wall your privacy as much as you want because they're not making any money off of it. I think that's one possibility - a subscription method. There's a couple of other possibilities.</p><p>The idea of regulation - everyone hates regulation, but at the same time, when you have something so dominant in our lives, so incredibly powerful, there has to be some oversight. It can't just be Mark Zuckerberg sitting in a room, saying I'm going to decide who gets to say what.</p><p>Q: You write in the prologue that cryptocurrency is \"a fundamental paradigm shift, and it will eventually change everything.\" How do you see the future of cryptocurrency?</p><p>A: I know that's somewhat controversial. I do think there are going to be people on either side of that. Listen, 100 years from now, we are not going to be paying for things with cut-down trees in an animal-hide wallet. We're not going to be bartering with cash. Cash is not going to exist in the future. I really don't see that happening. </p><p>I can't imagine 100 years from now, with our automatic cars and with our phones that pay for everything, there's going to be any need or want for cash. The future is crypto. It's some sort of electronic currency that is instantly transferable, that doesn't have any particular government making decisions over it and that isn't run by a single bank. As long as you've got stable governments, cash makes sense. But as soon as your country doesn't do so well, your cash becomes very scary.</p><p>In Cyprus, literally overnight they just took everyone's deposits, took a percentage of everyone's money. Up to 50% of your money just vanished the next day. And you think, well, it can't ever happen in America. No, it can't right now happen in America. But one day, if things go to s-, certainly it could.</p><p>Q: Two of your books have become films \"21\" and \"The Social Network\". Are there similar plans here as well?</p><p>A: It's going to be a big movie. I don't have any specifics to tell you, other than Columbia Pictures, which did \"The Social Network,\" would be distributing it. I would love to see Armie Hammer play the twins again, but it's too early to tell at this point. But, yes, it is going to be a movie. </p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Bitcoin Billionaires: A True Story of Genius, Betrayal, and Redemption </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>By Ben Mezrich</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Flatiron Books</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>288 pages; $27.99</p></bodyText></listItem></list></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Tyler left and Cameron Winklevoss, known for their legal battles over Facebook are the focus of  Bitcoin Billionaires.  </p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Ben Mezrich recasts the Winklevoss twins as the good guys in  Bitcoin Billionaires.  </p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Ben Mezrich is the author of  The Accidental Billionaires,  which the movie  The Social Network  was based on.

But the Nasdaq composite index fell 0.8 percent, dragged down by a broad-based sell-off in tech stocks.</p><p>The big tech names got hit hard: Alphabet and Apple lost 2.9 and 2.8 percent, respectively; Microsoft was down 2.4 percent; Facebook fell 1.9 percent; Twitter dropped almost 4 percent; Netflix lost 5.5 percent; and Amazon.com fell 3.8 percent.</p><p>In the two days since <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was elected president, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has fallen 1.2 percent while the Dow has gained 2.6 percent.</p><p>So what's the trouble with tech? The simple answer is sector rotation. The theory is that under a <person><nameText>Trump administration, </nameText></person>interest rates will rise, regulations will ease and infrastructure spending will grow. Investors are moving money into industries that would do best under that scenario - especially financials, industrials and materials - and out of sectors that will benefit less, namely technology and real estate.</p><p>Another concern is that Trump's trade and immigration policies could hurt tech. \"He certainly has talked about cracking down on immigration. The tech sector is one that relies most heavily on H-1B visas,\" said Dave Nadig, director of exchange-traded funds with FactSet.</p><p>Tech is also highly dependent on the global supply chain. If a trade disagreement caused a disruption to the chain, \"tech more than other industries would be affected,\" said Russ Koesterich, head of asset allocation for BlackRock's Global Allocation Fund.</p><p>Another fear is that Trump could overturn or weaken the Federal Communication Commission's net neutrality policy, which essentially says that Internet service providers cable and phone companies should not favor certain websites and apps over others.</p><p>\"The Obama administration was pro-net neutrality with an FCC that was increasing regulation around the cable companies,\" said Jason Helfstein, an analyst with Oppenheimer.</p><p>Although it wasn't a big issue for Trump during the campaign, net neutrality could come under attack as part of his \"broad theme of deregulation,\" Helfstein said.</p><p>For tech, taxes are a mixed bag. Trump has proposed chopping the top corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. But many big tech companies already have low effective tax rates. \"There are sectors other than tech that would benefit more\" from a tax cut, Koesterich said.</p><p>Today, U.S. companies don't have to pay U.S. tax on foreign profits until they bring them back to the United States. Many tech companies have large unrepatriated earnings sitting offshore. Trump has proposed letting U.S. companies bring home foreign profits at a rate of 10 percent, payable over 10 years. That \"could help large-cap tech if they could bring it back at a discounted rate,\" said Aaron Kessler, an analyst with Raymond James &amp; Associates</p><p>However, Trump has also said he would tax future profits of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies each year as the profits are earned.</p><p>Finally, an increase in long-term interest rates - like we've seen in the past two days - generally helps banks, but hurts tech and other growth companies that are valued more on their future profits than current ones, Nadig said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SFCHRN-B61371050Z</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SFCHRN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5M4X-5FJ1-JC8F-520R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8172</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"542\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 San Francisco Chronicle All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Francisco Chronicle (California)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4092\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>November 11, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>AMZN (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>STOCKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Internet Services</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0RBNjIwOTBBREExNDE1Q0ExQUYwMDE4MjI2MTkyQTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzNFQTlENUZGNUIyNEUyMzhEOEZFNUEzNzYzNEE4Qzg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The well-coached chief executive buried his propensity for arrogance and answered patiently as he was questioned in an often incompetent manner by aged senators who sounded as if they barely understood the internet, much less the intricacies of Facebook.</p><p>As a result, few of them were able to properly tackle Zuckerberg over the central mysteries of exactly how his algorithms work to deliver targeted advertising to users. Or precisely what protections there are to safeguard personal privacy. As Zuckerberg progressively realised this, his nervous demeanour vanished and he became more relaxed and assertive, even cracking jokes. The question for the senators is whether they believe his repeated promised to implement a raft of changes that will better protect the content, privacy and security of the social network.</p><p>It is a leap of faith to do so given Zuckerberg's track record of being reactive rather than proactive to the challenge of safeguarding Facebook from bad actors. But the alternative for congress is also difficult - a new regulatory regime for Facebook and other tech giants which congress has traditionally shied away from.</p><p>However, the EU has shown the courage the US has lacked by taking on the tech giants with sweeping privacy laws which take effect from next month.The scandals that have enveloped Facebook prove that Washington can no longer rely on big tech to self-regulate in this new era of social media.

There is a legitimate debate over the continued use of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act by these companies when they are engaged in such censorship (and alleged viewpoint bias). However, President Donald Trump's call for Twitter to take down a parody of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is wrong on a number of levels. It would only fuel the erosion of free speech on the Internet in curtailing political commentary.Yesterday, President Trump struck out at the picture of McConnell in a Russian military uniform: </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/ybHugWr\">https://imgur.com/ybHugWr</url> The tweet says: Why does Twitter leave phony pictures like this up, but take down Republican/Conservative pictures and statements that are true? Mitch must fight back and repeal Section 230, immediately. Stop biased Big Tech before they stop you! It is a particularly curious objection from a politician who regularly parodies his political opponents with insulting names and descriptions. Parody is one of the oldest forms of political discourse. Since Hegemon of Thasos, parodia has been a literary device and an important form of political speech. Parody and satire have long been used to emphasize (and often exaggerate) political objections to our leaders. In White v. Samsung Elec. Am., Inc., 989 F.2d 1512, 1519 (9th Cir. 1993), then Chief Judge Alex Kozinski wrote in dissent that 'TheFirstAmendmentisn't just about religion or politics - it's also about protecting the free development of our national culture.Parody, humor, irreverence are all vital components of the marketplace of ideas.' The Supreme Court has repeated affirmed the importance of parody and satire as protected speech. In Campbell v. Acuff-Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 579 (1994). Justice David Souter notedthat 'parody has an obvious claim to transformative value.' Even vulgar parodies have been protected like the fake advertisement featuring evangelical minister Jerry Falwell: 'At the heart of the FirstAmendment is the recognition of the fundamental importance of the free flow of ideas and opinions on matters of public interest and concern. '[T]he freedom to speak one's mind is not only an aspect of individual liberty-and thus a good unto itself-but also is essential to the common quest for truth and the vitality of society as a whole.'' Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 50-51 (1987)(quotingBose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 503-04 (1984)). This parody of McConnell as 'Moscow Mitch' may be unfair and insulting but it is quintessential political speech and should be protected. There is a legitimate criticism of companies like Twitter and Facebook for biased policies, but that should be part of a call for less, not more, censorship. It is not just Trump who is calling for increased censorship. I have criticized Democratic leaders who have made such limitation and regulation of free speech a central cause for their party. Hillary Clinton has demanded that political speech be regulated to avoid the 'manipulation of information' and stated that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg 'should pay a price for what he is doing to our democracy' by refusing to take down opposition postings. In Europe, free speech rights are in a free fall, and countries such as France and Germany are imposing legal penalties designed to censor speech across the world. Joe Biden has pushed for these companies to delete criticism of mail-in voting.[2] Many of us in the free speech community have warned of the growing insatiable appetite for censorship in the West. We have been losing the fight, and free speech opponents are now capitalizing on the opportunity presented by the pandemic. Representative Adam Schiff sent a message to the heads of Google, Twitter, and YouTube demanding censorship of anything deemed 'misinformation' and 'false information.' Schiff told the companies that they needed 'to remove or limit content' and that, 'while taking down harmful misinformation is a crucial step', they also needed to educate 'those users who accessed it' by making available the true facts. All of these calls from the left and the right are efforts to control the speech of political critics and dissidents. These companies should be criticized for the bias shown in past actions, which I have previously addressed[3]. However, do not be misled by the fact that these voices are coming from opposite sides of our political debate. They are unified in the desire to curtail the most powerful forum for free speech in the history of humanity: the Internet. It is the bane of the existence of politicians around the world and they want to control it. To do that, they have to get free citizens to call for their own censorship. Many have yielded to that siren's call to the peril of free speech. That is far too high a price to pay to protect Sen. McConnell from the insults of political parody.

Professor Roubini as acclaimed getting upfront of the crisis of 2007, I personally did that with him in Davos at one point in '05 or '06. And I'm thrilled to have Nouriel here on this important day. Let bring up from Enda Curran in Hong Kong a chart which is great because it's hard to read. I really mean that. It's hard to read this chart. Bring it up right now on radio. It is a massive disproportion of U.S. imports of China's stuff versus what they take from us. Here we are with the tariffs here, the tariffs there and China is just tiny, tiny, tiny. Professor Roubini, this is the arch-imbalance of President Trump's certitude. I heard this from Lawrence Kudlow yesterday at the economic club of New York. They speak of us as equals in trade dynamics or not, are we?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  We're not equal in terms of trade dynamics but has many other ways to retaliate. Of course, they've only 130 billion of imports from the U.S. while the U.S. imports from China more than 500 billion. But let's not forget that the U.S. firms, whether Apple, Gem (ph), hundreds of others, have done hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign direct investment in China. In the past, when China (inaudible) with Japan or Korea, they took action against these foreign investments, and therefore, they can retaliate and they're going to start doing it in many different ways. China can also retaliate by letting its currency weaken. Renminbi has already fallen at 8%. And then there's the nuclear option of dumping U.S. treasury, and I don't think that's likely. So the idea that there's an imbalance and China cannot retaliate, I think, is actually the wrong argument.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Your heritage of being born in Istanbul, have studied in Milan, studied with Jeff Sax at Harvard, your international sense, your old world sense, is a study of how China will react. Jonathan Spence 101 at Yale University, how would you presume that China will react to this approach by Mr. Trump?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  First of all, the Chinese can be flexible. They need to do reforms and some of the reforms (inaudible) upper hand. But China and President Xi Jinping cannot lose face (ph). And what happens is that United States is starting not just a trade war with China but geopolitically wants to contain China. China is never giving up on its own Made in China 2025 program, for example. And therefore, the risk is that if you try to contain China, China is going to become actually more aggressive and less cooperative. And I think that's what's going to likely happen. They're going to retaliate in many different ways. So this is going to be counterproductive.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  (Inaudible) from Milan, do we underestimate the dangers of a Chinese GDP that is slowing down or even does the size of shadow banking in China?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Well, there has been a slowdown in China. But every time there is excessive slowdown after a tightening of monetary, fiscal and credit policy, there is an easing of monetary, credit, fiscal policy. China has not ran out of tools, yet there has been a significant correction of the stock market, 25% but the world effect is small. Yes, default rates have gone up because they are reducing leverage and align more flexibility. But that's manageable. And the currency weakening actually is occurring right now and their capital controls has not (inaudible) in 2015 and '16. And that actually helps China. If their currency goes down by 8%, the U.S. imposes tariffs on 10% is a bit of a wash in terms of their competitiveness. So China has the macroeconomic policy tools to manage its own slowdown. Of course, China, so far, has kicked the can down the road and not dealing with too much and too fast enough with the issues of overcapacity, overleverage and debt, but China is going to do it gradually. And China is going to take the long-term view. China is going to be in a long-term competition with the United States once Mao was allegedly asked what he thought of the French Revolution, he said, too early to tell. And China takes an approach a decade longer. We have midterm election, we have election ever two years, China has no elections, so they can take control on their own policies and face and threaten the U.S. over the medium and long-term. So they may win this war.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Right. But, Nouriel, I guess what I'm trying to get at is they do have the tools to manage a slowdown. But if they only focus domestically on what they need to do, do they let the emerging markets down and what does that mean for markets overall?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Well, of course, the emerging markets are hurting right now for a number of global factors. China is one of them. The risk of trade war is one of them, either directly or through China. But then U.S. fed policies and fiscal policy, (inaudible), higher, longer and short rates, stronger dollar, and a stronger dollar means a lower dollar price of commodity. So these are the global factors that all EM are facing. But China were to react to the risk of a trade war by boosting domestic demand and maintaining its own economic growth closer to their 6.5% target, and recently, actually, they're growing faster in 6.5%, then that's going to be a backstop for emerging markets. So, of course, if China were to go to a hard landing, then that's going to hurt emerging markets, but also the U.S., Europe and the world economy. But in my view, China have still some of the policy tools to manage that economic slowdown.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  I saw Ambassador Hormats yesterday, Robert Hormats, he was an assistant of Secretary Clinton. And there is someone with a certain set of views. And I think of someone he works for, Dr. Kissinger, or Robert Kaplan, who has my book of the summer, writing about China and the Pacific Rim. All of that is a neo-realist view. What's the neo-realist response to a president who wants to put on layers of taxes called tariffs?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Well, the Chinese know that, effectively, by imposing these tariffs on China, they'll increase the cost of lots of goods up to $500 billion that used by U.S. consumers. And the fact that, for example, they may introduce for September 10 and push it 25% on January 1st, is they don't want to have a (inaudible) shock for consumers during the holiday as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Right. I don't mean to interrupt you but this is critical. This is Roubini 101 at Stern School New York University. Are we able to say that within all this mumbo-jumbo, a tariff is a tax on an American consumer? Is that a safe statement?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Yes, it's absolutely true. Whenever you impose tariffs, you're increasing the price on imports certainly for consumer products but also for a variety of other intermediate products and the fact also the business sector. But this first (inaudible) is a tax. And by the way, it's a very regressive tax because those kinds of consumer goods that we buy from China are usually bought at Walmart and other types of firms and they're bought by lower income individuals. So not only the tax but it's an extremely regressive tax.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  And this is important, Francine, with you in Milan. I mean, the bottom line here is this is not a tax on Gucci, is it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Well, let me ask Nouriel. Away from Gucci, is this a tax that could actually plunge the U.S. into a recession in the next 18 months?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  No. I don't think that that alone is going to plunge the U.S. into a recession, even if my prediction that a variety of other factors can push the U.S. into a recession by 2020, monetary policy, fiscal policy, the trade war, other frictions, what's happening with the rest of the world, but certainly I think that people underestimate the impact of this trade war on the economy because they say the trade impacts directly, indirectly, are too small to matter. That's not true because, first of all, you have retaliation. And as long as you have retaliation, the impact is bigger. Secondly is that tax on consumer that uses disposable income, it's going to slowdown consumption. Three, it's going to affect both business and consumer confidence. In addition, it's going to push down, emerging markets are going to hurt them, it's going to push down the price of commodity. And finally, they're going to have an effect only also on investor's confidence. If the stock market in China has gone down 20% this year under the threat of trade wars, in fact, later in the summer, the U.S. market was going down as well. So there's going to be a generalized trade war, not 50 billion, but it's going to be 500 billion and there's going to be a retaliation, there's going to be other things, there's going to be a bigger impact. And right now, this is not just a trade war. The U.S. is going to impose restriction on inward FDI (ph) into the U.S. by China to outward FDI (ph) by United States firms, they want to have all U.S. firms getting out of China, they're going to have global supply chains, technology transfer and so on and so on. So this is not just about trading goods. It's about technology, it's about IP, it's about FDI (ph), inward and outward, and you're going to roll, this is going to become de-globalized, it's going to become Volckanized, in which these frictions are going to have a negative stagflationary impact of reducing growth and increasing inflation globally. That's the danger of this trade war.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right. Well, that gets us started certainly. Nouriel Roubini there of Roubini Macro Associates stays with us.  </p><p>      Well I'm pleased to be joined by Corrado Passera. He is SPAXS' Chief Executive Officer and Founder, former Italian Minister of Economic Development and, for almost a decade, the Chief Executive of one of Italy's biggest bank. Still with us in New York, Nouriel Roubini of Roubini Macro Associates. So thank you for sticking around, Nouriel. Welcome to the program, Corrado Passera. When you look at Italy, there was a lot of anxiousness out there in the market over the summer. Do you think now investors concerned have been delayed (ph) because actually this government, like any Italian government, needs the markets?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PASSERA</emphasis>:  Absolutely. And anxiety was justified because of some of the announcements that were made in the first weeks after the creation of the government. But even today, the statements or the announcements that Tria made were the right ones because he talked about growth and growth through investment, increased the investment both public and private, that's the key word in my opinion, and he said very clearly, we will stick to our commitment in terms of debt reduction. So growth, investment, commitments on debt is the combination of things that markets expect. Then we will look at the stability now in the details but these three main announcements are good ones.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Is there a discount to Italian banks because of the political situation? You're actually starting a challenger bank. It's a niche bank that actually tries to lend to SME.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PASSERA</emphasis>:  Challenger and niche are two concepts that probably do not convey the right message because niche means small and it's not the kind of --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  So for now, that's all.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PASSERA</emphasis>:  The bank is small but the market is really booming and then (inaudible) need for financing with SMEs is very big. On the other side, challenger gives the right the message but we want to be -- we will be a special event. I mean, we want to do only a number things, three asset lines with SMEs that are very interesting, profitable and useful project for the country. And we will do it in a totally new paradigm way. So it's -- at the end, it's a challenge to others. But in a number of ways, we will also collaborate with the incumbents because we will buy guilty (ph) piece unlikely to pay, we will buy NPLs, we will manage to help second tier SMEs that have potential to grow, so it's more than that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Okay. You didn't answer my question on Italian banks. I'll come to you in a second.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PASSERA</emphasis>:  Yes. No, you're right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  But actually, Nouriel, what's your take overall on Italian banks and the Italian GDP? Should we worry about it, so like Mr. (inaudible) tells us or should markets remain cool about it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Well, there is some positive about Italy is that the market constraints in E.U. are going to force them to keep the budget deficit for the next year around the current level as a share of GDP. That's the positive. And euro membership is not on the table, so they have been controlled and contained by market discipline. However, spread in Italian debt are still 250 basis points, first of all, the economy is slowing down very sharply. And even if they want to maintain the deficit at around 2% of GDP, it's going to be problematic because they want to spend more and cut taxes by 1%, they don't know how they're going to finance it, they might fudge it by making estimates about growth for next year too high, 1.6, when market estimates are more like 0.8. And many of their policies are leading to a reduction of potential growth rather than an increase of potential growth, reverse in the reform of pension, restricting the labor market flexibility and so on and so on. So actual growth is falling, potential growth is falling, real rates are high or even before the ECB has ended up QE and the loosening of the primary balance implies that it's going to be very hard for them to stabilize the debt ratio and reduce it. It might go higher. And therefore, Italy is still on a knife edge situation from an economic point of view. And there is still political risk. Salvini is popular. And after the budget, the law is passed, it might go to election, that's going to create more uncertainty. So in the short run, I don't think that the spreads are going to widen, things are going to stabilize given their fiscal commitment, but Italy is facing a number of economic, fiscal and financial challenges over the next couple of years.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Nouriel, I want to explain this distinction. Mariana Mazzucato and Kenneth Rogoff sat right where you're sitting five or six days ago. And sometimes the body language -- and Jason, bring it in here, the body language we see on camera, like if I'm like this, I'm like really board and then you sit up straight and listen. Ken Rogoff sat up straight when the topic was Italy. Why is a guy like Ken Rogoff totally focused on Italy?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Well, it's not just Ken Rogoff, it's also the markets. When -- a couple of weeks ago, Salvini and Di Maio said, we're going to increase the deficit from two to three. The spread suddenly overnight went from 250 to over 300 and they flip-flopped in 24 hours. And they sided then to say, no, we're going to stick to the E.U. rules.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  (Inaudible) is that the heritage of Italy is that the adjacency of Italy on the Bloomberg screen, it's a G7 country. Why the focus on Italy?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Well, Italy has now become, for the first time, a country run by populists, Italian debt is 135% of GDP and is the largest debt in absolute terms after U.S. and Japan in the world economy. Greece could be built out by (inaudible) program was, after all, only needs EURO200 billion public debt problem, Italy is 2.3 trillion public debt problem. So Italy is too big to fail but also too big to be saved. There is no (inaudible) program, they could backstop Italy if Italy goes in the wrong direction. Therefore, Italy is systemic for Italy for Eurozone, if Italy were to leave, there will be a systemic shock to the Eurozone and then it could be a threat to the global economy. That's why people are interested in Italy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Francine?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Right. Yes. And, Nouriel, I would go a step further and saying this is not an obsession on Italy, it's also an obsession with Italian banks. If there's a problem with Italian banks, do the markets actually discount them and forget sometimes all of the work that's done on non-performing loans over the last three years?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PASSERA</emphasis>:  Nouriel is right in listing the risks and banks obviously are short of proxy over the old countries. So if all the wrong things are done, that we will have troubles. But I don't expect all the wrong things will be done. We all know that the so-called government contract, the two coalition parties have agreed upon -- it's not feasible and it will be implemented, in my opinion, only partially and only gradually. Having said that, banks, banks have gone through at least three main crisis, the financial asset crisis reasonably well managed, the credit asset crisis and we are digesting, we are getting out of it. I mean, NPLs and UTPs are still an important component of our asset balance sheets but they are being deluded. We had a number of single bank crisis, some of them very, very bad ones, but they're now sold, partially paid by the tax payers but are now gone. And now, we are going through the more structural transformation, reshaping of the industry, because digital technologies regulation, the entrance by big tech companies in the credit world and monetary policies are making the traditional business models very unsustainable. But new winners are coming in that area.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Okay. But do we need a banking consolidation in Italy? It's almost difficult to deny that actually Italy is not overbanked?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PASSERA</emphasis>:  No, it's not overbanked but --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  But it's not overbanked.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PASSERA</emphasis>:  It's not overbanked in a sense that we will have a new mix of players in the next years. Small and medium-sized banks are too generic and too traditional to sustain the competition will get out of the market for sure, and some of them to consolidation. Some of the big ones will keep investing in innovation and they will be players. Some entrance from other industries will be players. But we will certainly -- we can expect a number of specialty players, new paradigm kind of players in terms of business system to enter the market. And so market will change a lot. In terms of consolidation, Italy has been one of the countries that have consolidated the most. I mean, take, for example, Germany, I mean, much more than Germany. And now with the law that has been passed on Popolare and Rural (inaudible) cooperative banks, 300 of them will become free. So at the end, we will be landing (ph) around 100, that the steel is a large number. But compared with the 1,800 banks in Germany, I mean, it shows that we have done a good part of the road ahead.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Nouriel, do you think we'll see a banking union in our lifetime and will that help with consolidation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Well, I fear that for time being, there is not going to be a full banking union in the Eurozone, even a proposal for a common deposit insurance scheme in the Eurozone has been pushed back by Germany. Germany fears that risk sharing is re-shifting and a fiscal union effectively becomes like a transfer union. And given now there are political uncertainties in Italy, Germany is pushing back even the (inaudible) the proposals of Macron have not been accepted. They push them from June to December, then there'll be E.U. parliamentary election. And therefore, any agenda about finalizing the banking union and increasing the element of risk sharing is not going to happen until Germany and other parts of the north (ph) are going to have more security about what's happening in Italy and the periphery Eurozone.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Nouriel, let's continue here. Nouriel Roubini with us in New York. And we thank Corrado Passera in Milan.  </p><p>      It is one thing to talk about immigrants for we are all immigrants, there is actually the generational doing of it. One person that knows this call (ph) is Nouriel Roubini of Roubini Macro Associates and, of course, New York University, one of the world's acclaimed international economist. And now, he'll speak with where he started out, Istanbul in Turkey. How long were you in Istanbul for, a cup of coffee?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Well, I was born there. And this time, I was there for about a week. I went to Istanbul, I went to Ankara, I saw the news on policymakers and so on. So -- and I was there right at that time when the currency was plunging from (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Is it traditional economics? Is it Irving Fisher economics where, right now, the currency links right in the interest rates links, right into inflation and shows potential dampened GDP and frankly crisis?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Yes, there is a severe risk of a balance of payment in crisis over a sudden stop of capital, the huge amount of dollar that especially in the banking system, that corporate sector. And, of course, going from three to five to seven, I was around 6.3, implies a massive negative balance sheet affects on the corporate and the financial sector. That's why actually the currency is not leading the fall of the currency to an economic stimulus. If anything, the economy now is going into a recession. The latest economic data suggested that Turkey is going to have a credit crunch, it's going to enter a recession by probably the third quarter of this year. So you have the impact of the currency depreciation with dollar debt is contractioning rather than being expansionary, it leads to higher inflation. It forces the central bank to hike rates, finally, they have shown some independence. But monetary tightening is not sufficient because you have massive fiscal -- cause a fiscal and credit stimulus in the economy that led to overheating for him to win the election, and therefore, now they have to tighten also credit fiscal and quasi fiscal policy. But they have a regional election next March. And therefore, they want to avoid the recession because they want to win those important local elections, and therefore, they're not tightening the fiscal and credit range as much as they should.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Right. So, Nouriel, what will it take to put Turkey on a more stable footing? It seems that the central bank actually did a lot and yet investors aren't convinced?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Well, in Argentina the policy red (ph) were pushed to 60% with inflation slightly above the one of Turkey. In Turkey, finally, they pushed them from 17% towards 24%. That's a positive especially because the signal to the central bank is now slightly more independent even if Erdogan, the president, keeps on attacking the central banks and the interest will lobby (ph). But as I pointed out, you have massive imbalances both internal on the fiscal side and the savings and the spending of the private sector and external with very large current account deficit. Therefore, you need monetary tightening, probably more because inflation is going to rise, fiscal tightening and credit tightening. What that implies, you have to accept a recession. The (inaudible) is already going into a recession by the time where politically his support is deriving by having strong economic growth and you have an election coming next spring. So I don't think they're going to be doing enough because if they're doing enough, they're going to plunge the economy into a recession, that this point is unavoidable. And therefore, the weakening of the currency is going to continue to occur even after this monetary tightening, and we've seen it in the last couple of days. So the currency is weakening (inaudible), and there are political uncertainties as well. So they're not doing enough. Argentina, what that means is promising enough and the currency has still weakened. Turkey is not even promising to do what's necessary.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  So how do you find the floor in Turkish lira? Do you assume that it just continues falling until a politically -- I guess, the ruling class accepts that they could go into a recession?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Yes. First of all, inflation is going to go higher given the currency of the depreciation, so even 24% rate is not enough. They'll have to tighten more as inflation goes higher. And as I say, the main imbalances are not just on the monetary side but fiscal for the fiscal and credit, and that slowdown has not occurred. They have promised a fiscal tightening, it has not occurred. And politically, for them, accepting a recession is going to be very painful and they're going to try to kick the can down the road at least until March of next year, until after those elections. Given that situation, I think the currency can weaken in nominal and real term even if it has fallen significantly. It can fall more if inflation gets higher. So I don't see yet the bottom for the Turkish lira.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Okay. Nouriel, I want to talk about this right now because a lot of people say, what's the big deal with Nouriel Roubini? Here's why Nouriel Roubini is famous, going back to 2005 and 2007, we'll drive it forward. This is a fancy physics question which is sinusoidal function, a sign way (ph) function. And what Nouriel Roubini is famous for is his A right here, which is the amplitude of a given wave. And, Nouriel, this goes back to 2006, which was the amplitude of the crisis that everybody underestimated. Is that where we are right now where we really don't understand the amplitudes of Turkey, the amplitudes of Argentina or frankly the amplitudes that could have come out of this trade year?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Yes, we don't know it because we don't know what the policy responses are going to be in Turkey and Argentina. Therefore, the market, given the uncertainty, they tend to overreact and there're overshooting of prices. In a case of the trade war, that was 50, then 200, now, they are saying, 267, and that's not going to be just rates. Their technology for a large investment could be a global trade war, it could be a de-globalization.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Because of time, Nouriel, it's a critical question, and do you overlay a new kind of shadow banking where we all underestimate the A in that equation, the amplitude of a potential shock. (Inaudible) the shadow banking right now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Well, the shadow banking in China is in serious trouble. They tried to rein it in but (inaudible) shadow banking in the global financial system. People say the banks now have more liquidity, less leverage and more capital, yes. But a lot of financial transactions have gone in the shadow banking system globally, that have been rising. Leverage has been rising. And therefore, we're always fighting the last war. The last war was the banks were the problem. This time around, it might be the rest of the capital markets, it could be the shadow banking system certainly in China but even in the United States. You have algo trading, you have all these credit funds that are open-ended and are illiquid, you have a variety of things like the market makers are not there, they're not warehousing, the broker-dealers are not doing those activities. Those are sources of illiquidity and amplification of economic and financial shock over time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  And not only, Nouriel, that but the dollarization which maybe we'll have time to get. Nouriel Roubini with us, Roubini Macro Associates, Tom Keene in New York, Francine Lacqua in Milan, for your briefing coast to coast and indeed worldwide.  </p><p>      Let's do that with a brilliant essay, Rosa &amp; Roubini writing in project syndicate. The space for fiscal stimulus is already limited by a massive public debt. Mr. Kudlow didn't want to talk about that yesterday. Unlike in 2008, when governments had the policy tools needed to prevent a free fall, the policymakers who much confront the next downturn will have their hands tied while overall debt levels are higher than during the previous crisis. This is a surprising essay, Nouriel Roubini. Why will the policymakers have their hands tied? I thought regulators were doing a great job.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Well, on fiscal policy, we're running now another $2 trillion fiscal deficit over the next ten years. So when the likes of a recession comes, higher deficit, and that implies we don't have room to do stimulus. The fed is not going to have much headroom even if we reach to 75 before the next recession. Typically, you have 500, 600 basis points. So they're going to go to zero, forward guidance is not going to be enough. And doing quantitative is easing is going to be more difficult. And then the political willingness to backstop the banks our corporates are not going to be there. There's a populist backlash and many countries in the world are at insolvent (ph) governments, so they can't even bail out their own firms even if they want to. So all the policy tools are going to be much more constrained next time around in a world in which overall debt levels are higher.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Of these menu of items, the one that is immediate is yesterday, Mr. Kudlow made very clear that he believes that you can grow your way out of a deficit. He cited not once but twice in his conversation at the Economic Club of New York that they've already modeled out new Trumpian growth that will bring in taxes to pay the deficit. I know you don't buy that. I didn't think the audience bought as well. Push against the idea that you can grow your way out of a deficit. What does history tell us?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Well, it's good economics. Reagan tried it, Bush tried it. And this time around, look at the latest number. The deficit since last year has already, in August, doubled. And it's going to double because you have to $2 trillion budget deficit. Next year, we're going to have a budget deficit that is going to be overall $1 trillion. The deficit (inaudible) to the public $1 trillion per year for them as far as the eye can see. So it's totally good economics. Of course, it cut taxes, there is some short room in growth but they're going to be minimal, the the CBO (ph) estimates over a decade 0.1% increase in GDP level, okay. That is nothing as close to zero. Then a fiscal drag to the effect on long-term, short rates in the dollar, there will be a crowding out of that growth. And to contain it, then they have to increase rapidly taxes on the household sectors starting in 2024. So there will be a massive drag starting then but there will be already fiscal drag in 2020. The economy is going now three rather than two because this year and next year, there's a fiscal stimulus. By 2020, that still becomes a small fiscal drag. So not only are we going to go from three to two, we're going to go below two, we're going to go towards 1.8. So it's an artificial fiscal stimulus, unsustainable, peace time, first time ever, during and after a recession, and it's going to crowd out economic growth overtime.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  What does that mean for yields, Nouriel, treasury yields?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Well, overtime, the combination of the U.S. monetary policy and the fed tightening and this fiscal stimulus implies that long-term interest rates have gone higher and they're going to keep on going higher. Now, what keeps the lead right now on long-term trades in the U.S. is that while the fed controls the short end of the yield curve, ECB, BOJ and other central banks are controlling the long-term of the yield curve because there is still unconventional policies in other parts of the world. But guess what, the ECB decided we're going to finish QE and then start normalizing rate next year. Other central banks in Europe are going to do the same thing. Therefore, global liquidity is going to start to shrink. And therefore, once that happens, and you still have the stimulus, U.S. long-term interest rates are going to tend to go higher, (inaudible) is going higher, the dollar is going to strengthen, the current account deficit is going to become higher, and therefore, the crowding by late next year of that economic recovery into a fiscal drag in 2020 into a tightening by the fed towards 3.5%. And they have to go towards 3.5% because the fiscal stimulus leads to an overheating of the economy. And that tighter fiscal policy and tighter monetary policy could plunge the economy into a stall by 2020 if you add the trade frictions, the capital market frictions. In fact, there'll be a slowdown in emerging market, in Europe, in China, and, in fact, that asset prices, as you know, are frothy. Profit and P ratios are 50% higher than the historical average. So when the markets see the slowdown occurring to 2020, there will be market correction and that's going to have a negative world effect. So you might have by 2020 a perfect storm for the U.S. and the global economy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Okay. Will the central bank have enough tools to deal with this perfect storm if we were to have it by 2020?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  I think there are differences this time around, is that we are having policies that are stagflationary that reduce growth but also increase inflation. For the last decade, all the shocks were stagflationary, meaning lower growth and lower inflation, and therefore, central banks were doing even more in doubling down on more unconventional policies. But if you're going to have trade restriction, if you are going to have a restriction to capital flows, you're going to have a restriction to FDI and technology transfers, if you're going to have a restriction migration, if you're not going to invest into renewable resources, if you're not going to invest into renewable resources, if you're not going to invest into infrastructure and there's no plan. All those shocks are stagflationary, are going to release (ph) growth, are going to force inflation higher. And when that happens when the economy is overheating, that's going to force the fed to hike more faster and sooner rather than ease (ph), as it happens whenever you've had a policy shock that they have been stagflationary, like the oil (ph) shock, '73, '79, '99. Because if you don't tighten, inflation expectation go higher and then you're in the worst situation. So the type of policy that is going to be followed by the U.S. are going to imply force and effect to have to tighten rather than ease, even if growth slows down, because inflation and inflation expectations are going to go to higher. That's a difference in the ability and willingness of the fed and other central to react to that economic slowdown. It's driven by negative supply side shocks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right. Thank you so much for all of the insights. Nouriel Roubini there of Roubini Macro Associates, he stays with us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Right now, let's look at something we've avoided with Nouriel Roubini this morning, we're going to do it, we're going to dive in for a quick comment. Copper looks lousy. Right now, Dr. Roubini, Dr. Copper, this is just a textbook depressed commodity chart (inaudible) teach in one of your sessions in NYU, Nouriel. This should be a lead chart. What does it signal that we're seeing this dampening in something like copper?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Well, it signals that there is a potential slowdown in the global economy signal.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  You take it right over to GDP?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUBINI</emphasis>:  Yes. Emerging markets are slowing down, China will have to slowdown, and whether there's a correlation between the value of the dollar and the dollar prices of commodities, when the dollar is stronger, the dollar price of commodity tends to fall. So I would say, the weakening in copper is an ominous signal. And I would say also the increase in oil prices is an ominous signal because it's like a negative supply side shock to the global economy and that drives in the oil prices, it's not driven by demand growth but it's driven by the fact that the sanction on Iran right now are equivalent to a supply side shock, like it's happening in the previous episode. So that's even is a negative. Usually higher oil prices implies strong global growth. In this case, it's driven by a supply shock rather than (inaudible) shock so it's a negative for global growth.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  This has been wonderful and congratulations on your essay with Mr. Rosa in Project Syndicate. I'll get that out on social, folks. I really recommend that. It's a thought-provoking view forward looking back to the Lehman crisis. Nouriel Roubini, of course, with Roubini Macro Associates as well.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T9F-1JC1-F15W-H0MG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: And there is no one better to do that with  Nouriel Roubini of New York University. Professor Roubini as acclaimed  getting upfront of the crisis of 2007, I personally did that with him in  Davos at one point in '05 or '06. And I'm thrilled to have Nouriel here on  this important day. Let bring up from Enda Curran in Hong Kong a chart  which is great because it's hard to read. I really mean that. It's hard to  read this chart. Bring it up right now on radio. It is a massive  disproportion of U.S. imports of China's stuff versus what they take from  us. Here we are with the tariffs here, the tariffs there and China is just  tiny, tiny, tiny. Professor Roubini, this is the arch-imbalance of  President Trump's certitude. I heard this from Lawrence Kudlow yesterday at  the economic club of New York. They speak of us as equals in trade dynamics  or not, are we?</p><p> NOURIEL ROUBINI, CHAIRMAN &amp; PROFESSOR, ROUBINI MACRO ASSOCIATES NYU STERN  SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: We're not equal in terms of trade dynamics but has many  other ways to retaliate. Of course, they've only 130 billion of imports  from the U.S. while the U.S. imports from China more than 500 billion. But  let's not forget that the U.S. firms, whether Apple, Gem (ph), hundreds of  others, have done hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign direct  investment in China. In the past, when China (inaudible) with Japan or  Korea, they took action against these foreign investments, and therefore,  they can retaliate and they're going to start doing it in many different  ways. China can also retaliate by letting its currency weaken. Renminbi has  already fallen at 8%. And then there's the nuclear option of dumping U.S.  treasury, and I don't think that's likely. So the idea that there's an  imbalance and China cannot retaliate, I think, is actually the wrong  argument.</p><p> KEENE: Your heritage of being born in Istanbul, have studied in Milan,  studied with Jeff Sax at Harvard, your international sense, your old world  sense, is a study of how China will react. Jonathan Spence 101 at Yale  University, how would you presume that China will react to this approach by  Mr. Trump?</p><p> ROUBINI: First of all, the Chinese can be flexible. They need to do reforms  and some of the reforms (inaudible) upper hand. But China and President Xi  Jinping cannot lose face (ph). And what happens is that United States is  starting not just a trade war with China but geopolitically wants to  contain China. China is never giving up on its own Made in China 2025  program, for example. And therefore, the risk is that if you try to contain  China, China is going to become actually more aggressive and less  cooperative. And I think that's what's going to likely happen. They're  going to retaliate in many different ways. So this is going to be  counterproductive.</p><p> FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: (Inaudible) from Milan, do we  underestimate the dangers of a Chinese GDP that is slowing down or even  does the size of shadow banking in China?</p><p> ROUBINI: Well, there has been a slowdown in China. But every time there is  excessive slowdown after a tightening of monetary, fiscal and credit  policy, there is an easing of monetary, credit, fiscal policy. China has  not ran out of tools, yet there has been a significant correction of the  stock market, 25% but the world effect is small. Yes, default rates have  gone up because they are reducing leverage and align more flexibility. But  that's manageable. And the currency weakening actually is occurring right  now and their capital controls has not (inaudible) in 2015 and '16. And  that actually helps China. If their currency goes down by 8%, the U.S.  imposes tariffs on 10% is a bit of a wash in terms of their  competitiveness. So China has the macroeconomic policy tools to manage its  own slowdown. Of course, China, so far, has kicked the can down the road  and not dealing with too much and too fast enough with the issues of  overcapacity, overleverage and debt, but China is going to do it gradually.  And China is going to take the long-term view. China is going to be in a  long-term competition with the United States once Mao was allegedly asked  what he thought of the French Revolution, he said, too early to tell. And  China takes an approach a decade longer. We have midterm election, we have  election ever two years, China has no elections, so they can take control  on their own policies and face and threaten the U.S. over the medium and  long-term. So they may win this war.</p><p> LACQUA: Right. But, Nouriel, I guess what I'm trying to get at is they do  have the tools to manage a slowdown. But if they only focus domestically on  what they need to do, do they let the emerging markets down and what does  that mean for markets overall?</p><p> ROUBINI: Well, of course, the emerging markets are hurting right now for a  number of global factors. China is one of them. The risk of trade war is  one of them, either directly or through China. But then U.S. fed policies  and fiscal policy, (inaudible), higher, longer and short rates, stronger  dollar, and a stronger dollar means a lower dollar price of commodity. So  these are the global factors that all EM are facing. But China were to  react to the risk of a trade war by boosting domestic demand and  maintaining its own economic growth closer to their 6.5% target, and  recently, actually, they're growing faster in 6.5%, then that's going to be  a backstop for emerging markets. So, of course, if China were to go to a  hard landing, then that's going to hurt emerging markets, but also the  U.S., Europe and the world economy. But in my view, China have still some  of the policy tools to manage that economic slowdown.</p><p> KEENE: I saw Ambassador Hormats yesterday, Robert Hormats, he was an  assistant of Secretary Clinton. And there is someone with a certain set of  views. And I think of someone he works for, Dr. Kissinger, or Robert  Kaplan, who has my book of the summer, writing about China and the Pacific  Rim. All of that is a neo-realist view. What's the neo-realist response to  a president who wants to put on layers of taxes called tariffs?</p><p> ROUBINI: Well, the Chinese know that, effectively, by imposing these  tariffs on China, they'll increase the cost of lots of goods up to $500  billion that used by U.S. consumers. And the fact that, for example, they  may introduce for September 10 and push it 25% on January 1st, is they  don't want to have a (inaudible) shock for consumers during the holiday as  well.</p><p> KEENE: Right. I don't mean to interrupt you but this is critical. This is  Roubini 101 at Stern School New York University. Are we able to say that  within all this mumbo-jumbo, a tariff is a tax on an American consumer? Is  that a safe statement?</p><p> ROUBINI: Yes, it's absolutely true. Whenever you impose tariffs, you're  increasing the price on imports certainly for consumer products but also  for a variety of other intermediate products and the fact also the business  sector. But this first (inaudible) is a tax. And by the way, it's a very  regressive tax because those kinds of consumer goods that we buy from China  are usually bought at Walmart and other types of firms and they're bought  by lower income individuals. So not only the tax but it's an extremely  regressive tax.</p><p> KEENE: And this is important, Francine, with you in Milan. I mean, the  bottom line here is this is not a tax on Gucci, is it?</p><p> LACQUA: Well, let me ask Nouriel. Away from Gucci, is this a tax that could  actually plunge the U.S. into a recession in the next 18 months?</p><p> ROUBINI: No. I don't think that that alone is going to plunge the U.S. into  a recession, even if my prediction that a variety of other factors can push  the U.S. into a recession by 2020, monetary policy, fiscal policy, the  trade war, other frictions, what's happening with the rest of the world,  but certainly I think that people underestimate the impact of this trade  war on the economy because they say the trade impacts directly, indirectly,  are too small to matter. That's not true because, first of all, you have  retaliation. And as long as you have retaliation, the impact is bigger.  Secondly is that tax on consumer that uses disposable income, it's going to  slowdown consumption. Three, it's going to affect both business and  consumer confidence. In addition, it's going to push down, emerging markets  are going to hurt them, it's going to push down the price of commodity. And  finally, they're going to have an effect only also on investor's  confidence. If the stock market in China has gone down 20% this year under  the threat of trade wars, in fact, later in the summer, the U.S. market was  going down as well. So there's going to be a generalized trade war, not 50  billion, but it's going to be 500 billion and there's going to be a  retaliation, there's going to be other things, there's going to be a bigger  impact. And right now, this is not just a trade war. The U.S. is going to  impose restriction on inward FDI (ph) into the U.S. by China to outward FDI  (ph) by United States firms, they want to have all U.S. firms getting out  of China, they're going to have global supply chains, technology transfer  and so on and so on. So this is not just about trading goods. It's about  technology, it's about IP, it's about FDI (ph), inward and outward, and  you're going to roll, this is going to become de-globalized, it's going to  become Volckanized, in which these frictions are going to have a negative  stagflationary impact of reducing growth and increasing inflation globally.  That's the danger of this trade war.</p><p> LACQUA: All right. Well, that gets us started certainly. Nouriel Roubini  there of Roubini Macro Associates stays with us.</p><p> Well I'm pleased to be joined by Corrado Passera. He is SPAXS' Chief  Executive Officer and Founder, former Italian Minister of Economic  Development and, for almost a decade, the Chief Executive of one of Italy's  biggest bank. Still with us in New York, Nouriel Roubini of Roubini Macro  Associates. So thank you for sticking around, Nouriel. Welcome to the  program, Corrado Passera. When you look at Italy, there was a lot of  anxiousness out there in the market over the summer. Do you think now  investors concerned have been delayed (ph) because actually this  government, like any Italian government, needs the markets?</p><p> CORRADO PASSERA, CEO &amp; FOUNDER, SPAXS: Absolutely. And anxiety was  justified because of some of the announcements that were made in the first  weeks after the creation of the government. But even today, the statements  or the announcements that Tria made were the right ones because he talked  about growth and growth through investment, increased the investment both  public and private, that's the key word in my opinion, and he said very  clearly, we will stick to our commitment in terms of debt reduction. So  growth, investment, commitments on debt is the combination of things that  markets expect. Then we will look at the stability now in the details but  these three main announcements are good ones.</p><p> LACQUA: Is there a discount to Italian banks because of the political  situation? You're actually starting a challenger bank. It's a niche bank  that actually tries to lend to SME.</p><p> PASSERA: Challenger and niche are two concepts that probably do not convey  the right message because niche means small and it's not the kind of --</p><p> LACQUA: So for now, that's all.</p><p> PASSERA: The bank is small but the market is really booming and then  (inaudible) need for financing with SMEs is very big. On the other side,  challenger gives the right the message but we want to be -- we will be a  special event. I mean, we want to do only a number things, three asset  lines with SMEs that are very interesting, profitable and useful project  for the country. And we will do it in a totally new paradigm way. So it's - - at the end, it's a challenge to others. But in a number of ways, we will  also collaborate with the incumbents because we will buy guilty (ph) piece  unlikely to pay, we will buy NPLs, we will manage to help second tier SMEs  that have potential to grow, so it's more than that.</p><p> LACQUA: Okay. You didn't answer my question on Italian banks. I'll come to  you in a second.</p><p> PASSERA: Yes. No, you're right.</p><p> LACQUA: But actually, Nouriel, what's your take overall on Italian banks  and the Italian GDP? Should we worry about it, so like Mr. (inaudible)  tells us or should markets remain cool about it?</p><p> ROUBINI: Well, there is some positive about Italy is that the market  constraints in E.U. are going to force them to keep the budget deficit for  the next year around the current level as a share of GDP. That's the  positive. And euro membership is not on the table, so they have been  controlled and contained by market discipline. However, spread in Italian  debt are still 250 basis points, first of all, the economy is slowing down  very sharply. And even if they want to maintain the deficit at around 2% of  GDP, it's going to be problematic because they want to spend more and cut  taxes by 1%, they don't know how they're going to finance it, they might  fudge it by making estimates about growth for next year too high, 1.6, when  market estimates are more like 0.8. And many of their policies are leading  to a reduction of potential growth rather than an increase of potential  growth, reverse in the reform of pension, restricting the labor market  flexibility and so on and so on. So actual growth is falling, potential  growth is falling, real rates are high or even before the ECB has ended up  QE and the loosening of the primary balance implies that it's going to be  very hard for them to stabilize the debt ratio and reduce it. It might go  higher. And therefore, Italy is still on a knife edge situation from an  economic point of view. And there is still political risk. Salvini is  popular. And after the budget, the law is passed, it might go to election,  that's going to create more uncertainty. So in the short run, I don't think  that the spreads are going to widen, things are going to stabilize given  their fiscal commitment, but Italy is facing a number of economic, fiscal  and financial challenges over the next couple of years.</p><p> KEENE: Nouriel, I want to explain this distinction. Mariana Mazzucato and  Kenneth Rogoff sat right where you're sitting five or six days ago. And  sometimes the body language -- and Jason, bring it in here, the body  language we see on camera, like if I'm like this, I'm like really board and  then you sit up straight and listen. Ken Rogoff sat up straight when the  topic was Italy. Why is a guy like Ken Rogoff totally focused on Italy?</p><p> ROUBINI: Well, it's not just Ken Rogoff, it's also the markets. When -- a  couple of weeks ago, Salvini and Di Maio said, we're going to increase the  deficit from two to three. The spread suddenly overnight went from 250 to  over 300 and they flip-flopped in 24 hours. And they sided then to say, no,  we're going to stick to the E.U. rules.</p><p> KEENE: (Inaudible) is that the heritage of Italy is that the adjacency of  Italy on the Bloomberg screen, it's a G7 country. Why the focus on Italy?</p><p> ROUBINI: Well, Italy has now become, for the first time, a country run by  populists, Italian debt is 135% of GDP and is the largest debt in absolute  terms after U.S. and Japan in the world economy. Greece could be built out  by (inaudible) program was, after all, only needs _200 billion public debt  problem, Italy is 2.3 trillion public debt problem. So Italy is too big to  fail but also too big to be saved. There is no (inaudible) program, they  could backstop Italy if Italy goes in the wrong direction. Therefore, Italy  is systemic for Italy for Eurozone, if Italy were to leave, there will be a  systemic shock to the Eurozone and then it could be a threat to the global  economy. That's why people are interested in Italy.</p><p> KEENE: Francine?</p><p> LACQUA: Right. Yes. And, Nouriel, I would go a step further and saying this  is not an obsession on Italy, it's also an obsession with Italian banks. If  there's a problem with Italian banks, do the markets actually discount them  and forget sometimes all of the work that's done on non-performing loans  over the last three years?</p><p> PASSERA: Nouriel is right in listing the risks and banks obviously are  short of proxy over the old countries. So if all the wrong things are done,  that we will have troubles. But I don't expect all the wrong things will be  done. We all know that the so-called government contract, the two coalition  parties have agreed upon -- it's not feasible and it will be implemented,  in my opinion, only partially and only gradually. Having said that, banks,  banks have gone through at least three main crisis, the financial asset  crisis reasonably well managed, the credit asset crisis and we are  digesting, we are getting out of it. I mean, NPLs and UTPs are still an  important component of our asset balance sheets but they are being deluded.  We had a number of single bank crisis, some of them very, very bad ones,  but they're now sold, partially paid by the tax payers but are now gone.  And now, we are going through the more structural transformation, reshaping  of the industry, because digital technologies regulation, the entrance by  big tech companies in the credit world and monetary policies are making the  traditional business models very unsustainable. But new winners are coming  in that area.</p><p> LACQUA: Okay. But do we need a banking consolidation in Italy? It's almost  difficult to deny that actually Italy is not overbanked?</p><p> PASSERA: No, it's not overbanked but --</p><p> LACQUA: But it's not overbanked.</p><p> PASSERA: It's not overbanked in a sense that we will have a new mix of  players in the next years. Small and medium-sized banks are too generic and  too traditional to sustain the competition will get out of the market for  sure, and some of them to consolidation. Some of the big ones will keep  investing in innovation and they will be players. Some entrance from other  industries will be players. But we will certainly -- we can expect a number  of specialty players, new paradigm kind of players in terms of business  system to enter the market. And so market will change a lot. In terms of  consolidation, Italy has been one of the countries that have consolidated  the most. I mean, take, for example, Germany, I mean, much more than  Germany. And now with the law that has been passed on Popolare and Rural  (inaudible) cooperative banks, 300 of them will become free. So at the end,  we will be landing (ph) around 100, that the steel is a large number. But  compared with the 1,800 banks in Germany, I mean, it shows that we have  done a good part of the road ahead.</p><p> LACQUA: Nouriel, do you think we'll see a banking union in our lifetime and  will that help with consolidation?</p><p> ROUBINI: Well, I fear that for time being, there is not going to be a full  banking union in the Eurozone, even a proposal for a common deposit  insurance scheme in the Eurozone has been pushed back by Germany. Germany  fears that risk sharing is re-shifting and a fiscal union effectively  becomes like a transfer union. And given now there are political  uncertainties in Italy, Germany is pushing back even the (inaudible) the  proposals of Macron have not been accepted. They push them from June to  December, then there'll be E.U. parliamentary election. And therefore, any  agenda about finalizing the banking union and increasing the element of  risk sharing is not going to happen until Germany and other parts of the  north (ph) are going to have more security about what's happening in Italy  and the periphery Eurozone.</p><p> KEENE: Nouriel, let's continue here. Nouriel Roubini with us in New York.  And we thank Corrado Passera in Milan.</p><p> It is one thing to talk about immigrants for we are all immigrants, there  is actually the generational doing of it. One person that knows this call  (ph) is Nouriel Roubini of Roubini Macro Associates and, of course, New  York University, one of the world's acclaimed international economist. And  now, he'll speak with where he started out, Istanbul in Turkey. How long  were you in Istanbul for, a cup of coffee?</p><p> ROUBINI: Well, I was born there. And this time, I was there for about a  week. I went to Istanbul, I went to Ankara, I saw the news on policymakers  and so on. So -- and I was there right at that time when the currency was  plunging from (inaudible).</p><p> KEENE: Is it traditional economics? Is it Irving Fisher economics where,  right now, the currency links right in the interest rates links, right into  inflation and shows potential dampened GDP and frankly crisis?</p><p> ROUBINI: Yes, there is a severe risk of a balance of payment in crisis over  a sudden stop of capital, the huge amount of dollar that especially in the  banking system, that corporate sector. And, of course, going from three to  five to seven, I was around 6.3, implies a massive negative balance sheet  affects on the corporate and the financial sector. That's why actually the  currency is not leading the fall of the currency to an economic stimulus.  If anything, the economy now is going into a recession. The latest economic  data suggested that Turkey is going to have a credit crunch, it's going to  enter a recession by probably the third quarter of this year. So you have  the impact of the currency depreciation with dollar debt is contractioning  rather than being expansionary, it leads to higher inflation. It forces the  central bank to hike rates, finally, they have shown some independence. But  monetary tightening is not sufficient because you have massive fiscal --  cause a fiscal and credit stimulus in the economy that led to overheating  for him to win the election, and therefore, now they have to tighten also  credit fiscal and quasi fiscal policy. But they have a regional election  next March. And therefore, they want to avoid the recession because they  want to win those important local elections, and therefore, they're not  tightening the fiscal and credit range as much as they should.</p><p> LACQUA: Right. So, Nouriel, what will it take to put Turkey on a more  stable footing? It seems that the central bank actually did a lot and yet  investors aren't convinced?</p><p> ROUBINI: Well, in Argentina the policy red (ph) were pushed to 60% with  inflation slightly above the one of Turkey. In Turkey, finally, they pushed  them from 17% towards 24%. That's a positive especially because the signal  to the central bank is now slightly more independent even if Erdogan, the  president, keeps on attacking the central banks and the interest will lobby  (ph). But as I pointed out, you have massive imbalances both internal on  the fiscal side and the savings and the spending of the private sector and  external with very large current account deficit. Therefore, you need  monetary tightening, probably more because inflation is going to rise,  fiscal tightening and credit tightening. What that implies, you have to  accept a recession. The (inaudible) is already going into a recession by  the time where politically his support is deriving by having strong  economic growth and you have an election coming next spring. So I don't  think they're going to be doing enough because if they're doing enough,  they're going to plunge the economy into a recession, that this point is  unavoidable. And therefore, the weakening of the currency is going to  continue to occur even after this monetary tightening, and we've seen it in  the last couple of days. So the currency is weakening (inaudible), and  there are political uncertainties as well. So they're not doing enough.  Argentina, what that means is promising enough and the currency has still  weakened. Turkey is not even promising to do what's necessary.</p><p> LACQUA: So how do you find the floor in Turkish lira? Do you assume that it  just continues falling until a politically -- I guess, the ruling class  accepts that they could go into a recession?</p><p> ROUBINI: Yes. First of all, inflation is going to go higher given the  currency of the depreciation, so even 24% rate is not enough. They'll have  to tighten more as inflation goes higher. And as I say, the main imbalances  are not just on the monetary side but fiscal for the fiscal and credit, and  that slowdown has not occurred. They have promised a fiscal tightening, it  has not occurred. And politically, for them, accepting a recession is going  to be very painful and they're going to try to kick the can down the road  at least until March of next year, until after those elections. Given that  situation, I think the currency can weaken in nominal and real term even if  it has fallen significantly. It can fall more if inflation gets higher. So  I don't see yet the bottom for the Turkish lira.</p><p> KEENE: Okay. Nouriel, I want to talk about this right now because a lot of  people say, what's the big deal with Nouriel Roubini? Here's why Nouriel  Roubini is famous, going back to 2005 and 2007, we'll drive it forward.  This is a fancy physics question which is sinusoidal function, a sign way  (ph) function. And what Nouriel Roubini is famous for is his A right here,  which is the amplitude of a given wave. And, Nouriel, this goes back to  2006, which was the amplitude of the crisis that everybody underestimated.  Is that where we are right now where we really don't understand the  amplitudes of Turkey, the amplitudes of Argentina or frankly the amplitudes  that could have come out of this trade year?</p><p> ROUBINI: Yes, we don't know it because we don't know what the policy  responses are going to be in Turkey and Argentina. Therefore, the market,  given the uncertainty, they tend to overreact and there're overshooting of  prices. In a case of the trade war, that was 50, then 200, now, they are  saying, 267, and that's not going to be just rates. Their technology for a  large investment could be a global trade war, it could be a de- globalization.</p><p> KEENE: Because of time, Nouriel, it's a critical question, and do you  overlay a new kind of shadow banking where we all underestimate the A in  that equation, the amplitude of a potential shock. (Inaudible) the shadow  banking right now?</p><p> ROUBINI: Well, the shadow banking in China is in serious trouble. They  tried to rein it in but (inaudible) shadow banking in the global financial  system. People say the banks now have more liquidity, less leverage and  more capital, yes. But a lot of financial transactions have gone in the  shadow banking system globally, that have been rising. Leverage has been  rising. And therefore, we're always fighting the last war. The last war was  the banks were the problem. This time around, it might be the rest of the  capital markets, it could be the shadow banking system certainly in China  but even in the United States. You have algo trading, you have all these  credit funds that are open-ended and are illiquid, you have a variety of  things like the market makers are not there, they're not warehousing, the  broker-dealers are not doing those activities. Those are sources of  illiquidity and amplification of economic and financial shock over time.</p><p> KEENE: And not only, Nouriel, that but the dollarization which maybe we'll  have time to get. Nouriel Roubini with us, Roubini Macro Associates, Tom  Keene in New York, Francine Lacqua in Milan, for your briefing coast to  coast and indeed worldwide.</p><p> Let's do that with a brilliant essay, Rosa &amp; Roubini writing in project  syndicate. The space for fiscal stimulus is already limited by a massive  public debt. Mr. Kudlow didn't want to talk about that yesterday. Unlike in  2008, when governments had the policy tools needed to prevent a free fall,  the policymakers who much confront the next downturn will have their hands  tied while overall debt levels are higher than during the previous crisis.  This is a surprising essay, Nouriel Roubini. Why will the policymakers have  their hands tied? I thought regulators were doing a great job.</p><p> ROUBINI: Well, on fiscal policy, we're running now another $2 trillion  fiscal deficit over the next ten years. So when the likes of a recession  comes, higher deficit, and that implies we don't have room to do stimulus.  The fed is not going to have much headroom even if we reach to 75 before  the next recession. Typically, you have 500, 600 basis points. So they're  going to go to zero, forward guidance is not going to be enough. And doing  quantitative is easing is going to be more difficult. And then the  political willingness to backstop the banks our corporates are not going to  be there. There's a populist backlash and many countries in the world are  at insolvent (ph) governments, so they can't even bail out their own firms  even if they want to. So all the policy tools are going to be much more  constrained next time around in a world in which overall debt levels are  higher.</p><p> KEENE: Of these menu of items, the one that is immediate is yesterday, Mr.  Kudlow made very clear that he believes that you can grow your way out of a  deficit. He cited not once but twice in his conversation at the Economic  Club of New York that they've already modeled out new Trumpian growth that  will bring in taxes to pay the deficit. I know you don't buy that. I didn't  think the audience bought as well. Push against the idea that you can grow  your way out of a deficit. What does history tell us?</p><p> ROUBINI: Well, it's good economics. Reagan tried it, Bush tried it. And  this time around, look at the latest number. The deficit since last year  has already, in August, doubled. And it's going to double because you have  to $2 trillion budget deficit. Next year, we're going to have a budget  deficit that is going to be overall $1 trillion. The deficit (inaudible) to  the public $1 trillion per year for them as far as the eye can see. So it's  totally good economics. Of course, it cut taxes, there is some short room  in growth but they're going to be minimal, the the CBO (ph) estimates over  a decade 0.1% increase in GDP level, okay. That is nothing as close to  zero. Then a fiscal drag to the effect on long-term, short rates in the  dollar, there will be a crowding out of that growth. And to contain it,  then they have to increase rapidly taxes on the household sectors starting  in 2024. So there will be a massive drag starting then but there will be  already fiscal drag in 2020. The economy is going now three rather than two  because this year and next year, there's a fiscal stimulus. By 2020, that  still becomes a small fiscal drag. So not only are we going to go from  three to two, we're going to go below two, we're going to go towards 1.8.  So it's an artificial fiscal stimulus, unsustainable, peace time, first  time ever, during and after a recession, and it's going to crowd out  economic growth overtime.</p><p> LACQUA: What does that mean for yields, Nouriel, treasury yields?</p><p> ROUBINI: Well, overtime, the combination of the U.S. monetary policy and  the fed tightening and this fiscal stimulus implies that long-term interest  rates have gone higher and they're going to keep on going higher. Now, what  keeps the lead right now on long-term trades in the U.S. is that while the  fed controls the short end of the yield curve, ECB, BOJ and other central  banks are controlling the long-term of the yield curve because there is  still unconventional policies in other parts of the world. But guess what,  the ECB decided we're going to finish QE and then start normalizing rate  next year. Other central banks in Europe are going to do the same thing.  Therefore, global liquidity is going to start to shrink. And therefore,  once that happens, and you still have the stimulus, U.S. long-term interest  rates are going to tend to go higher, (inaudible) is going higher, the  dollar is going to strengthen, the current account deficit is going to  become higher, and therefore, the crowding by late next year of that  economic recovery into a fiscal drag in 2020 into a tightening by the fed  towards 3.5%. And they have to go towards 3.5% because the fiscal stimulus  leads to an overheating of the economy. And that tighter fiscal policy and  tighter monetary policy could plunge the economy into a stall by 2020 if  you add the trade frictions, the capital market frictions. In fact,  there'll be a slowdown in emerging market, in Europe, in China, and, in  fact, that asset prices, as you know, are frothy. Profit and P ratios are  50% higher than the historical average. So when the markets see the  slowdown occurring to 2020, there will be market correction and that's  going to have a negative world effect. So you might have by 2020 a perfect  storm for the U.S. and the global economy.</p><p> LACQUA: Okay. Will the central bank have enough tools to deal with this  perfect storm if we were to have it by 2020?</p><p> ROUBINI: I think there are differences this time around, is that we are  having policies that are stagflationary that reduce growth but also  increase inflation. For the last decade, all the shocks were  stagflationary, meaning lower growth and lower inflation, and therefore,  central banks were doing even more in doubling down on more unconventional  policies. But if you're going to have trade restriction, if you are going  to have a restriction to capital flows, you're going to have a restriction  to FDI and technology transfers, if you're going to have a restriction  migration, if you're not going to invest into renewable resources, if  you're not going to invest into renewable resources, if you're not going to  invest into infrastructure and there's no plan. All those shocks are  stagflationary, are going to release (ph) growth, are going to force  inflation higher. And when that happens when the economy is overheating,  that's going to force the fed to hike more faster and sooner rather than  ease (ph), as it happens whenever you've had a policy shock that they have  been stagflationary, like the oil (ph) shock, '73, '79, '99. Because if you  don't tighten, inflation expectation go higher and then you're in the worst  situation. So the type of policy that is going to be followed by the U.S.  are going to imply force and effect to have to tighten rather than ease,  even if growth slows down, because inflation and inflation expectations are  going to go to higher. That's a difference in the ability and willingness  of the fed and other central to react to that economic slowdown. It's  driven by negative supply side shocks.</p><p> LACQUA: All right. Thank you so much for all of the insights. Nouriel  Roubini there of Roubini Macro Associates, he stays with us.</p><p> KEENE: Right now, let's look at something we've avoided with Nouriel  Roubini this morning, we're going to do it, we're going to dive in for a  quick comment. Copper looks lousy. Right now, Dr. Roubini, Dr. Copper, this  is just a textbook depressed commodity chart (inaudible) teach in one of  your sessions in NYU, Nouriel. This should be a lead chart. What does it  signal that we're seeing this dampening in something like copper?</p><p> ROUBINI: Well, it signals that there is a potential slowdown in the global  economy signal.</p><p> KEENE: You take it right over to GDP?</p><p> ROUBINI: Yes. Emerging markets are slowing down, China will have to  slowdown, and whether there's a correlation between the value of the dollar  and the dollar prices of commodities, when the dollar is stronger, the  dollar price of commodity tends to fall. So I would say, the weakening in  copper is an ominous signal. And I would say also the increase in oil  prices is an ominous signal because it's like a negative supply side shock  to the global economy and that drives in the oil prices, it's not driven by  demand growth but it's driven by the fact that the sanction on Iran right  now are equivalent to a supply side shock, like it's happening in the  previous episode. So that's even is a negative. Usually higher oil prices  implies strong global growth. In this case, it's driven by a supply shock  rather than (inaudible) shock so it's a negative for global growth.</p><p> KEENE: This has been wonderful and congratulations on your essay with Mr.  Rosa in Project Syndicate. I'll get that out on social, folks. I really  recommend that. It's a thought-provoking view forward looking back to the  Lehman crisis. Nouriel Roubini, of course, with Roubini Macro Associates as  well.</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: And there is no one better to do that with  Nouriel Roubini of New York University. Professor Roubini as acclaimed  getting upfront of the crisis of 2007, I personally did that with him in  Davos at one point in '05 or '06. And I'm thrilled to have Nouriel here on  this important day. Let bring up from Enda Curran in Hong Kong a chart  which is great because it's hard to read. I really mean that. It's hard to  read this chart. Bring it up right now on radio. It is a massive  disproportion of U.S. imports of China's stuff versus what they take from  us. Here we are with the tariffs here, the tariffs there and China is just  tiny, tiny, tiny. Professor Roubini, this is the arch-imbalance of  President Trump's certitude. I heard this from Lawrence Kudlow yesterday at  the economic club of New York. They speak of us as equals in trade dynamics  or not, are we?</p><p>NOURIEL ROUBINI, CHAIRMAN &amp; PROFESSOR, ROUBINI MACRO ASSOCIATES NYU STERN  SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: We're not equal in terms of trade dynamics but has many  other ways to retaliate. Of course, they've only 130 billion of imports  from the U.S. while the U.S. imports from China more than 500 billion. But  let's not forget that the U.S. firms, whether Apple, Gem (ph), hundreds of  others, have done hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign direct  investment in China. In the past, when China (inaudible) with Japan or  Korea, they took action against these foreign investments, and therefore,  they can retaliate and they're going to start doing it in many different  ways. China can also retaliate by letting its currency weaken. Renminbi has  already fallen at 8%. And then there's the nuclear option of dumping U.S.  treasury, and I don't think that's likely. So the idea that there's an  imbalance and China cannot retaliate, I think, is actually the wrong  argument.</p><p>KEENE: Your heritage of being born in Istanbul, have studied in Milan,  studied with Jeff Sax at Harvard, your international sense, your old world  sense, is a study of how China will react. Jonathan Spence 101 at Yale  University, how would you presume that China will react to this approach by  Mr. Trump?</p><p>ROUBINI: First of all, the Chinese can be flexible. They need to do reforms  and some of the reforms (inaudible) upper hand. But China and President Xi  Jinping cannot lose face (ph). And what happens is that United States is  starting not just a trade war with China but geopolitically wants to  contain China. China is never giving up on its own Made in China 2025  program, for example. And therefore, the risk is that if you try to contain  China, China is going to become actually more aggressive and less  cooperative. And I think that's what's going to likely happen. They're  going to retaliate in many different ways. So this is going to be  counterproductive.</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: (Inaudible) from Milan, do we  underestimate the dangers of a Chinese GDP that is slowing down or even  does the size of shadow banking in China?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, there has been a slowdown in China. But every time there is  excessive slowdown after a tightening of monetary, fiscal and credit  policy, there is an easing of monetary, credit, fiscal policy. China has  not ran out of tools, yet there has been a significant correction of the  stock market, 25% but the world effect is small. Yes, default rates have  gone up because they are reducing leverage and align more flexibility. But  that's manageable. And the currency weakening actually is occurring right  now and their capital controls has not (inaudible) in 2015 and '16. And  that actually helps China. If their currency goes down by 8%, the U.S.  imposes tariffs on 10% is a bit of a wash in terms of their  competitiveness. So China has the macroeconomic policy tools to manage its  own slowdown. Of course, China, so far, has kicked the can down the road  and not dealing with too much and too fast enough with the issues of  overcapacity, overleverage and debt, but China is going to do it gradually.  And China is going to take the long-term view. China is going to be in a  long-term competition with the United States once Mao was allegedly asked  what he thought of the French Revolution, he said, too early to tell. And  China takes an approach a decade longer. We have midterm election, we have  election ever two years, China has no elections, so they can take control  on their own policies and face and threaten the U.S. over the medium and  long-term. So they may win this war.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. But, Nouriel, I guess what I'm trying to get at is they do  have the tools to manage a slowdown. But if they only focus domestically on  what they need to do, do they let the emerging markets down and what does  that mean for markets overall?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, of course, the emerging markets are hurting right now for a  number of global factors. China is one of them. The risk of trade war is  one of them, either directly or through China. But then U.S. fed policies  and fiscal policy, (inaudible), higher, longer and short rates, stronger  dollar, and a stronger dollar means a lower dollar price of commodity. So  these are the global factors that all EM are facing. But China were to  react to the risk of a trade war by boosting domestic demand and  maintaining its own economic growth closer to their 6.5% target, and  recently, actually, they're growing faster in 6.5%, then that's going to be  a backstop for emerging markets. So, of course, if China were to go to a  hard landing, then that's going to hurt emerging markets, but also the  U.S., Europe and the world economy. But in my view, China have still some  of the policy tools to manage that economic slowdown.</p><p>KEENE: I saw Ambassador Hormats yesterday, Robert Hormats, he was an  assistant of Secretary Clinton. And there is someone with a certain set of  views. And I think of someone he works for, Dr. Kissinger, or Robert  Kaplan, who has my book of the summer, writing about China and the Pacific  Rim. All of that is a neo-realist view. What's the neo-realist response to  a president who wants to put on layers of taxes called tariffs?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, the Chinese know that, effectively, by imposing these  tariffs on China, they'll increase the cost of lots of goods up to $500  billion that used by U.S. consumers. And the fact that, for example, they  may introduce for September 10 and push it 25% on January 1st, is they  don't want to have a (inaudible) shock for consumers during the holiday as  well.</p><p>KEENE: Right. I don't mean to interrupt you but this is critical. This is  Roubini 101 at Stern School New York University. Are we able to say that  within all this mumbo-jumbo, a tariff is a tax on an American consumer? Is  that a safe statement?</p><p>ROUBINI: Yes, it's absolutely true. Whenever you impose tariffs, you're  increasing the price on imports certainly for consumer products but also  for a variety of other intermediate products and the fact also the business  sector. But this first (inaudible) is a tax. And by the way, it's a very  regressive tax because those kinds of consumer goods that we buy from China  are usually bought at Walmart and other types of firms and they're bought  by lower income individuals. So not only the tax but it's an extremely  regressive tax.</p><p>KEENE: And this is important, Francine, with you in Milan. I mean, the  bottom line here is this is not a tax on Gucci, is it?</p><p>LACQUA: Well, let me ask Nouriel. Away from Gucci, is this a tax that could  actually plunge the U.S. into a recession in the next 18 months?</p><p>ROUBINI: No. I don't think that that alone is going to plunge the U.S. into  a recession, even if my prediction that a variety of other factors can push  the U.S. into a recession by 2020, monetary policy, fiscal policy, the  trade war, other frictions, what's happening with the rest of the world,  but certainly I think that people underestimate the impact of this trade  war on the economy because they say the trade impacts directly, indirectly,  are too small to matter. That's not true because, first of all, you have  retaliation. And as long as you have retaliation, the impact is bigger.  Secondly is that tax on consumer that uses disposable income, it's going to  slowdown consumption. Three, it's going to affect both business and  consumer confidence. In addition, it's going to push down, emerging markets  are going to hurt them, it's going to push down the price of commodity. And  finally, they're going to have an effect only also on investor's  confidence. If the stock market in China has gone down 20% this year under  the threat of trade wars, in fact, later in the summer, the U.S. market was  going down as well. So there's going to be a generalized trade war, not 50  billion, but it's going to be 500 billion and there's going to be a  retaliation, there's going to be other things, there's going to be a bigger  impact. And right now, this is not just a trade war. The U.S. is going to  impose restriction on inward FDI (ph) into the U.S. by China to outward FDI  (ph) by United States firms, they want to have all U.S. firms getting out  of China, they're going to have global supply chains, technology transfer  and so on and so on. So this is not just about trading goods. It's about  technology, it's about IP, it's about FDI (ph), inward and outward, and  you're going to roll, this is going to become de-globalized, it's going to  become Volckanized, in which these frictions are going to have a negative  stagflationary impact of reducing growth and increasing inflation globally.  That's the danger of this trade war.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Well, that gets us started certainly. Nouriel Roubini  there of Roubini Macro Associates stays with us.</p><p>Well I'm pleased to be joined by Corrado Passera. He is SPAXS' Chief  Executive Officer and Founder, former Italian Minister of Economic  Development and, for almost a decade, the Chief Executive of one of Italy's  biggest bank. Still with us in New York, Nouriel Roubini of Roubini Macro  Associates. So thank you for sticking around, Nouriel. Welcome to the  program, Corrado Passera. When you look at Italy, there was a lot of  anxiousness out there in the market over the summer. Do you think now  investors concerned have been delayed (ph) because actually this  government, like any Italian government, needs the markets?</p><p>CORRADO PASSERA, CEO &amp; FOUNDER, SPAXS: Absolutely. And anxiety was  justified because of some of the announcements that were made in the first  weeks after the creation of the government. But even today, the statements  or the announcements that Tria made were the right ones because he talked  about growth and growth through investment, increased the investment both  public and private, that's the key word in my opinion, and he said very  clearly, we will stick to our commitment in terms of debt reduction. So  growth, investment, commitments on debt is the combination of things that  markets expect. Then we will look at the stability now in the details but  these three main announcements are good ones.</p><p>LACQUA: Is there a discount to Italian banks because of the political  situation? You're actually starting a challenger bank. It's a niche bank  that actually tries to lend to SME.</p><p>PASSERA: Challenger and niche are two concepts that probably do not convey  the right message because niche means small and it's not the kind of --</p><p>LACQUA: So for now, that's all.</p><p>PASSERA: The bank is small but the market is really booming and then  (inaudible) need for financing with SMEs is very big. On the other side,  challenger gives the right the message but we want to be -- we will be a  special event. I mean, we want to do only a number things, three asset  lines with SMEs that are very interesting, profitable and useful project  for the country. And we will do it in a totally new paradigm way. So it's - - at the end, it's a challenge to others. But in a number of ways, we will  also collaborate with the incumbents because we will buy guilty (ph) piece  unlikely to pay, we will buy NPLs, we will manage to help second tier SMEs  that have potential to grow, so it's more than that.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. You didn't answer my question on Italian banks. I'll come to  you in a second.</p><p>PASSERA: Yes. No, you're right.</p><p>LACQUA: But actually, Nouriel, what's your take overall on Italian banks  and the Italian GDP? Should we worry about it, so like Mr. (inaudible)  tells us or should markets remain cool about it?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, there is some positive about Italy is that the market  constraints in E.U. are going to force them to keep the budget deficit for  the next year around the current level as a share of GDP. That's the  positive. And euro membership is not on the table, so they have been  controlled and contained by market discipline. However, spread in Italian  debt are still 250 basis points, first of all, the economy is slowing down  very sharply. And even if they want to maintain the deficit at around 2% of  GDP, it's going to be problematic because they want to spend more and cut  taxes by 1%, they don't know how they're going to finance it, they might  fudge it by making estimates about growth for next year too high, 1.6, when  market estimates are more like 0.8. And many of their policies are leading  to a reduction of potential growth rather than an increase of potential  growth, reverse in the reform of pension, restricting the labor market  flexibility and so on and so on. So actual growth is falling, potential  growth is falling, real rates are high or even before the ECB has ended up  QE and the loosening of the primary balance implies that it's going to be  very hard for them to stabilize the debt ratio and reduce it. It might go  higher. And therefore, Italy is still on a knife edge situation from an  economic point of view. And there is still political risk. Salvini is  popular. And after the budget, the law is passed, it might go to election,  that's going to create more uncertainty. So in the short run, I don't think  that the spreads are going to widen, things are going to stabilize given  their fiscal commitment, but Italy is facing a number of economic, fiscal  and financial challenges over the next couple of years.</p><p>KEENE: Nouriel, I want to explain this distinction. Mariana Mazzucato and  Kenneth Rogoff sat right where you're sitting five or six days ago. And  sometimes the body language -- and Jason, bring it in here, the body  language we see on camera, like if I'm like this, I'm like really board and  then you sit up straight and listen. Ken Rogoff sat up straight when the  topic was Italy. Why is a guy like Ken Rogoff totally focused on Italy?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, it's not just Ken Rogoff, it's also the markets. When -- a  couple of weeks ago, Salvini and Di Maio said, we're going to increase the  deficit from two to three. The spread suddenly overnight went from 250 to  over 300 and they flip-flopped in 24 hours. And they sided then to say, no,  we're going to stick to the E.U. rules.</p><p>KEENE: (Inaudible) is that the heritage of Italy is that the adjacency of  Italy on the Bloomberg screen, it's a G7 country. Why the focus on Italy?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, Italy has now become, for the first time, a country run by  populists, Italian debt is 135% of GDP and is the largest debt in absolute  terms after U.S. and Japan in the world economy. Greece could be built out  by (inaudible) program was, after all, only needs _200 billion public debt  problem, Italy is 2.3 trillion public debt problem. So Italy is too big to  fail but also too big to be saved. There is no (inaudible) program, they  could backstop Italy if Italy goes in the wrong direction. Therefore, Italy  is systemic for Italy for Eurozone, if Italy were to leave, there will be a  systemic shock to the Eurozone and then it could be a threat to the global  economy. That's why people are interested in Italy.</p><p>KEENE: Francine?</p><p>LACQUA: Right. Yes. And, Nouriel, I would go a step further and saying this  is not an obsession on Italy, it's also an obsession with Italian banks. If  there's a problem with Italian banks, do the markets actually discount them  and forget sometimes all of the work that's done on non-performing loans  over the last three years?</p><p>PASSERA: Nouriel is right in listing the risks and banks obviously are  short of proxy over the old countries. So if all the wrong things are done,  that we will have troubles. But I don't expect all the wrong things will be  done. We all know that the so-called government contract, the two coalition  parties have agreed upon -- it's not feasible and it will be implemented,  in my opinion, only partially and only gradually. Having said that, banks,  banks have gone through at least three main crisis, the financial asset  crisis reasonably well managed, the credit asset crisis and we are  digesting, we are getting out of it. I mean, NPLs and UTPs are still an  important component of our asset balance sheets but they are being deluded.  We had a number of single bank crisis, some of them very, very bad ones,  but they're now sold, partially paid by the tax payers but are now gone.  And now, we are going through the more structural transformation, reshaping  of the industry, because digital technologies regulation, the entrance by  big tech companies in the credit world and monetary policies are making the  traditional business models very unsustainable. But new winners are coming  in that area.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. But do we need a banking consolidation in Italy? It's almost  difficult to deny that actually Italy is not overbanked?</p><p>PASSERA: No, it's not overbanked but --</p><p>LACQUA: But it's not overbanked.</p><p>PASSERA: It's not overbanked in a sense that we will have a new mix of  players in the next years. Small and medium-sized banks are too generic and  too traditional to sustain the competition will get out of the market for  sure, and some of them to consolidation. Some of the big ones will keep  investing in innovation and they will be players. Some entrance from other  industries will be players. But we will certainly -- we can expect a number  of specialty players, new paradigm kind of players in terms of business  system to enter the market. And so market will change a lot. In terms of  consolidation, Italy has been one of the countries that have consolidated  the most. I mean, take, for example, Germany, I mean, much more than  Germany. And now with the law that has been passed on Popolare and Rural  (inaudible) cooperative banks, 300 of them will become free. So at the end,  we will be landing (ph) around 100, that the steel is a large number. But  compared with the 1,800 banks in Germany, I mean, it shows that we have  done a good part of the road ahead.</p><p>LACQUA: Nouriel, do you think we'll see a banking union in our lifetime and  will that help with consolidation?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, I fear that for time being, there is not going to be a full  banking union in the Eurozone, even a proposal for a common deposit  insurance scheme in the Eurozone has been pushed back by Germany. Germany  fears that risk sharing is re-shifting and a fiscal union effectively  becomes like a transfer union. And given now there are political  uncertainties in Italy, Germany is pushing back even the (inaudible) the  proposals of Macron have not been accepted. They push them from June to  December, then there'll be E.U. parliamentary election. And therefore, any  agenda about finalizing the banking union and increasing the element of  risk sharing is not going to happen until Germany and other parts of the  north (ph) are going to have more security about what's happening in Italy  and the periphery Eurozone.</p><p>KEENE: Nouriel, let's continue here. Nouriel Roubini with us in New York.  And we thank Corrado Passera in Milan.</p><p>It is one thing to talk about immigrants for we are all immigrants, there  is actually the generational doing of it. One person that knows this call  (ph) is Nouriel Roubini of Roubini Macro Associates and, of course, New  York University, one of the world's acclaimed international economist. And  now, he'll speak with where he started out, Istanbul in Turkey. How long  were you in Istanbul for, a cup of coffee?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, I was born there. And this time, I was there for about a  week. I went to Istanbul, I went to Ankara, I saw the news on policymakers  and so on. So -- and I was there right at that time when the currency was  plunging from (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: Is it traditional economics? Is it Irving Fisher economics where,  right now, the currency links right in the interest rates links, right into  inflation and shows potential dampened GDP and frankly crisis?</p><p>ROUBINI: Yes, there is a severe risk of a balance of payment in crisis over  a sudden stop of capital, the huge amount of dollar that especially in the  banking system, that corporate sector. And, of course, going from three to  five to seven, I was around 6.3, implies a massive negative balance sheet  affects on the corporate and the financial sector. That's why actually the  currency is not leading the fall of the currency to an economic stimulus.  If anything, the economy now is going into a recession. The latest economic  data suggested that Turkey is going to have a credit crunch, it's going to  enter a recession by probably the third quarter of this year. So you have  the impact of the currency depreciation with dollar debt is contractioning  rather than being expansionary, it leads to higher inflation. It forces the  central bank to hike rates, finally, they have shown some independence. But  monetary tightening is not sufficient because you have massive fiscal --  cause a fiscal and credit stimulus in the economy that led to overheating  for him to win the election, and therefore, now they have to tighten also  credit fiscal and quasi fiscal policy. But they have a regional election  next March. And therefore, they want to avoid the recession because they  want to win those important local elections, and therefore, they're not  tightening the fiscal and credit range as much as they should.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. So, Nouriel, what will it take to put Turkey on a more  stable footing? It seems that the central bank actually did a lot and yet  investors aren't convinced?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, in Argentina the policy red (ph) were pushed to 60% with  inflation slightly above the one of Turkey. In Turkey, finally, they pushed  them from 17% towards 24%. That's a positive especially because the signal  to the central bank is now slightly more independent even if Erdogan, the  president, keeps on attacking the central banks and the interest will lobby  (ph). But as I pointed out, you have massive imbalances both internal on  the fiscal side and the savings and the spending of the private sector and  external with very large current account deficit. Therefore, you need  monetary tightening, probably more because inflation is going to rise,  fiscal tightening and credit tightening. What that implies, you have to  accept a recession. The (inaudible) is already going into a recession by  the time where politically his support is deriving by having strong  economic growth and you have an election coming next spring. So I don't  think they're going to be doing enough because if they're doing enough,  they're going to plunge the economy into a recession, that this point is  unavoidable. And therefore, the weakening of the currency is going to  continue to occur even after this monetary tightening, and we've seen it in  the last couple of days. So the currency is weakening (inaudible), and  there are political uncertainties as well. So they're not doing enough.  Argentina, what that means is promising enough and the currency has still  weakened. Turkey is not even promising to do what's necessary.</p><p>LACQUA: So how do you find the floor in Turkish lira? Do you assume that it  just continues falling until a politically -- I guess, the ruling class  accepts that they could go into a recession?</p><p>ROUBINI: Yes. First of all, inflation is going to go higher given the  currency of the depreciation, so even 24% rate is not enough. They'll have  to tighten more as inflation goes higher. And as I say, the main imbalances  are not just on the monetary side but fiscal for the fiscal and credit, and  that slowdown has not occurred. They have promised a fiscal tightening, it  has not occurred. And politically, for them, accepting a recession is going  to be very painful and they're going to try to kick the can down the road  at least until March of next year, until after those elections. Given that  situation, I think the currency can weaken in nominal and real term even if  it has fallen significantly. It can fall more if inflation gets higher. So  I don't see yet the bottom for the Turkish lira.</p><p>KEENE: Okay. Nouriel, I want to talk about this right now because a lot of  people say, what's the big deal with Nouriel Roubini? Here's why Nouriel  Roubini is famous, going back to 2005 and 2007, we'll drive it forward.  This is a fancy physics question which is sinusoidal function, a sign way  (ph) function. And what Nouriel Roubini is famous for is his A right here,  which is the amplitude of a given wave. And, Nouriel, this goes back to  2006, which was the amplitude of the crisis that everybody underestimated.  Is that where we are right now where we really don't understand the  amplitudes of Turkey, the amplitudes of Argentina or frankly the amplitudes  that could have come out of this trade year?</p><p>ROUBINI: Yes, we don't know it because we don't know what the policy  responses are going to be in Turkey and Argentina. Therefore, the market,  given the uncertainty, they tend to overreact and there're overshooting of  prices. In a case of the trade war, that was 50, then 200, now, they are  saying, 267, and that's not going to be just rates. Their technology for a  large investment could be a global trade war, it could be a de- globalization.</p><p>KEENE: Because of time, Nouriel, it's a critical question, and do you  overlay a new kind of shadow banking where we all underestimate the A in  that equation, the amplitude of a potential shock. (Inaudible) the shadow  banking right now?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, the shadow banking in China is in serious trouble. They  tried to rein it in but (inaudible) shadow banking in the global financial  system. People say the banks now have more liquidity, less leverage and  more capital, yes. But a lot of financial transactions have gone in the  shadow banking system globally, that have been rising. Leverage has been  rising. And therefore, we're always fighting the last war. The last war was  the banks were the problem. This time around, it might be the rest of the  capital markets, it could be the shadow banking system certainly in China  but even in the United States. You have algo trading, you have all these  credit funds that are open-ended and are illiquid, you have a variety of  things like the market makers are not there, they're not warehousing, the  broker-dealers are not doing those activities. Those are sources of  illiquidity and amplification of economic and financial shock over time.</p><p>KEENE: And not only, Nouriel, that but the dollarization which maybe we'll  have time to get. Nouriel Roubini with us, Roubini Macro Associates, Tom  Keene in New York, Francine Lacqua in Milan, for your briefing coast to  coast and indeed worldwide.</p><p>Let's do that with a brilliant essay, Rosa &amp; Roubini writing in project  syndicate. The space for fiscal stimulus is already limited by a massive  public debt. Mr. Kudlow didn't want to talk about that yesterday. Unlike in  2008, when governments had the policy tools needed to prevent a free fall,  the policymakers who much confront the next downturn will have their hands  tied while overall debt levels are higher than during the previous crisis.  This is a surprising essay, Nouriel Roubini. Why will the policymakers have  their hands tied? I thought regulators were doing a great job.</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, on fiscal policy, we're running now another $2 trillion  fiscal deficit over the next ten years. So when the likes of a recession  comes, higher deficit, and that implies we don't have room to do stimulus.  The fed is not going to have much headroom even if we reach to 75 before  the next recession. Typically, you have 500, 600 basis points. So they're  going to go to zero, forward guidance is not going to be enough. And doing  quantitative is easing is going to be more difficult. And then the  political willingness to backstop the banks our corporates are not going to  be there. There's a populist backlash and many countries in the world are  at insolvent (ph) governments, so they can't even bail out their own firms  even if they want to. So all the policy tools are going to be much more  constrained next time around in a world in which overall debt levels are  higher.</p><p>KEENE: Of these menu of items, the one that is immediate is yesterday, Mr.  Kudlow made very clear that he believes that you can grow your way out of a  deficit. He cited not once but twice in his conversation at the Economic  Club of New York that they've already modeled out new Trumpian growth that  will bring in taxes to pay the deficit. I know you don't buy that. I didn't  think the audience bought as well. Push against the idea that you can grow  your way out of a deficit. What does history tell us?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, it's good economics. Reagan tried it, Bush tried it. And  this time around, look at the latest number. The deficit since last year  has already, in August, doubled. And it's going to double because you have  to $2 trillion budget deficit. Next year, we're going to have a budget  deficit that is going to be overall $1 trillion. The deficit (inaudible) to  the public $1 trillion per year for them as far as the eye can see. So it's  totally good economics. Of course, it cut taxes, there is some short room  in growth but they're going to be minimal, the the CBO (ph) estimates over  a decade 0.1% increase in GDP level, okay. That is nothing as close to  zero. Then a fiscal drag to the effect on long-term, short rates in the  dollar, there will be a crowding out of that growth. And to contain it,  then they have to increase rapidly taxes on the household sectors starting  in 2024. So there will be a massive drag starting then but there will be  already fiscal drag in 2020. The economy is going now three rather than two  because this year and next year, there's a fiscal stimulus. By 2020, that  still becomes a small fiscal drag. So not only are we going to go from  three to two, we're going to go below two, we're going to go towards 1.8.  So it's an artificial fiscal stimulus, unsustainable, peace time, first  time ever, during and after a recession, and it's going to crowd out  economic growth overtime.</p><p>LACQUA: What does that mean for yields, Nouriel, treasury yields?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, overtime, the combination of the U.S. monetary policy and  the fed tightening and this fiscal stimulus implies that long-term interest  rates have gone higher and they're going to keep on going higher. Now, what  keeps the lead right now on long-term trades in the U.S. is that while the  fed controls the short end of the yield curve, ECB, BOJ and other central  banks are controlling the long-term of the yield curve because there is  still unconventional policies in other parts of the world. But guess what,  the ECB decided we're going to finish QE and then start normalizing rate  next year. Other central banks in Europe are going to do the same thing.  Therefore, global liquidity is going to start to shrink. And therefore,  once that happens, and you still have the stimulus, U.S. long-term interest  rates are going to tend to go higher, (inaudible) is going higher, the  dollar is going to strengthen, the current account deficit is going to  become higher, and therefore, the crowding by late next year of that  economic recovery into a fiscal drag in 2020 into a tightening by the fed  towards 3.5%. And they have to go towards 3.5% because the fiscal stimulus  leads to an overheating of the economy. And that tighter fiscal policy and  tighter monetary policy could plunge the economy into a stall by 2020 if  you add the trade frictions, the capital market frictions. In fact,  there'll be a slowdown in emerging market, in Europe, in China, and, in  fact, that asset prices, as you know, are frothy. Profit and P ratios are  50% higher than the historical average. So when the markets see the  slowdown occurring to 2020, there will be market correction and that's  going to have a negative world effect. So you might have by 2020 a perfect  storm for the U.S. and the global economy.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. Will the central bank have enough tools to deal with this  perfect storm if we were to have it by 2020?</p><p>ROUBINI: I think there are differences this time around, is that we are  having policies that are stagflationary that reduce growth but also  increase inflation. For the last decade, all the shocks were  stagflationary, meaning lower growth and lower inflation, and therefore,  central banks were doing even more in doubling down on more unconventional  policies. But if you're going to have trade restriction, if you are going  to have a restriction to capital flows, you're going to have a restriction  to FDI and technology transfers, if you're going to have a restriction  migration, if you're not going to invest into renewable resources, if  you're not going to invest into renewable resources, if you're not going to  invest into infrastructure and there's no plan. All those shocks are  stagflationary, are going to release (ph) growth, are going to force  inflation higher. And when that happens when the economy is overheating,  that's going to force the fed to hike more faster and sooner rather than  ease (ph), as it happens whenever you've had a policy shock that they have  been stagflationary, like the oil (ph) shock, '73, '79, '99. Because if you  don't tighten, inflation expectation go higher and then you're in the worst  situation. So the type of policy that is going to be followed by the U.S.  are going to imply force and effect to have to tighten rather than ease,  even if growth slows down, because inflation and inflation expectations are  going to go to higher. That's a difference in the ability and willingness  of the fed and other central to react to that economic slowdown. It's  driven by negative supply side shocks.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Thank you so much for all of the insights. Nouriel  Roubini there of Roubini Macro Associates, he stays with us.</p><p>KEENE: Right now, let's look at something we've avoided with Nouriel  Roubini this morning, we're going to do it, we're going to dive in for a  quick comment. Copper looks lousy. Right now, Dr. Roubini, Dr. Copper, this  is just a textbook depressed commodity chart (inaudible) teach in one of  your sessions in NYU, Nouriel. This should be a lead chart. What does it  signal that we're seeing this dampening in something like copper?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, it signals that there is a potential slowdown in the global  economy signal.</p><p>KEENE: You take it right over to GDP?</p><p>ROUBINI: Yes. Emerging markets are slowing down, China will have to  slowdown, and whether there's a correlation between the value of the dollar  and the dollar prices of commodities, when the dollar is stronger, the  dollar price of commodity tends to fall. So I would say, the weakening in  copper is an ominous signal. And I would say also the increase in oil  prices is an ominous signal because it's like a negative supply side shock  to the global economy and that drives in the oil prices, it's not driven by  demand growth but it's driven by the fact that the sanction on Iran right  now are equivalent to a supply side shock, like it's happening in the  previous episode. So that's even is a negative. Usually higher oil prices  implies strong global growth. In this case, it's driven by a supply shock  rather than (inaudible) shock so it's a negative for global growth.</p><p>KEENE: This has been wonderful and congratulations on your essay with Mr.  Rosa in Project Syndicate. I'll get that out on social, folks. I really  recommend that. It's a thought-provoking view forward looking back to the  Lehman crisis.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: And there is no one better to do that with Nouriel Roubini of New York University. Professor Roubini as acclaimed getting upfront of the crisis of 2007, I personally did that with him in Davos at one point in '05 or '06. And I'm thrilled to have Nouriel here on this important day. Let bring up from Enda Curran in Hong Kong a chart which is great because it's hard to read. I really mean that. It's hard to read this chart. Bring it up right now on radio. It is a massive disproportion of U.S. imports of China's stuff versus what they take from us. Here we are with the tariffs here, the tariffs there and China is just tiny, tiny, tiny. Professor Roubini, this is the arch-imbalance of President Trump's certitude. I heard this from Lawrence Kudlow yesterday at the economic club of New York. They speak of us as equals in trade dynamics or not, are we?</p><p>NOURIEL ROUBINI, CHAIRMAN &amp; PROFESSOR, ROUBINI MACRO ASSOCIATES NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: We're not equal in terms of trade dynamics but has many other ways to retaliate. Of course, they've only 130 billion of imports from the U.S. while the U.S. imports from China more than 500 billion. But let's not forget that the U.S. firms, whether Apple, Gem (ph), hundreds of others, have done hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign direct investment in China. In the past, when China (inaudible) with Japan or Korea, they took action against these foreign investments, and therefore, they can retaliate and they're going to start doing it in many different ways. China can also retaliate by letting its currency weaken. Renminbi has already fallen at 8%. And then there's the nuclear option of dumping U.S. treasury, and I don't think that's likely. So the idea that there's an imbalance and China cannot retaliate, I think, is actually the wrong argument.</p><p>KEENE: Your heritage of being born in Istanbul, have studied in Milan, studied with Jeff Sax at Harvard, your international sense, your old world sense, is a study of how China will react. Jonathan Spence 101 at Yale University, how would you presume that China will react to this approach by Mr. Trump?</p><p>ROUBINI: First of all, the Chinese can be flexible. They need to do reforms and some of the reforms (inaudible) upper hand. But China and President Xi Jinping cannot lose face (ph). And what happens is that United States is starting not just a trade war with China but geopolitically wants to contain China. China is never giving up on its own Made in China 2025 program, for example. And therefore, the risk is that if you try to contain China, China is going to become actually more aggressive and less cooperative. And I think that's what's going to likely happen. They're going to retaliate in many different ways. So this is going to be counterproductive.</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: (Inaudible) from Milan, do we underestimate the dangers of a Chinese GDP that is slowing down or even does the size of shadow banking in China?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, there has been a slowdown in China. But every time there is excessive slowdown after a tightening of monetary, fiscal and credit policy, there is an easing of monetary, credit, fiscal policy. China has not ran out of tools, yet there has been a significant correction of the stock market, 25% but the world effect is small. Yes, default rates have gone up because they are reducing leverage and align more flexibility. But that's manageable. And the currency weakening actually is occurring right now and their capital controls has not (inaudible) in 2015 and '16. And that actually helps China. If their currency goes down by 8%, the U.S. imposes tariffs on 10% is a bit of a wash in terms of their competitiveness. So China has the macroeconomic policy tools to manage its own slowdown. Of course, China, so far, has kicked the can down the road and not dealing with too much and too fast enough with the issues of overcapacity, overleverage and debt, but China is going to do it gradually. And China is going to take the long-term view. China is going to be in a long-term competition with the United States once Mao was allegedly asked what he thought of the French Revolution, he said, too early to tell. And China takes an approach a decade longer. We have midterm election, we have election ever two years, China has no elections, so they can take control on their own policies and face and threaten the U.S. over the medium and long-term. So they may win this war.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. But, Nouriel, I guess what I'm trying to get at is they do have the tools to manage a slowdown. But if they only focus domestically on what they need to do, do they let the emerging markets down and what does that mean for markets overall?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, of course, the emerging markets are hurting right now for a number of global factors. China is one of them. The risk of trade war is one of them, either directly or through China. But then U.S. fed policies and fiscal policy, (inaudible), higher, longer and short rates, stronger dollar, and a stronger dollar means a lower dollar price of commodity. So these are the global factors that all EM are facing. But China were to react to the risk of a trade war by boosting domestic demand and maintaining its own economic growth closer to their 6.5% target, and recently, actually, they're growing faster in 6.5%, then that's going to be a backstop for emerging markets. So, of course, if China were to go to a hard landing, then that's going to hurt emerging markets, but also the U.S., Europe and the world economy. But in my view, China have still some of the policy tools to manage that economic slowdown.</p><p>KEENE: I saw Ambassador Hormats yesterday, Robert Hormats, he was an assistant of Secretary Clinton. And there is someone with a certain set of views. And I think of someone he works for, Dr. Kissinger, or Robert Kaplan, who has my book of the summer, writing about China and the Pacific Rim. All of that is a neo-realist view. What's the neo-realist response to a president who wants to put on layers of taxes called tariffs?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, the Chinese know that, effectively, by imposing these tariffs on China, they'll increase the cost of lots of goods up to $500 billion that used by U.S. consumers. And the fact that, for example, they may introduce for September 10 and push it 25% on January 1st, is they don't want to have a (inaudible) shock for consumers during the holiday as well.</p><p>KEENE: Right. I don't mean to interrupt you but this is critical. This is Roubini 101 at Stern School New York University. Are we able to say that within all this mumbo-jumbo, a tariff is a tax on an American consumer? Is that a safe statement?</p><p>ROUBINI: Yes, it's absolutely true. Whenever you impose tariffs, you're increasing the price on imports certainly for consumer products but also for a variety of other intermediate products and the fact also the business sector. But this first (inaudible) is a tax. And by the way, it's a very regressive tax because those kinds of consumer goods that we buy from China are usually bought at Walmart and other types of firms and they're bought by lower income individuals. So not only the tax but it's an extremely regressive tax.</p><p>KEENE: And this is important, Francine, with you in Milan. I mean, the bottom line here is this is not a tax on Gucci, is it?</p><p>LACQUA: Well, let me ask Nouriel. Away from Gucci, is this a tax that could actually plunge the U.S. into a recession in the next 18 months?</p><p>ROUBINI: No. I don't think that that alone is going to plunge the U.S. into a recession, even if my prediction that a variety of other factors can push the U.S. into a recession by 2020, monetary policy, fiscal policy, the trade war, other frictions, what's happening with the rest of the world, but certainly I think that people underestimate the impact of this trade war on the economy because they say the trade impacts directly, indirectly, are too small to matter. That's not true because, first of all, you have retaliation. And as long as you have retaliation, the impact is bigger. Secondly is that tax on consumer that uses disposable income, it's going to slowdown consumption. Three, it's going to affect both business and consumer confidence. In addition, it's going to push down, emerging markets are going to hurt them, it's going to push down the price of commodity. And finally, they're going to have an effect only also on investor's confidence. If the stock market in China has gone down 20% this year under the threat of trade wars, in fact, later in the summer, the U.S. market was going down as well. So there's going to be a generalized trade war, not 50 billion, but it's going to be 500 billion and there's going to be a retaliation, there's going to be other things, there's going to be a bigger impact. And right now, this is not just a trade war. The U.S. is going to impose restriction on inward FDI (ph) into the U.S. by China to outward FDI (ph) by United States firms, they want to have all U.S. firms getting out of China, they're going to have global supply chains, technology transfer and so on and so on. So this is not just about trading goods. It's about technology, it's about IP, it's about FDI (ph), inward and outward, and you're going to roll, this is going to become de-globalized, it's going to become Volckanized, in which these frictions are going to have a negative stagflationary impact of reducing growth and increasing inflation globally. That's the danger of this trade war.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Well, that gets us started certainly. Nouriel Roubini there of Roubini Macro Associates stays with us.</p><p>Well I'm pleased to be joined by Corrado Passera. He is SPAXS' Chief Executive Officer and Founder, former Italian Minister of Economic Development and, for almost a decade, the Chief Executive of one of Italy's biggest bank. Still with us in New York, Nouriel Roubini of Roubini Macro Associates. So thank you for sticking around, Nouriel. Welcome to the program, Corrado Passera. When you look at Italy, there was a lot of anxiousness out there in the market over the summer. Do you think now investors concerned have been delayed (ph) because actually this government, like any Italian government, needs the markets?</p><p>CORRADO PASSERA, CEO &amp; FOUNDER, SPAXS: Absolutely. And anxiety was justified because of some of the announcements that were made in the first weeks after the creation of the government. But even today, the statements or the announcements that Tria made were the right ones because he talked about growth and growth through investment, increased the investment both public and private, that's the key word in my opinion, and he said very clearly, we will stick to our commitment in terms of debt reduction. So growth, investment, commitments on debt is the combination of things that markets expect. Then we will look at the stability now in the details but these three main announcements are good ones.</p><p>LACQUA: Is there a discount to Italian banks because of the political situation? You're actually starting a challenger bank. It's a niche bank that actually tries to lend to SME.</p><p>PASSERA: Challenger and niche are two concepts that probably do not convey the right message because niche means small and it's not the kind of --</p><p>LACQUA: So for now, that's all.</p><p>PASSERA: The bank is small but the market is really booming and then (inaudible) need for financing with SMEs is very big. On the other side, challenger gives the right the message but we want to be -- we will be a special event. I mean, we want to do only a number things, three asset lines with SMEs that are very interesting, profitable and useful project for the country. And we will do it in a totally new paradigm way. So it's - - at the end, it's a challenge to others. But in a number of ways, we will also collaborate with the incumbents because we will buy guilty (ph) piece unlikely to pay, we will buy NPLs, we will manage to help second tier SMEs that have potential to grow, so it's more than that.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. You didn't answer my question on Italian banks. I'll come to you in a second.</p><p>PASSERA: Yes. No, you're right.</p><p>LACQUA: But actually, Nouriel, what's your take overall on Italian banks and the Italian GDP? Should we worry about it, so like Mr. (inaudible) tells us or should markets remain cool about it?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, there is some positive about Italy is that the market constraints in E.U. are going to force them to keep the budget deficit for the next year around the current level as a share of GDP. That's the positive. And euro membership is not on the table, so they have been controlled and contained by market discipline. However, spread in Italian debt are still 250 basis points, first of all, the economy is slowing down very sharply. And even if they want to maintain the deficit at around 2% of GDP, it's going to be problematic because they want to spend more and cut taxes by 1%, they don't know how they're going to finance it, they might fudge it by making estimates about growth for next year too high, 1.6, when market estimates are more like 0.8. And many of their policies are leading to a reduction of potential growth rather than an increase of potential growth, reverse in the reform of pension, restricting the labor market flexibility and so on and so on. So actual growth is falling, potential growth is falling, real rates are high or even before the ECB has ended up QE and the loosening of the primary balance implies that it's going to be very hard for them to stabilize the debt ratio and reduce it. It might go higher. And therefore, Italy is still on a knife edge situation from an economic point of view. And there is still political risk. Salvini is popular. And after the budget, the law is passed, it might go to election, that's going to create more uncertainty. So in the short run, I don't think that the spreads are going to widen, things are going to stabilize given their fiscal commitment, but Italy is facing a number of economic, fiscal and financial challenges over the next couple of years.</p><p>KEENE: Nouriel, I want to explain this distinction. Mariana Mazzucato and Kenneth Rogoff sat right where you're sitting five or six days ago. And sometimes the body language -- and Jason, bring it in here, the body language we see on camera, like if I'm like this, I'm like really board and then you sit up straight and listen. Ken Rogoff sat up straight when the topic was Italy. Why is a guy like Ken Rogoff totally focused on Italy?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, it's not just Ken Rogoff, it's also the markets. When -- a couple of weeks ago, Salvini and Di Maio said, we're going to increase the deficit from two to three. The spread suddenly overnight went from 250 to over 300 and they flip-flopped in 24 hours. And they sided then to say, no, we're going to stick to the E.U. rules.</p><p>KEENE: (Inaudible) is that the heritage of Italy is that the adjacency of Italy on the Bloomberg screen, it's a G7 country. Why the focus on Italy?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, Italy has now become, for the first time, a country run by populists, Italian debt is 135% of GDP and is the largest debt in absolute terms after U.S. and Japan in the world economy. Greece could be built out by (inaudible) program was, after all, only needs _200 billion public debt problem, Italy is 2.3 trillion public debt problem. So Italy is too big to fail but also too big to be saved. There is no (inaudible) program, they could backstop Italy if Italy goes in the wrong direction. Therefore, Italy is systemic for Italy for Eurozone, if Italy were to leave, there will be a systemic shock to the Eurozone and then it could be a threat to the global economy. That's why people are interested in Italy.</p><p>KEENE: Francine?</p><p>LACQUA: Right. Yes. And, Nouriel, I would go a step further and saying this is not an obsession on Italy, it's also an obsession with Italian banks. If there's a problem with Italian banks, do the markets actually discount them and forget sometimes all of the work that's done on non-performing loans over the last three years?</p><p>PASSERA: Nouriel is right in listing the risks and banks obviously are short of proxy over the old countries. So if all the wrong things are done, that we will have troubles. But I don't expect all the wrong things will be done. We all know that the so-called government contract, the two coalition parties have agreed upon -- it's not feasible and it will be implemented, in my opinion, only partially and only gradually. Having said that, banks, banks have gone through at least three main crisis, the financial asset crisis reasonably well managed, the credit asset crisis and we are digesting, we are getting out of it. I mean, NPLs and UTPs are still an important component of our asset balance sheets but they are being deluded. We had a number of single bank crisis, some of them very, very bad ones, but they're now sold, partially paid by the tax payers but are now gone. And now, we are going through the more structural transformation, reshaping of the industry, because digital technologies regulation, the entrance by big tech companies in the credit world and monetary policies are making the traditional business models very unsustainable. But new winners are coming in that area.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. But do we need a banking consolidation in Italy? It's almost difficult to deny that actually Italy is not overbanked?</p><p>PASSERA: No, it's not overbanked but --</p><p>LACQUA: But it's not overbanked.</p><p>PASSERA: It's not overbanked in a sense that we will have a new mix of players in the next years. Small and medium-sized banks are too generic and too traditional to sustain the competition will get out of the market for sure, and some of them to consolidation. Some of the big ones will keep investing in innovation and they will be players. Some entrance from other industries will be players. But we will certainly -- we can expect a number of specialty players, new paradigm kind of players in terms of business system to enter the market. And so market will change a lot. In terms of consolidation, Italy has been one of the countries that have consolidated the most. I mean, take, for example, Germany, I mean, much more than Germany. And now with the law that has been passed on Popolare and Rural (inaudible) cooperative banks, 300 of them will become free. So at the end, we will be landing (ph) around 100, that the steel is a large number. But compared with the 1,800 banks in Germany, I mean, it shows that we have done a good part of the road ahead.</p><p>LACQUA: Nouriel, do you think we'll see a banking union in our lifetime and will that help with consolidation?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, I fear that for time being, there is not going to be a full banking union in the Eurozone, even a proposal for a common deposit insurance scheme in the Eurozone has been pushed back by Germany. Germany fears that risk sharing is re-shifting and a fiscal union effectively becomes like a transfer union. And given now there are political uncertainties in Italy, Germany is pushing back even the (inaudible) the proposals of Macron have not been accepted. They push them from June to December, then there'll be E.U. parliamentary election. And therefore, any agenda about finalizing the banking union and increasing the element of risk sharing is not going to happen until Germany and other parts of the north (ph) are going to have more security about what's happening in Italy and the periphery Eurozone.</p><p>KEENE: Nouriel, let's continue here. Nouriel Roubini with us in New York. And we thank Corrado Passera in Milan.</p><p>It is one thing to talk about immigrants for we are all immigrants, there is actually the generational doing of it. One person that knows this call (ph) is Nouriel Roubini of Roubini Macro Associates and, of course, New York University, one of the world's acclaimed international economist. And now, he'll speak with where he started out, Istanbul in Turkey. How long were you in Istanbul for, a cup of coffee?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, I was born there. And this time, I was there for about a week. I went to Istanbul, I went to Ankara, I saw the news on policymakers and so on. So -- and I was there right at that time when the currency was plunging from (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: Is it traditional economics? Is it Irving Fisher economics where, right now, the currency links right in the interest rates links, right into inflation and shows potential dampened GDP and frankly crisis?</p><p>ROUBINI: Yes, there is a severe risk of a balance of payment in crisis over a sudden stop of capital, the huge amount of dollar that especially in the banking system, that corporate sector. And, of course, going from three to five to seven, I was around 6.3, implies a massive negative balance sheet affects on the corporate and the financial sector. That's why actually the currency is not leading the fall of the currency to an economic stimulus. If anything, the economy now is going into a recession. The latest economic data suggested that Turkey is going to have a credit crunch, it's going to enter a recession by probably the third quarter of this year. So you have the impact of the currency depreciation with dollar debt is contractioning rather than being expansionary, it leads to higher inflation. It forces the central bank to hike rates, finally, they have shown some independence. But monetary tightening is not sufficient because you have massive fiscal -- cause a fiscal and credit stimulus in the economy that led to overheating for him to win the election, and therefore, now they have to tighten also credit fiscal and quasi fiscal policy. But they have a regional election next March. And therefore, they want to avoid the recession because they want to win those important local elections, and therefore, they're not tightening the fiscal and credit range as much as they should.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. So, Nouriel, what will it take to put Turkey on a more stable footing? It seems that the central bank actually did a lot and yet investors aren't convinced?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, in Argentina the policy red (ph) were pushed to 60% with inflation slightly above the one of Turkey. In Turkey, finally, they pushed them from 17% towards 24%. That's a positive especially because the signal to the central bank is now slightly more independent even if Erdogan, the president, keeps on attacking the central banks and the interest will lobby (ph). But as I pointed out, you have massive imbalances both internal on the fiscal side and the savings and the spending of the private sector and external with very large current account deficit. Therefore, you need monetary tightening, probably more because inflation is going to rise, fiscal tightening and credit tightening. What that implies, you have to accept a recession. The (inaudible) is already going into a recession by the time where politically his support is deriving by having strong economic growth and you have an election coming next spring. So I don't think they're going to be doing enough because if they're doing enough, they're going to plunge the economy into a recession, that this point is unavoidable. And therefore, the weakening of the currency is going to continue to occur even after this monetary tightening, and we've seen it in the last couple of days. So the currency is weakening (inaudible), and there are political uncertainties as well. So they're not doing enough. Argentina, what that means is promising enough and the currency has still weakened. Turkey is not even promising to do what's necessary.</p><p>LACQUA: So how do you find the floor in Turkish lira? Do you assume that it just continues falling until a politically -- I guess, the ruling class accepts that they could go into a recession?</p><p>ROUBINI: Yes. First of all, inflation is going to go higher given the currency of the depreciation, so even 24% rate is not enough. They'll have to tighten more as inflation goes higher. And as I say, the main imbalances are not just on the monetary side but fiscal for the fiscal and credit, and that slowdown has not occurred. They have promised a fiscal tightening, it has not occurred. And politically, for them, accepting a recession is going to be very painful and they're going to try to kick the can down the road at least until March of next year, until after those elections. Given that situation, I think the currency can weaken in nominal and real term even if it has fallen significantly. It can fall more if inflation gets higher. So I don't see yet the bottom for the Turkish lira.</p><p>KEENE: Okay. Nouriel, I want to talk about this right now because a lot of people say, what's the big deal with Nouriel Roubini? Here's why Nouriel Roubini is famous, going back to 2005 and 2007, we'll drive it forward. This is a fancy physics question which is sinusoidal function, a sign way (ph) function. And what Nouriel Roubini is famous for is his A right here, which is the amplitude of a given wave. And, Nouriel, this goes back to 2006, which was the amplitude of the crisis that everybody underestimated. Is that where we are right now where we really don't understand the amplitudes of Turkey, the amplitudes of Argentina or frankly the amplitudes that could have come out of this trade year?</p><p>ROUBINI: Yes, we don't know it because we don't know what the policy responses are going to be in Turkey and Argentina. Therefore, the market, given the uncertainty, they tend to overreact and there're overshooting of prices. In a case of the trade war, that was 50, then 200, now, they are saying, 267, and that's not going to be just rates. Their technology for a large investment could be a global trade war, it could be a de- globalization.</p><p>KEENE: Because of time, Nouriel, it's a critical question, and do you overlay a new kind of shadow banking where we all underestimate the A in that equation, the amplitude of a potential shock. (Inaudible) the shadow banking right now?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, the shadow banking in China is in serious trouble. They tried to rein it in but (inaudible) shadow banking in the global financial system. People say the banks now have more liquidity, less leverage and more capital, yes. But a lot of financial transactions have gone in the shadow banking system globally, that have been rising. Leverage has been rising. And therefore, we're always fighting the last war. The last war was the banks were the problem. This time around, it might be the rest of the capital markets, it could be the shadow banking system certainly in China but even in the United States. You have algo trading, you have all these credit funds that are open-ended and are illiquid, you have a variety of things like the market makers are not there, they're not warehousing, the broker-dealers are not doing those activities. Those are sources of illiquidity and amplification of economic and financial shock over time.</p><p>KEENE: And not only, Nouriel, that but the dollarization which maybe we'll have time to get. Nouriel Roubini with us, Roubini Macro Associates, Tom Keene in New York, Francine Lacqua in Milan, for your briefing coast to coast and indeed worldwide.</p><p>Let's do that with a brilliant essay, Rosa &amp; Roubini writing in project syndicate. The space for fiscal stimulus is already limited by a massive public debt. Mr. Kudlow didn't want to talk about that yesterday. Unlike in 2008, when governments had the policy tools needed to prevent a free fall, the policymakers who much confront the next downturn will have their hands tied while overall debt levels are higher than during the previous crisis. This is a surprising essay, Nouriel Roubini. Why will the policymakers have their hands tied? I thought regulators were doing a great job.</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, on fiscal policy, we're running now another $2 trillion fiscal deficit over the next ten years. So when the likes of a recession comes, higher deficit, and that implies we don't have room to do stimulus. The fed is not going to have much headroom even if we reach to 75 before the next recession. Typically, you have 500, 600 basis points. So they're going to go to zero, forward guidance is not going to be enough. And doing quantitative is easing is going to be more difficult. And then the political willingness to backstop the banks our corporates are not going to be there. There's a populist backlash and many countries in the world are at insolvent (ph) governments, so they can't even bail out their own firms even if they want to. So all the policy tools are going to be much more constrained next time around in a world in which overall debt levels are higher.</p><p>KEENE: Of these menu of items, the one that is immediate is yesterday, Mr. Kudlow made very clear that he believes that you can grow your way out of a deficit. He cited not once but twice in his conversation at the Economic Club of New York that they've already modeled out new Trumpian growth that will bring in taxes to pay the deficit. I know you don't buy that. I didn't think the audience bought as well. Push against the idea that you can grow your way out of a deficit. What does history tell us?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, it's good economics. Reagan tried it, Bush tried it. And this time around, look at the latest number. The deficit since last year has already, in August, doubled. And it's going to double because you have to $2 trillion budget deficit. Next year, we're going to have a budget deficit that is going to be overall $1 trillion. The deficit (inaudible) to the public $1 trillion per year for them as far as the eye can see. So it's totally good economics. Of course, it cut taxes, there is some short room in growth but they're going to be minimal, the the CBO (ph) estimates over a decade 0.1% increase in GDP level, okay. That is nothing as close to zero. Then a fiscal drag to the effect on long-term, short rates in the dollar, there will be a crowding out of that growth. And to contain it, then they have to increase rapidly taxes on the household sectors starting in 2024. So there will be a massive drag starting then but there will be already fiscal drag in 2020. The economy is going now three rather than two because this year and next year, there's a fiscal stimulus. By 2020, that still becomes a small fiscal drag. So not only are we going to go from three to two, we're going to go below two, we're going to go towards 1.8. So it's an artificial fiscal stimulus, unsustainable, peace time, first time ever, during and after a recession, and it's going to crowd out economic growth overtime.</p><p>LACQUA: What does that mean for yields, Nouriel, treasury yields?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, overtime, the combination of the U.S. monetary policy and the fed tightening and this fiscal stimulus implies that long-term interest rates have gone higher and they're going to keep on going higher. Now, what keeps the lead right now on long-term trades in the U.S. is that while the fed controls the short end of the yield curve, ECB, BOJ and other central banks are controlling the long-term of the yield curve because there is still unconventional policies in other parts of the world. But guess what, the ECB decided we're going to finish QE and then start normalizing rate next year. Other central banks in Europe are going to do the same thing. Therefore, global liquidity is going to start to shrink. And therefore, once that happens, and you still have the stimulus, U.S. long-term interest rates are going to tend to go higher, (inaudible) is going higher, the dollar is going to strengthen, the current account deficit is going to become higher, and therefore, the crowding by late next year of that economic recovery into a fiscal drag in 2020 into a tightening by the fed towards 3.5%. And they have to go towards 3.5% because the fiscal stimulus leads to an overheating of the economy. And that tighter fiscal policy and tighter monetary policy could plunge the economy into a stall by 2020 if you add the trade frictions, the capital market frictions. In fact, there'll be a slowdown in emerging market, in Europe, in China, and, in fact, that asset prices, as you know, are frothy. Profit and P ratios are 50% higher than the historical average. So when the markets see the slowdown occurring to 2020, there will be market correction and that's going to have a negative world effect. So you might have by 2020 a perfect storm for the U.S. and the global economy.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. Will the central bank have enough tools to deal with this perfect storm if we were to have it by 2020?</p><p>ROUBINI: I think there are differences this time around, is that we are having policies that are stagflationary that reduce growth but also increase inflation. For the last decade, all the shocks were stagflationary, meaning lower growth and lower inflation, and therefore, central banks were doing even more in doubling down on more unconventional policies. But if you're going to have trade restriction, if you are going to have a restriction to capital flows, you're going to have a restriction to FDI and technology transfers, if you're going to have a restriction migration, if you're not going to invest into renewable resources, if you're not going to invest into renewable resources, if you're not going to invest into infrastructure and there's no plan. All those shocks are stagflationary, are going to release (ph) growth, are going to force inflation higher. And when that happens when the economy is overheating, that's going to force the fed to hike more faster and sooner rather than ease (ph), as it happens whenever you've had a policy shock that they have been stagflationary, like the oil (ph) shock, '73, '79, '99. Because if you don't tighten, inflation expectation go higher and then you're in the worst situation. So the type of policy that is going to be followed by the U.S. are going to imply force and effect to have to tighten rather than ease, even if growth slows down, because inflation and inflation expectations are going to go to higher. That's a difference in the ability and willingness of the fed and other central to react to that economic slowdown. It's driven by negative supply side shocks.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Thank you so much for all of the insights. Nouriel Roubini there of Roubini Macro Associates, he stays with us.</p><p>KEENE: Right now, let's look at something we've avoided with Nouriel Roubini this morning, we're going to do it, we're going to dive in for a quick comment. Copper looks lousy. Right now, Dr. Roubini, Dr. Copper, this is just a textbook depressed commodity chart (inaudible) teach in one of your sessions in NYU, Nouriel. This should be a lead chart. What does it signal that we're seeing this dampening in something like copper?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, it signals that there is a potential slowdown in the global economy signal.</p><p>KEENE: You take it right over to GDP?</p><p>ROUBINI: Yes. Emerging markets are slowing down, China will have to slowdown, and whether there's a correlation between the value of the dollar and the dollar prices of commodities, when the dollar is stronger, the dollar price of commodity tends to fall. So I would say, the weakening in copper is an ominous signal. And I would say also the increase in oil prices is an ominous signal because it's like a negative supply side shock to the global economy and that drives in the oil prices, it's not driven by demand growth but it's driven by the fact that the sanction on Iran right now are equivalent to a supply side shock, like it's happening in the previous episode. So that's even is a negative. Usually higher oil prices implies strong global growth. In this case, it's driven by a supply shock rather than (inaudible) shock so it's a negative for global growth.</p><p>KEENE: This has been wonderful and congratulations on your essay with Mr. Rosa in Project Syndicate. I'll get that out on social, folks. I really recommend that. It's a thought-provoking view forward looking back to the Lehman crisis. Nouriel Roubini, of course, with Roubini Macro Associates as well.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: And there is no one better to do that with Nouriel Roubini of New York University. Professor Roubini as acclaimed getting upfront of the crisis of 2007, I personally did that with him in Davos at one point in '05 or '06. And I'm thrilled to have Nouriel here on this important day. Let bring up from Enda Curran in Hong Kong a chart which is great because it's hard to read. I really mean that. It's hard to read this chart. Bring it up right now on radio. It is a massive disproportion of U.S. imports of China's stuff versus what they take from us. Here we are with the tariffs here, the tariffs there and China is just tiny, tiny, tiny. Professor Roubini, this is the arch-imbalance of President Trump's certitude. I heard this from Lawrence Kudlow yesterday at the economic club of New York. They speak of us as equals in trade dynamics or not, are we?</p><p>NOURIEL ROUBINI, CHAIRMAN &amp; PROFESSOR, ROUBINI MACRO ASSOCIATES NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: We're not equal in terms of trade dynamics but has many other ways to retaliate. Of course, they've only 130 billion of imports from the U.S. while the U.S. imports from China more than 500 billion. But let's not forget that the U.S. firms, whether Apple, Gem (ph), hundreds of others, have done hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign direct investment in China. In the past, when China (inaudible) with Japan or Korea, they took action against these foreign investments, and therefore, they can retaliate and they're going to start doing it in many different ways. China can also retaliate by letting its currency weaken. Renminbi has already fallen at 8%. And then there's the nuclear option of dumping U.S. treasury, and I don't think that's likely. So the idea that there's an imbalance and China cannot retaliate, I think, is actually the wrong argument.</p><p>KEENE: Your heritage of being born in Istanbul, have studied in Milan, studied with Jeff Sax at Harvard, your international sense, your old world sense, is a study of how China will react. Jonathan Spence 101 at Yale University, how would you presume that China will react to this approach by Mr. Trump?</p><p>ROUBINI: First of all, the Chinese can be flexible. They need to do reforms and some of the reforms (inaudible) upper hand. But China and President Xi Jinping cannot lose face (ph). And what happens is that United States is starting not just a trade war with China but geopolitically wants to contain China. China is never giving up on its own Made in China 2025 program, for example. And therefore, the risk is that if you try to contain China, China is going to become actually more aggressive and less cooperative. And I think that's what's going to likely happen. They're going to retaliate in many different ways. So this is going to be counterproductive.</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: (Inaudible) from Milan, do we underestimate the dangers of a Chinese GDP that is slowing down or even does the size of shadow banking in China?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, there has been a slowdown in China. But every time there is excessive slowdown after a tightening of monetary, fiscal and credit policy, there is an easing of monetary, credit, fiscal policy. China has not ran out of tools, yet there has been a significant correction of the stock market, 25% but the world effect is small. Yes, default rates have gone up because they are reducing leverage and align more flexibility. But that's manageable. And the currency weakening actually is occurring right now and their capital controls has not (inaudible) in 2015 and '16. And that actually helps China. If their currency goes down by 8%, the U.S. imposes tariffs on 10% is a bit of a wash in terms of their competitiveness. So China has the macroeconomic policy tools to manage its own slowdown. Of course, China, so far, has kicked the can down the road and not dealing with too much and too fast enough with the issues of overcapacity, overleverage and debt, but China is going to do it gradually. And China is going to take the long-term view. China is going to be in a long-term competition with the United States once Mao was allegedly asked what he thought of the French Revolution, he said, too early to tell. And China takes an approach a decade longer. We have midterm election, we have election ever two years, China has no elections, so they can take control on their own policies and face and threaten the U.S. over the medium and long-term. So they may win this war.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. But, Nouriel, I guess what I'm trying to get at is they do have the tools to manage a slowdown. But if they only focus domestically on what they need to do, do they let the emerging markets down and what does that mean for markets overall?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, of course, the emerging markets are hurting right now for a number of global factors. China is one of them. The risk of trade war is one of them, either directly or through China. But then U.S. fed policies and fiscal policy, (inaudible), higher, longer and short rates, stronger dollar, and a stronger dollar means a lower dollar price of commodity. So these are the global factors that all EM are facing. But China were to react to the risk of a trade war by boosting domestic demand and maintaining its own economic growth closer to their 6.5% target, and recently, actually, they're growing faster in 6.5%, then that's going to be a backstop for emerging markets. So, of course, if China were to go to a hard landing, then that's going to hurt emerging markets, but also the U.S., Europe and the world economy. But in my view, China have still some of the policy tools to manage that economic slowdown.</p><p>KEENE: I saw Ambassador Hormats yesterday, Robert Hormats, he was an assistant of Secretary Clinton. And there is someone with a certain set of views. And I think of someone he works for, Dr. Kissinger, or Robert Kaplan, who has my book of the summer, writing about China and the Pacific Rim. All of that is a neo-realist view. What's the neo-realist response to a president who wants to put on layers of taxes called tariffs?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, the Chinese know that, effectively, by imposing these tariffs on China, they'll increase the cost of lots of goods up to $500 billion that used by U.S. consumers. And the fact that, for example, they may introduce for September 10 and push it 25% on January 1st, is they don't want to have a (inaudible) shock for consumers during the holiday as well.</p><p>KEENE: Right. I don't mean to interrupt you but this is critical. This is Roubini 101 at Stern School New York University. Are we able to say that within all this mumbo-jumbo, a tariff is a tax on an American consumer? Is that a safe statement?</p><p>ROUBINI: Yes, it's absolutely true. Whenever you impose tariffs, you're increasing the price on imports certainly for consumer products but also for a variety of other intermediate products and the fact also the business sector. But this first (inaudible) is a tax. And by the way, it's a very regressive tax because those kinds of consumer goods that we buy from China are usually bought at Walmart and other types of firms and they're bought by lower income individuals. So not only the tax but it's an extremely regressive tax.</p><p>KEENE: And this is important, Francine, with you in Milan. I mean, the bottom line here is this is not a tax on Gucci, is it?</p><p>LACQUA: Well, let me ask Nouriel. Away from Gucci, is this a tax that could actually plunge the U.S. into a recession in the next 18 months?</p><p>ROUBINI: No. I don't think that that alone is going to plunge the U.S. into a recession, even if my prediction that a variety of other factors can push the U.S. into a recession by 2020, monetary policy, fiscal policy, the trade war, other frictions, what's happening with the rest of the world, but certainly I think that people underestimate the impact of this trade war on the economy because they say the trade impacts directly, indirectly, are too small to matter. That's not true because, first of all, you have retaliation. And as long as you have retaliation, the impact is bigger. Secondly is that tax on consumer that uses disposable income, it's going to slowdown consumption. Three, it's going to affect both business and consumer confidence. In addition, it's going to push down, emerging markets are going to hurt them, it's going to push down the price of commodity. And finally, they're going to have an effect only also on investor's confidence. If the stock market in China has gone down 20% this year under the threat of trade wars, in fact, later in the summer, the U.S. market was going down as well. So there's going to be a generalized trade war, not 50 billion, but it's going to be 500 billion and there's going to be a retaliation, there's going to be other things, there's going to be a bigger impact. And right now, this is not just a trade war. The U.S. is going to impose restriction on inward FDI (ph) into the U.S. by China to outward FDI (ph) by United States firms, they want to have all U.S. firms getting out of China, they're going to have global supply chains, technology transfer and so on and so on. So this is not just about trading goods. It's about technology, it's about IP, it's about FDI (ph), inward and outward, and you're going to roll, this is going to become de-globalized, it's going to become Volckanized, in which these frictions are going to have a negative stagflationary impact of reducing growth and increasing inflation globally. That's the danger of this trade war.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Well, that gets us started certainly. Nouriel Roubini there of Roubini Macro Associates stays with us.</p><p>Well I'm pleased to be joined by Corrado Passera. He is SPAXS' Chief Executive Officer and Founder, former Italian Minister of Economic Development and, for almost a decade, the Chief Executive of one of Italy's biggest bank. Still with us in New York, Nouriel Roubini of Roubini Macro Associates. So thank you for sticking around, Nouriel. Welcome to the program, Corrado Passera. When you look at Italy, there was a lot of anxiousness out there in the market over the summer. Do you think now investors concerned have been delayed (ph) because actually this government, like any Italian government, needs the markets?</p><p>CORRADO PASSERA, CEO &amp; FOUNDER, SPAXS: Absolutely. And anxiety was justified because of some of the announcements that were made in the first weeks after the creation of the government. But even today, the statements or the announcements that Tria made were the right ones because he talked about growth and growth through investment, increased the investment both public and private, that's the key word in my opinion, and he said very clearly, we will stick to our commitment in terms of debt reduction. So growth, investment, commitments on debt is the combination of things that markets expect. Then we will look at the stability now in the details but these three main announcements are good ones.</p><p>LACQUA: Is there a discount to Italian banks because of the political situation? You're actually starting a challenger bank. It's a niche bank that actually tries to lend to SME.</p><p>PASSERA: Challenger and niche are two concepts that probably do not convey the right message because niche means small and it's not the kind of --</p><p>LACQUA: So for now, that's all.</p><p>PASSERA: The bank is small but the market is really booming and then (inaudible) need for financing with SMEs is very big. On the other side, challenger gives the right the message but we want to be -- we will be a special event. I mean, we want to do only a number things, three asset lines with SMEs that are very interesting, profitable and useful project for the country. And we will do it in a totally new paradigm way. So it's - - at the end, it's a challenge to others. But in a number of ways, we will also collaborate with the incumbents because we will buy guilty (ph) piece unlikely to pay, we will buy NPLs, we will manage to help second tier SMEs that have potential to grow, so it's more than that.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. You didn't answer my question on Italian banks. I'll come to you in a second.</p><p>PASSERA: Yes. No, you're right.</p><p>LACQUA: But actually, Nouriel, what's your take overall on Italian banks and the Italian GDP? Should we worry about it, so like Mr. (inaudible) tells us or should markets remain cool about it?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, there is some positive about Italy is that the market constraints in E.U. are going to force them to keep the budget deficit for the next year around the current level as a share of GDP. That's the positive. And euro membership is not on the table, so they have been controlled and contained by market discipline. However, spread in Italian debt are still 250 basis points, first of all, the economy is slowing down very sharply. And even if they want to maintain the deficit at around 2% of GDP, it's going to be problematic because they want to spend more and cut taxes by 1%, they don't know how they're going to finance it, they might fudge it by making estimates about growth for next year too high, 1.6, when market estimates are more like 0.8. And many of their policies are leading to a reduction of potential growth rather than an increase of potential growth, reverse in the reform of pension, restricting the labor market flexibility and so on and so on. So actual growth is falling, potential growth is falling, real rates are high or even before the ECB has ended up QE and the loosening of the primary balance implies that it's going to be very hard for them to stabilize the debt ratio and reduce it. It might go higher. And therefore, Italy is still on a knife edge situation from an economic point of view. And there is still political risk. Salvini is popular. And after the budget, the law is passed, it might go to election, that's going to create more uncertainty. So in the short run, I don't think that the spreads are going to widen, things are going to stabilize given their fiscal commitment, but Italy is facing a number of economic, fiscal and financial challenges over the next couple of years.</p><p>KEENE: Nouriel, I want to explain this distinction. Mariana Mazzucato and Kenneth Rogoff sat right where you're sitting five or six days ago. And sometimes the body language -- and Jason, bring it in here, the body language we see on camera, like if I'm like this, I'm like really board and then you sit up straight and listen. Ken Rogoff sat up straight when the topic was Italy. Why is a guy like Ken Rogoff totally focused on Italy?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, it's not just Ken Rogoff, it's also the markets. When -- a couple of weeks ago, Salvini and Di Maio said, we're going to increase the deficit from two to three. The spread suddenly overnight went from 250 to over 300 and they flip-flopped in 24 hours. And they sided then to say, no, we're going to stick to the E.U. rules.</p><p>KEENE: (Inaudible) is that the heritage of Italy is that the adjacency of Italy on the Bloomberg screen, it's a G7 country. Why the focus on Italy?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, Italy has now become, for the first time, a country run by populists, Italian debt is 135% of GDP and is the largest debt in absolute terms after U.S. and Japan in the world economy. Greece could be built out by (inaudible) program was, after all, only needs _200 billion public debt problem, Italy is 2.3 trillion public debt problem. So Italy is too big to fail but also too big to be saved. There is no (inaudible) program, they could backstop Italy if Italy goes in the wrong direction. Therefore, Italy is systemic for Italy for Eurozone, if Italy were to leave, there will be a systemic shock to the Eurozone and then it could be a threat to the global economy. That's why people are interested in Italy.</p><p>KEENE: Francine?</p><p>LACQUA: Right. Yes. And, Nouriel, I would go a step further and saying this is not an obsession on Italy, it's also an obsession with Italian banks. If there's a problem with Italian banks, do the markets actually discount them and forget sometimes all of the work that's done on non-performing loans over the last three years?</p><p>PASSERA: Nouriel is right in listing the risks and banks obviously are short of proxy over the old countries. So if all the wrong things are done, that we will have troubles. But I don't expect all the wrong things will be done. We all know that the so-called government contract, the two coalition parties have agreed upon -- it's not feasible and it will be implemented, in my opinion, only partially and only gradually. Having said that, banks, banks have gone through at least three main crisis, the financial asset crisis reasonably well managed, the credit asset crisis and we are digesting, we are getting out of it. I mean, NPLs and UTPs are still an important component of our asset balance sheets but they are being deluded. We had a number of single bank crisis, some of them very, very bad ones, but they're now sold, partially paid by the tax payers but are now gone. And now, we are going through the more structural transformation, reshaping of the industry, because digital technologies regulation, the entrance by big tech companies in the credit world and monetary policies are making the traditional business models very unsustainable. But new winners are coming in that area.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. But do we need a banking consolidation in Italy? It's almost difficult to deny that actually Italy is not overbanked?</p><p>PASSERA: No, it's not overbanked but --</p><p>LACQUA: But it's not overbanked.</p><p>PASSERA: It's not overbanked in a sense that we will have a new mix of players in the next years. Small and medium-sized banks are too generic and too traditional to sustain the competition will get out of the market for sure, and some of them to consolidation. Some of the big ones will keep investing in innovation and they will be players. Some entrance from other industries will be players. But we will certainly -- we can expect a number of specialty players, new paradigm kind of players in terms of business system to enter the market. And so market will change a lot. In terms of consolidation, Italy has been one of the countries that have consolidated the most. I mean, take, for example, Germany, I mean, much more than Germany. And now with the law that has been passed on Popolare and Rural (inaudible) cooperative banks, 300 of them will become free. So at the end, we will be landing (ph) around 100, that the steel is a large number. But compared with the 1,800 banks in Germany, I mean, it shows that we have done a good part of the road ahead.</p><p>LACQUA: Nouriel, do you think we'll see a banking union in our lifetime and will that help with consolidation?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, I fear that for time being, there is not going to be a full banking union in the Eurozone, even a proposal for a common deposit insurance scheme in the Eurozone has been pushed back by Germany. Germany fears that risk sharing is re-shifting and a fiscal union effectively becomes like a transfer union. And given now there are political uncertainties in Italy, Germany is pushing back even the (inaudible) the proposals of Macron have not been accepted. They push them from June to December, then there'll be E.U. parliamentary election. And therefore, any agenda about finalizing the banking union and increasing the element of risk sharing is not going to happen until Germany and other parts of the north (ph) are going to have more security about what's happening in Italy and the periphery Eurozone.</p><p>KEENE: Nouriel, let's continue here. Nouriel Roubini with us in New York. And we thank Corrado Passera in Milan.</p><p>It is one thing to talk about immigrants for we are all immigrants, there is actually the generational doing of it. One person that knows this call (ph) is Nouriel Roubini of Roubini Macro Associates and, of course, New York University, one of the world's acclaimed international economist. And now, he'll speak with where he started out, Istanbul in Turkey. How long were you in Istanbul for, a cup of coffee?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, I was born there. And this time, I was there for about a week. I went to Istanbul, I went to Ankara, I saw the news on policymakers and so on. So -- and I was there right at that time when the currency was plunging from (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: Is it traditional economics? Is it Irving Fisher economics where, right now, the currency links right in the interest rates links, right into inflation and shows potential dampened GDP and frankly crisis?</p><p>ROUBINI: Yes, there is a severe risk of a balance of payment in crisis over a sudden stop of capital, the huge amount of dollar that especially in the banking system, that corporate sector. And, of course, going from three to five to seven, I was around 6.3, implies a massive negative balance sheet affects on the corporate and the financial sector. That's why actually the currency is not leading the fall of the currency to an economic stimulus. If anything, the economy now is going into a recession. The latest economic data suggested that Turkey is going to have a credit crunch, it's going to enter a recession by probably the third quarter of this year. So you have the impact of the currency depreciation with dollar debt is contractioning rather than being expansionary, it leads to higher inflation. It forces the central bank to hike rates, finally, they have shown some independence. But monetary tightening is not sufficient because you have massive fiscal -- cause a fiscal and credit stimulus in the economy that led to overheating for him to win the election, and therefore, now they have to tighten also credit fiscal and quasi fiscal policy. But they have a regional election next March. And therefore, they want to avoid the recession because they want to win those important local elections, and therefore, they're not tightening the fiscal and credit range as much as they should.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. So, Nouriel, what will it take to put Turkey on a more stable footing? It seems that the central bank actually did a lot and yet investors aren't convinced?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, in Argentina the policy red (ph) were pushed to 60% with inflation slightly above the one of Turkey. In Turkey, finally, they pushed them from 17% towards 24%. That's a positive especially because the signal to the central bank is now slightly more independent even if Erdogan, the president, keeps on attacking the central banks and the interest will lobby (ph). But as I pointed out, you have massive imbalances both internal on the fiscal side and the savings and the spending of the private sector and external with very large current account deficit. Therefore, you need monetary tightening, probably more because inflation is going to rise, fiscal tightening and credit tightening. What that implies, you have to accept a recession. The (inaudible) is already going into a recession by the time where politically his support is deriving by having strong economic growth and you have an election coming next spring. So I don't think they're going to be doing enough because if they're doing enough, they're going to plunge the economy into a recession, that this point is unavoidable. And therefore, the weakening of the currency is going to continue to occur even after this monetary tightening, and we've seen it in the last couple of days. So the currency is weakening (inaudible), and there are political uncertainties as well. So they're not doing enough. Argentina, what that means is promising enough and the currency has still weakened. Turkey is not even promising to do what's necessary.</p><p>LACQUA: So how do you find the floor in Turkish lira? Do you assume that it just continues falling until a politically -- I guess, the ruling class accepts that they could go into a recession?</p><p>ROUBINI: Yes. First of all, inflation is going to go higher given the currency of the depreciation, so even 24% rate is not enough. They'll have to tighten more as inflation goes higher. And as I say, the main imbalances are not just on the monetary side but fiscal for the fiscal and credit, and that slowdown has not occurred. They have promised a fiscal tightening, it has not occurred. And politically, for them, accepting a recession is going to be very painful and they're going to try to kick the can down the road at least until March of next year, until after those elections. Given that situation, I think the currency can weaken in nominal and real term even if it has fallen significantly. It can fall more if inflation gets higher. So I don't see yet the bottom for the Turkish lira.</p><p>KEENE: Okay. Nouriel, I want to talk about this right now because a lot of people say, what's the big deal with Nouriel Roubini? Here's why Nouriel Roubini is famous, going back to 2005 and 2007, we'll drive it forward. This is a fancy physics question which is sinusoidal function, a sign way (ph) function. And what Nouriel Roubini is famous for is his A right here, which is the amplitude of a given wave. And, Nouriel, this goes back to 2006, which was the amplitude of the crisis that everybody underestimated. Is that where we are right now where we really don't understand the amplitudes of Turkey, the amplitudes of Argentina or frankly the amplitudes that could have come out of this trade year?</p><p>ROUBINI: Yes, we don't know it because we don't know what the policy responses are going to be in Turkey and Argentina. Therefore, the market, given the uncertainty, they tend to overreact and there're overshooting of prices. In a case of the trade war, that was 50, then 200, now, they are saying, 267, and that's not going to be just rates. Their technology for a large investment could be a global trade war, it could be a de- globalization.</p><p>KEENE: Because of time, Nouriel, it's a critical question, and do you overlay a new kind of shadow banking where we all underestimate the A in that equation, the amplitude of a potential shock. (Inaudible) the shadow banking right now?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, the shadow banking in China is in serious trouble. They tried to rein it in but (inaudible) shadow banking in the global financial system. People say the banks now have more liquidity, less leverage and more capital, yes. But a lot of financial transactions have gone in the shadow banking system globally, that have been rising. Leverage has been rising. And therefore, we're always fighting the last war. The last war was the banks were the problem. This time around, it might be the rest of the capital markets, it could be the shadow banking system certainly in China but even in the United States. You have algo trading, you have all these credit funds that are open-ended and are illiquid, you have a variety of things like the market makers are not there, they're not warehousing, the broker-dealers are not doing those activities. Those are sources of illiquidity and amplification of economic and financial shock over time.</p><p>KEENE: And not only, Nouriel, that but the dollarization which maybe we'll have time to get. Nouriel Roubini with us, Roubini Macro Associates, Tom Keene in New York, Francine Lacqua in Milan, for your briefing coast to coast and indeed worldwide.</p><p>Let's do that with a brilliant essay, Rosa &amp; Roubini writing in project syndicate. The space for fiscal stimulus is already limited by a massive public debt. Mr. Kudlow didn't want to talk about that yesterday. Unlike in 2008, when governments had the policy tools needed to prevent a free fall, the policymakers who much confront the next downturn will have their hands tied while overall debt levels are higher than during the previous crisis. This is a surprising essay, Nouriel Roubini. Why will the policymakers have their hands tied? I thought regulators were doing a great job.</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, on fiscal policy, we're running now another $2 trillion fiscal deficit over the next ten years. So when the likes of a recession comes, higher deficit, and that implies we don't have room to do stimulus. The fed is not going to have much headroom even if we reach to 75 before the next recession. Typically, you have 500, 600 basis points. So they're going to go to zero, forward guidance is not going to be enough. And doing quantitative is easing is going to be more difficult. And then the political willingness to backstop the banks our corporates are not going to be there. There's a populist backlash and many countries in the world are at insolvent (ph) governments, so they can't even bail out their own firms even if they want to. So all the policy tools are going to be much more constrained next time around in a world in which overall debt levels are higher.</p><p>KEENE: Of these menu of items, the one that is immediate is yesterday, Mr. Kudlow made very clear that he believes that you can grow your way out of a deficit. He cited not once but twice in his conversation at the Economic Club of New York that they've already modeled out new Trumpian growth that will bring in taxes to pay the deficit. I know you don't buy that. I didn't think the audience bought as well. Push against the idea that you can grow your way out of a deficit. What does history tell us?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, it's good economics. Reagan tried it, Bush tried it. And this time around, look at the latest number. The deficit since last year has already, in August, doubled. And it's going to double because you have to $2 trillion budget deficit. Next year, we're going to have a budget deficit that is going to be overall $1 trillion. The deficit (inaudible) to the public $1 trillion per year for them as far as the eye can see. So it's totally good economics. Of course, it cut taxes, there is some short room in growth but they're going to be minimal, the the CBO (ph) estimates over a decade 0.1% increase in GDP level, okay. That is nothing as close to zero. Then a fiscal drag to the effect on long-term, short rates in the dollar, there will be a crowding out of that growth. And to contain it, then they have to increase rapidly taxes on the household sectors starting in 2024. So there will be a massive drag starting then but there will be already fiscal drag in 2020. The economy is going now three rather than two because this year and next year, there's a fiscal stimulus. By 2020, that still becomes a small fiscal drag. So not only are we going to go from three to two, we're going to go below two, we're going to go towards 1.8. So it's an artificial fiscal stimulus, unsustainable, peace time, first time ever, during and after a recession, and it's going to crowd out economic growth overtime.</p><p>LACQUA: What does that mean for yields, Nouriel, treasury yields?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, overtime, the combination of the U.S. monetary policy and the fed tightening and this fiscal stimulus implies that long-term interest rates have gone higher and they're going to keep on going higher. Now, what keeps the lead right now on long-term trades in the U.S. is that while the fed controls the short end of the yield curve, ECB, BOJ and other central banks are controlling the long-term of the yield curve because there is still unconventional policies in other parts of the world. But guess what, the ECB decided we're going to finish QE and then start normalizing rate next year. Other central banks in Europe are going to do the same thing. Therefore, global liquidity is going to start to shrink. And therefore, once that happens, and you still have the stimulus, U.S. long-term interest rates are going to tend to go higher, (inaudible) is going higher, the dollar is going to strengthen, the current account deficit is going to become higher, and therefore, the crowding by late next year of that economic recovery into a fiscal drag in 2020 into a tightening by the fed towards 3.5%. And they have to go towards 3.5% because the fiscal stimulus leads to an overheating of the economy. And that tighter fiscal policy and tighter monetary policy could plunge the economy into a stall by 2020 if you add the trade frictions, the capital market frictions. In fact, there'll be a slowdown in emerging market, in Europe, in China, and, in fact, that asset prices, as you know, are frothy. Profit and P ratios are 50% higher than the historical average. So when the markets see the slowdown occurring to 2020, there will be market correction and that's going to have a negative world effect. So you might have by 2020 a perfect storm for the U.S. and the global economy.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. Will the central bank have enough tools to deal with this perfect storm if we were to have it by 2020?</p><p>ROUBINI: I think there are differences this time around, is that we are having policies that are stagflationary that reduce growth but also increase inflation. For the last decade, all the shocks were stagflationary, meaning lower growth and lower inflation, and therefore, central banks were doing even more in doubling down on more unconventional policies. But if you're going to have trade restriction, if you are going to have a restriction to capital flows, you're going to have a restriction to FDI and technology transfers, if you're going to have a restriction migration, if you're not going to invest into renewable resources, if you're not going to invest into renewable resources, if you're not going to invest into infrastructure and there's no plan. All those shocks are stagflationary, are going to release (ph) growth, are going to force inflation higher. And when that happens when the economy is overheating, that's going to force the fed to hike more faster and sooner rather than ease (ph), as it happens whenever you've had a policy shock that they have been stagflationary, like the oil (ph) shock, '73, '79, '99. Because if you don't tighten, inflation expectation go higher and then you're in the worst situation. So the type of policy that is going to be followed by the U.S. are going to imply force and effect to have to tighten rather than ease, even if growth slows down, because inflation and inflation expectations are going to go to higher. That's a difference in the ability and willingness of the fed and other central to react to that economic slowdown. It's driven by negative supply side shocks.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Thank you so much for all of the insights. Nouriel Roubini there of Roubini Macro Associates, he stays with us.</p><p>KEENE: Right now, let's look at something we've avoided with Nouriel Roubini this morning, we're going to do it, we're going to dive in for a quick comment. Copper looks lousy. Right now, Dr. Roubini, Dr. Copper, this is just a textbook depressed commodity chart (inaudible) teach in one of your sessions in NYU, Nouriel. This should be a lead chart. What does it signal that we're seeing this dampening in something like copper?</p><p>ROUBINI: Well, it signals that there is a potential slowdown in the global economy signal.</p><p>KEENE: You take it right over to GDP?</p><p>ROUBINI: Yes. Emerging markets are slowing down, China will have to slowdown, and whether there's a correlation between the value of the dollar and the dollar prices of commodities, when the dollar is stronger, the dollar price of commodity tends to fall. So I would say, the weakening in copper is an ominous signal. And I would say also the increase in oil prices is an ominous signal because it's like a negative supply side shock to the global economy and that drives in the oil prices, it's not driven by demand growth but it's driven by the fact that the sanction on Iran right now are equivalent to a supply side shock, like it's happening in the previous episode. So that's even is a negative. Usually higher oil prices implies strong global growth. In this case, it's driven by a supply shock rather than (inaudible) shock so it's a negative for global growth.</p><p>KEENE: This has been wonderful and congratulations on your essay with Mr. Rosa in Project Syndicate. I'll get that out on social, folks. I really recommend that. It's a thought-provoking view forward looking back to the Lehman crisis. Nouriel Roubini, of course, with Roubini Macro Associates as well.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Welcome to the 38th Healthcare Conference at JPMorgan. I'm Richard Vosser, European Pharma Analyst at JPMorgan. It's my pleasure to introduce Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis, and welcome him to the conference.</p><p>Before I hand over to Vas, I'd just point out that the breakout session is in the Borgia Room after this presentation. Vas, welcome.</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN, CEO, NOVARTIS AG: Thank you, Richard, and it's great to be here, great to open the year, as always, at JPMorgan. I'd like to give some perspectives on the journey Novartis has been on over the last couple of years. I'm now entering my third year as CEO, and I think we're making progress on the strategy we set out to become the leading medicines company powered by advanced therapy platforms and data science. Now when you think about what we set out, we set out to focus the company and focus the company around our core of Innovative Medicines while looking to accelerate certain geographies where we thought we could have a differential advantage. And then we have 5 key priorities: to unleash the power of our people; to deliver transformative innovation; to embrace operational excellence; go big on data science and digital technologies; and importantly, to build trust with society. And I'll say more about that today than I have in the past.</p><p>And I think over the last couple of years, we've demonstrated that the strategy is working. These are numbers through Q3 of 2019. And you can see, whether it's on sales or operating income performance, we're generating strong leverage on the P&amp;L, solid top line growth, but importantly, 2.2% up through 9 months on our core margin in Innovative Medicines. You can see also strong free cash flow, showing that we're getting efficiency out of the business, and as well as a top-tier TSR ranking. That holds for 1-year, 2-year and 3-year TSR. So we're very happy with the performance we're generating with the strategy.</p><p>Now what I'd like to walk you through is why we believe that strategy is unique. Because in the end, the strategy only matters if we're unique from our competition. And one of the most important elements of our strategy is the focus. And what you've seen over the last 2 years is we've done over $70 billion of transactions to focus Novartis. Of course, major spins and exits, like Alcon and Consumer Health, but also important additions, building in areas like cell and gene therapies with AveXis radioligand therapies, with Endocyte and AAA, and most recently, into the world of cardiovascular population health with inclisiran and The Medicines Company, a deal we closed last week.</p><p>We believe that puts us in a unique position. This is a chart that looks at size of company based on market cap, concentration based on innovative medicines and overall concentration in Rx. You can see in terms of a scaled, focused medicines company, we believe we've now carved out for ourselves the unique position. Why does that matter? That enables us to have scale in R&amp;D, scale in the relevant and operational areas, like manufacturing and commercialization, and we believe in our ability to focus our capital to ensure that we can generate sustained growth and sustained profits.</p><p>We also think it enables us to maintain appropriate and important diversification. When you look at Novartis, we play in 10 therapeutic areas, always trying to balance which ones we're in and which ones we exit. Our top drug, Cosentyx, only accounts for 8% of our sales. So we don't present significant binary risk. We have 15 blockbusters, which puts us at the top of our peer set. And uniquely, we're positioned well in cell therapies, gene therapies, radioligand therapies as well as in RNA therapeutics.</p><p>The last point I want to make on focusing the company is our refocusing on China. And clearly, China is incredibly important for many companies now in our sector. But when you look at Novartis today, we have the opportunity to double the number of NDA approvals that we have, up to 50 NDA approvals. We've had 5 NDA approvals per year in the past. That will go up to 10 with a total of 50 over the next 5 years. We're focusing our resourcing in China. If you think about a drug like -- with Entresto, we see significant potential for medicines like Entresto and Cosentyx in China. And we've now focused as well our resourcing and management attention on the geography.</p><p>Now turning to culture. And one of the most important elements of the Novartis transformation is our belief that investing in our culture in the long run for long-run investors will generate outsized returns. And we do this in a very rigorous way. This is owned at the top, owned by me. We have a team that looks at how we're generating the culture change across the entire company, what we call an inspired, curious and unbossed organization.</p><p>We've looked at the research. The research clearly shows culture drives performance, culture drives innovation. We've actually done -- commissioned a meta analysis, and you can see areas like group goals, perceived support of innovation, psychological safety. These things really matter. And what we try to do at our company is measure the progress that we're making. We look at upward feedback for all 15,000 people managers at the company and continue to provide that feedback back to the managers. We pulse our associates every quarter looking at how are they perceiving the company. Do they believe that engagement is increasing? And lastly, we're using machine learning and people analytics on meta data through a collaboration with Microsoft to really understand how are the collaboration interaction points working.</p><p>There's a broad set of initiatives we've undertaken to transform the culture of Novartis. Some of the things like parental leave, where we've had 14-week parental leave for all associates anywhere in the world. That's a unique policy that we've put in place. We made LinkedIn Learning, Coursera, a broad range of learning programs free for all associates of the company. And we see tens of thousands of associates taking this up.</p><p>And then lastly, our unbossed approach, getting that through our leadership. We invest a tremendous amount in upgrading the leadership capabilities in the company. So we believe culture drives performance, and we believe in the long run, unleashing the power of our people is what's going to make the difference.</p><p>We've also pivoted harder to breakthrough innovation. Now that's something I think all companies will come up on the stage and tell you. But we're trying to be rigorous in asking ourselves, are we really first-in-class? Can we replace the standard of care? And do we have significant absolute efficacy gains in the medicines that we launch? Now when you look at the pipeline review that we recently had in London, on multiple measures, we believe we're achieving what we set out to do. When you look at scale, you can see 116 Phase I and Phase II programs, 37 Phase III. When you look at replacement power, we lead the sector in replacement power when you look at Evaluate Pharma's data from 2019 to 2024. And as I said, that pivot to breakthrough innovation really ensuring that we have most of our medicines as first-in-class or medicines that can significantly replace the standard of care.</p><p>Now one of the things I would say is 2019 was a breakthrough year. We set a record, at least we believe, with 6 NME approvals in the United States, 5 for novel compounds, you see them here, ranging from Zolgensma and Mayzent to Piqray, Beovu and Adakveo, one of the first advances in sickle cell. But one of the things I always want to highlight is the importance that these medicines ultimately have on patients. As a physician myself, I think that's really why we come to work. And there's extraordinary stories behind each of these medicines. Of course, Zolgensma is an extraordinary medicine. And there's one extraordinary story I wanted to briefly share with the audience today.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: We now have 15 children who have cleared 4.5 years from their initial dose of Zolgensma and extraordinary stories like [Matteo]. Now with hundreds of children treated around the world, I think we're starting to see the gene therapy revolution happen, and the potential that this has, I think, to really change the course of medicine. We want to be part of that as a company. That's why we invest in these early stages in areas like cell and gene therapies.</p><p>Now when you look at our 2020 catalysts, we continue to have a steady flow of catalysts through the year. Major approvals, importantly, ofatumumab, which we filed in December in the United States; inclisiran as well, which we've also -- The Medicines Company successfully filed in December of last year. Major submissions, you can see, around the world. Major readouts, and one of the things I wanted to highlight is now we're entering the next wave of innovation at the company. Phase III starts, including TQJ as well as LNP in PNH, and a number of other medicines we believe will be the next wave of innovation at Novartis. Four I wanted to highlight. We highlighted a whole range at our R&amp;D Day last month. I would encourage you, this was most transparent we've ever been in an R&amp;D Day. We provide full transparency now into the Phase I and Phase II pipeline, which you can also find at the back of this presentation. LNP, an oral factor B inhibitor, which we believe can transform the care of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria as well as multiple renal indications as well. It's a unique molecule, beautiful profile, we think can be a significant medicine entering now pivotal studies.</p><p>TQJ, which follows on from the same concepts like inclisiran, takes on Lp(a), one of the remaining genetic determinants of cardiovascular risk, with very potent reductions in Lp(a). We start a major outcome study with that medicine this year. Iscalimab, which is our CD40 ligand inhibitor, which looks at transplantation and can we get to a calcineurin-free transplantation regimen as well as moving to other immunological areas.</p><p>And then lastly, MBG, our anti-TIM-3 antibody, which is now entering pivotal studies in myelodysplastic syndromes as well as AML. So a really exciting group of medicines here. But there is an even broader group that we highlighted at R&amp;D Day, ranging from cartilage regeneration to other important cancer modalities. I encourage you to take a look.</p><p>Now the third area, which I think has become a very important part of our story, is our focus on operational execution and delivering on margin expansion. And when you look at the operational performance we've had this year of our recently launched medicines, I think it's quite impressive. You see Cosentyx through 9 months already at $2.6 billion, Entresto at $1.2 billion. Both of these medicines combined on their way already to generating $5 billion in sales. You can look at throughout the oncology group of medicines areas like -- medicines like Lutathera or PROMACTA, Kisqali as well now starts to take off. We feel like we're in a good place with these, a pretty broad set of medicines we've recently launched.</p><p>And when you look at the Innovative Medicine sales, we're now rapidly climbing up in terms of the percent of sales that are coming from these recently launched growth drivers. But the real story for us in the coming years is going to be launching medicines. We have to be a launch machine in launching the broad array of medicines we're bringing forward. We have 15 ongoing and upcoming major launches, as you can see here in the chart. Many of them you know well. Beovu is off to a very strong start. Mayzent is coming back up as we had hoped. Piqray has outperformed all of our expectations. Adakveo now starting to have patients in the United States on the medicine. Important launches this year, like ofatumumab in MS, but also Cosentyx in a new indication. And later today, we'll actually be announcing an important collaboration with the U.K. government with respect to inclisiran. And that will be announced later this morning, which demonstrates, I think, how this medicine, in particular, could transform population health in cardiovascular disease like few others could in the past.</p><p>Now in terms of margin expansion, consistent margin expansion that we delivered. We originally had guided to mid-30s by -- within 5 years. Now we've brought forward that guidance. We'll be at mid-30s in the near-term and mid- to high 30s in the medium term. We can achieve this independent of all of the ins and outs of potential patent expiries. We believe we will hit this, and I think we feel very confident at the levers that we're putting in place to make this happen. And just to put a little more meat behind that, both in manufacturing and in business services, we have very broad-based programs to take out what will cumulatively be $2 billion in costs by 2020.</p><p>You can see in our manufacturing areas, we've had multiple exits, we're rapidly streamlining the footprint and putting in new technologies and preparing to be a cell and gene therapy for the long term. Similarly, in business services, a significant offshoring operation as well as a lot of work to automate the system. Alongside this, we're working very hard to improve our cash conversion cycle, so we can throw off more cash out of the P&amp;L that we can invest in new technologies.</p><p>I also want to say a word about data science and digital technologies. I know for many of you, there's a question as to how will these technologies ultimately impact a company like Novartis. And there's a few things I'd want to highlight. First, we believe that the biggest opportunity is in our core operations. We have what we call 12 digital lighthouse projects, which we're scaling across Novartis. We believe these can significantly increase either the efficiency of our R&amp;D or manufacturing operations or enable our sales reps to get to our patients with better information at the right time. We're scaling across the company in terms of capabilities. We have 1,500 data scientists now at Novartis. We have programs now to enable any associate at the company to be trained in artificial intelligence or data science. We've launched biomes across the world from San Francisco to Paris, there will be more coming, where we have start-ups sitting with us and learning from us and hopefully, coming up with the next wave of digital technologies. And we've launched 3 major partnerships last year, each of which I think would have a significant impact on the long-run success of Novartis. A partnership with Microsoft on artificial intelligence, a partnership with Amazon to scale operational excellence within the company, and lastly, our partnership with Tencent to leverage WeChat to enable better detection and better management of heart failure, and hopefully, other therapeutic areas in the future.</p><p>Now I wanted to actually show you that this is happening at Novartis. So another brief video, which I hope will demonstrate that this isn't just talk.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: In each one of those areas, those are real. Those are scaling across our enterprise. We think about 110,000 associates operating in 150 countries. We only achieve impact when we hit scale. In every one of these technologies, our goal in 2020 is to take them truly to scale. That single platform that we have is a room in -- and we have multiple rooms across Novartis, where almost like an air traffic control center, we can monitor and predict, using artificial intelligence, how all of our trials are enrolling. We're rolling out the same in manufacturing as well as other operational areas. And we have almost 10,000 sales reps with AI-powered intelligence, helping them guide how they do their work every single day.</p><p>Now the last topic I wanted to tackle before closing is on building trust with society. Clearly, in the current environment, especially given the push for environmental concerns, in general, ESG, we believe we have to be -- I believe, we have to be a leader in how we work across the various elements that we can impact from a building trust standpoint.</p><p>In Novartis, we have now identified 4 areas we plan to focus on. We transparently do this. For those of you who are interested, we have a very detailed report that we put out and are making it even more detailed, that will come out later this month, outlining what we're doing in each of these areas with clear targets. Whether it's ethical standards, where we are doing a lot now to improve how we manage third parties, which is, I think, one of the big things that our sector needs to do much better. We're bringing our prices down in low- and middle-income countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, we've now prioritized access over profits to in order -- in order to achieve maximum access in the region. We launched a major global health partnership in sickle cell disease with the Government of Ghana, which is now scaling across Africa. And we've committed to important standards with respect to diversity, UN equal pay for equal work, and we've now reached 44% of management with gender diversity, and our goal is 50% within the next few years.</p><p>We're doing this in a very structured way. We have a scorecard with 1-year targets. Those targets will be published. Those targets are in my CEO scorecard. They're systematically reviewed. We have a committee that I chair, where we actually look at this in a consistent way. It's linked to compensation and will be transparently disclosed.</p><p>There's a few big areas which I am particularly proud that we're trying to make an impact on. One, we're trying to reduce the time lag novel medicines come to the poorest parts of the world to 3 months from when they're launched in U.S. and Europe. Second, we're implementing access strategies now to figure out how to close the gap in cell and gene therapies to broaden access to these very advanced technologies. We've committed $100 million to treat malaria, and we've also committed to eliminate leprosy as well as take on another infectious disease, Chagas disease in Latin America, the most common infectious disease in the region. We've committed to achieve carbon neutrality in our own operations by 2025 and reduce our total carbon footprint even in our third-party operations by 2030. We've committed to deliver on our UN EPIC and LGBTI pledges and holistically address sickle cell disease in Ghana. I take this very seriously. Our leadership team takes this very seriously. This is not an and -- this is not something we do on the side. This is something that is core to our strategy. I believe it motivates our associates. It gives us the license to operate in countries around the world.</p><p>I did want to share one incredible story, that is, of course, the launch of an effort to tackle sickle cell disease in Ghana. As many of you know, we've brought forward sickle cell therapies now to treat sickle cell disease across the United States and in Europe. But the vast majority, many millions of children and patients, suffer from this disease in West Africa. We took on the challenge with the President and Vice President of Ghana. I was there with the Vice President. We launched a major effort to tackle it in Ghana with newborn screening, bringing the cost of generic medicines down dramatically in the region. And now our hope is to spread that across Africa to show you can take on a disease like sickle cell, maybe 1 day bring some of the more advanced therapies to the region.</p><p>We're also using drones. And I've learned that drones are really cool. And so one of the things I did want to show you is a video of the drones that we're using to deliver sickle cell medicines across Ghana.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: That is actually a clinic that's inaccessible by roads. So you can see the power now to use these technologies to bring advanced therapeutics to people who desperately are in need. The company, Zipline, can move 1 ton of medicines across a region in Ghana spanning over 100 kilometers and can now do it with a closed supply chain.</p><p>I hope that gives you a sense of what's going on at our company. We believe we're on the right track. It's been a great journey for the last 2 years, a big transformation. As I said, $70 billion of transactions, a new strategy. But most importantly, in my mind, the cultural transformation is taking hold. We're bringing medicines that matter to patients. We're driving outstanding financial performance, and we look forward to continuing to do that to deliver value to all of you, our investors, but most importantly, to patients, families and people all around the world. Thank you all very much.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: We can start? Okay.</p><p>RICHARD VOSSER: Welcome, everyone, to the Novartis breakout at the JPMorgan conference. We have the CEO, Vas, here with us. This is Q&amp;A so we can go right in, if there are questions. Then maybe I'll kick off with one. You talked straight away out front about the focus that you brought to the business. Maybe you could talk about the -- maybe bringing future focus and the ideas around Sandoz and the transformation that you're bringing to Sandoz.</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: With Sandoz, what we've done now is put in, I think, a great leadership team that's really focused the agenda at Sandoz to be a great generics company. I think we're -- you've seen us exit areas that were more tangential, really focusing back on core oral solids, injectables and biosimilars. Some of the actions we've taken, we made an acquisition in Japan of an injectables business. We're continuing to look at additional opportunities in a number of biosimilar fields as well. And when you look at Sandoz' underlying performance in 2019, it's actually been quite good. You start to see revenues in the low single digits, you see core operating income growth in the high single digits, you see reasonable margin expansion. So it makes me feel pretty good with where Sandoz is at the moment. Now that doesn't change our goal for end of this year, early next year, to really make Sandoz a standalone generics company within the Novartis infrastructure. So with that, we will separate out manufacturing, certain elements elsewhere in the business services arena as well, to really enable Sandoz to operate like a generics company with a generics cost base. Why do we do that? One, we think we can improve responsiveness to the market; two, we think we can hopefully drive the margins of Sandoz up to its peer set, which is in the mid to high 20s; and three, we think that will also enable Sandoz to have the freedom in decision-making to hopefully build out its portfolio.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: How much of that portfolio do you expect to dispose (inaudible)?</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: Yes, so for Sandoz right now, we have the ongoing transaction with Aurobindo, which we hope will close in the first quarter of 2020. I mean, beyond that, right now, we feel like we have the right footprint. If you look at Sandoz, in Europe, we're, depending on the segment, #1 or #2. In many of the relevant emerging markets, a similar position. If anything, I think right now what we're looking to do is add on -- strategically add on, particularly areas in hard-to-make generics and injectables to kind of build out the portfolio and give it some more strength. I think another element of the story will be watching how U.S. pricing in generics evolves. I think we're starting to see, across the sector, some flattening or slowing down of the price erosion that we saw that really peaked a couple of years ago. So that's another element, I think, of the story.</p><p>RICHARD VOSSER: Maybe just to build on that one, just in terms of biosimilars and bringing those to the U.S. and how the roll-out is going in Europe, and maybe future biosimilars you can bring. Just thoughts there.</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: So I think on biosimilars, we've had a very strong, I think, performance in Europe. We have, I think, about 7 or 8 biosimilars now launched in Europe. We generally see, in the first couple of years, very good sales performance. Then as additional entrants come in, you do, as expected, start to see declines in price. But even after that, given how we're able to drive down cost of goods, we still feel very good overall in the European context. As you all know, in the U.S., it's been tougher, I think, in the biosimilars environment. I still believe that given the size of resources that we could take out of the system through successful biosimilars, this will eventually happen. In our hands, of course, we have Filgrastim and pegfilgrastim already launched. We also have, from older days, a human growth hormone. We'll see how the Enbrel patent case ultimately evolves. And then over time, we hope to of course get adalimumab biosimilars as well. We also signed a number of deals. We have an ongoing deal for bringing Tysabri -- a biosimilar Tysabri as well as a deal with Gan &amp; Lee in China to look at bringing insulins around the world as well. So we continue to invest through a mix of partnerships and internal developments. So our commitment to biosimilars stays strong, commitment in the U.S. stays strong. I do think smart reforms would help accelerate biosimilar uptake in the U.S.</p><p>RICHARD VOSSER: One of the new launches you highlighted with the very nice video was Zolgensma. Perhaps you could talk about the roll-out in the U.S. of Zolgensma, how we're going there and where you are in terms of the European filing, et cetera.</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: So on the U.S., roll-out still goes very well. I'd say right now, we continue to see very solid uptake, consistent uptake as we saw already in Q3. The trends continue in the direction we had hoped. In terms of the patient profile, we see still a pretty even distribution of patients of all SMA types between the ages of 1 and 2, 6 to 12 months and under 6 months. We do, do very well in states that have newborn screening. Right now, about 30% to 35% of newborn lives are covered now through newborn screening. The aspiration is that we can get that number up in 2020 and then up even further. I think clinically, there is such a strong case to give Zolgensma to a newborn identified with any of the SMA types, regardless of SMN2 copy number, that as you saw with the video of [Matteo], if you treat early enough, you have truly revolutionary outcomes. So that's basically where we are in the U.S., goes according to plan. Manufacturing continues to be expanding well.</p><p>We announced the Longmont facility is now operational last week, which gives us a third facility in the U.S. to build out our AAV capacity. In Europe, we have, I think, come to a good place with EMA. We still continue to expect to see a CHMP positive opinion in Q1. Similarly, in Japan, we're in a similar situation. And we're in the midst now of filing all around the world on the basis of the U.S. files. So the U.S. is the reference file for Zolgensma in other markets. The reason that matters is that you have a reasonable burden of disease of SMA in the Middle East, in Latin America. High degree of interest in these markets to come up with approaches that allows accelerated access.</p><p>So I think in this particular medicines case, you don't want to just focus on U.S., EU and Japan. You also want to look at some of the other emerging markets as well. And that's a big focus for 2020 for us, is to get under 2 years of age, Zolgensma well on track in those markets around the world. I already have presupposed the next question on the IT clinical hold. We've had good conversations with the FDA. I think there's important context, of course, in terms of as we've gotten deeper into this, we feel quite comfortable that with the appropriate package of information, we can move off of clinical hold, move hopefully towards a filing of IT in the U.S. as we said in -- during this year.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Any reimbursement issues that you had in the U.S. or is that gone? And then in terms of your [Beovu] pricing, is pricing the same in developed markets, less in emerging markets? How are you pricing [that drug]?</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: So in the U.S., to date, we have only had 1 patient -- 1% of patients, but in effect it was 1 patient who was on label who didn't get reimbursed. I think it's important to note that in many cases, there is multiple rounds of appeals with the payers to ultimately get the patients on the medicines, but in general, it happens. So in the U.S., I think it's been largely according to plan. We've not announced a pricing strategy around the world, mostly because I think once we get approval, we need to have those discussions. So of course, this is a very unique context. What I would say is when you look at Kymriah around the world, Kymriah, our CAR therapy for pediatric ALL and DLBCL, is currently reimbursed in 18 countries around the world and in general, reimbursed in a pricing corridor very close to the U.S. So I think that gives us, I think, a reasonable model of how we're going to approach Zolgensma as well.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Well, (inaudible) I think you were mentioning that you have a (inaudible) in China, almost at double the price. [By] looking at (inaudible), so what's the rationale making you to do such a [study]?</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: When I look at China and the impressive reforms that have been made, I think there's a couple of things that it's important to note. One, from a regulatory standpoint, the outstanding work that the China FDA, which now has been renamed, has done, I think, in terms of raising the bar in terms of what's expected for regulatory filings, but also clearing the backlog. It's become a much more efficient system, much more predictable system. That was point 1. Point 2, the ability to do pivotal clinical studies, including China in the pivotal study without having to do a separate approach or a separate IND in China changes the game. It enables us to bring medicines much more quickly into the Chinese market. And then three, I think the overall modernization of how China approaches these new -- whether biologics, also new technologies has been impressive.</p><p>So we see a lot more predictability from a regulatory standpoint.</p><p>I think, second, with the tendering reforms that the Chinese government has done to really look at older medicines, take resources out of those older medicines, put them into newer medicines, including, I think, which was very visionary in some ways, to look at a whole set of medicines where they wanted to just grandfather them in into the Chinese system, a number of oncology drugs as well. We benefited from that, where we didn't have to do anything except to provide our global filings. This enables us, of course, to then bring novel medicines to market.</p><p>Now I think the key shift for us is to move from a world where we were protecting our older medicines, our valsartan-based medicines or Gleevac and some of our older cancer medicines, to focusing completely on launches and new medicines. And that's what we do. We pivoted our commercial organization towards that. We are comfortable with the fact those older medicines will be tendered eventually and go down very quickly, but we believe we can double our business, overcoming that and still double our Chinese business in the next 5 years.</p><p>RICHARD VOSSER: Just following up on that. I think you had 5 NDRL approvals in the recent [charts] and nothing on the tenders. So just thinking about the growth profile of China within your business, strong double-digit growth. Is that how you're thinking about it?</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: We've seen strong double-digit growth, I think, with the latest round, particularly with ENTRESTO now getting on to the NRDL, where we have an aspiration, may or may not happen, but an aspiration to make ENTRESTO even a blockbuster in China alone.</p><p>That, I think, shows the kind of power you have. And of course, given the quality concerns there has been with nitrosamines, to date, the valsartan-based medicines haven't ended up on the tenders. And so right now, at least, we have a window where we're not seeing the declines in the older medicine, and we're seeing a ramp on the newer medicines. High priority for us right now is the oncology launches. I think in -- and Marie-France is here. In China, in pharmaceuticals, we're doing an outstanding job. Now it's really in oncology, building out a deeper sales force to enable success there.</p><p>RICHARD VOSSER: One of the other launches you've highlighted in the U.S. was the Beovu launch. And I think people would like to probably get your feedback, the initial feedback from that launch.</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: So I'd start with the actual clinical experience we're seeing with Beovu, which is really quite positive. The feedback we get from physicians is that, at least in the early patients that they trial Beovu on, they're seeing remarkable results, even from the early doses in drying of -- in the OCT scans, the drying of the retina, which is one of the things they're really looking for. They're seeing in patients who are uncontrolled in the currently licensed medicines, getting those patients back to control. If you follow the kind of physician online sharing or social media sharing, you also have stories of significant best corrected visual acuity gains with Beovu.</p><p>So at least anecdotally, we see a very strong clinical response, which has to be, of course, the foundation for the success of the product. We don't hear a lot as well about any of the concerns on inflammation. Just to remind you, the 2 competitor products have inflammation in their label of 3% and 5%. We have 4%. So we're in the range anyway of our peer set. To date, uptake has been very strong, equally distributed from the 2 licensed medicines. In general, it's switches. It's not a lot of new initiations yet. But importantly, we have a J code now. And so I think in the next 6 months, we'll really have a much better understanding of the trajectory of Beovu. Our team did an incredible job to get a J code early. That should enable us, hopefully, to drive very rapid uptake in the first part of this year.</p><p>RICHARD VOSSER: Maybe one of the other things you touched on is the generics that are coming in the future. One of those that has been put off so far is Gilenya. So perhaps you could give us an update on how you're doing with settling, how we should think about Gilenya going through, and how that's factored into your midterm guidance target.</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: So I think, first on guidance. This year, we will give guidance, assuming Gilenya doesn't come in 2020. If it did come, we'll, of course, adjust accordingly. That's one. And two, our midterm margin guidance of mid- to high 30s is independent. I mean, so if Gilenya comes, it comes. Whenever it comes, we will still plan on hitting that mid- to high 30s. So I think for anyone who is assuming that, that has a swing factor, that's not at all the case. Gilenya is -- has been a very positive surprise, and we continue to try to drive the medicine in the relevant markets.</p><p>Now in terms of the resolution of the case, it's complicated, first of all, I think the first thing to say. So everything I'm about to say is going to sound probably very complicated. We have an appeal of the IPR decision that's ongoing. That case, we expect to read out sometime probably in early Q2. So that is the appeal of the underlying decision that validated the 405 patent. Separate from that, there's a district court case to try to validate the patent separate from the IPR decision. That court case would start potentially in Q2. All of which to say, if any of these court cases would not go our way, the earliest we would expect a potential entrant is sometime in the second half.</p><p>But that, of course, is many ifs away, given all of the cases, the appeals and our own strategy to build an even stronger patent case for Gilenya. We plan to very aggressively, of course, protect the product. So that's basically where we stand. In terms of settling, we've settled with the vast majority of filers. There are still a few filers that have not settled, which is why we still have these court cases. Certainly, our aspiration would be to settle, but we're not willing to settle beyond what we think is a fair and reasonable term for Gilenya protection. So that's kind of where we are. And of course, we'll keep everyone updated.</p><p>RICHARD VOSSER: Maybe moving to sort of M&amp;A strategy. You highlighted the $70 billion worth of deals, not all acquisitions. But just in terms of the acquisition strategy, just -- we obviously saw inclisiran come into the group in the second half last year. But what is the priority now in terms of adding to the portfolio and the pipeline?</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: Yes. I think the strategy, of course, fits with our capital allocation strategy, which remains unchanged: invest deeply in our internal capabilities and business, grow the dividend in Swiss francs, and then look strategic at M&amp;A and share buybacks. When you look at our M&amp;A strategy, we generally are looking to either build depth in one of these new technology areas, which you saw us do, gene therapy to radioligand therapy, or to build depth in one of our core therapeutic areas. The inclisiran deal is a case study in the sense that we have a global cardiovascular footprint. We've been in cardiovascular disease for 50 years. I personally believe our industry has a responsibility to take on significant diseases of high incidence, which cause the greatest burden of disease, mortality and morbidity around the world, cardiovascular disease and pulmonary diseases being the highest among them. And so it was a very logical fit.</p><p>And I think if we find other opportunities, but I don't think -- it's hard to predict. I mean, if you had asked me, middle of last year, would I have thought we would have acquired Medicines Company, I would have said probably no. And then our thinking changed. So I think it really depends on the assets in the situation. We continue to have though, in our minds, the approach of programmatic M&amp;A. Don't believe in big M&amp;A. We believe that programmatic M&amp;A, up to 5% of our market cap, done consistently over time will continue to build the valuation of this company over the long term. So long-run investors then will ultimately benefit. Quiet group today.</p><p>RICHARD VOSSER: It is. I'm having to work.</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: I know.</p><p>RICHARD VOSSER: Maybe just sticking with the M&amp;A that you've done and just thinking about another one as Xiidra in terms of that. And obviously, it was bridging between some of the old ophthalmology products and some of the new ones. But just that is a tricky product to sell in the U.S. So maybe an update on how that's going.</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: Yes. So Xiidra we brought in basically around July, August of last year. We brought together the 2 sales forces and optimized it -- optimized the situation. One thing important to note is, we always knew that with Xiidra, we were going to get the inflection change when we got Part D reimbursement. And we still think that is a 2021 time line to get the Part D. In the meantime, our focus has been, given the dry eye products behave a bit more like consumer products, is to focus on DTC. And so we have a DTC campaign that rolled out in Q4. A significant investment, relatively speaking, given the size of the market, which we think should be able to drive, hopefully, share gains, which we haven't seen to date.</p><p>And I think, Richard, well, it's been relatively flattish in the back half of last year. But I think it's early days. DTC has gone out. And so we'll see the responsiveness to that DTC, hopefully, in Q2, mid of this year, and we're hopeful that we can get a trajectory change. We've brought on a great team of real experts in the front of the eye. So I remain very optimistic. And just to remind you on that deal, it's a very back-loaded deal. And so most of the milestone payments we make are really dependent on us achieving very high sales levels. And if we achieve those sales levels, we'll be happy to make those milestone payments.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [But just correct me], you said that if you had asked me a year ago about The Medicines Company, I probably wouldn't have done it. So what really changed? What are you seeing in the asset that really gave you the [thought process] to buy it? And then how can you expand it? How do you think you can expand it globally?</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: So I believe inclisiran has the potential to be one of the largest, if not the largest medicines at Novartis in our history. Now we have a lot of work to do to get there. But I think obviously, the clinical data shifted our view. I think when we saw that -- scientifically, what the scientists had already done at Alnylam was, of course, come up with a sequence that they believed could manage off-target toxicities as well as get very efficient taking out of the PCSK9 gene in the cytoplasm. And it looked like they did it. I mean, basically, you look at a completely clean safety profile and you saw LDL reductions on top of statins, 55% to 60%. And it's a better -- or at the same par or better than the PCSK9 monoclonal antibody's 6-monthly dosing. So when we saw that clinical data, then we really -- Marie-France and her team got their pens down -- pens up and really started thinking about what could we do.</p><p>In the U.S., this story is going to be all about building out a Part B model, buy-and-bill model within the cardiovascular physician's office. We believe we can achieve higher compliance. We believe it's going to be attractive to bring in these patients every 6 months, which they have to do anyway, and give them a quick IV infusion that's very safe to get their cholesterol levels down. Outside the U.S., we believe the upside potential here is to go into population health. And you're -- will hear a press conference in 2 hours, where we'll talk more about the idea of population health with this medicine as a model in at least 1 country. And then beyond that, of course, the upside potential is to get into primary prevention, and you'll also hear more about that in 2 hours as well.</p><p>But we believe that if we could thread the needle on primary prevention, you have a vaccine-like approach to LDL lowering. And if you could do that -- and you should all look at Eugene Braunwald, who is really the -- of course, the god of cardiology, his comments on this medicine. He said, this is likely the most important advance of the next 20 years in cardiovascular disease. He believes the potential of this to transform cardiovascular health around the world is unparalleled. That's his view, not our view, his view on the potential of inclisiran. So that's why we did the deal. And of course, a lot of work to do, but we definitely see the potential.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: How do you see the Kymriah launch evolving? And [will there be an operational] update or (inaudible)?</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: So Kymriah continues to do steady and well. I think the key for us is continuing to work on our supply constraints. So it's not a demand-constrained product. It's a supply-constrained product, particularly in the U.S. We have been making a number of manufacturing changes, which we think will increase the efficiency of the manufacturing. We continue to work with the FDA to try to expand the specifications to our European specifications. One of the reasons we continue to see strong growth is in Europe, we're able to release and treat almost -- within the broader spec. In the U.S., we still have a significant number of patients who are treated, treated under treatment INDs, but then ultimately not charged. And when we can turn those patients into paying patients that are reimbursed that -- I think you'll see a rapid inflection point then with Kymriah.</p><p>We're hopeful, but I said that last year as well. So I'm a little more humble about that now. I mean, I think we have work to do to really demonstrate the next wave on that process. But we remain optimistic. We continue to believe it will be a blockbuster medicine. I will take that moment as well to say, we also are seeing a trend shift on Kisqali with the 2 OS readouts. We are seeing uptakes in share. I believe humbly, Richard, I think there's opportunity there in the consensus models in terms of under-appreciating that in the size of the CDK 4/6 market, what Kisqali can do.</p><p>RICHARD VOSSER: I think we're now out of time, so...</p><p>VASANT NARASIMHAN: Good. Thank you all very much. Thank you for coming.</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you so much for being here on our panel where we're going to talk about technology innovations in health care. I hope everyone's been having a great JPMorgan so far. And I know this is a lunchtime panel. So if you do have sandwiches or anything else, go for it. We want to make sure you guys have enough food.</p><p>So I'm Christina Farr. I'm a health and technology reporter with CNBC, and I'm just going to let the panel introduce themselves, the 10 seconds, on who you are and who you work for.</p><p>OTHMAN LARAKI, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO, COLOR GENOMICS, INC.: I'm Othman Laraki. I'm Cofounder and CEO of Color. We're a health technology company that works with about 100 different institutions across -- from NIH, self-insured employers, some -- pharma as well.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA: Aashima Gupta. I lead Healthcare Solutions in Google Cloud. In my role, I work with broad spectrum of industry stakeholders in helping them transform, leveraging cloud, APIs and AI. Happy to be here.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH: Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Jujhar. I'm responsible for the Salesforce, Industry Clouds. We are focused on building industry verticals for 7 of those industries and excited to be part of this panel, look forward to it.</p><p>KEN EHLERT, CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER &amp; MEMBER OF OFFICE OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE, UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED: Ken Ehlert. I'm UnitedHealth Group's Chief Scientific Officer. We spend all of our time in health care.</p><p>JEREMY SOHN: Jeremy Sohn. I'm Global Head of Digital Business Development, which effectively is our partnership engine as well as our venture investment engine for working with technology, data and new business model companies. And hopefully, everyone knows what Novartis is, and we, too, spend all of our time in health care.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: Here you go. So we are here to talk about health care, but we're also here to talk about technology. And everybody on this panel has a background in that, some more than others. Aashima Gupta, and then we have Salesforce and traditional health care companies also.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: But I wanted to kick things off with a question that kind of put you guys on the spot. And that's how do you define digital health? And is that even the right term? Should we say health tech? Is it health IT? Like what's your working definition that you use in and around kind of this conference?</p><p>OTHMAN LARAKI: Anyone want to start? I can jump in. I mean, basically, that's just health care. I think there's no version of health care with IT anymore. And so in the same way that like retail, 20 years ago, we were thinking about e-commerce versus the -- versus retail, but now it's like it seems completely inaccurate as to even think about retail without digital shopping, and I think health care is basically the same thing.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA: Yes. I would say it's an intersection of traditional health care with technology, and it's all coming together. To me, that's the healthy -- melting pots of technology and health care coming together.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH: I think the way we define it is technology kind of ushering health care into a much more retail-centric world with patient right at the center. That's how we look at it. That's what the whole company is all about, and that's how we define digital health.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: For us, it actually would depend on which part of health we're talking about. So if we're automating core business processes, that would be one version. But if we're moving into a different way of diagnosing and screening patients, that would be another way that we'd think about it. Or on the extreme, from a therapy perspective, if we're thinking about beyond conditions that we think of as body type conditions. But if we move to the mind, the ability of a molecule to cross into the brain to actually alter an underlying PTSD event, for example, that's a -- today, with current technology, that's an impossible task. But using digital mechanisms, we can actually go in and sort of mitigate the effects of that. So I think it depends on what part of health we're actually talking about. Whether it's the business or all the way to the other extreme, it's in therapy itself. Those types of tools that are there, the tools that are out there and available can be deployed against those things in different ways.</p><p>JEREMY SOHN: So I love the fact that you asked that question because I think what you're hearing is, is that digital health probably means something different to everyone.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: Absolutely. Yes.</p><p>JEREMY SOHN: At the same time, what I hope is, is that we actually ultimately drop the initial adjective and we just actually talk about it as health.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: Health.</p><p>JEREMY SOHN: And I think that that's sort of the transition, in fact, the inflection point that we're in. And a lot of what we were trying to do and the fact that we want to -- I sit within our digital office. And the reality is, is digital -- why do we even need a digital office? Ultimately, I'm trying to apply technology and innovation and new business models as a core capability inside every aspect of my core business, whether in research or development or running clinical trials or my commercial organization, or for that matter, internal finance, et cetera. All those are business units that exist and don't really need to be replaced. So what we're trying to do is to just create an agility engine inside of those around health care. And so in many respects, it's all just health and just -- it's how we run our business.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: Yes. I mean, I want to kind of -- a couple of people said that they think digital health should eventually just be health, but we do see -- maybe it's because we're in a transition period, but there is certainly a difference in the culture between health care companies and technology companies. I mean, one of the great sort of mantras that's kicked about in Silicon Valley is move fast and break things. And can you imagine if I walked into a UnitedHealthcare or Novartis and said, \"I want to move -- I want to break things.\" You guys would say, \"Okay, here's the door.\" So how do you bring together those 2 cultures? And what do we kind of need to learn from each other to get these conversations to be more productive?</p><p>JEREMY SOHN: Maybe I can start. So from a Novartis perspective and from a pharma perspective, certainly quality is -- and repeatability is one of those things that we absolutely believe is core to one of our strengths, right? We're best in class in science and in delivering transformative drugs for our patients because of that quality, because of that excellence. But at the same time, when you talk about digital health, for us, again, it's building a new muscle. And that muscle is that quality or being best in class actually isn't about repeatability. It's about continuous optimization. And so that's a little bit of taking that start-up engine, that technology engine and actually recreating the way that we operate. And in fact, we do that in the science, right, but we don't necessarily do that across all of our business functions.</p><p>So I actually don't think about it as breaking Novartis or pharma or large companies in general. It's actually just creating a different way of operating and hopefully a more optimal way of operating.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH: I think at Salesforce, we actually see the perspective of both the universes, the B2B as well as the B2C, the consumer as well as the enterprise. And we don't believe that you can't be agile and still be maintaining the change management processes. We have done it successfully across multiple of our industries. Health care is no different. We believe the changes that actually you need to bring on the enterprise side of the house, they are actually going to be really pushing the digital health concept, touching the consumer. The whole patient engagement is going to be very fundamentally driven by the internal processes that change on the enterprise side of the house. So we see them mutually feeding on one another rather than being exclusive. And successfully, we've done it. We do agile releases 3 times a year. We've done it for the last 20 years, both with enterprise as well as the consumers.</p><p>OTHMAN LARAKI: I think one of the cultural gaps that has existed sometimes is that if you're purely coming from a consumer technology world, I used to be at Google for a number of years. And when you're iterating sometimes on a pure consumer product, there are very few parts of the product that are sacrosanct, in some sense, where you can iterate on the entire experience. As you can -- there's a big surface area where you can be very experimental. And I think with health care, obviously, there is some parts that are very deeply sacred in terms of ensuring that you don't cause harm, that you have certain quality standards, et cetera. And I think sometimes where there has been kind of a gap in that cultural -- in those cultural norms has been around different assumptions about where -- what parts are experimental versus not. Like, for example, just with Color's experience like we...</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: Can you give us an example?</p><p>OTHMAN LARAKI: Yes. I was going to say, like, for example, with Color, so we -- by now we've built a kind of an infrastructure that has been used to roll out the largest number of genomics -- population genomics programs in the world. And there are some parts of the system that we are very experimental with, like, for example, how do you get a clean consent flows and how do you get people to answer questions with the highest convenience for them, et cetera. Those are things where you actually want to increase yield and be very experimental.</p><p>On the flip side, we run a clinical-grade diagnostic part of the product. And that is a part where we really cannot mess up, right? And it's very -- like the experimentation framework for that is very constrained. And so I think like that's where like sometimes if you come in with a pure consumer tech hat, it's important to realize, like, okay, where do I draw the lines and operate in these very different worlds and be kind of comfortable with them.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: So you're saying you can have pieces of the business that operate more like traditional health care and then pieces where you've got R&amp;D efforts internally that feel more like a traditional tech company?</p><p>OTHMAN LARAKI: Yes. I understand that there's just a curve of risk tolerance and impact across your product. I think we're -- which I think is much less the case in consumer products. I mean when -- if Twitter goes down, it's not great. They lose money, but they always say, no one dies, right? Like whereas in health care, that actually is not true. So I think that's really understanding -- like being sensitive to that difference, I think, is important.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA: Yes. And I think where I sit today, when we were working with the industry stakeholders, one comment that was made just a couple of days ago that, \"Aashima, we -- yes, we move very slow, but we make much less mistakes.\" And so -- and now they're shifting. There's a paradigm shift. And if I go back to my old role in Kaiser Permanente, I led digital health incubations. This was a complete set of team. You incubate ideas before you actually roll it out in pilot or production. So there is that discipline. Things are changing. I think the health care industry is now looking into another term that is overused in health care, or in general, in all the industries, digital transformation. Just like digital health, everything is about digital transformation now. It's such a generic term. Like are you transforming clinician experience, physician experience? What does...</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: Yes. What does it mean to transform something digitally?</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA: Right. So it's -- and there are many aspects, just patient facing, physician facing, and there's actually operation robotic process automation. And that's an \u00c3\u00bcber term of umbrella people call digital transformation, yes.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: To this point about culture, I mean, I've even -- I think in this space where we are still quite confused about what digital health means, I've had folks tell me Peloton is a digital health company, and you guys may agree or disagree with that. But people say that digital health companies, in general, tend to focus more on sort of the very privileged populations and often as a cash pay aspect. You see them kind of on the fringes of health care. And some might say, \"Well, that's not the case because you're also seeing digital health companies actually work with traditional health insurers and pharma and others.\" But do you see there being any truth to that, that digital health, so far, has primarily been concerned with the wellness, the fitness, the sort of higher-income professional user base?</p><p>KEN EHLERT: We see a lot that's out there, and it's true. There are a lot of companies, especially from something that feels very consumer-like. I want to do a diet. I want to exercise more. And it makes sense that some -- a company that's doing that would take the perspective that I have a consumer that's purchasing something from me, I'm trying to optimize the experience, the product for that consumer, and there is a price that they're willing to exchange value on. That part is separate, though, from is it health or not health. Yes, exercising is health. When we all stand up and walk out of here, our large muscle groups are going to start producing interleukins, and they're going to have an anti-inflammatory effect. And none of you got permission from your health -- actually, probably a bunch of you have health insurance from UnitedHealthcare, but none of you got permission from your insurance company to actually engage in health like that, and yet you do. So this idea of what's health and what's not, we're human, we're alive, and every interaction that we do is part of health. When you have an interaction that's a social interaction with somebody, that actually changes what's going on in your brain. If you socially isolate, you will put your brain under enormous amounts of stress. That will cause your immune -- as it goes through all the different sort of the HPA axis all the way down, that will cause your immune system to start responding in a different way. Do I want you to start exercising when that happens? Sure, I do. But the idea that that's all in one bucket and this stuff is in a different bucket is actually not quite true.</p><p>So like this morning, just on our call, we talked about -- I don't know, it's about 0.5 million lives that are in the Motion program, where they're actually earning really large incentives, about $1,000 -- up to $1,000 a year for doing something as simple as actually going for a walk, and I could take that a lot further if we wanted to. The idea that you have a molecule -- and by the way, the idea that like health care companies don't move quick or innovate, thousands of molecules will get tested to produce something that actually doesn't kill people in the process of helping them. The same thing could be said when you're looking at a genomic test. There's enormous amounts of stuff that's going on there. But when you start to narrow down and say, \"Hey, we've got 0.5 million people that are actually doing things for their health, incorporating it in, reaping the benefit of that, that's a pretty cool thing to have happened.\" When somebody makes a molecule or some sort of a protein, whatever it might be that you need to take to improve your health, you got to remember, you still need to take that pill or you need to get that injection. That, too, is part of health. And how we make that happen, whether it's with incentives or it's with an app that actually can work with somebody to actually get that going, all of those things end up being in scope.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH: I would say kind of to your point, that there are 2 universes, right, in the digital health are kind of the rich and the privileged and the others. I believe that a lot of the insurance companies are actually investing. UnitedHealth, for example, acquired Vivify very recently for the remote monitoring piece. They are giving incentives for people because I think at the heart of all of this digital health is bringing the consumer into mediating and managing their own health. And all the insurance -- UnitedHealth and all other companies like that are focused on outcomes. So if the result is a better outcome, I think it's not a matter of just a subsection of the population using it, it's the whole institution is using for better outcomes. So I would say those 2 universes are very much in tandem with one another.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA: So I have a question for the audience, if I may. So how many digital health apps do you think exists in different app stores? There's an app for diabetes, losing weight, blood pressure. Like any guesses? It could be Play or the other app store.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: Thousands.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA: Thousands, like...</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH: Tens of thousands.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA: So the last I checked, this was like, 250,000-plus apps. Just -- there's an app for everything. Now my follow-on question, which is the crux of my point, how many of those apps actually connect to your medical record, percentage guess? Like 2%. Okay. So to me, when we are creating this app ecosystem and digital health innovations and if you don't meaningfully connect that to a patient's medical records, that all becomes a very scattered data, and I think that's my view on the digital health. It needs to be connected for patients and including the medical record.</p><p>OTHMAN LARAKI: I don't know if that's the right even metric of like defining as something being related to health because, in reality, I think there's like 3 different things that kind of get mixed when we're thinking about this. Like the first is that health that goes all the way from a basic human right to a luxury item, right? Like there's basic human right that if you're having a heart attack, someone should try to save you, all the way to going to a spa in the Swiss Alps, and that's a luxury item that's good for health. I think that's one dimension to it.</p><p>I think the second dimension is that the -- there is a component of technology that tends to correlate also with luxury. So you get the newest iPhone, if you're wealthier, et cetera. And so we tend to associate access to technology with kind of affluence.</p><p>But the third effect that I think is more important than the first 2 is that technology, historically, and I think, especially for health, is also a democratizer of access to services and products. And so like, I think, actually, like, over time, that's the way in which, really, we serve a lot of people much more effectively. So -- and so the -- like...</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: I actually want to pick on you a little bit there because you guys transitioned the business. When I first started reporting on Color, it was very much a cash business. And now it's -- you connect with a lot of insurance companies. So was that transition about trying to make the company less about serving the fortunate few?</p><p>OTHMAN LARAKI: It's actually interesting because it's -- initially, even the reason why we actually have a cash access is that we took a product that used to cost $5,000 and put a clinical-grade version of it at $250, which is still not nothing. But it made it much more accessible, right? And then -- but the -- but really, where we started working with payers, et cetera, is much more in terms of recognizing that there's not just one stakeholder in health care, right? Like it's kind of like there's individual, there's payers and the clinicians and really kind of incorporating those 3 together in the model, both from a product as well as a business model.</p><p>And it's been actually pretty been part of kind of how we've been working for quite a while. So like the kind of cash access is really about an access point for people, but -- yes.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: So I actually want to -- while we're on the topic of interoperability, which I think Aashima hinted that here with the 2% of apps that are connected into the medical record. So I write about digital health companies. I talk to them all the time, and they would love to be connected to the medical record. But there's all sorts of information blocking. It's not easy within the health care industry. Are we going to see movement on that this year because every year at JPMorgan, someone says -- someone gets up and says, \"I just don't have -- I'm a patient. I don't have access to my medical record.\" And you -- we have the same discussions, and it doesn't seem to change. So who's got some optimism from me on that front?</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA: I didn't hear the (inaudible) keynote, but I'm very hopeful that, in 2020, the information blocking rule will be passed. I think I'm very hopeful for that, but that's the crux of the problem that we see as a patient. I think it's more relatable as a consumer. If you go to your private care physician and you're looking for some tests from your specialist, that information is not there, and that's the reality. And unless we fix that interoperability problem, the digital health ecosystem will just become the shelves of applications with incomplete patient information. And this isn't also about behavior change, right? So that needs motivation, ability, trigger and connecting those different silos, and I think I'm hopeful. But the progress has been slow, but 2020 is the year.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: So I am going to take maybe a more optimistic perspective on this. I mean if you think about some of the challenges that sort of persisted inside the ecosystem that prevented that from happening. First, the plumbing didn't exist. So the capability to actually -- first, most of the data actually wasn't even digitized. So that's only happened in the last decade. Now that the data was digitized, the second thing was that you needed to standardize and normalize. And now we have standards. They are largely FHIR, but there are other important standards that exist that now allow that data interoperability.</p><p>The thing that you need after that effectively is the company is operating in a way that they allow that to actually flow in a liquid way, and that's happening at multiple levels. It's happening both at the commercial level, and there are meaningful discussions, both at the policy level as well, to make that much more of a -- I don't want to say a mandate, but it will be something that I think that the clarity in terms of the importance and the fluidity of that data will exist. And there are companies that do exist now to allow and enable an individual to aggregate and collect in a more meaningful way his or her own data.</p><p>The piece that's, honestly, is still missing is the demand from the individual. Now there are people who absolutely want to need their data, and that's beginning to emerge. And unfortunately, those situations tend to be rare diseases and so on and so forth. And those are terrible situations, and thank god that these changes and evolutions are happening. But what we need is to create the applications that create value for me as a consumer of that data that will drive the use cases. And so I think we're just in the beginning of that inflection point, whether it's clinical decision, support systems or more recreational use and some of these health and wellness apps that you're talking about. But that will certainly evolve, and it is evolving.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH: I'm highly optimistic that the interoperability will move big -- in a big way in this year. And the reasons are -- I actually slightly differ. I believe, actually, the whole focus on patient experience is going to be the biggest driver for change. It's going to push -- whether they are providers, whether they are payers or pharma, it's going to push the needle because they need systems which talk to one another to have a great consumer experience. So that's one part of it.</p><p>Secondly, I think the regulations and the whole industry actually betting on standards. The 21st Century Cures Act is a big initiative in that regard. But even the interoperability pledge that a lot of the top tech companies have taken is also making a concerted attempt into focusing on those foundations of interoperability. I think gone are the days when people think about just products. It's much more about ecosystems. And if those are to thrive, interoperability has to happen. So consumer is going to make the change.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: I'll be super optimistic. We've actually pulled in all the heterogeneous sets for all of the folks that we've served, run it through an ontologist so that we can homogenize some of the pieces. And it is available, and it's available down to a subset of those who -- those members. We're doing pretty careful stage to roll out and watching how people use it and what they use -- what those things look like. That set is also available for other outside partners, parties to come in and actually use, subject to sort of the use rules around what we should be able to use it for.</p><p>The data blocking thing, it is frustrating, especially when you sit back and you don't really think about what's happening. If I said to you, \"Hey, Chrissy, we're going to expose all of your notes from every conversation that you have with everybody in a public way.\" You'd probably retract from that quite a bit. And you might even go to the point of saying, \"I think I'm not going to keep my notes very carefully anymore.\"</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: Yes. I'd be burned in a fire.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: So you could see why a doctor or a health system, somebody would say, \"I'm not so sure I like that idea.\" Now there are other things that can be done if we've looked at claim and different types of disease states and do you need breadth of data, meaning everything that's going on? Or do you need depth of data? If you're in the ICU, depth of data turns out as super important. If you have a chronic condition and you're running around in a hospital, turns out breadth of data is way more important.</p><p>Now if you're running around, we're trying to think about sort of how to help you and how to engage, do I need to be able to have every single doctor note available and posted up for any vendor that comes to look at it? And the answer is probably no. In fact, actually, I would -- I bet all of us would be uncomfortable with that idea.</p><p>Right now, I'm in a camp where I would rather that -- I don't like data blocking, but that's a really big term that captures a whole bunch of different circumstances underneath it. The idea that you can't get access to anything, that seems problematic. The idea that you can't get access to everything, that doesn't seem problematic. It feels like if I got a patient in the ICU, I don't want to have whoever is creating that note to have a restriction in their own mind about. I don't want to write something down.</p><p>So -- and when we look across -- we've got about 50,000 or so physicians that are practicing in real exam rooms all over the place. So it's not -- everybody here knows that. But it's not just an insurance company there. There's all these doctors that are doing those things, too, and they have to think about those issues. And I think we actually owe those types of folks a little bit of deference in terms of what are they doing to practice and to -- and with all respect to the -- it's like a consumer industry. The sole device right here doesn't change very fast either. The software on it does change. But in health care, every interaction between a physician and a patient is a unique opportunity for and unique decision to be made. There are millions, if not billions, of experiments going on because you're at the edge of what we know from a science perspective. That's why some of the stuff that's happening at Color is actually really important for where the world is going to. This idea that change happens, figuring out how to capture that and then deploy it in a way that helps is the real issue.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH: Yes. I think...</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: Go ahead.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH: I just wanted to comment on one thing about information blocking, right? A very pertinent point about what does get exposed. But I think when I was talking about the legislations and how they are morphing also, we are talking about information blocking, but ONC is now also chartered with the target of what are the things that are not information blocking. So that actually shows the realization that there are things which are information blocking and which are not. So the process, at least from a legislation standpoint, has evolved to a point that all these nuances are actually getting factored in.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: Yes. I mean I was just going to -- I'll jump in, but we can come back to this, which would -- which is that I also talk to physicians about this idea of opening up their notes. And there's definitely fear among the physician community that they're going to write that a patient is obese or difficult and what if that patient sees the note and what would ensue there, and I think there is something extremely valid to that concern.</p><p>But I want to also kind of bring up the privacy issue as well at this juncture because it's been in the press. This is -- when you mentioned any large tech company, Google, Amazon, the next word that you will often hear is privacy. And this certainly has come up for Google lately with the Ascension partnership.</p><p>So I wanted to start with Aashima there and see if you had anything more to share about that and what you're thinking kind of at this point but then broaden it up to the panel to think about how we can weigh the sort of the privacy versus some of the utility that might come out of opening up access to this information.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA: I'm glad you brought it up, Chrissy. From the Ascension work, we're very proud to be working with them. It is a long partnership with them. And if I look into what they're doing with us, it's no different than any other health system and health care companies who are coming to cloud to really migrate their data and with the intent to really gain analytics or build AI-enabled applications on top. So they are bringing digital to the cloud. It is private and secure environment for Ascension, and it's -- we have BAs with them. It's all protected. They have a key. They control the access.</p><p>The second project that we're working with them and other videos out there, it's intelligent layer on top. It's all [aiding] our search, which is to really look into a patient's history. And if you're looking at the patient's notes, it's cut, copy, cut, copy. And it's -- there -- this tool would enable their clinician and nurses to really, a, define information they need from the vast history and then being able to get that at the point of care so that they can make the informed decisions. And again, the -- there is that skepticism around tech companies, but it is no different than people leveraging cloud, and we are modernizing their infrastructure. Like if you look into the TechCrunch report, which was 2 days ago, billions of DICOM images because the medical center storage was not secure. It's out there. It has PHI, right? That's news there.</p><p>So moving to cloud there, that's what essentially you should realize is that we need to modernize that layer, and they are doing this on-premise analytics and warehouse onto the cloud.</p><p>JEREMY SOHN: So maybe just to state, hopefully, the obvious. I mean, from a pharma perspective, I mean, obviously, we hold patient identity and privacy as extremely important. And maybe the industry itself, the broader health care industry can learn from some of the models that we have, which are good and bad in many respects. They're meeting and -- but they're also empowering. So we, by nature, we have an informed consent process. We don't necessarily need to implement it in the same way, but that's the challenge, right? Because the reality is, is when you ask the vast majority of people, would they contribute their data, their personal data for research purposes, and in particular, for health care, the vast majority of people say, yes, right? And so it's really just a transparency and an ordering process of instead of finding out that your data is actually being used for research after the fact, let's just ask for that up-front. So I think it's that change, that shift that really needs to happen, and we do that, thankfully, already for good reasons inside the pharma industry. And hopefully, the rest of the health care market will catch up.</p><p>I do think it's equally important for all of us to recognize that the evolution of technology and the vast amount of data that's being aggregated and the ability to actually do pattern recognition means that also the ocean of identity and privacy is also going to be changing. And so beyond even that consent, I think we have to think about those things differently. What is PHI? What is identity? What is privacy?</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: What's it mean to be de-identified?</p><p>JEREMY SOHN: Or to be even de-identified, exactly. And certainly, as we look at multi-omic imprints, but not even that. I mean if I go to the same -- if you look at completely de-identified sort of data sets associated with, well, maybe not me in work because I'm in a different city every day. But like for most people, I mean, you could pretty much map out in a completely de-identified data set that, that's Jeremy Sohn, right, or that's you. And so identity means to me...</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: That's kind of terrifying, right, just to mention that.</p><p>JEREMY SOHN: Yes. It's terrifying. It's terrifying. So the trust relationship, maybe the transparency needs to shift to transparency in terms of what are you doing with that data? How do I know -- how do I actually get visibility to where my data is flowing and how it's being used. And then we can then think about, all right, how do I now sort of create limitations around the edges of that use because that's super hard.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: [Identity] can go both ways, right? Like, because now you also have the ability to know what is being done with your data and much more so than it ever was possible before. So I totally agree with Jeremy about the -- at least what we've seen is like over 80% in clinical care context, people actually are very willing to contribute honestly to research, especially when they -- when it's made up-front. And the -- but I think the...</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: Can I make a point to you? I would be willing -- just personally would be willing to show a lot of my health information with different entities up here, but I would not be willing to share it with you because of the loophole with how -- maybe -- but because of the -- because of GINA and the law against genetic discrimination doesn't cover long-term care, life insurance and disability. So for me, I just -- I don't see the regulations protecting me as a consumer to make it sort of worth my while to give you my genetic information, if it could be used against me.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: So I think that's an interesting point. Like, I mean, that's -- I think there's -- and fundamentally, one thing to realize is that those are limitations in our kind of current like legal framework, not -- they're not connected to the actual technology in itself, right? When all is said and done, all that genetics does is that it's a way to generate a high amount of signal that can be used for your health. And now we're at a point where that signal can be used in a life-saving fashion, right? The ability to control the use of our data and to stop it from being misused, I think that is something that is fundamental to kind of like the trust relationship that, not just like in genetics, but through all of health care, is part of the contract, right. Like the -- that's what the ACA had a very big impact on that in terms of like preexisting conditions, et cetera. But I think that's actually a part of the long arc of data's relationship with health care.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: I think that's where the...</p><p>JEREMY SOHN: Sorry, I just want to make one slight joke, but we should ask Ken because my guess is your genetic information is going to be interesting but less informative than probably de-identified data on what you ate, where you went, how often you sleep...</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: Amazon probably has that.</p><p>JEREMY SOHN: So on and so forth in terms of your potential cost to the health care system or who you're friends with.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: I'm just going to stay silent on this one.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA: I was going to say the work that Kevin aligns and the different industry groups are proposing and doing around consumer-directed data exchange because to your point, you should have that right to share and maybe not of Color, maybe with the other entities. So that choices with consumer, but that consumer-directed exchanges are still -- sometimes is growing. And good work being done by Kevin and a few others to push that ball forward.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH: From a Salesforce perspective, from our perspective, trust is the highest way. So privacy, as was mentioned, informed consent, I think that should be the bedrock of privacy. The consumer should know where the data is, how is it getting used. It should be nondiscriminatory. At the same time, all the time understanding and getting educated on the whole process of how it is getting used is extremely important.</p><p>One point I would mention, the ability to rework after having given data because there are certain discussions that are happening. \"Hey, once we have given the data, we want to actually use it, and it's very valuable.\" I think the revocation piece is extremely important.</p><p>I think one other part is I think technology is improving enough that there was a point about anonymized data. You still can point to things pointing back to that individual. I think with the advances in technology, we can actually build the foundation that the anonymized data at least remains, for all intents and purposes, anonymized.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: Any thoughts from the insurance perspective?</p><p>KEN EHLERT: There is nothing more to beat up on this topic. It's -- well, actually, there is a small piece. Trust with data, it is an important thing. Consumer trust is one thing. In health, trust takes on a new dimension that I think is important to appreciate. One of the things that you need to trust is that the information that you're getting is accurate. So if I do a search on something and I brought something back if that's ordered by who's sponsoring that or whatever. And I'm not making a knock on a business model at all. But if the things are at the top, are those ad sponsored? Or are those the things that really are going to be most helpful to me in what I'm doing. In health, that actually takes on in very real ways, life and death type situations. So to take a really easy answer or a really easy situation. if you take out -- on an annual basis, we have about 1.6 million, 1.7 million cancer -- can really diagnose cancer cases. And in the example, I apologize because I guarantee I'm going to touch on somebody's personal situation in the room. But if we take out the top 4: breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, that leaves about half the cases left. In the rest of the cases, you max out at about 20,000 cases a year. We have 10,000 medical oncologists in this country. And all the Roka scientists in the room will really quickly go that's an average of 2 cases per oncologist per year. In reality, you have some that only see a case like that one every other year or every third year. On the other extreme, you have some people who kind of specialize in that type of case. But when cancer happens to you, almost always, it only happens once. And so the idea that I need to talk to somebody right now to figure out not just what type of cancer I have, I got to get back all the way up to who should I go see. I could do a Google search and say -- or any other search engine. But since you have 90% share, we'll go with that. You could do a Google search and say, \"Okay. Show me oncologists close by me.\" But if the oncologist close by you has only seen a case like once last year, that's not a good oncologist to have, implementing a brand new cutting-edge therapy that just came out, that might have serious consequences to it. Or do you go talk to your primary care physician? Or do you go to your social media network and say, \"Hey, I have cancer. Where should I go?\" And then somebody responds with, \"Well, my uncle had prostate cancer, and so you should go here.\" Not even thinking about prostate cancer, it's almost always with the urologist. And maybe you have lung cancer, and that's, by the way, different organ systems.</p><p>So the idea that, that information is being used to guide what happens next to you is an element of trust that we don't talk about very often. We talk about -- I need to trust that -- I mean, we have data with Google. It sits in there. It's protected. It would be like the world's largest lawsuit if that protective lock-and-key data became unlocked. That's not going to happen. We have stuff with Salesforce. The same thing. It's not going to happen. We have business-to-business trust that they're actually protecting the data. But that next level when the patient calls up, which, by the way, is one of the most frequent phone calls we get, I have a serious condition. Where do I go? Now there's a new level of trust that's actually necessary in that transaction about what happens next.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: Yes. Great point. So I wanted to kind of raise another issue about something that seems fairly unique to me about health care, which is that I have colleagues that cover other areas like education technology, and fintech is another one. And in the course of the past 10 years of their reporting, you've seen so much infiltration of disruptive technology into the space, and it's really moved in leaps and bounds. But with my sector, it seems to be much slower, much harder. There's a lot more failure. I mean, not to pick on Google, but Google Health didn't work. We had -- Microsoft HealthVault just shut down. It hasn't been an easy road. So would anybody comment on just is health care more challenging? And is that a good thing because you're talking -- unlike fintech, I mean, it's certainly important, but lives aren't at stake in the same way.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH: Let me take a first crack at it. I think the point about Microsoft Health or Google Health kind of not getting the same amount of traction was fundamentally focused on the fact that they were relying on the patient actually collecting all the data. Fundamentally, that was -- now if you compare it with Apple, the way they are trying to do it, it is -- they are mediating across different EHRs hitting that information, the success is much higher.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: Is anybody in the room, by the way, using Apple Health records to access their health information?</p><p>JEREMY SOHN: It's a small number, reinforces my point. There aren't use cases yet for it.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: Check this out. though. Is anybody in the room ever had a claim processed?</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA: So I think there's a different angle to that from the complexity, Chrissy. Health care, again, having spent years in Kaiser Permanente, the health IT landscape is pretty complex. So it's not a big tech or a health care or start wave. There's an ecosystem problem to really push the needle forward. Now we talked about the trust from the consumer standpoint. Let me ask another query, again, to the audience. Let's say I'm a big health system. I'm really looking to reach out to my population for female aged 45 to 55 who have a BRCA1, BRCA2 gene , and I really want them to come back to get a mammogram done. And they have insurance, and the insurance allows for the test included. And I want to reach out to that population today. How many people think you can do that query today? Like you -- that's the internal. You have the systems, and it's not the vast information, but in the -- do you think how easy to do that query?</p><p>KEN EHLERT: Health systems allow or...</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA: As a health system, for them to make that outreach to the patient population, to reach out to folks so that they can get the mammogram done, like screening, because your health information is in HR, your membership system is completely -- and then your DICOM images are sitting in some PACS system. So today, the problem is all data silos are very much reality of health care. And I know we talk about standards, and there's that -- it's true that HL7 standards have done a phenomenal job, and FHIR is new and up and coming. But just because a new standard exists, do you think you can map your back-end system to the new standard? Is it magic? It's hard work. It takes years, mapping around thousands of fields for millions of patients with validation. It takes years for them to take that leap. These systems have been built for many, many decades in the past. And for them to take leap forward, it's very humbling. It's hard.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH: Chrissy, I was trying to quote the example of Microsoft and Google, right? From a personal -- I think this circumstance was different. My belief is that the technology adoption in health care is definitely slower. If you look at telecommunications, they have digitized their whole processes. In case of health care, the silos are huge, and the focus on interoperability has been very slower. If those 2 things have changed, the adoption of all these new technologies should be as easy as in any other case. I think it's a matter of telecommunication. Their interoperability standards are equally important. You try to get a cell phone, changing it, making it easy, you can do everything online. Try doing that in health care. One silo doesn't talk to the other.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: Yes. They use -- I mean you used to keep your phone number hostage, and now they don't. And in health care, I think we still think that we have to trap patients inside the health system and...</p><p>OTHMAN LARAKI: And also at a different phase of the digitization of the industry. Like, I mean, this actually, like right now, health care feels like the mobile industry felt in the early 2000s. And like, for example, now Vodafone was the product of, I think, like done dozens of acquisitions. And they still were running literally like 20 different billing systems internally. And so if you moved states, they could not like we can see your bills, et cetera. So you have like very similar problems actually. And so I think just the -- I think health care is maybe just at a different part of the cycle. It's probably actually not even that more complex than telecoms in practice. It's probably just that we are kind of still in the earlier phase of ingesting technology and as a...</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA: I think we need interoperability to be real. There's no death of ideas in health care. These ideas need execution, and those execution need doers, and those doers need tech to really make it happen. Like we talked about air mapping from much a 75. It's a pretty massive undertaking by itself. So what can we do to bring those tools together?</p><p>The -- one other example I was going to use was we talk about interoperability, and I've been saying that both as been before joining Google as Apigee in launching interoperability with (inaudible) and then (inaudible) with Kaiser. Each year, we go to conferences. We say interoperability, and we sound innovative, but it has not moved. Right. We keep saying this word, but it relay needs actions, doers, and doers need tech. And I think we need to be building those tools to help the health care industry to move forward.</p><p>JEREMY SOHN: So I should preface this, but I think I spend every day -- every minute of the day arguing that we can be faster, and we could be better, and it's just too slow. So I preface by saying that. But in a reality check, the statement that health care is not innovating in speed, I don't think is a fair comment for a whole host of reasons. I mean we could look at many examples.</p><p>I mean we are now in an age where we are curing disease. Started in hep C, and now we're doing it in cancer. And thank god for cell and gene therapy and many other next-generation technologies, technologies, not health care, technologies. We are literally eradicating certain forms of disease, unheard of.</p><p>15, 20 years ago, the health care system was all run on paper. You would go to the doctor's office, okay? You would -- they would take the file. They had carbon copies of your documentation. I mean that's how we ran clinical trials. And so the entire industry is now digitized. It hasn't been perfect because, as everyone has described, in some sense, we are in a 3-sided marketplace, a 4-sided marketplace, maybe even a 6-sided marketplace, and that absolutely creates challenges, right, challenges that are super frustrating, right, for -- I'm an entrepreneur, actually, before I came to Novartis. But the reality is that there's a tremendous amount of change, and I keep going on.</p><p>In the third -- you made a point earlier,that may be sort of less second-world, third-world countries don't necessarily benefit from digital health. In fact, some of the most exciting opportunities are happening there. And we do a lot of our innovation work I think actually wrongly. We should be doing it in third-world countries or in smaller countries, but we should be doing it in both, in first-world countries and in those countries. But why? Because we're in Ghana, and we are distributing life-saving medicine by drones. Think about that for a second. We're not doing that here yet, right, but we are absolutely beginning to do that in third-world countries because we can, right? In third-world countries, the infrastructure, it doesn't need to be replaced because it's being built. And so a lot of the frustration is the 6-sided marketplace and the established institutions. And that's a good thing, and it's a bad thing. But it's absolutely happening, and we should celebrate it, and we should continue to struggle through it and fight for making it faster.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: I agree.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH: I just have one element. The health care industry is innovating, right? Precision medicine. Color sitting right here is there. The fact is all the innovation is happening in the silos. The innovation from a patient experience is way behind as compared to other industries. I think that's the fundamental point. And those innovations are happening in those silos. As a result, the end consumer is actually not seeing the results of the connected system. That's at the heart of what fintech is doing much better. Because as part of my portfolio, I see them evolving across 7 different industries. That's a fundamental difference between health care and other industries.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: I don't think that's true.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH: That's a good discussion then.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: The outcome -- when you think about the outcome and experiencing the outcome of innovation, today, we have people that live that yesterday, they died. That is an outcome that is pretty hard to put a dollar amount or an experience or anything else around. That's a pretty darn good experience. There are babies that are born today that, 15 years ago, didn't stand a chance of making it a week. Jeremy is right. Innovation is happening everywhere at a pace that is absolutely incredible.</p><p>This idea around information and how it flows, though, I think people who are outside look at it through a lens of the wrong analogy. I understand the analogy of like the telecom industry. That's sort of true but mostly not. It's more like -- because, see, in telecom, we all use our phones every single day, lots of times. We don't all go to the hospital and go to the ICU and hang out there every single day with a new rare disease. It happens once. It happens twice. So it happens whatever it is. It's a lot more like show me the really cool digital app that tracks all of your home purchases that you've made this year. There isn't an app that tracks all of your home purchases because there are only like 5 people on the planet that buy lots of homes in the same year. The reality in health is that these things are so skewed, you have a few people that have a very few -- I'll stop right there. I'll stop mid-sentence.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: I was going to let you wrap it up with...</p><p>KEN EHLERT: We'll bring it out in the hall and have a different conversation.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR: We'll continue the conversation. Thank you so much to our panel. This is so much fun, and I love the discussion between all the different stakeholders today. So thank you very much.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: Thank you.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA: Thanks.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

I'm Blake Burman, in for Maria Bartiromo, and this is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president slamming Canada for -- quote -- \"ripping us off\" and warning Congress not to interfere as NAFTA talks continued.

He joins me next.</p><p>Plus: Congress set to grill tech execs later this week over claims that conservatives are being censored online.

I will talk to a former Kavanaugh clerk about what we can expect this week, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>And right out the gate this morning, President Trump renewing his attacks on Canada and NAFTA, warning our neighbors to the north that it will be out of a revised agreement if it doesn't concede to new terms. The president also warning Congress not to interfere with trade negotiations going forward, or he would terminate the trade deal altogether, all of this as the U.S. and Canada are set to restart trade talks a few days now on Wednesday.</p><p>Let's bring in the New York Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin. He sits on both the House Financial Services and House Foreign Affairs Committees.</p><p>And he joins us from New York this morning.</p><p>Hello, Congressman.</p><p>REP. LEE ZELDIN (R), NEW YORK: Good morning.</p><p>BURMAN: Good morning to you.</p><p>So there's a few ways to go forward with this on a potential revamped NAFTA. There could be a three-way deal between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. There could be two bilateral deals, one with Mexico and the U.S., one with Canada and the U.S., or there could be nothing as it relates to Canada.</p><p>Which side are you on?</p><p>ZELDIN: I think that the best thing for the United States is going to be to be able to get a deal that also includes Canada.</p><p>However, the president isn't going to just cut a deal with Canada just to cut one. He made a pledge during his campaign that he genuinely believes in that we can do better than NAFTA, that NAFTA has hurt us with regards to the businesses that we have lost, with regards to the millions of jobs that we have lost as well.</p><p>So, the president feels good about that deal that was cut with Mexico, and feels like he is a -- and he is -- in a good position negotiating with Canada with really important goals. So I would fall onto the side of being able to enter into a deal that includes Canada.</p><p>Our relations -- the United States and Canada, that trade relationship is vitally important. There's a long history. Next to United States and China, it is a massive trade relationship between the two nations. So it would be great for the United States to enter into a better deal with Canada, but not just to enter into one just to enter into one.</p><p>So option B ends up being, you enter into a better deal with Mexico. And then you just walk from NAFTA, and then maybe Canada decides to revisit some of the issues that are really important, like dairy, where there needs to be a concession on the part of the Canadians.</p><p>BURMAN: Yes, I know that's a big issue in New York.</p><p>You saw, I'm sure, that the tweet that President Trump sent out just yesterday. It was kind of a two-fold threat both to Canada and to Congress. This was the tweet right here from the president.</p><p>He said -- quote -- \"There is no political necessity to keep Canada in the new NAFTA deal. If we don't make a fair deal for the U.S. after decades of abuse, Canada will be out. Congress shouldn't interfere with these negotiations, or I will simply terminate NAFTA entirely, and we will be far better off.\"</p><p>So breaking that down, let's start with Congress.</p><p>Is there an appetite amongst your colleagues there, both Republicans and Democrats, to potentially give this president the trade deal and the trade win that he so desires?</p><p>ZELDIN: I think this really about giving the American economy a trade win, giving American workers and American companies the trade win. That is what I want as a member of Congress.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are other members of Congress who want political wins. They want to become the speaker of the House. They want to become chair of a committee in the House. They have taken a pledge to resist, oppose, impeach obstruct this president on everything and anything.</p><p>So there are 535 members of Congress. Many of us want what's best for the American worker and the American economy. Others want what is best in their goals to take down President Trump.</p><p>So as far as the president's tweet goes, I think that's a strong message to the members of Congress who want a political win, selfishly for themselves, because they want power not to mess around, because you're going to -- you're not only going to be hurting yourselves politically, but you're going to be, most importantly, hurting our country.</p><p>BURMAN: Just a couple more on this.</p><p>The dairy issue is a big one for New York, the state of which you are representative -- a representative in. If Canada doesn't move on that issue, might change your -- your potential vote one way or the next?</p><p>ZELDIN: I don't think that this administration -- I don't want to speak for the administration. And I don't know what I'm about to say is actually their position, but my impression is that they're not cutting a deal with - - with Canada where Canada is not budging at all with regards to dairy.</p><p>And this administration has taken a tough stance, a correct stance, fighting on behalf of many different businesses all across our country and for the American economy that Canada is going to have to make concessions as it relates to dairy.</p><p>I don't believe that this administration would be sending a deal to Congress with Canada where Canada makes no concessions on dairy. But, again, I'm just speculating.</p><p>BURMAN: Right.</p><p>OK, one last one on this, Congressman, before we move on. The chief negotiator for Canada earlier this week, on Friday actually, once this was racing to a deadline, was asked whether or not she essentially feels that the United States wants a deal, or at least is acting in good faith with all of this.</p><p>And this was her response. Watch here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUESTION: Do you think they're negotiating in good faith?</p><p>CHRYSTIA FREELAND, CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: Ambassador Lighthizer and his team through this negotiation have been working really, really hard.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: There was a pause there, and it wasn't a yes.</p><p>So, the Canadians seem, it believes -- or at least seems to be somewhat skeptical. And you saw the tweet from the president.</p><p>What we're in right now, is that just the ebbs and flows of negotiations, or is it possible that these two just cannot get to a middle ground at some point?</p><p>ZELDIN: Well, the president is operating from a position of strength, not weakness.</p><p>With regards to American foreign policy all across the globe, it is important for us to be operating from positions of strength, and not to just concede that. And what we have seen in the past is -- one of the analogies I like to use, Texas hold'em, the best starting hand are pocket aces.</p><p>The worst are the two -- the two, seven off-suit. The United States inherits, the president of the United States, we inherit those pocket aces. And sometimes, as a negotiating strategy, we feel guilty about it. We apologize for American exceptionalism. We trade in our pocket aces. You say, you play these. I will play your two, seven off-suit.</p><p>Now, the United States has the largest economy in the entire world. The president understands that. He's leveraging it correctly. And he -- and his job is to represent America, just like Canada is saying they're not going to enter into a deal that's not in the best interest of Canada. That's a fair position on the part of the Canadians.</p><p>But the president's position is one that's a position of strength, that is leveraging the United States economy well, and is not going to just take a position of weakness to grab one, and isn't going to just cut a deal with Canada just to cut one.</p><p>BURMAN: All right, I want to move on here.</p><p>The president, as we know, he has been has been critical of Canada. He has also been very critical of his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions. He was asked in a Bloomberg interview in the White House in the Oval Office earlier this week, essentially saying that Sessions has his job, the attorney general does, until the November election.</p><p>And then he was asked, well, what about after that?</p><p>And here's what the president said -- quote -- \"I don't want to comment on it. Look, I just would love to have him do a great job. And I would love to have him look at the other side.\"</p><p>It appears, Congressmen, that the attorney general, his time as attorney general, essentially has an expiration date on it. Is that the way to view this?</p><p>ZELDIN: Could be. I don't know what the president's thinking is. I don't know what A.G. Sessions' thinking is.</p><p>I believe that the attorney general should revisit the scope of his recusal in what we're -- I mean, what we're working every day on, especially on other networks, where it's just 24/7 wall-to-wall coverage 365 about trying to take this president down, is that the attorney general, because of the scope of his refusal, almost seems like he's not in charge of the Justice Department, that he's recused himself out of a large portion of his job in what is by far the highest-profile role that the Justice Department is playing right now in American politics.</p><p>So it would be great to have an attorney general, whether that's Attorney General Sessions or someone else, it'd be great to have an attorney general who is completely in charge of the Justice Department.</p><p>And, unfortunately, we're at the case right now where you have a special counsel that gets created in order to look into Russian interference, and it appears like the scope of that investigation has gone so far beyond the scope of why it was created, that that needs to be refocused, that needs to be narrowed, and, in many respects, it needs to be ended, where you have six million different -- it's a six million-headed monster right now.</p><p>So, if they're -- if they are looking at 17 different things, well, the perception is that they're looking at six million different things. And they created those clouds.</p><p>So if you have no evidence that President Trump colluded with the Russians, just come out and say it. Let's clear up some of those clouds, so the American people can move forward.</p><p>BURMAN: You say it needs to be ended. We are almost 60 days until the November election. It's Thursday or Friday is the 60-day mark.</p><p>In your, mind if Bob Mueller has something or anything of significance, does it need to come out before the end of this week, so that there is some distance between then and the end of the election? Or should he wait if he potentially has something until after the election?</p><p>ZELDIN: I mean, if there's anything that is damaging that he wants to come out with, the closer that you get to November, the more it ends up influencing the political process.</p><p>So if there's something that he's planning on coming out that is damaging to someone, something, it's best that it comes out right now. Now, between now and November, if -- if there's any dead ends that he is aware of, where there is a cloud over a particular -- a person or a party or a company, he can come out with that information anytime between now and November, because the American public needs to have as much information as possible as to what they have decided wasn't done, where there wasn't any wrongdoing.</p><p>But if there's anything damaging that he has that he's going to come out with between now and November, it really should -- it really should come out now.</p><p>BURMAN: Congressman Lee Zeldin, joining us from Southampton, New York, this morning, I'm sure it is beautiful out there on this holiday weekend. So we thank you for stopping in and joining us. Thanks, sir.</p><p>ZELDIN: You got it.</p><p>BURMAN: Coming up: Can Apple be used as a bargaining chip to defuse trade tensions between the U.S. and China? And might the Chinese use it as one?</p><p>My next guest says Beijing not prepared for a long-term struggle with Washington. Asia expert Gordon Chang joins me with his unique take coming up.</p><p>And, remember, you can follow us at @SundayFutures right there, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BURMAN: Welcome back.</p><p>Could be a big week on the trade front, as President Trump potentially could slap further tariffs, up to 25 percent, on an additional $200 billion worth of imports from China.</p><p>The latest volley in the growing trade war, as some would call it, could hurt American companies with interests inside that country. And some analysts warn that Beijing could use Apple and other blue chips to tip the scales in their favor.</p><p>Gordon Chang is the author of \"The Coming Collapse of China.\"</p><p>And he joins us live in studio this morning.</p><p>Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\": Thanks, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN: So we're hearing that, I'm hearing that the president's talked about this possibility of putting the $200 billion worth of tariffs further on China at some point this week. The public comment period, as you know, ends on Wednesday. So it could happen after that.</p><p>What do you think the president's going to do, and what do you think he should do?</p><p>CHANG: Well, I think he should put the tariffs on the $200 billion of goods. He should do it at the 25 percent rate, rather than the 10.</p><p>I would even go higher. And the reason is, the Chinese have been stealing hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. intellectual property each year. That's what these tariffs are intended to remedy. And the Chinese are not stopping.</p><p>So, clearly, we got to make the costs higher.</p><p>BURMAN: I know you call this a tech war, not a trade war, because of that I.P. theft, but the Chinese have not given any indication whatsoever that they're going to back off that position.</p><p>So would tariffs even move them off it? Because they haven't -- haven't yet.</p><p>CHANG: Yes, tariffs may not do it. And we may have to put like 100 percent tariffs on $505.5 billion worth of goods, which is we what imported.</p><p>BURMAN: That's not going to happen, though, right?</p><p>CHANG: Well, you never know.</p><p>But the point is, if tariffs don't work, then we have to go to something even more drastic, which would be just banning Chinese imports. But one way or another, we have got to stop China's theft, because we have an innovation-based economy. If we cannot commercialize that innovation, we don't have very much of an economy.</p><p>So we have our backs against the wall. And you can't run. And I know there's going to be costs to the U.S., but you just can't run decades of bad trade policy and think, oh, we can get out of this without cost to ourselves.</p><p>BURMAN: Here was the -- the statement from the White House earlier this week that President Trump tweeted out.</p><p>He said -- quote -- or the White House statement -- quote -- \"As for the U.S.-China trade disputes and other differences, they will be resolved in time by President Trump and China's great President Xi Jinping. That relationship and bond remain very strong.\"</p><p>Where does this end? I mean, you just floated the possibility of 100 percent tariffs, not that the administration has said that they're doing that.</p><p>CHANG: No. No.</p><p>BURMAN: But what's the finish line here?</p><p>CHANG: Well, the finish line is probably not months. It's probably years or maybe even a decade.</p><p>We did have a trade arrangement with China last spring. It didn't sustain. It didn't hold. So President Trump could have a deal with Xi Jinping, and I don't think it's going to hold, because he's seen -- Xi Jinping has decided not to give up.</p><p>He has lost some influence recently. He came out of the recent meetings at -- sort of diminished. So he realizes that, if he gives up, he's going to be eroded even further. So I think he's going to try to bluff Trump into making concessions where we don't really have to.</p><p>BURMAN: You talk -- we talk about, in the greater scheme of things, the U.S. vs. China, but the companies within the United States are really the ones that bear the benefits or the cost.</p><p>You think the company that potentially has the biggest exposure here is Apple, which is the biggest United States company. Why do you think that?</p><p>CHANG: Well, first of all, we know the Chinese have gone after Apple. They did that in March 2013. They did it in the beginning of last month, where they talked about how Apple had to give more to the Chinese if they wanted to stay in the country.</p><p>That was almost extortion. But the, really, reason why Apple has a problem is because it has a supply chain that's very difficult to move. It's got Foxconn, its contract manufacturer. They're in China. It would take a number of years for Foxconn and Apple to move elsewhere.</p><p>Other companies, basically, they can move a lot quicker, with perhaps the exception of the pharmaceuticals. But everybody else can move their supply chains quickly. So China's threats against other companies are pretty hollow. Against Apple, it's a real threat.</p><p>BURMAN: Real quick, North Korea, the president now is back to the argument that the Chinese are not acting the way that he would like to see fit as it relates to North Korea.</p><p>We're now a couple months past the summit. Where do you think things stand with -- with the North Koreans? And the president is starting to make this argument now -- or he has been for a little while -- no missile tests, they haven't been firing off rockets.</p><p>Is that a -- moving of the goalposts, or is that a fair metric for us to judge this whole situation by?</p><p>CHANG: It's a fair metric, but we have got to remember, in the past, there have been long periods where the North Koreans didn't test and they started to test again</p><p>What we're going to have to do is go back to that maximum pressure campaign that made President Trump so successful up to the end of May. Since that time, he's tried to create this really friendly environment. It hasn't worked.</p><p>The North Koreans are not taking advantage of that one-shot opportunity the president is giving them. So he's got to go back to sanctions. And, unfortunately, it's going to be difficult. But the North Koreans, again, are not leaving us with much of a choice.</p><p>BURMAN: I was going to say, real quickly, if you think sanctions for the North Koreans, you would go full-throttle on that? Real quick.</p><p>CHANG: Especially the Chinese banks and the Russians and increasingly the South Koreans.</p><p>BURMAN: Gordon Chang, thank you for joining us this morning. Big week ahead. We will see where it takes us.</p><p>CHANG: Thanks, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN: Appreciate it.</p><p>Meantime, coming up: top social media executives set to once again make their way to Capitol Hill amid growing public outcry over what many consider to be anti-conservative censorship online.</p><p>House Energy and Commerce Committee member Leonard Lance joins us next with his take, as we look ahead this Sunday morning on a holiday weekend on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>BURMAN: Welcome back.</p><p>Top executives from Facebook and Twitter set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee later this week, as the social media giant has faced accusations of anti-conservative censorships on their platforms.</p><p>Their most vocal critic? President Trump, pledging his administration will not let tech companies -- quote -- \"control what we can and cannot see.\"</p><p>Joining me now is the New Jersey Congressman Leonard Lance. He is a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p><p>Thank you for joining us in studio this morning.</p><p>REP. LEONARD LANCE (R), NEW JERSEY: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BURMAN: There's a couple different hearings.</p><p>The Senate side is more on how these tech companies can -- can help out with elections, and et cetera. On your side, you have got Jack Dorsey in the hot seat and what many view as a bias of these social media companies against conservatives.</p><p>You plan to ask the Twitter CEO what?</p><p>LANCE: Whether there is bias and why, based upon their algorithm, they may have chosen certain content over other content.</p><p>It will be a busy day for Mr. Dorsey. He will be at the Senate first and then he comes over to our side of the Congress, to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>BURMAN: So I guess the question is, do you think that, if there -- if you think there is bias, do you think it's purposely being directed at conservatives, at Republicans? And if it is, Twitter's a massive company.</p><p>Is there anything that you could even do about it?</p><p>LANCE: I don't know whether it's intentional or not, but we intend to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>And this is based upon our majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, who is very strong on this issue. And he has worked with the chairman of the committee, Greg Walden of Oregon. And we intend to get to the bottom of it. And, of course, the American people demand fairness and not bias in any way, shape, or form.</p><p>BURMAN: Of course, the follow-up here is -- is regulation, right, whether this company, other big tech companies need to be regulated.</p><p>The president specifically earlier this week, on Twitter, and then there were a lot of questions after it, took on Google. And this was the question that was posed to President Trump. Watch it real quick about regulation and Google. Watch here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You know what we want? Not regulation. We want fairness. When we have fairness, we are all very happy.</p><p>But you're talking about a tremendous amount. I mean, I'm president. They got me here. You're talking about a tremendous number of people. We want to see fairness.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: So the president there wouldn't wholeheartedly endorse regulation. It's kind of a political catch-22 for him, because he's been talking about one of his big prizes is how they have been able to slash regulation over the first 18, 19 months of his presidency.</p><p>So if you endorse it, it's kind of backing something that you want to essentially unwind. Do these companies needs to be regulated?</p><p>LANCE: They need to be fair.</p><p>And I think the president is 100 percent accurate. Let's see if they can be fair. And I don't favor over-regulation. I favor a free and fair Internet. And so let's get to the bottom of it. And I agree with the president.</p><p>BURMAN: If they are regulated, how would you even go about that? How on Congress would that get done?</p><p>LANCE: That would be a challenging endeavor.</p><p>And, of course, I favor what is known as the BROWSER Act by Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. And that relates to this whole issue.</p><p>But, first, let's get to the bottom of it.</p><p>BURMAN: Here was the statement that Google put out as it relates to Google. They said this -- quote -- \"Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our resorts\" -- \"results,\" rather, \"toward any political ideology.\"</p><p>A spokesperson goes on to say: \"We continually work to improve Google search, and we never ranked search results to manipulate political sentiment.\"</p><p>That's Google's take.</p><p>Do you believe them?</p><p>LANCE: We will see what is said on Capitol Hill this week.</p><p>I am a cautious lawyer, but we ought to get to the bottom of it. And that is why we're holding our hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee.</p><p>BURMAN: All right, the president also brought up the issue of antitrust. So you could go at it through potentially regulation. He brought up the issue of maybe there's an antitrust issue.</p><p>This is what the president said in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this week. He said -- quote -- \"I won't comment on the breaking up, whether that's that -- meaning Google -- \"or Amazon or Facebook.\"</p><p>He went on to say: \"As you know, many people think it's a very antitrust situation, the three of them, but I just -- I won't comment on that.\"</p><p>Antitrust issues here?</p><p>LANCE: Potentially.</p><p>But that would be referred to the Department of Justice. And I don't know whether it actually qualifies as an antitrust violation. But, first, we on Capitol Hill are going to see whether or not there is bias, intentional or otherwise.</p><p>BURMAN: So I guess the big picture here is just that. Is the bias intentional? Is it unintentional?</p><p>We're at the dawn of the Internet age, right? Like, these companies are just a handful of years old. Is it possible that they're just trying to work their way through some things, or is it simply this is Silicon Valley trying to target Republicans here?</p><p>LANCE: I hope it's not the latter. I hope that it's a situation where the company is just trying to work through this situation.</p><p>But there are some concerns regarding the fact that it might be deliberate. I don't reach that conclusion yet. That's why we're holding the hearing.</p><p>BURMAN: You got Dorsey in the hot seat. Do you want to see Bezos? You have already had Zuckerberg. Do you want to continue to pull these people in there? You think anything enlightening can come from it?</p><p>LANCE: Yes, I think the testimony of Mark Zuckerberg was very enlightening, when he came before the committee in the spring.</p><p>I think that he may have violated, his company may have violated a consent agreement with the FTC in 2011. I asked him specifically about that. And I asked him whether he had a position the BROWSER legislation, and he's yet to get back to us on that.</p><p>BURMAN: OK, wait and see, I guess. And we will see what happens this week.</p><p>Congressman Leonard Lance, thank you for joining us this morning. We appreciate it.</p><p>LANCE: Thank you very much.</p><p>BURMAN: Meantime, coming up, Democrats denouncing a -- quote -- \"document massacre,\" as the Trump administration keeps thousands of pages of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's White House work history from the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p><p>How this could affect questioning at Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings coming up later this week, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>BURMAN: Welcome back.</p><p>It looks like the Democrats have lost a weeks-long battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's paper trail from his years working in the White House of President George W. Bush.</p><p>The Trump administration withholding more than 100,000 pages of document -- documents, rather. They are citing executive privilege, with Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings set to begin just a couple days from now on Tuesday.</p><p>Let's bring our panel -- bring in the panel, rather.</p><p>Justin Walker is a former clerk for judge Kavanaugh and an assistant professor of law at the University of Louisville. Gregg Nunziata is a former chief nominations counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Thank you both for joining us this morning.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>GREGG NUNZIATA, FORMER SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHIEF NOMINATIONS COUNSEL: Good morning.</p><p>BURMAN: So, Gregg, you were there the last time -- and this would have been about a decade ago -- that Brett Kavanaugh was preparing for his nomination on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. You got a little bit of an insight as to what this last week or so might have been like for him.</p><p>What do you think it's been like?</p><p>NUNZIATA: Well, that, his previous confirmation hearings were pretty intense.</p><p>The D.C. Circuit is often called the second most important court in the country. And at the time, he was serving in the Bush White House. And a lot of Democrats kind of used him as a way of attacking the president.</p><p>So he's been through this before in a pretty tough environment. This is tougher still. And it's a week long of hearings, including two very lengthy marathon days of question and answers from senators, half of whom are going to be out there to try to trip him up.</p><p>So I'm sure he's been the careful lawyer he is. He's been studying his own record and studying existing law, Supreme Court precedent, and he will be prepared this week.</p><p>BURMAN: Justin, the best hope here for Democrats, it appears, is that there might be some needle in a haystack-type thing and one of these documents, in a page somewhere over his decades' worth long of being on the bench.</p><p>This was the reaction from the top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, as he posted this on Twitter about the withholding -- withholding of 100,000 or so pages of documents.</p><p>Here's what Schumer said. He wrote -- quote -- \"We're witnessing a Friday night document massacre. President Trump's decision to step in at the last moment and hide 100,000 pages of Judge Kavanaugh's records from the American public is not only unprecedented in the history of Supreme Court nominations. It has all the makings of a cover-up.\"</p><p>In a second sweet, Schumer goes on to say: \"What are they trying so desperately to hide?\"</p><p>Your response to that would be?</p><p>JUSTIN WALKER, FORMER CLERK FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH: Well, the only thing unprecedented is this kind of hyperbolic rhetoric from people like Chuck Schumer.</p><p>The truth is that there have been more documents produced for Judge Kavanaugh than for any nominee in history. And, moreover, the most important documents have been public all along. They are the opinions he's written, the opinions over 12 years on the second most important court in the country.</p><p>And if you look at those 300 opinions, you see a judge who always goes where the law leads, who understands the proper limited role of the judiciary, who is very much in the mainstream, and who has been endorsed by the Supreme Court on 13 separate occasions, an unparalleled record of vindication for a lower court judge.</p><p>BURMAN: White House officials that I have spoken with this week tell me that they don't feel that there's anything, sort of a needle in a haystack out there. That's their position. They have reason to feel confident, of course.</p><p>But I'm wondering, to the both of you -- and, Gregg, you can go first -- when you're preparing for something like this, how are you ever really just entirely confident that that's the case?</p><p>NUNZIATA: Well, you -- the Senate, the White House has dozens of lawyers looking through Judge Kavanaugh's public record, his personal life.</p><p>I mean, these things are gone over in detail. I don't think anybody should be expecting a big surprise from any of these documents or from the hearing today. And, as the professor says, I mean, his traditional record speaks for itself. And that's what the Senate should be focusing on.</p><p>If you want to know what kind of judge he will be on the Supreme Court, look at what kind of judge he's been on the D.C. Circuit for the last 10 years.</p><p>BURMAN: Justin, you clerked for him. What was he like?</p><p>WALKER: Oh, my goodness.</p><p>I have never met a better lawyer. I have never worked for a better man. I had him as a teacher at law school. He believes, he adheres -- he reveres the Constitution. And that comes across in his chambers.</p><p>One thing he used to tell us as clerks is, he would say, every case is a separation of powers case. And what he meant is that every case requires the judge to remember that it's the executive and the legislature who make the law and it's the judge who merely applies the law.</p><p>BURMAN: Justin, you were up there on the Senate Judiciary Committee. You know that there's a lot of preparation that goes into this. This will be splashed overall the networks, and rightfully so. People will follow this. There's going to be lots of questions, lots of answers, hours' worth, headlines, et cetera, on down the line.</p><p>But at the end of the day, 95, 96 of these 100 senators already have their minds made up. And it appears that conservatives -- that Republicans have the numbers. Does any of this -- I don't want to say it doesn't matter. But is it a formality, essentially, at this point, just waiting for the confirmation vote?</p><p>NUNZIATA: No, I think -- look, this is -- Supreme Court hearings are one of the few times that we as a country really stop to talk about and to focus on the role of the court in our system and what our Constitution means to us as Americans.</p><p>So I think it's important just in that sense alone. But beyond that, I mean, we do learn meaningful things about a nominee, about their background, their fitness for the court, and their judicial philosophy.</p><p>I think Americans are going to like what they hear when they hear from Judge Kavanaugh. I do think, the more they hear from him, the more inevitable his confirmation becomes. And, yes, there's a handful of votes in play, particularly Democrats from states which the president carried with a large margin in 2016.</p><p>I think they're going to be very interested in how these hearings go, and they're going to be very interested in what they hear from their voters who are watching.</p><p>BURMAN: Justin, how important is it to actually get Brett Kavanaugh confirmed by October 1, when the -- when the Supreme Court reconvenes?</p><p>Is it actually more important to get him in there by September 24, which is the first time that they meet behind closed doors, the week leading into this, or is it -- is it fine for the makeup of the court, forget the person, but just the function of the court as it moves forward, if he isn't in there for one reason or the next by October 1?</p><p>WALKER: Well, I think, from an institutional perspective, the sooner the better.</p><p>And I think, the Senate obviously has a role to play in advise and consent. It's a constitutional role. So I'm sure they will do that thoughtfully. And that takes some time.</p><p>But there's -- really, I see no reason why that can't be done by the end of September. And if the senators really take seriously the advise and consent function that the founders imagined, then we will be looking at a 100-0 confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>Unfortunately, that's not -- that's not the world we live in right now. We're going to see a lot of vicious attacks at the hearings this week. But I think what we will also see is a witness, a judge who's thoughtful and friendly and scholarly, and someone who really the people -- the American people really will like the more they learn about him.</p><p>BURMAN: Justin Walker, Gregg Nunziata, I know you will be watching. so will we. Thank you joining us this morning.</p><p>WALKER: Thanks, Blake.</p><p>NUNZIATA: Thanks for having us.</p><p>BURMAN: Yes.</p><p>And for all of you at home, make sure you stay with the FOX News Channel all this week, as the Senate begins its confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh.</p><p>Our special coverage starts on Tuesday.</p><p>So what can we expect at those hearings, now that Democrats are furious at the White House for withholding all of those documents, a lot of them, some of them?</p><p>Our political panel takes a look on this, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>BURMAN: Welcome back.</p><p>As you know by now, the confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh are set to start tomorrow.</p><p>The White House moved Friday night to withhold 100,000 pages worth of documents from his records in the Bush 43 White House. They cite executive privilege. Some Democrats are saying, uh-uh, not so.</p><p>Time now for our panel, Ed Rollins, former White House adviser to President Reagan, a FOX News contributor and affiliated with a conservative PAC that supports Kavanaugh's confirmation, we should add. And Al D'Amato is a former Republican senator from this state and a FOX News contributor as well.</p><p>Thanks for joining us this morning.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you.</p><p>BURMAN: Want to start, first, though, I'm sure it's been a tough last few days for the both of you with the proceedings, the services and the passing of Senator John McCain.</p><p>Just a word from you both?</p><p>ROLLINS: Yesterday was spectacular day.</p><p>I mean, we had have two funerals, on Friday for Aretha Franklin, which was a spectacular joining together of the black leadership of this country. Yesterday was a -- was a memorial to a very decent man who has basically been on the stage for 60 years.</p><p>And I think he staged it very well. It was his -- and it was a great song that Aretha sang which was called \"Respect.\"</p><p>BURMAN: Right.</p><p>ROLLINS: John McCain got his respect yesterday from the establishment.</p><p>Now, at the same time, the attack and the theme -- underlying theme was, this is the establishment and they were attacking Trump.</p><p>BURMAN: Right.</p><p>ROLLINS: Trump is not the establishment. Tomorrow, he goes back to -his control of -- and the world of John McCain didn't turn out to be quite what he wanted, in the sense that he wanted bipartisanship.</p><p>You won't see it again this week. You're going to see the hand grenades back thrown with Kavanaugh.</p><p>BURMAN: With Kavanaugh.</p><p>Al.</p><p>AL D'AMATO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You can't help but admire a great hero.</p><p>And why was he a great hero? In my mind, anyone who suffered the way he did, and yet refused to leave early -- he could have left I don't know how many years earlier. But he said, I'm not leaving prison and torture until the men who are in here with me and before me are released.</p><p>That's incredible. That's heroic. And, in my mind, he was always a very special person because of that. Did we always agree? Just like all of the people who spoke said, we had conflicts.</p><p>But he was a man of principle. He believed in what he did. He stood up, and he had the highest values for this country. And it was a great testimony that people recognized this.</p><p>BURMAN: Senator McCain to be buried today in Annapolis, Maryland.</p><p>You talked about what is coming up this week.</p><p>Senator, you have been through many of these Supreme Court hearings. You would say to Brett Kavanaugh -- what would be the advice that you would give him?</p><p>D'AMATO: Keep doing what you have been doing. He's been a fine jurist in the second highest court in the nation, the appellate court.</p><p>His work is outstanding. He is a scholar. Everyone admits that. He is a gentleman. He is a family person. And his record speaks for itself. So those who raise questions now about, oh, 100,000 documents, et cetera, that they'd like to see when he worked for the White House years ago, that's just an attempt to slow down the proceedings, to embarrass him.</p><p>But his record is going to carry him through. He will get all of the Republican votes. That's my opinion. And he will get several Democrats who will vote for him.</p><p>BURMAN: You -- on this show, I had asked you in the days before the president made the announcement, who do you want? You said Amy Coney Barrett. Now you're trying to get Kavanaugh confirmed.</p><p>Has it been a full embrace for you, now that he's the pick?</p><p>ROLLINS: Oh, totally. Totally. No, totally.</p><p>I thought a woman on the court, a conservative woman, would have been very important. And she may end up in the court before all is said here .</p><p>He's a superb choice. The document thing is ridiculous. These are President Bush's documents. These aren't his documents. Having worked on the White House staff, a couple White Houses, those aren't your documents. Those are the president's documents. And he was the staff secretary, so he touched everything, but he didn't write them.</p><p>And the idea that the Congress wants them, no president would give those up. So my sense is, he will get confirmed. It'll be a knock-down, drag- out. And all of the good wishes of yesterday's funeral are all by the wayside, and we're back -- we're back to warfare again come next Tuesday.</p><p>BURMAN: Real quick, Senator, Democrats hit him how, Kavanaugh?</p><p>D'AMATO: He will get several Democrats to vote for him.</p><p>BURMAN: Think so?</p><p>D'AMATO: Yes.</p><p>BURMAN: Manchin, Donnelly, Heitkamp, the folks that went for Gorsuch?</p><p>D'AMATO: Yes.</p><p>I think he will get two, if not three Democrats, and all of the Republicans, including Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski.</p><p>BURMAN: Fifty-two, fifty-three, fifty-four votes?</p><p>ROLLINS: And the new senator from Arizona.</p><p>BURMAN: And the new senator from Arizona. Exactly.</p><p>Doug Ducey has a selection and probably will unveil it soon.</p><p>Stay right with us, Ed Rollins, Senator D'Amato.</p><p>ROLLINS: Sure.</p><p>BURMAN: We will be right back with our panel after this, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>Stay with.</p><p>BURMAN: President Trump now having second thoughts about plans to cancel pay raises for federal employees.</p><p>We are back with our panel, Ed Rollins, Senator Al D'Amato.</p><p>Thanks for sticking around one again.</p><p>ROLLINS: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>BURMAN: This came from the president earlier this week, Wednesday, Thursday, basically saying, federal employees if you are not in the military, you're not going to get a pay raise, potentially look at the issue of merit-based pay.</p><p>If nothing else, for these employees, it's something you don't want to see. And on the political front, it's a -- it's not a good headline for this...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, you don't want to go -- you don't want to go to war with your employees. And the bottom line is that a 2 percent pay increase is not dramatic.</p><p>And my sense is, the savings, which is about $25 billion, in a $4 trillion budget, with a trillion-dollar deficit, it's not that significant. And I think it would be a very terrible thing for the morale of the employees.</p><p>BURMAN: How do you keep -- how do you keep qualified employees? Because, when you look back -- we were just talking about this. When you look back, President Obama froze it for three consecutive years. The economy was in a much different place in 2011 than it is in 2018 now.</p><p>But if you're a federal employee, over the last several years, you have barely seen a pay increase. Why stay if you can get a good private sector job?</p><p>D'AMATO: Well, you're absolutely right.</p><p>And you might want to save money, but there are better ways to do it. Look at the real problems of how the deficit is growing. Where is the spending? What do you do to resolve it?</p><p>You have Social Security, which if it continues on this pattern, runs out of money not too down -- far down the road. Same thing with Medicare.</p><p>So what do you do? Put together a bipartisan panel. It was done. President Reagan did it. And guess what? We saved Social Security. We strengthened it. You can do the same thing again.</p><p>Now, if we're going to talk about bringing the country together and bringing partisan politics, keeping it out, there are two areas where we could save trillions of dollars over the next decade if we came together.</p><p>And, by the way, it's not tough. You have people who are living longer. You should adjust the time that they can retire.</p><p>ROLLINS: I would argue you don't want to do it before a campaign season.</p><p>BURMAN: Before November.</p><p>ROLLINS: I would argue definitely that those are constituents.</p><p>And I think I think the bottom line is you -- it's one of these things it's going to take a year to do it, Al.</p><p>D'AMATO: Yes.</p><p>ROLLINS: It's not simple.</p><p>And I think, to a certain extent, the moment you mentioned Social Security, if you're Republican, you get banged over the head by every Democrat in the world.</p><p>BURMAN: Got about a minute left.</p><p>So, real quick, we're about 64, 65 days whatever it is...</p><p>ROLLINS: Right.</p><p>BURMAN: ... until November 7.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURMAN: Some interesting races this past week.</p><p>Where do you think things stand? What's the lay of the land, as we are here?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS: The lay of the land, quickly, is, there's three -- three Republican seats in the Senate that are in trouble, or at least potentially in trouble.</p><p>One is the Nevada seat of Heller, the Arizona seat, and the Tennessee seat, which are both open seats. They are competitive.</p><p>There are four or five Democrat seats that are -- that are competitive. And the House is very competitive. And it could go either way.</p><p>My sense is, they're our seats, so our guys have to lose it. And they have to fight hard.</p><p>BURMAN: Biggest worry as a Republican is what?</p><p>D'AMATO: I think the Republicans pick up two to three seats, the Democrats pick up two seats. So we will hold the Senate.</p><p>I think we have trouble in the House. Reapportionment, court decisions come down. Pennsylvania, we will lose a couple of seats. We may lose one in New York.</p><p>The chances are, at this point, we lose the House.</p><p>BURMAN: Really? You think so? Chances are?</p><p>D'AMATO: Yes, chances are.</p><p>BURMAN: Great chances or just coin flip-type stuff?</p><p>D'AMATO: Well, right now, I would say it's 60/40. It can turn, but, right now, we're in trouble in the House.</p><p>BURMAN: Ed, do you agree, real quick?</p><p>ROLLINS: I would argue it's truly, who's going to vote is the critical thing, and can we get our vote out? If we get our vote out, we're going to be OK. If we don't get our vote out, then, obviously, we could lose.</p><p>BURMAN: And you got 65 days, I believe, to do that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURMAN: So we will see what happens between now and November 7.</p><p>Thank you both for joining us. Appreciate it.</p><p>ROLLINS: Great. Thank you.</p><p>D'AMATO: Good being with you.</p><p>BURMAN: That does it this morning, believe it or not, for \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>I am Blake Burman, in for Maria Bartiromo. Maria will be back next week.</p><p>Make sure to watch both of us on the FOX Business Network as well.</p><p>\"Media Buzz With Howard Kurtz\" is coming up next.

I'm Blake Burman, in for Maria Bartiromo, and  this is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president slamming Canada for -- quote -- \"ripping us off\" and warning  Congress not to interfere as NAFTA talks continued.  So what's the impact  if a deal cannot be reached?  </p><p>Lee Zeldin is a member of the House Financial Services and Foreign Affairs  Committees.  He joins me next.  </p><p>Plus: Congress set to grill tech execs later this week over claims that  conservatives are being censored online.  The president calling for change,  but is regulation the right answer going forward?  Congressman Leonard  Lance will be questioning Twitter's CEO, and he is here this morning to  weigh in.  </p><p>Plus:  The White House says it is withholding 100,000 pages of Judge  Kavanaugh's records just days before his confirmation proceedings begin.  I  will talk to a former Kavanaugh clerk about what we can expect this week,  as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"  </p><p>And right out the gate this morning, President Trump renewing his attacks  on Canada and NAFTA, warning our neighbors to the north that it will be out  of a revised agreement if it doesn't concede to new terms.  The president  also warning Congress not to interfere with trade negotiations going  forward, or he would terminate the trade deal altogether, all of this as  the U.S. and Canada are set to restart trade talks a few days now on  Wednesday.  </p><p>Let's bring in the New York Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin.  He sits on  both the House Financial Services and House Foreign Affairs Committees.  </p><p>And he joins us from New York this morning.  </p><p>Hello, Congressman.  </p><p>REP. LEE ZELDIN (R), NEW YORK:  Good morning.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Good morning to you.  </p><p>So there's a few ways to go forward with this on a potential revamped  NAFTA.  There could be a three-way deal between the U.S., Mexico and  Canada.  There could be two bilateral deals, one with Mexico and the U.S.,  one with Canada and the U.S., or there could be nothing as it relates to  Canada.</p><p>Which side are you on?</p><p>ZELDIN:  I think that the best thing for the United States is going to be  to be able to get a deal that also includes Canada.</p><p>However, the president isn't going to just cut a deal with Canada just to  cut one.  He made a pledge during his campaign that he genuinely believes  in that we can do better than NAFTA, that NAFTA has hurt us with regards to  the businesses that we have lost, with regards to the millions of jobs that  we have lost as well.  </p><p>So, the president feels good about that deal that was cut with Mexico, and  feels like he is a -- and he is -- in a good position negotiating with  Canada with really important goals.  So I would fall onto the side of being  able to enter into a deal that includes Canada.</p><p>Our relations -- the United States and Canada, that trade relationship is  vitally important.  There's a long history.  Next to United States and  China, it is a massive trade relationship between the two nations.  So it  would be great for the United States to enter into a better deal with  Canada, but not just to enter into one just to enter into one.  </p><p>So option B ends up being, you enter into a better deal with Mexico.  And  then you just walk from NAFTA, and then maybe Canada decides to revisit  some of the issues that are really important, like dairy, where there needs  to be a concession on the part of the Canadians.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Yes, I know that's a big issue in New York.</p><p>You saw, I'm sure, that the tweet that President Trump sent out just  yesterday.  It was kind of a two-fold threat both to Canada and to  Congress.  This was the tweet right here from the president.</p><p>He said -- quote -- \"There is no political necessity to keep Canada in the  new NAFTA deal.  If we don't make a fair deal for the U.S. after decades of  abuse, Canada will be out.  Congress shouldn't interfere with these  negotiations, or I will simply terminate NAFTA entirely, and we will be far  better off.\"</p><p>So breaking that down, let's start with Congress.  </p><p>Is there an appetite amongst your colleagues there, both Republicans and  Democrats, to potentially give this president the trade deal and the trade  win that he so desires?</p><p>ZELDIN:  I think this really about giving the American economy a trade win,  giving American workers and American companies the trade win.  That is what  I want as a member of Congress.  </p><p>Unfortunately, there are other members of Congress who want political wins.   They want to become the speaker of the House.  They want to become chair of  a committee in the House.  They have taken a pledge to resist, oppose,  impeach obstruct this president on everything and anything.  </p><p>So there are 535 members of Congress.  Many of us want what's best for the  American worker and the American economy.  Others want what is best in  their goals to take down President Trump.</p><p>So as far as the president's tweet goes, I think that's a strong message to  the members of Congress who want a political win, selfishly for themselves,  because they want power not to mess around, because you're going to --  you're not only going to be hurting yourselves politically, but you're  going to be, most importantly, hurting our country.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Just a couple more on this.</p><p>The dairy issue is a big one for New York, the state of which you are  representative -- a representative in.  If Canada doesn't move on that  issue, might change your -- your potential vote one way or the next?</p><p>ZELDIN:  I don't think that this administration -- I don't want to speak  for the administration.  And I don't know what I'm about to say is actually  their position, but my impression is that they're not cutting a deal with - - with Canada where Canada is not budging at all with regards to dairy.  </p><p>And this administration has taken a tough stance, a correct stance,  fighting on behalf of many different businesses all across our country and  for the American economy that Canada is going to have to make concessions  as it relates to dairy.  </p><p>I don't believe that this administration would be sending a deal to  Congress with Canada where Canada makes no concessions on dairy.  But,  again, I'm just speculating.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Right.  </p><p>OK, one last one on this, Congressman, before we move on.  The chief  negotiator for Canada earlier this week, on Friday actually, once this was  racing to a deadline, was asked whether or not she essentially feels that  the United States wants a deal, or at least is acting in good faith with  all of this.  </p><p>And this was her response.  Watch here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUESTION:  Do you think they're negotiating in good faith?</p><p>CHRYSTIA FREELAND, CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  Ambassador Lighthizer and  his team through this negotiation have been working really, really hard.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  There was a pause there, and it wasn't a yes.  </p><p>So, the Canadians seem, it believes -- or at least seems to be somewhat  skeptical.  And you saw the tweet from the president.</p><p>What we're in right now, is that just the ebbs and flows of negotiations,  or is it possible that these two just cannot get to a middle ground at some  point?  </p><p>ZELDIN:  Well, the president is operating from a position of strength, not  weakness.</p><p>With regards to American foreign policy all across the globe, it is  important for us to be operating from positions of strength, and not to  just concede that.  And what we have seen in the past is -- one of the  analogies I like to use, Texas hold'em, the best starting hand are pocket  aces.</p><p>The worst are the two -- the two, seven off-suit.  The United States  inherits, the president of the United States, we inherit those pocket aces.   And sometimes, as a negotiating strategy, we feel guilty about it.  We  apologize for American exceptionalism.  We trade in our pocket aces.  You  say, you play these.  I will play your two, seven off-suit.  </p><p>Now, the United States has the largest economy in the entire world.  The  president understands that.  He's leveraging it correctly.  And he -- and  his job is to represent America, just like Canada is saying they're not  going to enter into a deal that's not in the best interest of Canada.   That's a fair position on the part of the Canadians.  </p><p>But the president's position is one that's a position of strength, that is  leveraging the United States economy well, and is not going to just take a  position of weakness to grab one, and isn't going to just cut a deal with  Canada just to cut one.  </p><p>BURMAN:  All right, I want to move on here.  </p><p>The president, as we know, he has been has been critical of Canada.  He has  also been very critical of his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions.  He was  asked in a Bloomberg interview in the White House in the Oval Office  earlier this week, essentially saying that Sessions has his job, the  attorney general does, until the November election.</p><p>And then he was asked, well, what about after that?  </p><p>And here's what the president said -- quote -- \"I don't want to comment on  it.  Look, I just would love to have him do a great job.  And I would love  to have him look at the other side.\"</p><p>It appears, Congressmen, that the attorney general, his time as attorney  general, essentially has an expiration date on it.  Is that the way to view  this?</p><p>ZELDIN:  Could be.  I don't know what the president's thinking is.  I don't  know what A.G. Sessions' thinking is.</p><p>I believe that the attorney general should revisit the scope of his recusal  in what we're -- I mean, what we're working every day on, especially on  other networks, where it's just 24/7 wall-to-wall coverage 365 about trying  to take this president down, is that the attorney general, because of the  scope of his refusal, almost seems like he's not in charge of the Justice  Department, that he's recused himself out of a large portion of his job in  what is by far the highest-profile role that the Justice Department is  playing right now in American politics.  </p><p>So it would be great to have an attorney general, whether that's Attorney  General Sessions or someone else, it'd be great to have an attorney general  who is completely in charge of the Justice Department.  </p><p>And, unfortunately, we're at the case right now where you have a special  counsel that gets created in order to look into Russian interference, and  it appears like the scope of that investigation has gone so far beyond the  scope of why it was created, that that needs to be refocused, that needs to  be narrowed, and, in many respects, it needs to be ended, where you have  six million different -- it's a six million-headed monster right now.  </p><p>So, if they're -- if they are looking at 17 different things, well, the  perception is that they're looking at six million different things.  And  they created those clouds.  </p><p>So if you have no evidence that President Trump colluded with the Russians,  just come out and say it.  Let's clear up some of those clouds, so the  American people can move forward.</p><p>BURMAN:  You say it needs to be ended.  We are almost 60 days until the  November election.  It's Thursday or Friday is the 60-day mark.</p><p>In your, mind if Bob Mueller has something or anything of significance,  does it need to come out before the end of this week, so that there is some  distance between then and the end of the election?  Or should he wait if he  potentially has something until after the election?</p><p>ZELDIN:  I mean, if there's anything that is damaging that he wants to come  out with, the closer that you get to November, the more it ends up  influencing the political process.  </p><p>So if there's something that he's planning on coming out that is damaging  to someone, something, it's best that it comes out right now.  Now, between  now and November, if -- if there's any dead ends that he is aware of, where  there is a cloud over a particular -- a person or a party or a company, he  can come out with that information anytime between now and November,  because the American public needs to have as much information as possible  as to what they have decided wasn't done, where there wasn't any  wrongdoing.</p><p>But if there's anything damaging that he has that he's going to come out  with between now and November, it really should -- it really should come  out now.</p><p>BURMAN:  Congressman Lee Zeldin, joining us from Southampton, New York,  this morning, I'm sure it is beautiful out there on this holiday weekend.   So we thank you for stopping in and joining us.  Thanks, sir.</p><p>ZELDIN:  You got it.</p><p>BURMAN:  Coming up:  Can Apple be used as a bargaining chip to defuse trade  tensions between the U.S. and China?  And might the Chinese use it as one?</p><p>My next guest says Beijing not prepared for a long-term struggle with  Washington.  Asia expert Gordon Chang joins me with his unique take coming  up.</p><p>And, remember, you can follow us at @SundayFutures right there, as we look  ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BURMAN:  Welcome back.</p><p>Could be a big week on the trade front, as President Trump potentially  could slap further tariffs, up to 25 percent, on an additional $200 billion  worth of imports from China.</p><p>The latest volley in the growing trade war, as some would call it, could  hurt American companies with interests inside that country.  And some  analysts warn that Beijing could use Apple and other blue chips to tip the  scales in their favor.  </p><p>Gordon Chang is the author of \"The Coming Collapse of China.\"</p><p>And he joins us live in studio this morning.  </p><p>Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\":  Thanks, Blake.  </p><p>BURMAN:  So we're hearing that, I'm hearing that the president's talked  about this possibility of putting the $200 billion worth of tariffs further  on China at some point this week.  The public comment period, as you know,  ends on Wednesday.  So it could happen after that.  </p><p>What do you think the president's going to do, and what do you think he  should do?  </p><p>CHANG:  Well, I think he should put the tariffs on the $200 billion of  goods.  He should do it at the 25 percent rate, rather than the 10.</p><p>I would even go higher.  And the reason is, the Chinese have been stealing  hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. intellectual property each year.   That's what these tariffs are intended to remedy.  And the Chinese are not  stopping.  </p><p>So, clearly, we got to make the costs higher.  </p><p>BURMAN:  I know you call this a tech war, not a trade war, because of that  I.P. theft, but the Chinese have not given any indication whatsoever that  they're going to back off that position.  </p><p>So would tariffs even move them off it?  Because they haven't -- haven't  yet.</p><p>CHANG:  Yes, tariffs may not do it.  And we may have to put like 100  percent tariffs on $505.5 billion worth of goods, which is we what  imported.</p><p>BURMAN:  That's not going to happen, though, right?</p><p>CHANG:  Well, you never know.  </p><p>But the point is, if tariffs don't work, then we have to go to something  even more drastic, which would be just banning Chinese imports.  But one  way or another, we have got to stop China's theft, because we have an  innovation-based economy.  If we cannot commercialize that innovation, we  don't have very much of an economy.</p><p>So we have our backs against the wall.  And you can't run.  And I know  there's going to be costs to the U.S., but you just can't run decades of  bad trade policy and think, oh, we can get out of this without cost to  ourselves.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Here was the -- the statement from the White House earlier this  week that President Trump tweeted out.</p><p>He said -- quote -- or the White House statement -- quote -- \"As for the  U.S.-China trade disputes and other differences, they will be resolved in  time by President Trump and China's great President Xi Jinping.  That  relationship and bond remain very strong.\"</p><p>Where does this end?  I mean, you just floated the possibility of 100  percent tariffs, not that the administration has said that they're doing  that.</p><p>CHANG:  No.  No.</p><p>BURMAN:  But what's the finish line here?  </p><p>CHANG:  Well, the finish line is probably not months.  It's probably years  or maybe even a decade.  </p><p>We did have a trade arrangement with China last spring.  It didn't sustain.   It didn't hold.  So President Trump could have a deal with Xi Jinping, and  I don't think it's going to hold, because he's seen -- Xi Jinping has  decided not to give up.</p><p>He has lost some influence recently.  He came out of the recent meetings at  -- sort of diminished.  So he realizes that, if he gives up, he's going to  be eroded even further.  So I think he's going to try to bluff Trump into  making concessions where we don't really have to.</p><p>BURMAN:  You talk -- we talk about, in the greater scheme of things, the  U.S. vs. China, but the companies within the United States are really the  ones that bear the benefits or the cost.</p><p>You think the company that potentially has the biggest exposure here is  Apple, which is the biggest United States company.  Why do you think that?  </p><p>CHANG:  Well, first of all, we know the Chinese have gone after Apple.   They did that in March 2013.  They did it in the beginning of last month,  where they talked about how Apple had to give more to the Chinese if they  wanted to stay in the country.</p><p>That was almost extortion.  But the, really, reason why Apple has a problem  is because it has a supply chain that's very difficult to move.  It's got  Foxconn, its contract manufacturer.  They're in China.  It would take a  number of years for Foxconn and Apple to move elsewhere.  </p><p>Other companies, basically, they can move a lot quicker, with perhaps the  exception of the pharmaceuticals.  But everybody else can move their supply  chains quickly.  So China's threats against other companies are pretty  hollow.  Against Apple, it's a real threat.</p><p>BURMAN:  Real quick, North Korea, the president now is back to the argument  that the Chinese are not acting the way that he would like to see fit as it  relates to North Korea.</p><p>We're now a couple months past the summit.  Where do you think things stand  with -- with the North Koreans?  And the president is starting to make this  argument now -- or he has been for a little while -- no missile tests, they  haven't been firing off rockets.  </p><p>Is that a -- moving of the goalposts, or is that a fair metric for us to  judge this whole situation by?</p><p>CHANG:  It's a fair metric, but we have got to remember, in the past, there  have been long periods where the North Koreans didn't test and they started  to test again</p><p>What we're going to have to do is go back to that maximum pressure campaign  that made President Trump so successful up to the end of May.  Since that  time, he's tried to create this really friendly environment.  It hasn't  worked.</p><p>The North Koreans are not taking advantage of that one-shot opportunity the  president is giving them.  So he's got to go back to sanctions.  And,  unfortunately, it's going to be difficult.  But the North Koreans, again,  are not leaving us with much of a choice.</p><p>BURMAN:  I was going to say, real quickly, if you think sanctions for the  North Koreans, you would go full-throttle on that?  Real quick.</p><p>CHANG:  Especially the Chinese banks and the Russians and increasingly the  South Koreans.</p><p>BURMAN:  Gordon Chang, thank you for joining us this morning.  Big week  ahead.  We will see where it takes us.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN:  Appreciate it.  </p><p>Meantime, coming up: top social media executives set to once again make  their way to Capitol Hill amid growing public outcry over what many  consider to be anti-conservative censorship online.</p><p>House Energy and Commerce Committee member Leonard Lance joins us next with  his take, as we look ahead this Sunday morning on a holiday weekend on  \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BURMAN:  Welcome back.</p><p>Top executives from Facebook and Twitter set to testify before the Senate  Intelligence Committee later this week, as the social media giant has faced  accusations of anti-conservative censorships on their platforms.</p><p>Their most vocal critic?  President Trump, pledging his administration will  not let tech companies -- quote -- \"control what we can and cannot see.\"</p><p>Joining me now is the New Jersey Congressman Leonard Lance.  He is a member  of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  </p><p>Thank you for joining us in studio this morning.  </p><p>REP. LEONARD LANCE (R), NEW JERSEY:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BURMAN:  There's a couple different hearings.</p><p>The Senate side is more on how these tech companies can -- can help out  with elections, and et cetera.  On your side, you have got Jack Dorsey in  the hot seat and what many view as a bias of these social media companies  against conservatives.</p><p>You plan to ask the Twitter CEO what?</p><p>LANCE:  Whether there is bias and why, based upon their algorithm, they may  have chosen certain content over other content.  </p><p>It will be a busy day for Mr. Dorsey.  He will be at the Senate first and  then he comes over to our side of the Congress, to the House Energy and  Commerce Committee, Wednesday afternoon.  </p><p>BURMAN:  So I guess the question is, do you think that, if there -- if you  think there is bias, do you think it's purposely being directed at  conservatives, at Republicans?  And if it is, Twitter's a massive company.</p><p>Is there anything that you could even do about it?</p><p>LANCE:  I don't know whether it's intentional or not, but we intend to get  to the bottom of it.  </p><p>And this is based upon our majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, who is very  strong on this issue.  And he has worked with the chairman of the  committee, Greg Walden of Oregon.  And we intend to get to the bottom of  it.  And, of course, the American people demand fairness and not bias in  any way, shape, or form.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Of course, the follow-up here is -- is regulation, right, whether  this company, other big tech companies need to be regulated.</p><p>The president specifically earlier this week, on Twitter, and then there  were a lot of questions after it, took on Google.  And this was the  question that was posed to President Trump.  Watch it real quick about  regulation and Google.  Watch here. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You know what we want?  Not  regulation.  We want fairness.  When we have fairness, we are all very  happy.  </p><p>But you're talking about a tremendous amount.  I mean, I'm president.  They  got me here.  You're talking about a tremendous number of people.  We want  to see fairness.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  So the president there wouldn't wholeheartedly endorse regulation.   It's kind of a political catch-22 for him, because he's been talking about  one of his big prizes is how they have been able to slash regulation over  the first 18, 19 months of his presidency.  </p><p>So if you endorse it, it's kind of backing something that you want to  essentially unwind.  Do these companies needs to be regulated?</p><p>LANCE:  They need to be fair.</p><p>And I think the president is 100 percent accurate.  Let's see if they can  be fair.  And I don't favor over-regulation.  I favor a free and fair  Internet.  And so let's get to the bottom of it.  And I agree with the  president.</p><p>BURMAN:  If they are regulated, how would you even go about that?  How on  Congress would that get done?</p><p>LANCE:  That would be a challenging endeavor.  </p><p>And, of course, I favor what is known as the BROWSER Act by Marsha  Blackburn of Tennessee.  And that relates to this whole issue.  </p><p>But, first, let's get to the bottom of it.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Here was the statement that Google put out as it relates to  Google.  They said this -- quote -- \"Search is not used to set a political  agenda and we don't bias our resorts\" -- \"results,\" rather, \"toward any  political ideology.\"</p><p>A spokesperson goes on to say: \"We continually work to improve Google  search, and we never ranked search results to manipulate political  sentiment.\"</p><p>That's Google's take.</p><p>Do you believe them?</p><p>LANCE:  We will see what is said on Capitol Hill this week.  </p><p>I am a cautious lawyer, but we ought to get to the bottom of it.  And that  is why we're holding our hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee.  </p><p>BURMAN:  All right, the president also brought up the issue of antitrust.   So you could go at it through potentially regulation.  He brought up the  issue of maybe there's an antitrust issue.</p><p>This is what the president said in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this  week.  He said -- quote -- \"I won't comment on the breaking up, whether  that's that -- meaning Google -- \"or Amazon or Facebook.\"</p><p>He went on to say: \"As you know, many people think it's a very antitrust  situation, the three of them, but I just -- I won't comment on that.\"</p><p>Antitrust issues here?</p><p>LANCE:  Potentially.  </p><p>But that would be referred to the Department of Justice.  And I don't know  whether it actually qualifies as an antitrust violation.  But, first, we on  Capitol Hill are going to see whether or not there is bias, intentional or  otherwise.  </p><p>BURMAN:  So I guess the big picture here is just that.  Is the bias  intentional?  Is it unintentional?  </p><p>We're at the dawn of the Internet age, right?  Like, these companies are  just a handful of years old.  Is it possible that they're just trying to  work their way through some things, or is it simply this is Silicon Valley  trying to target Republicans here?  </p><p>LANCE:  I hope it's not the latter.  I hope that it's a situation where the  company is just trying to work through this situation.  </p><p>But there are some concerns regarding the fact that it might be deliberate.   I don't reach that conclusion yet.  That's why we're holding the hearing.  </p><p>BURMAN:  You got Dorsey in the hot seat.  Do you want to see Bezos?  You  have already had Zuckerberg.  Do you want to continue to pull these people  in there?  You think anything enlightening can come from it?  </p><p>LANCE:  Yes, I think the testimony of Mark Zuckerberg was very  enlightening, when he came before the committee in the spring.  </p><p>I think that he may have violated, his company may have violated a consent  agreement with the FTC in 2011.  I asked him specifically about that.  And  I asked him whether he had a position the BROWSER legislation, and he's yet  to get back to us on that.  </p><p>BURMAN:  OK, wait and see, I guess.  And we will see what happens this  week.  </p><p>Congressman Leonard Lance, thank you for joining us this morning.  We  appreciate it.  </p><p>LANCE:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Meantime, coming up, Democrats denouncing a -- quote -- \"document  massacre,\" as the Trump administration keeps thousands of pages of Supreme  Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's White House work history from the Senate  Judiciary Committee.</p><p>How this could affect questioning at Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings  coming up later this week, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BURMAN:  Welcome back.</p><p>It looks like the Democrats have lost a weeks-long battle over Supreme  Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's paper trail from his years working in the  White House of President George W. Bush.</p><p>The Trump administration withholding more than 100,000 pages of document --  documents, rather.  They are citing executive privilege, with Kavanaugh's  confirmation hearings set to begin just a couple days from now on Tuesday.  </p><p>Let's bring our panel -- bring in the panel, rather.</p><p>Justin Walker is a former clerk for judge Kavanaugh and an assistant  professor of law at the University of Louisville.  Gregg Nunziata is a  former chief nominations counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee.  </p><p>Thank you both for joining us this morning.  </p><p>Thank you.  </p><p>GREGG NUNZIATA, FORMER SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHIEF NOMINATIONS  COUNSEL:  Good morning.  </p><p>BURMAN:  So, Gregg, you were there the last time -- and this would have  been about a decade ago -- that Brett Kavanaugh was preparing for his  nomination on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.  You got a little bit of  an insight as to what this last week or so might have been like for him.  </p><p>What do you think it's been like?  </p><p>NUNZIATA:  Well, that, his previous confirmation hearings were pretty  intense.  </p><p>The D.C. Circuit is often called the second most important court in the  country.  And at the time, he was serving in the Bush White House.  And a  lot of Democrats kind of used him as a way of attacking the president.  </p><p>So he's been through this before in a pretty tough environment.  This is  tougher still.  And it's a week long of hearings, including two very  lengthy marathon days of question and answers from senators, half of whom  are going to be out there to try to trip him up.  </p><p>So I'm sure he's been the careful lawyer he is.  He's been studying his own  record and studying existing law, Supreme Court precedent, and he will be  prepared this week.</p><p>BURMAN:  Justin, the best hope here for Democrats, it appears, is that  there might be some needle in a haystack-type thing and one of these  documents, in a page somewhere over his decades' worth long of being on the  bench.  </p><p>This was the reaction from the top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer,  as he posted this on Twitter about the withholding -- withholding of  100,000 or so pages of documents.  </p><p>Here's what Schumer said.  He wrote -- quote -- \"We're witnessing a Friday  night document massacre.  President Trump's decision to step in at the last  moment and hide 100,000 pages of Judge Kavanaugh's records from the  American public is not only unprecedented in the history of Supreme Court  nominations.  It has all the makings of a cover-up.\"</p><p>In a second sweet, Schumer goes on to say: \"What are they trying so  desperately to hide?\"</p><p>Your response to that would be?</p><p>JUSTIN WALKER, FORMER CLERK FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH:  Well, the only thing  unprecedented is this kind of hyperbolic rhetoric from people like Chuck  Schumer.  </p><p>The truth is that there have been more documents produced for Judge  Kavanaugh than for any nominee in history.  And, moreover, the most  important documents have been public all along.  They are the opinions he's  written, the opinions over 12 years on the second most important court in  the country.</p><p>And if you look at those 300 opinions, you see a judge who always goes  where the law leads, who understands the proper limited role of the  judiciary, who is very much in the mainstream, and who has been endorsed by  the Supreme Court on 13 separate occasions, an unparalleled record of  vindication for a lower court judge.</p><p>BURMAN:  White House officials that I have spoken with this week tell me  that they don't feel that there's anything, sort of a needle in a haystack  out there.  That's their position.  They have reason to feel confident, of  course.</p><p>But I'm wondering, to the both of you -- and, Gregg, you can go first --  when you're preparing for something like this, how are you ever really just  entirely confident that that's the case?</p><p>NUNZIATA:  Well, you -- the Senate, the White House has dozens of lawyers  looking through Judge Kavanaugh's public record, his personal life.</p><p>I mean, these things are gone over in detail.  I don't think anybody should  be expecting a big surprise from any of these documents or from the hearing  today.  And, as the professor says, I mean, his traditional record speaks  for itself.  And that's what the Senate should be focusing on.  </p><p>If you want to know what kind of judge he will be on the Supreme Court,  look at what kind of judge he's been on the D.C. Circuit for the last 10  years.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Justin, you clerked for him.  What was he like?</p><p>WALKER:  Oh, my goodness.</p><p>I have never met a better lawyer.  I have never worked for a better man.  I  had him as a teacher at law school.  He believes, he adheres -- he reveres  the Constitution.  And that comes across in his chambers.  </p><p>One thing he used to tell us as clerks is, he would say, every case is a  separation of powers case.  And what he meant is that every case requires  the judge to remember that it's the executive and the legislature who make  the law and it's the judge who merely applies the law.</p><p>BURMAN:  Justin, you were up there on the Senate Judiciary Committee.  You  know that there's a lot of preparation that goes into this.  This will be  splashed overall the networks, and rightfully so.  People will follow this.   There's going to be lots of questions, lots of answers, hours' worth,  headlines, et cetera, on down the line.  </p><p>But at the end of the day, 95, 96 of these 100 senators already have their  minds made up.  And it appears that conservatives -- that Republicans have  the numbers.  Does any of this -- I don't want to say it doesn't matter.   But is it a formality, essentially, at this point, just waiting for the  confirmation vote?  </p><p>NUNZIATA:  No, I think -- look, this is -- Supreme Court hearings are one  of the few times that we as a country really stop to talk about and to  focus on the role of the court in our system and what our Constitution  means to us as Americans.  </p><p>So I think it's important just in that sense alone.  But beyond that, I  mean, we do learn meaningful things about a nominee, about their  background, their fitness for the court, and their judicial philosophy.  </p><p>I think Americans are going to like what they hear when they hear from  Judge Kavanaugh.  I do think, the more they hear from him, the more  inevitable his confirmation becomes.  And, yes, there's a handful of votes  in play, particularly Democrats from states which the president carried  with a large margin in 2016.</p><p>I think they're going to be very interested in how these hearings go, and  they're going to be very interested in what they hear from their voters who  are watching.</p><p>BURMAN:  Justin, how important is it to actually get Brett Kavanaugh  confirmed by October 1, when the -- when the Supreme Court reconvenes?</p><p>Is it actually more important to get him in there by September 24, which is  the first time that they meet behind closed doors, the week leading into  this, or is it -- is it fine for the makeup of the court, forget the  person, but just the function of the court as it moves forward, if he isn't  in there for one reason or the next by October 1?  </p><p>WALKER:  Well, I think, from an institutional perspective, the sooner the  better.</p><p>And I think, the Senate obviously has a role to play in advise and consent.   It's a constitutional role.  So I'm sure they will do that thoughtfully.   And that takes some time.  </p><p>But there's -- really, I see no reason why that can't be done by the end of  September.  And if the senators really take seriously the advise and  consent function that the founders imagined, then we will be looking at a  100-0 confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh.  </p><p>Unfortunately, that's not -- that's not the world we live in right now.   We're going to see a lot of vicious attacks at the hearings this week.  But  I think what we will also see is a witness, a judge who's thoughtful and  friendly and scholarly, and someone who really the people -- the American  people really will like the more they learn about him.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Justin Walker, Gregg Nunziata, I know you will be watching.  so  will we.  Thank you joining us this morning.  </p><p>WALKER:  Thanks, Blake.</p><p>NUNZIATA:  Thanks for having us.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>And for all of you at home, make sure you stay with the FOX News Channel  all this week, as the Senate begins its confirmation hearings for Judge  Brett Kavanaugh.</p><p>Our special coverage starts on Tuesday.  </p><p>So what can we expect at those hearings, now that Democrats are furious at  the White House for withholding all of those documents, a lot of them, some  of them?</p><p>Our political panel takes a look on this, as we look ahead on \"Sunday  Morning Futures.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BURMAN:  Welcome back.</p><p>As you know by now, the confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court nominee  Brett Kavanaugh are set to start tomorrow.</p><p>The White House moved Friday night to withhold 100,000 pages worth of  documents from his records in the Bush 43 White House.  They cite executive  privilege.  Some Democrats are saying, uh-uh, not so.</p><p>Time now for our panel, Ed Rollins, former White House adviser to President  Reagan, a FOX News contributor and affiliated with a conservative PAC that  supports Kavanaugh's confirmation, we should add.  And Al D'Amato is a  former Republican senator from this state and a FOX News contributor as  well.</p><p>Thanks for joining us this morning.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Want to start, first, though, I'm sure it's been a tough last few  days for the both of you with the proceedings, the services and the passing  of Senator John McCain.</p><p>Just a word from you both?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Yesterday was spectacular day.</p><p>I mean, we had have two funerals, on Friday for Aretha Franklin, which was  a spectacular joining together of the black leadership of this country.   Yesterday was a -- was a memorial to a very decent man who has basically  been on the stage for 60 years.</p><p>And I think he staged it very well.  It was his -- and it was a great song  that Aretha sang which was called \"Respect.\"</p><p>BURMAN:  Right.</p><p>ROLLINS:  John McCain got his respect yesterday from the establishment.</p><p>Now, at the same time, the attack and the theme -- underlying theme was,  this is the establishment and they were attacking Trump.</p><p>BURMAN:  Right.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Trump is not the establishment.  Tomorrow, he goes back to -his  control of -- and the world of John McCain didn't turn out to be quite what  he wanted, in the sense that he wanted bipartisanship.  </p><p>You won't see it again this week.  You're going to see the hand grenades  back thrown with Kavanaugh.</p><p>BURMAN:  With Kavanaugh.</p><p>Al.</p><p>AL D'AMATO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  You can't help but admire a great hero.  </p><p>And why was he a great hero?  In my mind, anyone who suffered the way he  did, and yet refused to leave early -- he could have left I don't know how  many years earlier.  But he said, I'm not leaving prison and torture until  the men who are in here with me and before me are released.  </p><p>That's incredible.  That's heroic.  And, in my mind, he was always a very  special person because of that.  Did we always agree?  Just like all of the  people who spoke said, we had conflicts.</p><p>But he was a man of principle.  He believed in what he did.  He stood up,  and he had the highest values for this country.  And it was a great  testimony that people recognized this.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Senator McCain to be buried today in Annapolis, Maryland.  </p><p>You talked about what is coming up this week.  </p><p>Senator, you have been through many of these Supreme Court hearings.  You  would say to Brett Kavanaugh -- what would be the advice that you would  give him?</p><p>D'AMATO:  Keep doing what you have been doing.  He's been a fine jurist in  the second highest court in the nation, the appellate court.</p><p>His work is outstanding.  He is a scholar.  Everyone admits that.  He is a  gentleman.  He is a family person.  And his record speaks for itself.  So  those who raise questions now about, oh, 100,000 documents, et cetera, that  they'd like to see when he worked for the White House years ago, that's  just an attempt to slow down the proceedings, to embarrass him.</p><p>But his record is going to carry him through.  He will get all of the  Republican votes.  That's my opinion.  And he will get several Democrats  who will vote for him.</p><p>BURMAN:  You -- on this show, I had asked you in the days before the  president made the announcement, who do you want?  You said Amy Coney  Barrett.  Now you're trying to get Kavanaugh confirmed.</p><p>Has it been a full embrace for you, now that he's the pick?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Oh, totally.  Totally.  No, totally.</p><p>I thought a woman on the court, a conservative woman, would have been very  important.  And she may end up in the court before all is said here .</p><p>He's a superb choice.  The document thing is ridiculous.  These are  President Bush's documents.  These aren't his documents.  Having worked on  the White House staff, a couple White Houses, those aren't your documents.   Those are the president's documents.  And he was the staff secretary, so he  touched everything, but he didn't write them.</p><p>And the idea that the Congress wants them, no president would give those  up.  So my sense is, he will get confirmed.  It'll be a knock-down, drag- out.  And all of the good wishes of yesterday's funeral are all by the  wayside, and we're back -- we're back to warfare again come next Tuesday.</p><p>BURMAN:  Real quick, Senator, Democrats hit him how, Kavanaugh?</p><p>D'AMATO:  He will get several Democrats to vote for him.</p><p>BURMAN:  Think so?</p><p>D'AMATO:  Yes.</p><p>BURMAN:  Manchin, Donnelly, Heitkamp, the folks that went for Gorsuch?</p><p>D'AMATO:  Yes.</p><p>I think he will get two, if not three Democrats, and all of the  Republicans, including Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski.</p><p>BURMAN:  Fifty-two, fifty-three, fifty-four votes?</p><p>ROLLINS:  And the new senator from Arizona.</p><p>BURMAN:  And the new senator from Arizona.  Exactly.</p><p>Doug Ducey has a selection and probably will unveil it soon.</p><p>Stay right with us, Ed Rollins, Senator D'Amato.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Sure.</p><p>BURMAN:  We will be right back with our panel after this, as we look ahead  on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>Stay with.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BURMAN:  President Trump now having second thoughts about plans to cancel  pay raises for federal employees.</p><p>We are back with our panel, Ed Rollins, Senator Al D'Amato.  </p><p>Thanks for sticking around one again.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.  Thank you.  </p><p>BURMAN:  This came from the president earlier this week, Wednesday,  Thursday, basically saying, federal employees if you are not in the  military, you're not going to get a pay raise, potentially look at the  issue of merit-based pay.  </p><p>If nothing else, for these employees, it's something you don't want to see.   And on the political front, it's a -- it's not a good headline for this...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, you don't want to go -- you don't want to go to war with  your employees.  And the bottom line is that a 2 percent pay increase is  not dramatic.  </p><p>And my sense is, the savings, which is about $25 billion, in a $4 trillion  budget, with a trillion-dollar deficit, it's not that significant.  And I  think it would be a very terrible thing for the morale of the employees.  </p><p>BURMAN:  How do you keep -- how do you keep qualified employees?  Because,  when you look back -- we were just talking about this.  When you look back,  President Obama froze it for three consecutive years.  The economy was in a  much different place in 2011 than it is in 2018 now.</p><p>But if you're a federal employee, over the last several years, you have  barely seen a pay increase.  Why stay if you can get a good private sector  job?  </p><p>D'AMATO:  Well, you're absolutely right.  </p><p>And you might want to save money, but there are better ways to do it.  Look  at the real problems of how the deficit is growing.  Where is the spending?   What do you do to resolve it?</p><p>You have Social Security, which if it continues on this pattern, runs out  of money not too down -- far down the road.  Same thing with Medicare.</p><p>So what do you do?  Put together a bipartisan panel.  It was done.   President Reagan did it.  And guess what?  We saved Social Security.  We  strengthened it.  You can do the same thing again.</p><p>Now, if we're going to talk about bringing the country together and  bringing partisan politics, keeping it out, there are two areas where we  could save trillions of dollars over the next decade if we came together.</p><p>And, by the way, it's not tough.  You have people who are living longer.   You should adjust the time that they can retire.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  I would argue you don't want to do it before a campaign season.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Before November.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I would argue definitely that those are constituents.  </p><p>And I think I think the bottom line is you -- it's one of these things it's  going to take a year to do it, Al.  </p><p>D'AMATO:  Yes.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  It's not simple.</p><p>And I think, to a certain extent, the moment you mentioned Social Security,  if you're Republican, you get banged over the head by every Democrat in the  world.</p><p>BURMAN:  Got about a minute left.</p><p>So, real quick, we're about 64, 65 days whatever it is...</p><p>ROLLINS:  Right.  </p><p>BURMAN:  ... until November 7.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURMAN:  Some interesting races this past week.</p><p>Where do you think things stand?  What's the lay of the land, as we are  here?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  The lay of the land, quickly, is, there's three -- three  Republican seats in the Senate that are in trouble, or at least potentially  in trouble.  </p><p>One is the Nevada seat of Heller, the Arizona seat, and the Tennessee seat,  which are both open seats.  They are competitive.</p><p>There are four or five Democrat seats that are -- that are competitive.   And the House is very competitive.  And it could go either way.</p><p>My sense is, they're our seats, so our guys have to lose it.  And they have  to fight hard.</p><p>BURMAN:  Biggest worry as a Republican is what?</p><p>D'AMATO:  I think the Republicans pick up two to three seats, the Democrats  pick up two seats.  So we will hold the Senate.</p><p>I think we have trouble in the House.  Reapportionment, court decisions  come down.  Pennsylvania, we will lose a couple of seats.  We may lose one  in New York.</p><p>The chances are, at this point, we lose the House.</p><p>BURMAN:  Really?  You think so?  Chances are?</p><p>D'AMATO:  Yes, chances are.</p><p>BURMAN:  Great chances or just coin flip-type stuff?</p><p>D'AMATO:  Well, right now, I would say it's 60/40.  It can turn, but, right  now, we're in trouble in the House.</p><p>BURMAN:  Ed, do you agree, real quick?</p><p>ROLLINS:  I would argue it's truly, who's going to vote is the critical  thing, and can we get our vote out?  If we get our vote out, we're going to  be OK.  If we don't get our vote out, then, obviously, we could lose.</p><p>BURMAN:  And you got 65 days, I believe, to do that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURMAN:  So we will see what happens between now and November 7.</p><p>Thank you both for joining us.  Appreciate it.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Great.  Thank you.  </p><p>D'AMATO:  Good being with you.</p><p>BURMAN:  That does it this morning, believe it or not, for \"Sunday Morning  Futures.\"</p><p>I am Blake Burman, in for Maria Bartiromo.  Maria will be back next week.  </p><p>Make sure to watch both of us on the FOX Business Network as well.  </p><p>\"Media Buzz With Howard Kurtz\" is coming up next.

I'm Blake Burman, in for Maria Bartiromo, and  this is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president slamming Canada for -- quote -- \"ripping us off\" and warning  Congress not to interfere as NAFTA talks continued.  So what's the impact  if a deal cannot be reached?  </p><p>Lee Zeldin is a member of the House Financial Services and Foreign Affairs  Committees.  He joins me next.  </p><p>Plus: Congress set to grill tech execs later this week over claims that  conservatives are being censored online.  The president calling for change,  but is regulation the right answer going forward?  Congressman Leonard  Lance will be questioning Twitter's CEO, and he is here this morning to  weigh in.  </p><p>Plus:  The White House says it is withholding 100,000 pages of Judge  Kavanaugh's records just days before his confirmation proceedings begin.  I  will talk to a former Kavanaugh clerk about what we can expect this week,  as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"  </p><p>And right out the gate this morning, President Trump renewing his attacks  on Canada and NAFTA, warning our neighbors to the north that it will be out  of a revised agreement if it doesn't concede to new terms.  The president  also warning Congress not to interfere with trade negotiations going  forward, or he would terminate the trade deal altogether, all of this as  the U.S. and Canada are set to restart trade talks a few days now on  Wednesday.  </p><p>Let's bring in the New York Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin.  He sits on  both the House Financial Services and House Foreign Affairs Committees.  </p><p>And he joins us from New York this morning.  </p><p>Hello, Congressman.  </p><p>REP. LEE ZELDIN (R), NEW YORK:  Good morning.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Good morning to you.  </p><p>So there's a few ways to go forward with this on a potential revamped  NAFTA.  There could be a three-way deal between the U.S., Mexico and  Canada.  There could be two bilateral deals, one with Mexico and the U.S.,  one with Canada and the U.S., or there could be nothing as it relates to  Canada.</p><p>Which side are you on?</p><p>ZELDIN:  I think that the best thing for the United States is going to be  to be able to get a deal that also includes Canada.</p><p>However, the president isn't going to just cut a deal with Canada just to  cut one.  He made a pledge during his campaign that he genuinely believes  in that we can do better than NAFTA, that NAFTA has hurt us with regards to  the businesses that we have lost, with regards to the millions of jobs that  we have lost as well.  </p><p>So, the president feels good about that deal that was cut with Mexico, and  feels like he is a -- and he is -- in a good position negotiating with  Canada with really important goals.  So I would fall onto the side of being  able to enter into a deal that includes Canada.</p><p>Our relations -- the United States and Canada, that trade relationship is  vitally important.  There's a long history.  Next to United States and  China, it is a massive trade relationship between the two nations.  So it  would be great for the United States to enter into a better deal with  Canada, but not just to enter into one just to enter into one.  </p><p>So option B ends up being, you enter into a better deal with Mexico.  And  then you just walk from NAFTA, and then maybe Canada decides to revisit  some of the issues that are really important, like dairy, where there needs  to be a concession on the part of the Canadians.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Yes, I know that's a big issue in New York.</p><p>You saw, I'm sure, that the tweet that President Trump sent out just  yesterday.  It was kind of a two-fold threat both to Canada and to  Congress.  This was the tweet right here from the president.</p><p>He said -- quote -- \"There is no political necessity to keep Canada in the  new NAFTA deal.  If we don't make a fair deal for the U.S. after decades of  abuse, Canada will be out.  Congress shouldn't interfere with these  negotiations, or I will simply terminate NAFTA entirely, and we will be far  better off.\"</p><p>So breaking that down, let's start with Congress.  </p><p>Is there an appetite amongst your colleagues there, both Republicans and  Democrats, to potentially give this president the trade deal and the trade  win that he so desires?</p><p>ZELDIN:  I think this really about giving the American economy a trade win,  giving American workers and American companies the trade win.  That is what  I want as a member of Congress.  </p><p>Unfortunately, there are other members of Congress who want political wins.   They want to become the speaker of the House.  They want to become chair of  a committee in the House.  They have taken a pledge to resist, oppose,  impeach obstruct this president on everything and anything.  </p><p>So there are 535 members of Congress.  Many of us want what's best for the  American worker and the American economy.  Others want what is best in  their goals to take down President Trump.</p><p>So as far as the president's tweet goes, I think that's a strong message to  the members of Congress who want a political win, selfishly for themselves,  because they want power not to mess around, because you're going to --  you're not only going to be hurting yourselves politically, but you're  going to be, most importantly, hurting our country.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Just a couple more on this.</p><p>The dairy issue is a big one for New York, the state of which you are  representative -- a representative in.  If Canada doesn't move on that  issue, might change your -- your potential vote one way or the next?</p><p>ZELDIN:  I don't think that this administration -- I don't want to speak  for the administration.  And I don't know what I'm about to say is actually  their position, but my impression is that they're not cutting a deal with - - with Canada where Canada is not budging at all with regards to dairy.  </p><p>And this administration has taken a tough stance, a correct stance,  fighting on behalf of many different businesses all across our country and  for the American economy that Canada is going to have to make concessions  as it relates to dairy.  </p><p>I don't believe that this administration would be sending a deal to  Congress with Canada where Canada makes no concessions on dairy.  But,  again, I'm just speculating.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Right.  </p><p>OK, one last one on this, Congressman, before we move on.  The chief  negotiator for Canada earlier this week, on Friday actually, once this was  racing to a deadline, was asked whether or not she essentially feels that  the United States wants a deal, or at least is acting in good faith with  all of this.  </p><p>And this was her response.  Watch here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUESTION:  Do you think they're negotiating in good faith?</p><p>CHRYSTIA FREELAND, CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  Ambassador Lighthizer and  his team through this negotiation have been working really, really hard.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  There was a pause there, and it wasn't a yes.  </p><p>So, the Canadians seem, it believes -- or at least seems to be somewhat  skeptical.  And you saw the tweet from the president.</p><p>What we're in right now, is that just the ebbs and flows of negotiations,  or is it possible that these two just cannot get to a middle ground at some  point?  </p><p>ZELDIN:  Well, the president is operating from a position of strength, not  weakness.</p><p>With regards to American foreign policy all across the globe, it is  important for us to be operating from positions of strength, and not to  just concede that.  And what we have seen in the past is -- one of the  analogies I like to use, Texas hold'em, the best starting hand are pocket  aces.</p><p>The worst are the two -- the two, seven off-suit.  The United States  inherits, the president of the United States, we inherit those pocket aces.   And sometimes, as a negotiating strategy, we feel guilty about it.  We  apologize for American exceptionalism.  We trade in our pocket aces.  You  say, you play these.  I will play your two, seven off-suit.  </p><p>Now, the United States has the largest economy in the entire world.  The  president understands that.  He's leveraging it correctly.  And he -- and  his job is to represent America, just like Canada is saying they're not  going to enter into a deal that's not in the best interest of Canada.   That's a fair position on the part of the Canadians.  </p><p>But the president's position is one that's a position of strength, that is  leveraging the United States economy well, and is not going to just take a  position of weakness to grab one, and isn't going to just cut a deal with  Canada just to cut one.  </p><p>BURMAN:  All right, I want to move on here.  </p><p>The president, as we know, he has been has been critical of Canada.  He has  also been very critical of his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions.  He was  asked in a Bloomberg interview in the White House in the Oval Office  earlier this week, essentially saying that Sessions has his job, the  attorney general does, until the November election.</p><p>And then he was asked, well, what about after that?  </p><p>And here's what the president said -- quote -- \"I don't want to comment on  it.  Look, I just would love to have him do a great job.  And I would love  to have him look at the other side.\"</p><p>It appears, Congressmen, that the attorney general, his time as attorney  general, essentially has an expiration date on it.  Is that the way to view  this?</p><p>ZELDIN:  Could be.  I don't know what the president's thinking is.  I don't  know what A.G. Sessions' thinking is.</p><p>I believe that the attorney general should revisit the scope of his recusal  in what we're -- I mean, what we're working every day on, especially on  other networks, where it's just 24/7 wall-to-wall coverage 365 about trying  to take this president down, is that the attorney general, because of the  scope of his refusal, almost seems like he's not in charge of the Justice  Department, that he's recused himself out of a large portion of his job in  what is by far the highest-profile role that the Justice Department is  playing right now in American politics.  </p><p>So it would be great to have an attorney general, whether that's Attorney  General Sessions or someone else, it'd be great to have an attorney general  who is completely in charge of the Justice Department.  </p><p>And, unfortunately, we're at the case right now where you have a special  counsel that gets created in order to look into Russian interference, and  it appears like the scope of that investigation has gone so far beyond the  scope of why it was created, that that needs to be refocused, that needs to  be narrowed, and, in many respects, it needs to be ended, where you have  six million different -- it's a six million-headed monster right now.  </p><p>So, if they're -- if they are looking at 17 different things, well, the  perception is that they're looking at six million different things.  And  they created those clouds.  </p><p>So if you have no evidence that President Trump colluded with the Russians,  just come out and say it.  Let's clear up some of those clouds, so the  American people can move forward.</p><p>BURMAN:  You say it needs to be ended.  We are almost 60 days until the  November election.  It's Thursday or Friday is the 60-day mark.</p><p>In your, mind if Bob Mueller has something or anything of significance,  does it need to come out before the end of this week, so that there is some  distance between then and the end of the election?  Or should he wait if he  potentially has something until after the election?</p><p>ZELDIN:  I mean, if there's anything that is damaging that he wants to come  out with, the closer that you get to November, the more it ends up  influencing the political process.  </p><p>So if there's something that he's planning on coming out that is damaging  to someone, something, it's best that it comes out right now.  Now, between  now and November, if -- if there's any dead ends that he is aware of, where  there is a cloud over a particular -- a person or a party or a company, he  can come out with that information anytime between now and November,  because the American public needs to have as much information as possible  as to what they have decided wasn't done, where there wasn't any  wrongdoing.</p><p>But if there's anything damaging that he has that he's going to come out  with between now and November, it really should -- it really should come  out now.</p><p>BURMAN:  Congressman Lee Zeldin, joining us from Southampton, New York,  this morning, I'm sure it is beautiful out there on this holiday weekend.   So we thank you for stopping in and joining us.  Thanks, sir.</p><p>ZELDIN:  You got it.</p><p>BURMAN:  Coming up:  Can Apple be used as a bargaining chip to defuse trade  tensions between the U.S. and China?  And might the Chinese use it as one?</p><p>My next guest says Beijing not prepared for a long-term struggle with  Washington.  Asia expert Gordon Chang joins me with his unique take coming  up.</p><p>And, remember, you can follow us at @SundayFutures right there, as we look  ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BURMAN:  Welcome back.</p><p>Could be a big week on the trade front, as President Trump potentially  could slap further tariffs, up to 25 percent, on an additional $200 billion  worth of imports from China.</p><p>The latest volley in the growing trade war, as some would call it, could  hurt American companies with interests inside that country.  And some  analysts warn that Beijing could use Apple and other blue chips to tip the  scales in their favor.  </p><p>Gordon Chang is the author of \"The Coming Collapse of China.\"</p><p>And he joins us live in studio this morning.  </p><p>Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\":  Thanks, Blake.  </p><p>BURMAN:  So we're hearing that, I'm hearing that the president's talked  about this possibility of putting the $200 billion worth of tariffs further  on China at some point this week.  The public comment period, as you know,  ends on Wednesday.  So it could happen after that.  </p><p>What do you think the president's going to do, and what do you think he  should do?  </p><p>CHANG:  Well, I think he should put the tariffs on the $200 billion of  goods.  He should do it at the 25 percent rate, rather than the 10.</p><p>I would even go higher.  And the reason is, the Chinese have been stealing  hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. intellectual property each year.   That's what these tariffs are intended to remedy.  And the Chinese are not  stopping.  </p><p>So, clearly, we got to make the costs higher.  </p><p>BURMAN:  I know you call this a tech war, not a trade war, because of that  I.P. theft, but the Chinese have not given any indication whatsoever that  they're going to back off that position.  </p><p>So would tariffs even move them off it?  Because they haven't -- haven't  yet.</p><p>CHANG:  Yes, tariffs may not do it.  And we may have to put like 100  percent tariffs on $505.5 billion worth of goods, which is we what  imported.</p><p>BURMAN:  That's not going to happen, though, right?</p><p>CHANG:  Well, you never know.  </p><p>But the point is, if tariffs don't work, then we have to go to something  even more drastic, which would be just banning Chinese imports.  But one  way or another, we have got to stop China's theft, because we have an  innovation-based economy.  If we cannot commercialize that innovation, we  don't have very much of an economy.</p><p>So we have our backs against the wall.  And you can't run.  And I know  there's going to be costs to the U.S., but you just can't run decades of  bad trade policy and think, oh, we can get out of this without cost to  ourselves.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Here was the -- the statement from the White House earlier this  week that President Trump tweeted out.</p><p>He said -- quote -- or the White House statement -- quote -- \"As for the  U.S.-China trade disputes and other differences, they will be resolved in  time by President Trump and China's great President Xi Jinping.  That  relationship and bond remain very strong.\"</p><p>Where does this end?  I mean, you just floated the possibility of 100  percent tariffs, not that the administration has said that they're doing  that.</p><p>CHANG:  No.  No.</p><p>BURMAN:  But what's the finish line here?  </p><p>CHANG:  Well, the finish line is probably not months.  It's probably years  or maybe even a decade.  </p><p>We did have a trade arrangement with China last spring.  It didn't sustain.   It didn't hold.  So President Trump could have a deal with Xi Jinping, and  I don't think it's going to hold, because he's seen -- Xi Jinping has  decided not to give up.</p><p>He has lost some influence recently.  He came out of the recent meetings at  -- sort of diminished.  So he realizes that, if he gives up, he's going to  be eroded even further.  So I think he's going to try to bluff Trump into  making concessions where we don't really have to.</p><p>BURMAN:  You talk -- we talk about, in the greater scheme of things, the  U.S. vs. China, but the companies within the United States are really the  ones that bear the benefits or the cost.</p><p>You think the company that potentially has the biggest exposure here is  Apple, which is the biggest United States company.  Why do you think that?  </p><p>CHANG:  Well, first of all, we know the Chinese have gone after Apple.   They did that in March 2013.  They did it in the beginning of last month,  where they talked about how Apple had to give more to the Chinese if they  wanted to stay in the country.</p><p>That was almost extortion.  But the, really, reason why Apple has a problem  is because it has a supply chain that's very difficult to move.  It's got  Foxconn, its contract manufacturer.  They're in China.  It would take a  number of years for Foxconn and Apple to move elsewhere.  </p><p>Other companies, basically, they can move a lot quicker, with perhaps the  exception of the pharmaceuticals.  But everybody else can move their supply  chains quickly.  So China's threats against other companies are pretty  hollow.  Against Apple, it's a real threat.</p><p>BURMAN:  Real quick, North Korea, the president now is back to the argument  that the Chinese are not acting the way that he would like to see fit as it  relates to North Korea.</p><p>We're now a couple months past the summit.  Where do you think things stand  with -- with the North Koreans?  And the president is starting to make this  argument now -- or he has been for a little while -- no missile tests, they  haven't been firing off rockets.  </p><p>Is that a -- moving of the goalposts, or is that a fair metric for us to  judge this whole situation by?</p><p>CHANG:  It's a fair metric, but we have got to remember, in the past, there  have been long periods where the North Koreans didn't test and they started  to test again</p><p>What we're going to have to do is go back to that maximum pressure campaign  that made President Trump so successful up to the end of May.  Since that  time, he's tried to create this really friendly environment.  It hasn't  worked.</p><p>The North Koreans are not taking advantage of that one-shot opportunity the  president is giving them.  So he's got to go back to sanctions.  And,  unfortunately, it's going to be difficult.  But the North Koreans, again,  are not leaving us with much of a choice.</p><p>BURMAN:  I was going to say, real quickly, if you think sanctions for the  North Koreans, you would go full-throttle on that?  Real quick.</p><p>CHANG:  Especially the Chinese banks and the Russians and increasingly the  South Koreans.</p><p>BURMAN:  Gordon Chang, thank you for joining us this morning.  Big week  ahead.  We will see where it takes us.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN:  Appreciate it.  </p><p>Meantime, coming up: top social media executives set to once again make  their way to Capitol Hill amid growing public outcry over what many  consider to be anti-conservative censorship online.</p><p>House Energy and Commerce Committee member Leonard Lance joins us next with  his take, as we look ahead this Sunday morning on a holiday weekend on  \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BURMAN:  Welcome back.</p><p>Top executives from Facebook and Twitter set to testify before the Senate  Intelligence Committee later this week, as the social media giant has faced  accusations of anti-conservative censorships on their platforms.</p><p>Their most vocal critic?  President Trump, pledging his administration will  not let tech companies -- quote -- \"control what we can and cannot see.\"</p><p>Joining me now is the New Jersey Congressman Leonard Lance.  He is a member  of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  </p><p>Thank you for joining us in studio this morning.  </p><p>REP. LEONARD LANCE (R), NEW JERSEY:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BURMAN:  There's a couple different hearings.</p><p>The Senate side is more on how these tech companies can -- can help out  with elections, and et cetera.  On your side, you have got Jack Dorsey in  the hot seat and what many view as a bias of these social media companies  against conservatives.</p><p>You plan to ask the Twitter CEO what?</p><p>LANCE:  Whether there is bias and why, based upon their algorithm, they may  have chosen certain content over other content.  </p><p>It will be a busy day for Mr. Dorsey.  He will be at the Senate first and  then he comes over to our side of the Congress, to the House Energy and  Commerce Committee, Wednesday afternoon.  </p><p>BURMAN:  So I guess the question is, do you think that, if there -- if you  think there is bias, do you think it's purposely being directed at  conservatives, at Republicans?  And if it is, Twitter's a massive company.</p><p>Is there anything that you could even do about it?</p><p>LANCE:  I don't know whether it's intentional or not, but we intend to get  to the bottom of it.  </p><p>And this is based upon our majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, who is very  strong on this issue.  And he has worked with the chairman of the  committee, Greg Walden of Oregon.  And we intend to get to the bottom of  it.  And, of course, the American people demand fairness and not bias in  any way, shape, or form.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Of course, the follow-up here is -- is regulation, right, whether  this company, other big tech companies need to be regulated.</p><p>The president specifically earlier this week, on Twitter, and then there  were a lot of questions after it, took on Google.  And this was the  question that was posed to President Trump.  Watch it real quick about  regulation and Google.  Watch here. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You know what we want?  Not  regulation.  We want fairness.  When we have fairness, we are all very  happy.  </p><p>But you're talking about a tremendous amount.  I mean, I'm president.  They  got me here.  You're talking about a tremendous number of people.  We want  to see fairness.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  So the president there wouldn't wholeheartedly endorse regulation.   It's kind of a political catch-22 for him, because he's been talking about  one of his big prizes is how they have been able to slash regulation over  the first 18, 19 months of his presidency.  </p><p>So if you endorse it, it's kind of backing something that you want to  essentially unwind.  Do these companies needs to be regulated?</p><p>LANCE:  They need to be fair.</p><p>And I think the president is 100 percent accurate.  Let's see if they can  be fair.  And I don't favor over-regulation.  I favor a free and fair  Internet.  And so let's get to the bottom of it.  And I agree with the  president.</p><p>BURMAN:  If they are regulated, how would you even go about that?  How on  Congress would that get done?</p><p>LANCE:  That would be a challenging endeavor.  </p><p>And, of course, I favor what is known as the BROWSER Act by Marsha  Blackburn of Tennessee.  And that relates to this whole issue.  </p><p>But, first, let's get to the bottom of it.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Here was the statement that Google put out as it relates to  Google.  They said this -- quote -- \"Search is not used to set a political  agenda and we don't bias our resorts\" -- \"results,\" rather, \"toward any  political ideology.\"</p><p>A spokesperson goes on to say: \"We continually work to improve Google  search, and we never ranked search results to manipulate political  sentiment.\"</p><p>That's Google's take.</p><p>Do you believe them?</p><p>LANCE:  We will see what is said on Capitol Hill this week.  </p><p>I am a cautious lawyer, but we ought to get to the bottom of it.  And that  is why we're holding our hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee.  </p><p>BURMAN:  All right, the president also brought up the issue of antitrust.   So you could go at it through potentially regulation.  He brought up the  issue of maybe there's an antitrust issue.</p><p>This is what the president said in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this  week.  He said -- quote -- \"I won't comment on the breaking up, whether  that's that -- meaning Google -- \"or Amazon or Facebook.\"</p><p>He went on to say: \"As you know, many people think it's a very antitrust  situation, the three of them, but I just -- I won't comment on that.\"</p><p>Antitrust issues here?</p><p>LANCE:  Potentially.  </p><p>But that would be referred to the Department of Justice.  And I don't know  whether it actually qualifies as an antitrust violation.  But, first, we on  Capitol Hill are going to see whether or not there is bias, intentional or  otherwise.  </p><p>BURMAN:  So I guess the big picture here is just that.  Is the bias  intentional?  Is it unintentional?  </p><p>We're at the dawn of the Internet age, right?  Like, these companies are  just a handful of years old.  Is it possible that they're just trying to  work their way through some things, or is it simply this is Silicon Valley  trying to target Republicans here?  </p><p>LANCE:  I hope it's not the latter.  I hope that it's a situation where the  company is just trying to work through this situation.  </p><p>But there are some concerns regarding the fact that it might be deliberate.   I don't reach that conclusion yet.  That's why we're holding the hearing.  </p><p>BURMAN:  You got Dorsey in the hot seat.  Do you want to see Bezos?  You  have already had Zuckerberg.  Do you want to continue to pull these people  in there?  You think anything enlightening can come from it?  </p><p>LANCE:  Yes, I think the testimony of Mark Zuckerberg was very  enlightening, when he came before the committee in the spring.  </p><p>I think that he may have violated, his company may have violated a consent  agreement with the FTC in 2011.  I asked him specifically about that.  And  I asked him whether he had a position the BROWSER legislation, and he's yet  to get back to us on that.  </p><p>BURMAN:  OK, wait and see, I guess.  And we will see what happens this  week.  </p><p>Congressman Leonard Lance, thank you for joining us this morning.  We  appreciate it.  </p><p>LANCE:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Meantime, coming up, Democrats denouncing a -- quote -- \"document  massacre,\" as the Trump administration keeps thousands of pages of Supreme  Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's White House work history from the Senate  Judiciary Committee.</p><p>How this could affect questioning at Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings  coming up later this week, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BURMAN:  Welcome back.</p><p>It looks like the Democrats have lost a weeks-long battle over Supreme  Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's paper trail from his years working in the  White House of President George W. Bush.</p><p>The Trump administration withholding more than 100,000 pages of document --  documents, rather.  They are citing executive privilege, with Kavanaugh's  confirmation hearings set to begin just a couple days from now on Tuesday.  </p><p>Let's bring our panel -- bring in the panel, rather.</p><p>Justin Walker is a former clerk for judge Kavanaugh and an assistant  professor of law at the University of Louisville.  Gregg Nunziata is a  former chief nominations counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee.  </p><p>Thank you both for joining us this morning.  </p><p>Thank you.  </p><p>GREGG NUNZIATA, FORMER SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHIEF NOMINATIONS  COUNSEL:  Good morning.  </p><p>BURMAN:  So, Gregg, you were there the last time -- and this would have  been about a decade ago -- that Brett Kavanaugh was preparing for his  nomination on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.  You got a little bit of  an insight as to what this last week or so might have been like for him.  </p><p>What do you think it's been like?  </p><p>NUNZIATA:  Well, that, his previous confirmation hearings were pretty  intense.  </p><p>The D.C. Circuit is often called the second most important court in the  country.  And at the time, he was serving in the Bush White House.  And a  lot of Democrats kind of used him as a way of attacking the president.  </p><p>So he's been through this before in a pretty tough environment.  This is  tougher still.  And it's a week long of hearings, including two very  lengthy marathon days of question and answers from senators, half of whom  are going to be out there to try to trip him up.  </p><p>So I'm sure he's been the careful lawyer he is.  He's been studying his own  record and studying existing law, Supreme Court precedent, and he will be  prepared this week.</p><p>BURMAN:  Justin, the best hope here for Democrats, it appears, is that  there might be some needle in a haystack-type thing and one of these  documents, in a page somewhere over his decades' worth long of being on the  bench.  </p><p>This was the reaction from the top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer,  as he posted this on Twitter about the withholding -- withholding of  100,000 or so pages of documents.  </p><p>Here's what Schumer said.  He wrote -- quote -- \"We're witnessing a Friday  night document massacre.  President Trump's decision to step in at the last  moment and hide 100,000 pages of Judge Kavanaugh's records from the  American public is not only unprecedented in the history of Supreme Court  nominations.  It has all the makings of a cover-up.\"</p><p>In a second sweet, Schumer goes on to say: \"What are they trying so  desperately to hide?\"</p><p>Your response to that would be?</p><p>JUSTIN WALKER, FORMER CLERK FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH:  Well, the only thing  unprecedented is this kind of hyperbolic rhetoric from people like Chuck  Schumer.  </p><p>The truth is that there have been more documents produced for Judge  Kavanaugh than for any nominee in history.  And, moreover, the most  important documents have been public all along.  They are the opinions he's  written, the opinions over 12 years on the second most important court in  the country.</p><p>And if you look at those 300 opinions, you see a judge who always goes  where the law leads, who understands the proper limited role of the  judiciary, who is very much in the mainstream, and who has been endorsed by  the Supreme Court on 13 separate occasions, an unparalleled record of  vindication for a lower court judge.</p><p>BURMAN:  White House officials that I have spoken with this week tell me  that they don't feel that there's anything, sort of a needle in a haystack  out there.  That's their position.  They have reason to feel confident, of  course.</p><p>But I'm wondering, to the both of you -- and, Gregg, you can go first --  when you're preparing for something like this, how are you ever really just  entirely confident that that's the case?</p><p>NUNZIATA:  Well, you -- the Senate, the White House has dozens of lawyers  looking through Judge Kavanaugh's public record, his personal life.</p><p>I mean, these things are gone over in detail.  I don't think anybody should  be expecting a big surprise from any of these documents or from the hearing  today.  And, as the professor says, I mean, his traditional record speaks  for itself.  And that's what the Senate should be focusing on.  </p><p>If you want to know what kind of judge he will be on the Supreme Court,  look at what kind of judge he's been on the D.C. Circuit for the last 10  years.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Justin, you clerked for him.  What was he like?</p><p>WALKER:  Oh, my goodness.</p><p>I have never met a better lawyer.  I have never worked for a better man.  I  had him as a teacher at law school.  He believes, he adheres -- he reveres  the Constitution.  And that comes across in his chambers.  </p><p>One thing he used to tell us as clerks is, he would say, every case is a  separation of powers case.  And what he meant is that every case requires  the judge to remember that it's the executive and the legislature who make  the law and it's the judge who merely applies the law.</p><p>BURMAN:  Justin, you were up there on the Senate Judiciary Committee.  You  know that there's a lot of preparation that goes into this.  This will be  splashed overall the networks, and rightfully so.  People will follow this.   There's going to be lots of questions, lots of answers, hours' worth,  headlines, et cetera, on down the line.  </p><p>But at the end of the day, 95, 96 of these 100 senators already have their  minds made up.  And it appears that conservatives -- that Republicans have  the numbers.  Does any of this -- I don't want to say it doesn't matter.   But is it a formality, essentially, at this point, just waiting for the  confirmation vote?  </p><p>NUNZIATA:  No, I think -- look, this is -- Supreme Court hearings are one  of the few times that we as a country really stop to talk about and to  focus on the role of the court in our system and what our Constitution  means to us as Americans.  </p><p>So I think it's important just in that sense alone.  But beyond that, I  mean, we do learn meaningful things about a nominee, about their  background, their fitness for the court, and their judicial philosophy.  </p><p>I think Americans are going to like what they hear when they hear from  Judge Kavanaugh.  I do think, the more they hear from him, the more  inevitable his confirmation becomes.  And, yes, there's a handful of votes  in play, particularly Democrats from states which the president carried  with a large margin in 2016.</p><p>I think they're going to be very interested in how these hearings go, and  they're going to be very interested in what they hear from their voters who  are watching.</p><p>BURMAN:  Justin, how important is it to actually get Brett Kavanaugh  confirmed by October 1, when the -- when the Supreme Court reconvenes?</p><p>Is it actually more important to get him in there by September 24, which is  the first time that they meet behind closed doors, the week leading into  this, or is it -- is it fine for the makeup of the court, forget the  person, but just the function of the court as it moves forward, if he isn't  in there for one reason or the next by October 1?  </p><p>WALKER:  Well, I think, from an institutional perspective, the sooner the  better.</p><p>And I think, the Senate obviously has a role to play in advise and consent.   It's a constitutional role.  So I'm sure they will do that thoughtfully.   And that takes some time.  </p><p>But there's -- really, I see no reason why that can't be done by the end of  September.  And if the senators really take seriously the advise and  consent function that the founders imagined, then we will be looking at a  100-0 confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh.  </p><p>Unfortunately, that's not -- that's not the world we live in right now.   We're going to see a lot of vicious attacks at the hearings this week.  But  I think what we will also see is a witness, a judge who's thoughtful and  friendly and scholarly, and someone who really the people -- the American  people really will like the more they learn about him.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Justin Walker, Gregg Nunziata, I know you will be watching.  so  will we.  Thank you joining us this morning.  </p><p>WALKER:  Thanks, Blake.</p><p>NUNZIATA:  Thanks for having us.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>And for all of you at home, make sure you stay with the FOX News Channel  all this week, as the Senate begins its confirmation hearings for Judge  Brett Kavanaugh.</p><p>Our special coverage starts on Tuesday.  </p><p>So what can we expect at those hearings, now that Democrats are furious at  the White House for withholding all of those documents, a lot of them, some  of them?</p><p>Our political panel takes a look on this, as we look ahead on \"Sunday  Morning Futures.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BURMAN:  Welcome back.</p><p>As you know by now, the confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court nominee  Brett Kavanaugh are set to start tomorrow.</p><p>The White House moved Friday night to withhold 100,000 pages worth of  documents from his records in the Bush 43 White House.  They cite executive  privilege.  Some Democrats are saying, uh-uh, not so.</p><p>Time now for our panel, Ed Rollins, former White House adviser to President  Reagan, a FOX News contributor and affiliated with a conservative PAC that  supports Kavanaugh's confirmation, we should add.  And Al D'Amato is a  former Republican senator from this state and a FOX News contributor as  well.</p><p>Thanks for joining us this morning.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Want to start, first, though, I'm sure it's been a tough last few  days for the both of you with the proceedings, the services and the passing  of Senator John McCain.</p><p>Just a word from you both?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Yesterday was spectacular day.</p><p>I mean, we had have two funerals, on Friday for Aretha Franklin, which was  a spectacular joining together of the black leadership of this country.   Yesterday was a -- was a memorial to a very decent man who has basically  been on the stage for 60 years.</p><p>And I think he staged it very well.  It was his -- and it was a great song  that Aretha sang which was called \"Respect.\"</p><p>BURMAN:  Right.</p><p>ROLLINS:  John McCain got his respect yesterday from the establishment.</p><p>Now, at the same time, the attack and the theme -- underlying theme was,  this is the establishment and they were attacking Trump.</p><p>BURMAN:  Right.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Trump is not the establishment.  Tomorrow, he goes back to -his  control of -- and the world of John McCain didn't turn out to be quite what  he wanted, in the sense that he wanted bipartisanship.  </p><p>You won't see it again this week.  You're going to see the hand grenades  back thrown with Kavanaugh.</p><p>BURMAN:  With Kavanaugh.</p><p>Al.</p><p>AL D'AMATO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  You can't help but admire a great hero.  </p><p>And why was he a great hero?  In my mind, anyone who suffered the way he  did, and yet refused to leave early -- he could have left I don't know how  many years earlier.  But he said, I'm not leaving prison and torture until  the men who are in here with me and before me are released.  </p><p>That's incredible.  That's heroic.  And, in my mind, he was always a very  special person because of that.  Did we always agree?  Just like all of the  people who spoke said, we had conflicts.</p><p>But he was a man of principle.  He believed in what he did.  He stood up,  and he had the highest values for this country.  And it was a great  testimony that people recognized this.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Senator McCain to be buried today in Annapolis, Maryland.  </p><p>You talked about what is coming up this week.  </p><p>Senator, you have been through many of these Supreme Court hearings.  You  would say to Brett Kavanaugh -- what would be the advice that you would  give him?</p><p>D'AMATO:  Keep doing what you have been doing.  He's been a fine jurist in  the second highest court in the nation, the appellate court.</p><p>His work is outstanding.  He is a scholar.  Everyone admits that.  He is a  gentleman.  He is a family person.  And his record speaks for itself.  So  those who raise questions now about, oh, 100,000 documents, et cetera, that  they'd like to see when he worked for the White House years ago, that's  just an attempt to slow down the proceedings, to embarrass him.</p><p>But his record is going to carry him through.  He will get all of the  Republican votes.  That's my opinion.  And he will get several Democrats  who will vote for him.</p><p>BURMAN:  You -- on this show, I had asked you in the days before the  president made the announcement, who do you want?  You said Amy Coney  Barrett.  Now you're trying to get Kavanaugh confirmed.</p><p>Has it been a full embrace for you, now that he's the pick?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Oh, totally.  Totally.  No, totally.</p><p>I thought a woman on the court, a conservative woman, would have been very  important.  And she may end up in the court before all is said here .</p><p>He's a superb choice.  The document thing is ridiculous.  These are  President Bush's documents.  These aren't his documents.  Having worked on  the White House staff, a couple White Houses, those aren't your documents.   Those are the president's documents.  And he was the staff secretary, so he  touched everything, but he didn't write them.</p><p>And the idea that the Congress wants them, no president would give those  up.  So my sense is, he will get confirmed.  It'll be a knock-down, drag- out.  And all of the good wishes of yesterday's funeral are all by the  wayside, and we're back -- we're back to warfare again come next Tuesday.</p><p>BURMAN:  Real quick, Senator, Democrats hit him how, Kavanaugh?</p><p>D'AMATO:  He will get several Democrats to vote for him.</p><p>BURMAN:  Think so?</p><p>D'AMATO:  Yes.</p><p>BURMAN:  Manchin, Donnelly, Heitkamp, the folks that went for Gorsuch?</p><p>D'AMATO:  Yes.</p><p>I think he will get two, if not three Democrats, and all of the  Republicans, including Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski.</p><p>BURMAN:  Fifty-two, fifty-three, fifty-four votes?</p><p>ROLLINS:  And the new senator from Arizona.</p><p>BURMAN:  And the new senator from Arizona.  Exactly.</p><p>Doug Ducey has a selection and probably will unveil it soon.</p><p>Stay right with us, Ed Rollins, Senator D'Amato.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Sure.</p><p>BURMAN:  We will be right back with our panel after this, as we look ahead  on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>Stay with.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BURMAN:  President Trump now having second thoughts about plans to cancel  pay raises for federal employees.</p><p>We are back with our panel, Ed Rollins, Senator Al D'Amato.  </p><p>Thanks for sticking around one again.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.  Thank you.  </p><p>BURMAN:  This came from the president earlier this week, Wednesday,  Thursday, basically saying, federal employees if you are not in the  military, you're not going to get a pay raise, potentially look at the  issue of merit-based pay.  </p><p>If nothing else, for these employees, it's something you don't want to see.   And on the political front, it's a -- it's not a good headline for this...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, you don't want to go -- you don't want to go to war with  your employees.  And the bottom line is that a 2 percent pay increase is  not dramatic.  </p><p>And my sense is, the savings, which is about $25 billion, in a $4 trillion  budget, with a trillion-dollar deficit, it's not that significant.  And I  think it would be a very terrible thing for the morale of the employees.  </p><p>BURMAN:  How do you keep -- how do you keep qualified employees?  Because,  when you look back -- we were just talking about this.  When you look back,  President Obama froze it for three consecutive years.  The economy was in a  much different place in 2011 than it is in 2018 now.</p><p>But if you're a federal employee, over the last several years, you have  barely seen a pay increase.  Why stay if you can get a good private sector  job?  </p><p>D'AMATO:  Well, you're absolutely right.  </p><p>And you might want to save money, but there are better ways to do it.  Look  at the real problems of how the deficit is growing.  Where is the spending?   What do you do to resolve it?</p><p>You have Social Security, which if it continues on this pattern, runs out  of money not too down -- far down the road.  Same thing with Medicare.</p><p>So what do you do?  Put together a bipartisan panel.  It was done.   President Reagan did it.  And guess what?  We saved Social Security.  We  strengthened it.  You can do the same thing again.</p><p>Now, if we're going to talk about bringing the country together and  bringing partisan politics, keeping it out, there are two areas where we  could save trillions of dollars over the next decade if we came together.</p><p>And, by the way, it's not tough.  You have people who are living longer.   You should adjust the time that they can retire.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  I would argue you don't want to do it before a campaign season.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Before November.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I would argue definitely that those are constituents.  </p><p>And I think I think the bottom line is you -- it's one of these things it's  going to take a year to do it, Al.  </p><p>D'AMATO:  Yes.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  It's not simple.</p><p>And I think, to a certain extent, the moment you mentioned Social Security,  if you're Republican, you get banged over the head by every Democrat in the  world.</p><p>BURMAN:  Got about a minute left.</p><p>So, real quick, we're about 64, 65 days whatever it is...</p><p>ROLLINS:  Right.  </p><p>BURMAN:  ... until November 7.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURMAN:  Some interesting races this past week.</p><p>Where do you think things stand?  What's the lay of the land, as we are  here?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  The lay of the land, quickly, is, there's three -- three  Republican seats in the Senate that are in trouble, or at least potentially  in trouble.  </p><p>One is the Nevada seat of Heller, the Arizona seat, and the Tennessee seat,  which are both open seats.  They are competitive.</p><p>There are four or five Democrat seats that are -- that are competitive.   And the House is very competitive.  And it could go either way.</p><p>My sense is, they're our seats, so our guys have to lose it.  And they have  to fight hard.</p><p>BURMAN:  Biggest worry as a Republican is what?</p><p>D'AMATO:  I think the Republicans pick up two to three seats, the Democrats  pick up two seats.  So we will hold the Senate.</p><p>I think we have trouble in the House.  Reapportionment, court decisions  come down.  Pennsylvania, we will lose a couple of seats.  We may lose one  in New York.</p><p>The chances are, at this point, we lose the House.</p><p>BURMAN:  Really?  You think so?  Chances are?</p><p>D'AMATO:  Yes, chances are.</p><p>BURMAN:  Great chances or just coin flip-type stuff?</p><p>D'AMATO:  Well, right now, I would say it's 60/40.  It can turn, but, right  now, we're in trouble in the House.</p><p>BURMAN:  Ed, do you agree, real quick?</p><p>ROLLINS:  I would argue it's truly, who's going to vote is the critical  thing, and can we get our vote out?  If we get our vote out, we're going to  be OK.  If we don't get our vote out, then, obviously, we could lose.</p><p>BURMAN:  And you got 65 days, I believe, to do that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURMAN:  So we will see what happens between now and November 7.</p><p>Thank you both for joining us.  Appreciate it.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Great.  Thank you.  </p><p>D'AMATO:  Good being with you.</p><p>BURMAN:  That does it this morning, believe it or not, for \"Sunday Morning  Futures.\"</p><p>I am Blake Burman, in for Maria Bartiromo.  Maria will be back next week.  </p><p>Make sure to watch both of us on the FOX Business Network as well.  </p><p>\"Media Buzz With Howard Kurtz\" is coming up next.

I'm Blake Burman, in for Maria Bartiromo, and  this is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The president slamming Canada for -- quote -- \"ripping us off\" and warning  Congress not to interfere as NAFTA talks continued.  So what's the impact  if a deal cannot be reached?  </p><p> Lee Zeldin is a member of the House Financial Services and Foreign Affairs  Committees.  He joins me next.  </p><p> Plus: Congress set to grill tech execs later this week over claims that  conservatives are being censored online.  The president calling for change,  but is regulation the right answer going forward?  Congressman Leonard  Lance will be questioning Twitter's CEO, and he is here this morning to  weigh in.  </p><p> Plus:  The White House says it is withholding 100,000 pages of Judge  Kavanaugh's records just days before his confirmation proceedings begin.  I  will talk to a former Kavanaugh clerk about what we can expect this week,  as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"  </p><p> And right out the gate this morning, President Trump renewing his attacks  on Canada and NAFTA, warning our neighbors to the north that it will be out  of a revised agreement if it doesn't concede to new terms.  The president  also warning Congress not to interfere with trade negotiations going  forward, or he would terminate the trade deal altogether, all of this as  the U.S. and Canada are set to restart trade talks a few days now on  Wednesday.  </p><p> Let's bring in the New York Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin.  He sits on  both the House Financial Services and House Foreign Affairs Committees.  </p><p> And he joins us from New York this morning.  </p><p> Hello, Congressman.  </p><p> REP. LEE ZELDIN (R), NEW YORK:  Good morning.  </p><p> BURMAN:  Good morning to you.  </p><p> So there's a few ways to go forward with this on a potential revamped  NAFTA.  There could be a three-way deal between the U.S., Mexico and  Canada.  There could be two bilateral deals, one with Mexico and the U.S.,  one with Canada and the U.S., or there could be nothing as it relates to  Canada.</p><p> Which side are you on?</p><p> ZELDIN:  I think that the best thing for the United States is going to be  to be able to get a deal that also includes Canada.</p><p> However, the president isn't going to just cut a deal with Canada just to  cut one.  He made a pledge during his campaign that he genuinely believes  in that we can do better than NAFTA, that NAFTA has hurt us with regards to  the businesses that we have lost, with regards to the millions of jobs that  we have lost as well.  </p><p> So, the president feels good about that deal that was cut with Mexico, and  feels like he is a -- and he is -- in a good position negotiating with  Canada with really important goals.  So I would fall onto the side of being  able to enter into a deal that includes Canada.</p><p> Our relations -- the United States and Canada, that trade relationship is  vitally important.  There's a long history.  Next to United States and  China, it is a massive trade relationship between the two nations.  So it  would be great for the United States to enter into a better deal with  Canada, but not just to enter into one just to enter into one.  </p><p> So option B ends up being, you enter into a better deal with Mexico.  And  then you just walk from NAFTA, and then maybe Canada decides to revisit  some of the issues that are really important, like dairy, where there needs  to be a concession on the part of the Canadians.  </p><p> BURMAN:  Yes, I know that's a big issue in New York.</p><p> You saw, I'm sure, that the tweet that President Trump sent out just  yesterday.  It was kind of a two-fold threat both to Canada and to  Congress.  This was the tweet right here from the president.</p><p> He said -- quote -- \"There is no political necessity to keep Canada in the  new NAFTA deal.  If we don't make a fair deal for the U.S. after decades of  abuse, Canada will be out.  Congress shouldn't interfere with these  negotiations, or I will simply terminate NAFTA entirely, and we will be far  better off.\"</p><p> So breaking that down, let's start with Congress.  </p><p> Is there an appetite amongst your colleagues there, both Republicans and  Democrats, to potentially give this president the trade deal and the trade  win that he so desires?</p><p> ZELDIN:  I think this really about giving the American economy a trade win,  giving American workers and American companies the trade win.  That is what  I want as a member of Congress.  </p><p> Unfortunately, there are other members of Congress who want political wins.   They want to become the speaker of the House.  They want to become chair of  a committee in the House.  They have taken a pledge to resist, oppose,  impeach obstruct this president on everything and anything.  </p><p> So there are 535 members of Congress.  Many of us want what's best for the  American worker and the American economy.  Others want what is best in  their goals to take down President Trump.</p><p> So as far as the president's tweet goes, I think that's a strong message to  the members of Congress who want a political win, selfishly for themselves,  because they want power not to mess around, because you're going to --  you're not only going to be hurting yourselves politically, but you're  going to be, most importantly, hurting our country.  </p><p> BURMAN:  Just a couple more on this.</p><p> The dairy issue is a big one for New York, the state of which you are  representative -- a representative in.  If Canada doesn't move on that  issue, might change your -- your potential vote one way or the next?</p><p> ZELDIN:  I don't think that this administration -- I don't want to speak  for the administration.  And I don't know what I'm about to say is actually  their position, but my impression is that they're not cutting a deal with - - with Canada where Canada is not budging at all with regards to dairy.  </p><p> And this administration has taken a tough stance, a correct stance,  fighting on behalf of many different businesses all across our country and  for the American economy that Canada is going to have to make concessions  as it relates to dairy.  </p><p> I don't believe that this administration would be sending a deal to  Congress with Canada where Canada makes no concessions on dairy.  But,  again, I'm just speculating.  </p><p> BURMAN:  Right.  </p><p> OK, one last one on this, Congressman, before we move on.  The chief  negotiator for Canada earlier this week, on Friday actually, once this was  racing to a deadline, was asked whether or not she essentially feels that  the United States wants a deal, or at least is acting in good faith with  all of this.  </p><p> And this was her response.  Watch here.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUESTION:  Do you think they're negotiating in good faith?</p><p> CHRYSTIA FREELAND, CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  Ambassador Lighthizer and  his team through this negotiation have been working really, really hard.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  There was a pause there, and it wasn't a yes.  </p><p> So, the Canadians seem, it believes -- or at least seems to be somewhat  skeptical.  And you saw the tweet from the president.</p><p> What we're in right now, is that just the ebbs and flows of negotiations,  or is it possible that these two just cannot get to a middle ground at some  point?  </p><p> ZELDIN:  Well, the president is operating from a position of strength, not  weakness.</p><p> With regards to American foreign policy all across the globe, it is  important for us to be operating from positions of strength, and not to  just concede that.  And what we have seen in the past is -- one of the  analogies I like to use, Texas hold'em, the best starting hand are pocket  aces.</p><p> The worst are the two -- the two, seven off-suit.  The United States  inherits, the president of the United States, we inherit those pocket aces.   And sometimes, as a negotiating strategy, we feel guilty about it.  We  apologize for American exceptionalism.  We trade in our pocket aces.  You  say, you play these.  I will play your two, seven off-suit.  </p><p> Now, the United States has the largest economy in the entire world.  The  president understands that.  He's leveraging it correctly.  And he -- and  his job is to represent America, just like Canada is saying they're not  going to enter into a deal that's not in the best interest of Canada.   That's a fair position on the part of the Canadians.  </p><p> But the president's position is one that's a position of strength, that is  leveraging the United States economy well, and is not going to just take a  position of weakness to grab one, and isn't going to just cut a deal with  Canada just to cut one.  </p><p> BURMAN:  All right, I want to move on here.  </p><p> The president, as we know, he has been has been critical of Canada.  He has  also been very critical of his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions.  He was  asked in a Bloomberg interview in the White House in the Oval Office  earlier this week, essentially saying that Sessions has his job, the  attorney general does, until the November election.</p><p> And then he was asked, well, what about after that?  </p><p> And here's what the president said -- quote -- \"I don't want to comment on  it.  Look, I just would love to have him do a great job.  And I would love  to have him look at the other side.\"</p><p> It appears, Congressmen, that the attorney general, his time as attorney  general, essentially has an expiration date on it.  Is that the way to view  this?</p><p> ZELDIN:  Could be.  I don't know what the president's thinking is.  I don't  know what A.G. Sessions' thinking is.</p><p> I believe that the attorney general should revisit the scope of his recusal  in what we're -- I mean, what we're working every day on, especially on  other networks, where it's just 24/7 wall-to-wall coverage 365 about trying  to take this president down, is that the attorney general, because of the  scope of his refusal, almost seems like he's not in charge of the Justice  Department, that he's recused himself out of a large portion of his job in  what is by far the highest-profile role that the Justice Department is  playing right now in American politics.  </p><p> So it would be great to have an attorney general, whether that's Attorney  General Sessions or someone else, it'd be great to have an attorney general  who is completely in charge of the Justice Department.  </p><p> And, unfortunately, we're at the case right now where you have a special  counsel that gets created in order to look into Russian interference, and  it appears like the scope of that investigation has gone so far beyond the  scope of why it was created, that that needs to be refocused, that needs to  be narrowed, and, in many respects, it needs to be ended, where you have  six million different -- it's a six million-headed monster right now.  </p><p> So, if they're -- if they are looking at 17 different things, well, the  perception is that they're looking at six million different things.  And  they created those clouds.  </p><p> So if you have no evidence that President Trump colluded with the Russians,  just come out and say it.  Let's clear up some of those clouds, so the  American people can move forward.</p><p> BURMAN:  You say it needs to be ended.  We are almost 60 days until the  November election.  It's Thursday or Friday is the 60-day mark.</p><p> In your, mind if Bob Mueller has something or anything of significance,  does it need to come out before the end of this week, so that there is some  distance between then and the end of the election?  Or should he wait if he  potentially has something until after the election?</p><p> ZELDIN:  I mean, if there's anything that is damaging that he wants to come  out with, the closer that you get to November, the more it ends up  influencing the political process.  </p><p> So if there's something that he's planning on coming out that is damaging  to someone, something, it's best that it comes out right now.  Now, between  now and November, if -- if there's any dead ends that he is aware of, where  there is a cloud over a particular -- a person or a party or a company, he  can come out with that information anytime between now and November,  because the American public needs to have as much information as possible  as to what they have decided wasn't done, where there wasn't any  wrongdoing.</p><p> But if there's anything damaging that he has that he's going to come out  with between now and November, it really should -- it really should come  out now.</p><p> BURMAN:  Congressman Lee Zeldin, joining us from Southampton, New York,  this morning, I'm sure it is beautiful out there on this holiday weekend.   So we thank you for stopping in and joining us.  Thanks, sir.</p><p> ZELDIN:  You got it.</p><p> BURMAN:  Coming up:  Can Apple be used as a bargaining chip to defuse trade  tensions between the U.S. and China?  And might the Chinese use it as one?</p><p> My next guest says Beijing not prepared for a long-term struggle with  Washington.  Asia expert Gordon Chang joins me with his unique take coming  up.</p><p> And, remember, you can follow us at @SundayFutures right there, as we look  ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p> Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BURMAN:  Welcome back.</p><p> Could be a big week on the trade front, as President Trump potentially  could slap further tariffs, up to 25 percent, on an additional $200 billion  worth of imports from China.</p><p> The latest volley in the growing trade war, as some would call it, could  hurt American companies with interests inside that country.  And some  analysts warn that Beijing could use Apple and other blue chips to tip the  scales in their favor.  </p><p>Gordon Chang is the author of \"The Coming Collapse of China.\"</p><p> And he joins us live in studio this morning.  </p><p> Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\":  Thanks, Blake.  </p><p> BURMAN:  So we're hearing that, I'm hearing that the president's talked  about this possibility of putting the $200 billion worth of tariffs further  on China at some point this week.  The public comment period, as you know,  ends on Wednesday.  So it could happen after that.  </p><p> What do you think the president's going to do, and what do you think he  should do?  </p><p>CHANG:  Well, I think he should put the tariffs on the $200 billion of  goods.  He should do it at the 25 percent rate, rather than the 10.</p><p> I would even go higher.  And the reason is, the Chinese have been stealing  hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. intellectual property each year.   That's what these tariffs are intended to remedy.  And the Chinese are not  stopping.  </p><p> So, clearly, we got to make the costs higher.  </p><p> BURMAN:  I know you call this a tech war, not a trade war, because of that  I.P. theft, but the Chinese have not given any indication whatsoever that  they're going to back off that position.  </p><p> So would tariffs even move them off it?  Because they haven't -- haven't  yet.</p><p>CHANG:  Yes, tariffs may not do it.  And we may have to put like 100  percent tariffs on $505.5 billion worth of goods, which is we what  imported.</p><p> BURMAN:  That's not going to happen, though, right?</p><p>CHANG:  Well, you never know.  </p><p> But the point is, if tariffs don't work, then we have to go to something  even more drastic, which would be just banning Chinese imports.  But one  way or another, we have got to stop China's theft, because we have an  innovation-based economy.  If we cannot commercialize that innovation, we  don't have very much of an economy.</p><p> So we have our backs against the wall.  And you can't run.  And I know  there's going to be costs to the U.S., but you just can't run decades of  bad trade policy and think, oh, we can get out of this without cost to  ourselves.  </p><p> BURMAN:  Here was the -- the statement from the White House earlier this  week that President Trump tweeted out.</p><p> He said -- quote -- or the White House statement -- quote -- \"As for the  U.S.-China trade disputes and other differences, they will be resolved in  time by President Trump and China's great President Xi Jinping.  That  relationship and bond remain very strong.\"</p><p> Where does this end?  I mean, you just floated the possibility of 100  percent tariffs, not that the administration has said that they're doing  that.</p><p>CHANG:  No.  No.</p><p> BURMAN:  But what's the finish line here?  </p><p>CHANG:  Well, the finish line is probably not months.  It's probably years  or maybe even a decade.  </p><p> We did have a trade arrangement with China last spring.  It didn't sustain.   It didn't hold.  So President Trump could have a deal with Xi Jinping, and  I don't think it's going to hold, because he's seen -- Xi Jinping has  decided not to give up.</p><p> He has lost some influence recently.  He came out of the recent meetings at  -- sort of diminished.  So he realizes that, if he gives up, he's going to  be eroded even further.  So I think he's going to try to bluff Trump into  making concessions where we don't really have to.</p><p> BURMAN:  You talk -- we talk about, in the greater scheme of things, the  U.S. vs. China, but the companies within the United States are really the  ones that bear the benefits or the cost.</p><p> You think the company that potentially has the biggest exposure here is  Apple, which is the biggest United States company.  Why do you think that?  </p><p>CHANG:  Well, first of all, we know the Chinese have gone after Apple.   They did that in March 2013.  They did it in the beginning of last month,  where they talked about how Apple had to give more to the Chinese if they  wanted to stay in the country.</p><p> That was almost extortion.  But the, really, reason why Apple has a problem  is because it has a supply chain that's very difficult to move.  It's got  Foxconn, its contract manufacturer.  They're in China.  It would take a  number of years for Foxconn and Apple to move elsewhere.  </p><p> Other companies, basically, they can move a lot quicker, with perhaps the  exception of the pharmaceuticals.  But everybody else can move their supply  chains quickly.  So China's threats against other companies are pretty  hollow.  Against Apple, it's a real threat.</p><p> BURMAN:  Real quick, North Korea, the president now is back to the argument  that the Chinese are not acting the way that he would like to see fit as it  relates to North Korea.</p><p> We're now a couple months past the summit.  Where do you think things stand  with -- with the North Koreans?  And the president is starting to make this  argument now -- or he has been for a little while -- no missile tests, they  haven't been firing off rockets.  </p><p> Is that a -- moving of the goalposts, or is that a fair metric for us to  judge this whole situation by?</p><p>CHANG:  It's a fair metric, but we have got to remember, in the past, there  have been long periods where the North Koreans didn't test and they started  to test again</p><p> What we're going to have to do is go back to that maximum pressure campaign  that made President Trump so successful up to the end of May.  Since that  time, he's tried to create this really friendly environment.  It hasn't  worked.</p><p> The North Koreans are not taking advantage of that one-shot opportunity the  president is giving them.  So he's got to go back to sanctions.  And,  unfortunately, it's going to be difficult.  But the North Koreans, again,  are not leaving us with much of a choice.</p><p> BURMAN:  I was going to say, real quickly, if you think sanctions for the  North Koreans, you would go full-throttle on that?  Real quick.</p><p>CHANG:  Especially the Chinese banks and the Russians and increasingly the  South Koreans.</p><p> BURMAN:  Gordon Chang, thank you for joining us this morning.  Big week  ahead.  We will see where it takes us.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks, Blake.</p><p> BURMAN:  Appreciate it.  </p><p> Meantime, coming up: top social media executives set to once again make  their way to Capitol Hill amid growing public outcry over what many  consider to be anti-conservative censorship online.</p><p> House Energy and Commerce Committee member Leonard Lance joins us next with  his take, as we look ahead this Sunday morning on a holiday weekend on  \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BURMAN:  Welcome back.</p><p> Top executives from Facebook and Twitter set to testify before the Senate  Intelligence Committee later this week, as the social media giant has faced  accusations of anti-conservative censorships on their platforms.</p><p> Their most vocal critic?  President Trump, pledging his administration will  not let tech companies -- quote -- \"control what we can and cannot see.\"</p><p> Joining me now is the New Jersey Congressman Leonard Lance.  He is a member  of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  </p><p> Thank you for joining us in studio this morning.  </p><p> REP. LEONARD LANCE (R), NEW JERSEY:  Thank you for having me.</p><p> BURMAN:  There's a couple different hearings.</p><p> The Senate side is more on how these tech companies can -- can help out  with elections, and et cetera.  On your side, you have got Jack Dorsey in  the hot seat and what many view as a bias of these social media companies  against conservatives.</p><p> You plan to ask the Twitter CEO what?</p><p> LANCE:  Whether there is bias and why, based upon their algorithm, they may  have chosen certain content over other content.  </p><p> It will be a busy day for Mr. Dorsey.  He will be at the Senate first and  then he comes over to our side of the Congress, to the House Energy and  Commerce Committee, Wednesday afternoon.  </p><p> BURMAN:  So I guess the question is, do you think that, if there -- if you  think there is bias, do you think it's purposely being directed at  conservatives, at Republicans?  And if it is, Twitter's a massive company.</p><p> Is there anything that you could even do about it?</p><p> LANCE:  I don't know whether it's intentional or not, but we intend to get  to the bottom of it.  </p><p> And this is based upon our majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, who is very  strong on this issue.  And he has worked with the chairman of the  committee, Greg Walden of Oregon.  And we intend to get to the bottom of  it.  And, of course, the American people demand fairness and not bias in  any way, shape, or form.  </p><p> BURMAN:  Of course, the follow-up here is -- is regulation, right, whether  this company, other big tech companies need to be regulated.</p><p> The president specifically earlier this week, on Twitter, and then there  were a lot of questions after it, took on Google.  And this was the  question that was posed to President Trump.  Watch it real quick about  regulation and Google.  Watch here. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You know what we want?  Not  regulation.  We want fairness.  When we have fairness, we are all very  happy.  </p><p> But you're talking about a tremendous amount.  I mean, I'm president.  They  got me here.  You're talking about a tremendous number of people.  We want  to see fairness.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  So the president there wouldn't wholeheartedly endorse regulation.   It's kind of a political catch-22 for him, because he's been talking about  one of his big prizes is how they have been able to slash regulation over  the first 18, 19 months of his presidency.  </p><p> So if you endorse it, it's kind of backing something that you want to  essentially unwind.  Do these companies needs to be regulated?</p><p> LANCE:  They need to be fair.</p><p> And I think the president is 100 percent accurate.  Let's see if they can  be fair.  And I don't favor over-regulation.  I favor a free and fair  Internet.  And so let's get to the bottom of it.  And I agree with the  president.</p><p> BURMAN:  If they are regulated, how would you even go about that?  How on  Congress would that get done?</p><p> LANCE:  That would be a challenging endeavor.  </p><p> And, of course, I favor what is known as the BROWSER Act by Marsha  Blackburn of Tennessee.  And that relates to this whole issue.  </p><p> But, first, let's get to the bottom of it.  </p><p> BURMAN:  Here was the statement that Google put out as it relates to  Google.  They said this -- quote -- \"Search is not used to set a political  agenda and we don't bias our resorts\" -- \"results,\" rather, \"toward any  political ideology.\"</p><p> A spokesperson goes on to say: \"We continually work to improve Google  search, and we never ranked search results to manipulate political  sentiment.\"</p><p> That's Google's take.</p><p> Do you believe them?</p><p> LANCE:  We will see what is said on Capitol Hill this week.  </p><p> I am a cautious lawyer, but we ought to get to the bottom of it.  And that  is why we're holding our hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee.  </p><p> BURMAN:  All right, the president also brought up the issue of antitrust.   So you could go at it through potentially regulation.  He brought up the  issue of maybe there's an antitrust issue.</p><p> This is what the president said in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this  week.  He said -- quote -- \"I won't comment on the breaking up, whether  that's that -- meaning Google -- \"or Amazon or Facebook.\"</p><p> He went on to say: \"As you know, many people think it's a very antitrust  situation, the three of them, but I just -- I won't comment on that.\"</p><p> Antitrust issues here?</p><p> LANCE:  Potentially.  </p><p> But that would be referred to the Department of Justice.  And I don't know  whether it actually qualifies as an antitrust violation.  But, first, we on  Capitol Hill are going to see whether or not there is bias, intentional or  otherwise.  </p><p> BURMAN:  So I guess the big picture here is just that.  Is the bias  intentional?  Is it unintentional?  </p><p> We're at the dawn of the Internet age, right?  Like, these companies are  just a handful of years old.  Is it possible that they're just trying to  work their way through some things, or is it simply this is Silicon Valley  trying to target Republicans here?  </p><p> LANCE:  I hope it's not the latter.  I hope that it's a situation where the  company is just trying to work through this situation.  </p><p> But there are some concerns regarding the fact that it might be deliberate.   I don't reach that conclusion yet.  That's why we're holding the hearing.  </p><p> BURMAN:  You got Dorsey in the hot seat.  Do you want to see Bezos?  You  have already had Zuckerberg.  Do you want to continue to pull these people  in there?  You think anything enlightening can come from it?  </p><p> LANCE:  Yes, I think the testimony of Mark Zuckerberg was very  enlightening, when he came before the committee in the spring.  </p><p> I think that he may have violated, his company may have violated a consent  agreement with the FTC in 2011.  I asked him specifically about that.  And  I asked him whether he had a position the BROWSER legislation, and he's yet  to get back to us on that.  </p><p> BURMAN:  OK, wait and see, I guess.  And we will see what happens this  week.  </p><p> Congressman Leonard Lance, thank you for joining us this morning.  We  appreciate it.  </p><p> LANCE:  Thank you very much.  </p><p> BURMAN:  Meantime, coming up, Democrats denouncing a -- quote -- \"document  massacre,\" as the Trump administration keeps thousands of pages of Supreme  Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's White House work history from the Senate  Judiciary Committee.</p><p> How this could affect questioning at Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings  coming up later this week, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BURMAN:  Welcome back.</p><p> It looks like the Democrats have lost a weeks-long battle over Supreme  Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's paper trail from his years working in the  White House of President George W. Bush.</p><p> The Trump administration withholding more than 100,000 pages of document --  documents, rather.  They are citing executive privilege, with Kavanaugh's  confirmation hearings set to begin just a couple days from now on Tuesday.  </p><p> Let's bring our panel -- bring in the panel, rather.</p><p> Justin Walker is a former clerk for judge Kavanaugh and an assistant  professor of law at the University of Louisville.  Gregg Nunziata is a  former chief nominations counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee.  </p><p> Thank you both for joining us this morning.  </p><p> Thank you.  </p><p> GREGG NUNZIATA, FORMER SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHIEF NOMINATIONS  COUNSEL:  Good morning.  </p><p> BURMAN:  So, Gregg, you were there the last time -- and this would have  been about a decade ago -- that Brett Kavanaugh was preparing for his  nomination on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.  You got a little bit of  an insight as to what this last week or so might have been like for him.  </p><p> What do you think it's been like?  </p><p> NUNZIATA:  Well, that, his previous confirmation hearings were pretty  intense.  </p><p> The D.C. Circuit is often called the second most important court in the  country.  And at the time, he was serving in the Bush White House.  And a  lot of Democrats kind of used him as a way of attacking the president.  </p><p> So he's been through this before in a pretty tough environment.  This is  tougher still.  And it's a week long of hearings, including two very  lengthy marathon days of question and answers from senators, half of whom  are going to be out there to try to trip him up.  </p><p> So I'm sure he's been the careful lawyer he is.  He's been studying his own  record and studying existing law, Supreme Court precedent, and he will be  prepared this week.</p><p> BURMAN:  Justin, the best hope here for Democrats, it appears, is that  there might be some needle in a haystack-type thing and one of these  documents, in a page somewhere over his decades' worth long of being on the  bench.  </p><p> This was the reaction from the top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer,  as he posted this on Twitter about the withholding -- withholding of  100,000 or so pages of documents.  </p><p> Here's what Schumer said.  He wrote -- quote -- \"We're witnessing a Friday  night document massacre.  President Trump's decision to step in at the last  moment and hide 100,000 pages of Judge Kavanaugh's records from the  American public is not only unprecedented in the history of Supreme Court  nominations.  It has all the makings of a cover-up.\"</p><p> In a second sweet, Schumer goes on to say: \"What are they trying so  desperately to hide?\"</p><p> Your response to that would be?</p><p> JUSTIN WALKER, FORMER CLERK FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH:  Well, the only thing  unprecedented is this kind of hyperbolic rhetoric from people like Chuck  Schumer.  </p><p> The truth is that there have been more documents produced for Judge  Kavanaugh than for any nominee in history.  And, moreover, the most  important documents have been public all along.  They are the opinions he's  written, the opinions over 12 years on the second most important court in  the country.</p><p> And if you look at those 300 opinions, you see a judge who always goes  where the law leads, who understands the proper limited role of the  judiciary, who is very much in the mainstream, and who has been endorsed by  the Supreme Court on 13 separate occasions, an unparalleled record of  vindication for a lower court judge.</p><p> BURMAN:  White House officials that I have spoken with this week tell me  that they don't feel that there's anything, sort of a needle in a haystack  out there.  That's their position.  They have reason to feel confident, of  course.</p><p> But I'm wondering, to the both of you -- and, Gregg, you can go first --  when you're preparing for something like this, how are you ever really just  entirely confident that that's the case?</p><p> NUNZIATA:  Well, you -- the Senate, the White House has dozens of lawyers  looking through Judge Kavanaugh's public record, his personal life.</p><p> I mean, these things are gone over in detail.  I don't think anybody should  be expecting a big surprise from any of these documents or from the hearing  today.  And, as the professor says, I mean, his traditional record speaks  for itself.  And that's what the Senate should be focusing on.  </p><p> If you want to know what kind of judge he will be on the Supreme Court,  look at what kind of judge he's been on the D.C. Circuit for the last 10  years.  </p><p> BURMAN:  Justin, you clerked for him.  What was he like?</p><p> WALKER:  Oh, my goodness.</p><p> I have never met a better lawyer.  I have never worked for a better man.  I  had him as a teacher at law school.  He believes, he adheres -- he reveres  the Constitution.  And that comes across in his chambers.  </p><p> One thing he used to tell us as clerks is, he would say, every case is a  separation of powers case.  And what he meant is that every case requires  the judge to remember that it's the executive and the legislature who make  the law and it's the judge who merely applies the law.</p><p> BURMAN:  Justin, you were up there on the Senate Judiciary Committee.  You  know that there's a lot of preparation that goes into this.  This will be  splashed overall the networks, and rightfully so.  People will follow this.   There's going to be lots of questions, lots of answers, hours' worth,  headlines, et cetera, on down the line.  </p><p> But at the end of the day, 95, 96 of these 100 senators already have their  minds made up.  And it appears that conservatives -- that Republicans have  the numbers.  Does any of this -- I don't want to say it doesn't matter.   But is it a formality, essentially, at this point, just waiting for the  confirmation vote?  </p><p> NUNZIATA:  No, I think -- look, this is -- Supreme Court hearings are one  of the few times that we as a country really stop to talk about and to  focus on the role of the court in our system and what our Constitution  means to us as Americans.  </p><p> So I think it's important just in that sense alone.  But beyond that, I  mean, we do learn meaningful things about a nominee, about their  background, their fitness for the court, and their judicial philosophy.  </p><p> I think Americans are going to like what they hear when they hear from  Judge Kavanaugh.  I do think, the more they hear from him, the more  inevitable his confirmation becomes.  And, yes, there's a handful of votes  in play, particularly Democrats from states which the president carried  with a large margin in 2016.</p><p> I think they're going to be very interested in how these hearings go, and  they're going to be very interested in what they hear from their voters who  are watching.</p><p> BURMAN:  Justin, how important is it to actually get Brett Kavanaugh  confirmed by October 1, when the -- when the Supreme Court reconvenes?</p><p> Is it actually more important to get him in there by September 24, which is  the first time that they meet behind closed doors, the week leading into  this, or is it -- is it fine for the makeup of the court, forget the  person, but just the function of the court as it moves forward, if he isn't  in there for one reason or the next by October 1?  </p><p> WALKER:  Well, I think, from an institutional perspective, the sooner the  better.</p><p> And I think, the Senate obviously has a role to play in advise and consent.   It's a constitutional role.  So I'm sure they will do that thoughtfully.   And that takes some time.  </p><p> But there's -- really, I see no reason why that can't be done by the end of  September.  And if the senators really take seriously the advise and  consent function that the founders imagined, then we will be looking at a  100-0 confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh.  </p><p> Unfortunately, that's not -- that's not the world we live in right now.   We're going to see a lot of vicious attacks at the hearings this week.  But  I think what we will also see is a witness, a judge who's thoughtful and  friendly and scholarly, and someone who really the people -- the American  people really will like the more they learn about him.  </p><p> BURMAN:  Justin Walker, Gregg Nunziata, I know you will be watching.  so  will we.  Thank you joining us this morning.  </p><p> WALKER:  Thanks, Blake.</p><p> NUNZIATA:  Thanks for having us.  </p><p> BURMAN:  Yes.  </p><p> And for all of you at home, make sure you stay with the FOX News Channel  all this week, as the Senate begins its confirmation hearings for Judge  Brett Kavanaugh.</p><p> Our special coverage starts on Tuesday.  </p><p> So what can we expect at those hearings, now that Democrats are furious at  the White House for withholding all of those documents, a lot of them, some  of them?</p><p> Our political panel takes a look on this, as we look ahead on \"Sunday  Morning Futures.\"</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BURMAN:  Welcome back.</p><p> As you know by now, the confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court nominee  Brett Kavanaugh are set to start tomorrow.</p><p> The White House moved Friday night to withhold 100,000 pages worth of  documents from his records in the Bush 43 White House.  They cite executive  privilege.  Some Democrats are saying, uh-uh, not so.</p><p> Time now for our panel, Ed Rollins, former White House adviser to President  Reagan, a FOX News contributor and affiliated with a conservative PAC that  supports Kavanaugh's confirmation, we should add.  And Al D'Amato is a  former Republican senator from this state and a FOX News contributor as  well.</p><p> Thanks for joining us this morning.</p><p> ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.  </p><p> BURMAN:  Want to start, first, though, I'm sure it's been a tough last few  days for the both of you with the proceedings, the services and the passing  of Senator John McCain.</p><p> Just a word from you both?</p><p> ROLLINS:  Yesterday was spectacular day.</p><p> I mean, we had have two funerals, on Friday for Aretha Franklin, which was  a spectacular joining together of the black leadership of this country.   Yesterday was a -- was a memorial to a very decent man who has basically  been on the stage for 60 years.</p><p> And I think he staged it very well.  It was his -- and it was a great song  that Aretha sang which was called \"Respect.\"</p><p> BURMAN:  Right.</p><p> ROLLINS:  John McCain got his respect yesterday from the establishment.</p><p> Now, at the same time, the attack and the theme -- underlying theme was,  this is the establishment and they were attacking Trump.</p><p> BURMAN:  Right.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  Trump is not the establishment.  Tomorrow, he goes back to -his  control of -- and the world of John McCain didn't turn out to be quite what  he wanted, in the sense that he wanted bipartisanship.  </p><p> You won't see it again this week.  You're going to see the hand grenades  back thrown with Kavanaugh.</p><p> BURMAN:  With Kavanaugh.</p><p> Al.</p><p> AL D'AMATO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  You can't help but admire a great hero.  </p><p> And why was he a great hero?  In my mind, anyone who suffered the way he  did, and yet refused to leave early -- he could have left I don't know how  many years earlier.  But he said, I'm not leaving prison and torture until  the men who are in here with me and before me are released.  </p><p> That's incredible.  That's heroic.  And, in my mind, he was always a very  special person because of that.  Did we always agree?  Just like all of the  people who spoke said, we had conflicts.</p><p> But he was a man of principle.  He believed in what he did.  He stood up,  and he had the highest values for this country.  And it was a great  testimony that people recognized this.  </p><p> BURMAN:  Senator McCain to be buried today in Annapolis, Maryland.  </p><p> You talked about what is coming up this week.  </p><p> Senator, you have been through many of these Supreme Court hearings.  You  would say to Brett Kavanaugh -- what would be the advice that you would  give him?</p><p> D'AMATO:  Keep doing what you have been doing.  He's been a fine jurist in  the second highest court in the nation, the appellate court.</p><p> His work is outstanding.  He is a scholar.  Everyone admits that.  He is a  gentleman.  He is a family person.  And his record speaks for itself.  So  those who raise questions now about, oh, 100,000 documents, et cetera, that  they'd like to see when he worked for the White House years ago, that's  just an attempt to slow down the proceedings, to embarrass him.</p><p> But his record is going to carry him through.  He will get all of the  Republican votes.  That's my opinion.  And he will get several Democrats  who will vote for him.</p><p> BURMAN:  You -- on this show, I had asked you in the days before the  president made the announcement, who do you want?  You said Amy Coney  Barrett.  Now you're trying to get Kavanaugh confirmed.</p><p> Has it been a full embrace for you, now that he's the pick?</p><p> ROLLINS:  Oh, totally.  Totally.  No, totally.</p><p> I thought a woman on the court, a conservative woman, would have been very  important.  And she may end up in the court before all is said here .</p><p> He's a superb choice.  The document thing is ridiculous.  These are  President Bush's documents.  These aren't his documents.  Having worked on  the White House staff, a couple White Houses, those aren't your documents.   Those are the president's documents.  And he was the staff secretary, so he  touched everything, but he didn't write them.</p><p> And the idea that the Congress wants them, no president would give those  up.  So my sense is, he will get confirmed.  It'll be a knock-down, drag- out.  And all of the good wishes of yesterday's funeral are all by the  wayside, and we're back -- we're back to warfare again come next Tuesday.</p><p> BURMAN:  Real quick, Senator, Democrats hit him how, Kavanaugh?</p><p> D'AMATO:  He will get several Democrats to vote for him.</p><p> BURMAN:  Think so?</p><p> D'AMATO:  Yes.</p><p> BURMAN:  Manchin, Donnelly, Heitkamp, the folks that went for Gorsuch?</p><p> D'AMATO:  Yes.</p><p> I think he will get two, if not three Democrats, and all of the  Republicans, including Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski.</p><p> BURMAN:  Fifty-two, fifty-three, fifty-four votes?</p><p> ROLLINS:  And the new senator from Arizona.</p><p> BURMAN:  And the new senator from Arizona.  Exactly.</p><p> Doug Ducey has a selection and probably will unveil it soon.</p><p> Stay right with us, Ed Rollins, Senator D'Amato.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Sure.</p><p> BURMAN:  We will be right back with our panel after this, as we look ahead  on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p> Stay with.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BURMAN:  President Trump now having second thoughts about plans to cancel  pay raises for federal employees.</p><p> We are back with our panel, Ed Rollins, Senator Al D'Amato.  </p><p> Thanks for sticking around one again.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  Thank you.  Thank you.  </p><p> BURMAN:  This came from the president earlier this week, Wednesday,  Thursday, basically saying, federal employees if you are not in the  military, you're not going to get a pay raise, potentially look at the  issue of merit-based pay.  </p><p> If nothing else, for these employees, it's something you don't want to see.   And on the political front, it's a -- it's not a good headline for this...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, you don't want to go -- you don't want to go to war with  your employees.  And the bottom line is that a 2 percent pay increase is  not dramatic.  </p><p> And my sense is, the savings, which is about $25 billion, in a $4 trillion  budget, with a trillion-dollar deficit, it's not that significant.  And I  think it would be a very terrible thing for the morale of the employees.  </p><p> BURMAN:  How do you keep -- how do you keep qualified employees?  Because,  when you look back -- we were just talking about this.  When you look back,  President Obama froze it for three consecutive years.  The economy was in a  much different place in 2011 than it is in 2018 now.</p><p> But if you're a federal employee, over the last several years, you have  barely seen a pay increase.  Why stay if you can get a good private sector  job?  </p><p> D'AMATO:  Well, you're absolutely right.  </p><p> And you might want to save money, but there are better ways to do it.  Look  at the real problems of how the deficit is growing.  Where is the spending?   What do you do to resolve it?</p><p> You have Social Security, which if it continues on this pattern, runs out  of money not too down -- far down the road.  Same thing with Medicare.</p><p> So what do you do?  Put together a bipartisan panel.  It was done.   President Reagan did it.  And guess what?  We saved Social Security.  We  strengthened it.  You can do the same thing again.</p><p> Now, if we're going to talk about bringing the country together and  bringing partisan politics, keeping it out, there are two areas where we  could save trillions of dollars over the next decade if we came together.</p><p> And, by the way, it's not tough.  You have people who are living longer.   You should adjust the time that they can retire.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  I would argue you don't want to do it before a campaign season.  </p><p> BURMAN:  Before November.</p><p> ROLLINS:  I would argue definitely that those are constituents.  </p><p> And I think I think the bottom line is you -- it's one of these things it's  going to take a year to do it, Al.  </p><p> D'AMATO:  Yes.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  It's not simple.</p><p> And I think, to a certain extent, the moment you mentioned Social Security,  if you're Republican, you get banged over the head by every Democrat in the  world.</p><p> BURMAN:  Got about a minute left.</p><p> So, real quick, we're about 64, 65 days whatever it is...</p><p> ROLLINS:  Right.  </p><p> BURMAN:  ... until November 7.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BURMAN:  Some interesting races this past week.</p><p> Where do you think things stand?  What's the lay of the land, as we are  here?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> ROLLINS:  The lay of the land, quickly, is, there's three -- three  Republican seats in the Senate that are in trouble, or at least potentially  in trouble.  </p><p> One is the Nevada seat of Heller, the Arizona seat, and the Tennessee seat,  which are both open seats.  They are competitive.</p><p> There are four or five Democrat seats that are -- that are competitive.   And the House is very competitive.  And it could go either way.</p><p> My sense is, they're our seats, so our guys have to lose it.  And they have  to fight hard.</p><p> BURMAN:  Biggest worry as a Republican is what?</p><p> D'AMATO:  I think the Republicans pick up two to three seats, the Democrats  pick up two seats.  So we will hold the Senate.</p><p> I think we have trouble in the House.  Reapportionment, court decisions  come down.  Pennsylvania, we will lose a couple of seats.  We may lose one  in New York.</p><p> The chances are, at this point, we lose the House.</p><p> BURMAN:  Really?  You think so?  Chances are?</p><p> D'AMATO:  Yes, chances are.</p><p> BURMAN:  Great chances or just coin flip-type stuff?</p><p> D'AMATO:  Well, right now, I would say it's 60/40.  It can turn, but, right  now, we're in trouble in the House.</p><p> BURMAN:  Ed, do you agree, real quick?</p><p> ROLLINS:  I would argue it's truly, who's going to vote is the critical  thing, and can we get our vote out?  If we get our vote out, we're going to  be OK.  If we don't get our vote out, then, obviously, we could lose.</p><p> BURMAN:  And you got 65 days, I believe, to do that.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BURMAN:  So we will see what happens between now and November 7.</p><p> Thank you both for joining us.  Appreciate it.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Great.  Thank you.  </p><p> D'AMATO:  Good being with you.</p><p> BURMAN:  That does it this morning, believe it or not, for \"Sunday Morning  Futures.\"</p><p> I am Blake Burman, in for Maria Bartiromo.  Maria will be back next week.  </p><p> Make sure to watch both of us on the FOX Business Network as well.  </p><p> \"Media Buzz With Howard Kurtz\" is coming up next.

It may be too early to say if the trend will be embraced by other big tech public launches, but some industry watchers say there is cause for both concern and vigilance.</p><p>Finance experts from the University of Utah and Brigham Young University say this new model for public stock offerings is concerning.</p><p>\"It's a very disturbing trend,\" said Robert Dubil, professor of finance at the U.'s David Eccles School of Business. \"Going to public markets, asking for money but giving up zero control ... as a long-term investor, I wouldn't buy their stock.\"</p><p>Dubil said the rationale behind the trend is not hard to comprehend. The founders of the company, along with early investors, typically represent a relatively small number of people who, in the case of an offering like Snap, get to retain unfettered control of the company, while gaining all the advantages that come with a new influx of IPO capital. However, over the long term, other management skill sets usually become more vital to the company's continued fiscal health.</p><p>\"Is it smart engineers who should be running a company when it matures or, say, experts at navigating government regulations?\" asked Dubil. \"The challenges to stay profitable over time will change.\"</p><p>Snap's unique stock offering strategy has already created some potentially serious challenges for the company. Institutional investor groups have balked at the no-vote-stock offering, and some are actively lobbying for keeping the new Snap stock out of market indexes like the S&amp;P 500. This matters a lot, since institutional investors manage things like retirement accounts, which represent almost 40 percent ownership of the entire stock market. And, they are heavily invested in funds that track the index-listed companies.</p><p>\"Speaking from an institutional investor's standpoint, Snap's stock offering gives me some pause,\" said Steven Thorley, the H. Taylor Peery Professor of Finance at BYU's Marriott School of Management. \"Over the long term, things like an entrenched management team, nonresponsive management, or environmental or social concerns could not be addressed by shareholders who have no voice in making changes.\"</p><p>Thorley said a company's failure to earn a listing on index funds would make the stock even less attractive and provide further reason to avoid it as an investment.</p><p>\"Given that I, or any investor, has so many other alternatives, I would be looking elsewhere,\" Thorley said.</p><p>On Thursday, Kent Bersch, the executive director of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Council of Institutional Investors offered remarks to the Securities and Exchange Commission's Investor Advisory Committee that mirrored the concerns raised by Rubil and Thorley. The Council of Institutional Investors' 170 members manage or control some $23 trillion in assets.</p><p>\"Proponents of shielding founders and managers from a company's owners through multiclass structures say that the public markets too often are impatient, and visionary leaders must be protected from company owners to create value for the long term,\" said Bersch. \"For example, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel says it will be five years before markets will see what he can do.\"</p><p>\"That seems to be the basis for Snap's extreme disenfranchisement of public shareholders,\" Bersch added. \"I believe that assertion is dubious.\"</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:araymond@deseretnews.com\">araymond@deseretnews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-17132590</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N2P-XX71-JBRG-X15M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"667\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Deseret News Publishing Co.</copyright><publicationName>Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 12, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000DLFA</classCode><className>SNAP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0005XAH</classCode><className>BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF UTAH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0005XAH</classCode><className>BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SNAP (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

A veteran banker, August was appointed to his current position in April 2016. He previously served as UBS Head of Ultra High Net Worth and Global Family Office Switzerland based in Zurich. He enjoys running and trekking. Jyrki Rauhio, Citi Private Bank South Asia Head. Jyrki is responsible for the overall franchise of the private bank's ASEAN, Global India, Australia and New Zealand businesses. He has been with Citi for over 23 years. He likes foreign cultures and outdoor activites. Benjamin Cavalli, Credit Suisse Head of Private Banking South Asia, and CEO Singapore. Benjamin leads the private banking business in South Asia, comprising eight markets including Australia, India, Indonesia and Singapore. He prioritises spending time with his two daughters and is also active in philanthropic activities.What is your business outlook for the next couple of years? What do you see as the main drivers or dampeners'</p><p>August: We expect Asia to remain a centre of wealth creation for the next few years. At UBS, we are committed to delivering superior investment performance for our clients. We have been encouraged by our clients' confidence in us, reflected by our stellar 2Q2018 performance with invested assets of 387 billion Swiss franc (S$550 billion), and net new money flows of 8.2 billion Swiss franc in 1H 2018, consolidating our position as the number one wealth manager in the region.</p><p>We plan to consolidate our growth in the region by sharpening our focusing on China, Japan, and Taiwan, as well as the regional wealth management hubs, Singapore and Hong Kong.</p><p>According to our 2017 Billionaire report, Asian billionaires now outnumber their US counterparts. On average, a new billionaire was created in Asia every other day, led by China. Most of Asia's wealthy individuals are self-made, and we expect this trend to grow.</p><p>This presents tremendous growth opportunities for the wealth management business. And we are extremely well placed to benefit from the growth in Asia.</p><p>Jyrki: 2017 was the best year for our private banking business in Asia in over 10 years. In the first six months of this year, our Asia business has grown 21 per cent versus last year. I am particularly positive about our business in South-east Asia, given the rapid economic growth in the region which is seeing greater inflows due to the strong wealth creation. This gives rise to demand for wealth management services. For example, in Singapore, offshore assets are rising at a compound annual average rate of around 8 per cent.</p><p>However, we have to be mindful of the market environment, such as the looming US-China tariff battle. We have already seen a beaten down China stock market, which is down around 20 per cent since its high earlier this year.</p><p>\u00a0Furthermore, emerging market currencies are being hit and Asian currencies are not immune, as we are seeing in our region. This will have an effect on offshore banking accounts: On one hand, it encourages \"safe haven\" currencies and assets, on the other, it raises the hurdle to convert local currency holdings to hard currencies such as the US dollar.</p><p>Therefore, we expect a more challenging market environment in the next few months ahead but are confident that we will be able to achieve sustainable growth for our business by continuing to focus on our clients. Our objective is not to sell a specific product to clients but to offer a solution to them, being product agnostic.</p><p>Benjamin: There are tremendous growth opportunities in the private banking business in Asia as wealth continues to expand. Last year, Asia comprised 20-21 per cent of the global wealth pool for private banking and this figure is expected to go up to 25 per cent by 2025. Regional wealth management hubs like Singapore and Hong Kong are predicted to attract wealth from abroad at a faster rate over the next four years. Singapore is in a prime position as a leading wealth management hub.</p><p>At the same time, we also expect onshore wealth across Asian countries to grow at a faster pace than offshore wealth. However, accessing onshore wealth across Asia can be complex due to varied business and regulatory environments in this vastly heterogeneous region. To effectively serve the region's diverse wealth pools, complex private banking operating models are required. Credit Suisse has taken a long-term view of these evolving wealth trends in the region, and has expanded its domestic wealth management footprint into major and high potential wealth markets in the last decade, including Australia, Japan, India, Thailand.</p><p>While there is massive opportunity in the private banking business, the operating environment comes with challenging complexities and escalating cost of doing business. To stay relevant for clients, banks need to continuously enhance their value proposition in terms of the quality of our talent and advisory as well as the sophisticated global products and solutions platform we offer. We also need to harness technology to deliver the next level of client services and solutions.</p><p>At Credit Suisse, we are committed to be the trusted bank for entrepreneurs of Asia. According to Credit Suisse Research, over 80 per cent of the region's major listed family businesses are owned by first and second generation entrepreneurs, and this is our sweet spot. In our view, the business model that is best suited to these Asian entrepreneurs' needs is the integrated platform with strong wealth management and investment banking capabilities, to be able to effectively serve the current and future generation of clients throughout their entrepreneurial life-cycle, for both their corporate and personal wealth needs.</p><p>The latest Capgemini Wealth report talks about the possible entrance of \"Big tech\" into the wealth space and the importance of offering \"hybrid\" advice. What are your thoughts on the trends that could significantly shift the way private banking services are delivered to clients over the next two to five years'</p><p>August: In a world where the wealthy are getting wealthier, the population is ageing and the largest intergenerational wealth transfer is occurring, client needs are converging globally and clients are becoming globally mobile and globally minded. Client advisers must rise to this challenge - and UBS must provide them the tools to do so.</p><p>Clients demand a seamless, digitally enabled multi-channel experience, but always with a client adviser at the center of the experience. We have seen evidence that the more wealthy clients use our digital tools, the more they contact their adviser to provide the advice beyond the numbers that only a human advisor can provide.</p><p>Our clients demand access to a suite of global products and services as well as connectivity with peers, allies, business collaborators and social entrepreneurs across the globe. UBS aims to provide advice beyond investments, taking all the client's needs into perspective. Networks like the Global Philanthropist Community, the Industry Leader Network, or the Next Generation Foundation are all examples of how we bring our clients together with like-minded individuals.</p><p>Jyrki: There is no doubt that our clients across all age groups are becoming incredibly digitally savvy. However, robo-advisory is not something that they seem to be keen to rely on to make sizeable and important decisions - at least not for now.</p><p>With a hybrid advice model, which combines advice from wealth managers and robo-advisory, my view is that this is unlikely to go mainstream for most of our private banking clients. I am sure that there will be some interest from younger ultra high net worth individuals in the future who will be receptive to this new servicing approach and the way I see it, a robo-advisor can take up some of the simple responsibilities or tasks of the wealth manager, allowing him or her to focus on the more important aspects of the relationship and investment advisory.</p><p>With the entrance of the \"big tech\", we are already seeing disruptions in the consumer business. But private banking is a high-touch business and it will remain so as clients still prefer having personalised interactions and relationships with their bankers, especially when they are entrusting millions of dollars of their assets to them. While technology companies may win in the race for technology development, they are unlikely to be on par anytime soon with the private banks when it comes to the strength of relationships - which have been painstakingly developed over the years.</p><p>How private banking services are delivered to clients will surely evolve in the future, but I believe this will largely be due to how banks leverage data or artificial intelligence among other technologies to enhance their ability to better serve their clients. That said, there is no doubt that technology and data are already playing a more meaningful role in creating private banking products and servicing clients, which will cause many smaller players to look for mergers or partners as they run out of economies of scale.</p><p>Benjamin: The next phase of private banking business lies in the use of innovative technology to improve the client experience and give them the ability to have access to private banking services digitally.</p><p>Credit Suisse was the regional private banking industry's first mover in embracing digital innovation when it launched a global digital private banking platform for clients in Asia-Pacific in March 2015, with Singapore as the first global rollout location. We believe that our digital platform places us at the forefront of providing digital wealth management services to our current and next generation of clients, while creating a new multi-channel private banking service delivery model, combining digital technology and the bank's relationship management team.</p><p>Clients have round-the-clock access to comprehensive information about their accounts, market insights and intelligence personalised according to their portfolio, and are also able to use trading tools that allow them to respond to moving markets wherever they are and at any time.</p><p>It also facilitates multiple channels of connectivity and collaboration for clients with their relationship manager and Credit Suisse team, brings the relationship manager and bank significant gains in efficiency and higher value-added productivity, and most important of all, enables us to serve our clients better and cultivate deeper client relationships.</p><p>Today, our digital private banking platform has continued to gain client traction, with the number of users increasing by 15 times since the platform was launched in 2015.</p><p>On the topic of robo-advisory, our clients in Asia are largely high net worth and ultra high net worth individuals with complex financial needs. For example, they look at wealth planning across generations and often require integrated solutions that cover their corporate as well as personal wealth needs. These demands cannot (yet) be serviced solely by an automated platform. \"Robo-advisors\" today have two key limitations in servicing such private banking clients. Firstly, they apply algorithms to create mostly ETF-based portfolios. Secondly their reach and offering is primarily local, whereas private banking clients typically have global needs.</p><p>While the digital evolution in the private banking space is important to the success of our business in the future, relationship managers will continue to remain a core part of client relationships, having built these relationships on trust and highly personalised solutions.</p><p>* * *</p><p>What progress have you made in terms of advisory/discretionary services, and the ability to charge clients a fee for advice'</p><p>August: We are happy with our current mandate penetration; in the second quarter 2018, our mandate volume and penetration reached new record heights - in fact, globally, our mandate product business has grown by almost 100 billion Swiss francs in the last 12 months. But we know there is still scope to grow more without compromising on risk or suitability standards. The formation of GWM (Global Wealth Management) will allows us to better provide the best of what UBS has to offer to clients no matter where they are booked in the world. And we are working hard to provide our clients mandates that address their specific needs.</p><p>For example, earlier this year we launched the first ever 100 per cent sustainable investing mandate, which has over US$100 million in assets from APAC based clients and over US$2 billion globally.</p><p>Jyrki: Our discretionary offering in Asia has seen assets grow more than 1,000 per cent since its re- launch in 2010. In addition to offering existing global capabilities in equities, fixed income and fund of fund asset allocation programmes, since 2010 we have significantly increased the portfolio management team in Asia, and have introduced both Asia fixed income and Asia equity discretionary capabilities, both of which have proved enormously successful and have driven the exponential growth of discretionary assets in Asia.</p><p>We continue to expand the team meaningfully each year. Clients have responded extremely well to the mandates we can provide. Regular access to the portfolio managers in the same time zone is of particular importance to clients in Asia, and they also like the full transparency offered by the separately managed account model that our discretionary business uses. These mandates, with varying degrees of customisation to suit the specific needs of clients, happily co-exist alongside our clients' extensive holdings in third-party best-of-breed funds.</p><p>On the advisory front, our business continues to be extremely strong. About five years ago, we recognised the need for wrap fee advisory services alongside our traditional transaction fee based model, and we launched our service to cater for those clients who required this type of arrangement with a flat fee based on overall assets under management. This type of offering has been well entrenched for many years in markets such as Australia, Europe and the US, but was relatively untapped in Asia. Five years on, whilst we have seen some traction in this type of arrangement, the majority of the business remains on the traditional transaction fee model. There is no doubt that client appetite for wrap fee arrangements will grow in Asia from a low base over time. But ultimately, our business is built around clients' needs, and at this juncture, clients continue to prefer transaction fee arrangements.</p><p>Benjamin: At Credit Suisse, we have made significant progress in both our advisory and discretionary mandates solutions. It is our aim to make our clients better investors, and offering a fee-for-advice model increases alignment of interests between the bank and the client.</p><p>For discretionary mandates, our assets have grown by more than 30 per cent in the last two years, and there have been continuous product innovations to meet changing market conditions and client demands. Some of our newly launched discretionary mandate solutions include a structured note format mandate, a Singapore dollar reference currency mandate, a fixed income strategy mandate that works in a rising rate environment and a mandate that follows the ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) themes.</p><p>Credit Suisse Invest, launched mid-2017, is a human-led, digitally-enabled advisory solution, offering our clients access to retrocession-free share classes of funds, and is one of the key differentiators to help our clients improve performance.</p><p>Credit Suisse Invest enables investors to conveniently view the latest updates to their portfolio, as well as the actionable ideas relevant to their chosen strategy via the Credit Suisse Private Banking Asia Pacific app. Clients can also digitally access regular market updates and the monthly Portfolio Quality Reports which provide scenario analyses on how historical market events would affect their performance. This digital empowerment is further strengthened by client-initiated portfolio reviews, allowing relationship managers to take into consideration changes in the client's personal circumstances and adjust the investment strategy or rebalance the portfolio accordingly.</p><p>We have seen substantial client demand for Credit Suisse Invest, with volume growth as at end-July 2018 increasing year-on-year by over 400 per cent, and year-to-date it has more than doubled. This fee-for-advice model is highly successful as clients acknowledge the tangible benefits of a systematic investment process supported by the Credit Suisse house view and leveraging on technology and digitisation to enhance their investment experience.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-220480</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TCX-96S1-JCF2-800T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2806\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 2, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001X99</classCode><className>CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009QD3</classCode><className>UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS523120 SECURITIES BROKERAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS522210 CREDIT CARD ISSUING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS551111 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS524126 DIRECT PROPERTY &amp;

The European commission for competition has launched a formal investigation into the online behemoth, saying that it intends to take 'a very close look' at whether the company has been breaking antitrust regulations.The investigation will examine whether Amazon is using sales data to give it an unfair advantage over smaller retailers on the Amazon Marketplace platform that enables third parties to sell products alongside Amazon. 'We need to ensure that large online platforms don't eliminate [e-commerce] benefits through anti-competitive behaviours,' says competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager. 'I have therefore decided to take a very close look at Amazon's business practices and its dual role as marketplace and retailer, to assess its compliance with EU competition rules.'Vestager is looked upon by the White House as a leading Tech Major adversary as, under her antitrust watch, the EU has fined Google and Facebook, while forcing Apple to pay back $15.4bn in tax. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-BRDE1077051563527201981251762900067</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRDE-6558</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKW-VF91-F03R-N4G3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"185\"/><timeReceived>9:06 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Brand-e.biz</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 19, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Non-compliance could land you in jail for seven years. On the top of that would be a fine of up to Rs 100 crore. BJP MP Tarun Vijay, who has long been campaigning for such a law, said \"patriotic Indians\" should use the country's own 'Bhuvan' software application for maps.</p><p>\"Why do we need Google? We should stop becoming Google's instruments,\" he told ET. \"The patriotic government of Narendra Modi has taken a right step in a big relief to the security establishment. UPA did not take any action despite my pleas to the then Defence Minister AK Antony. I congratulate the Modi government for showing spine in face of arrogance of these IT giants,\" he said, adding: Google has been \"behaving as if it were above Indian law\".</p><p>A top government official involved in the move said maps of India's sensitive installations were available on Google Maps, increasing the security risk of those sites. Demand to mask those were never complied to. \"Pathankot air base, which was recently attacked, can be seen on Google Maps. Terrorists plot strikes on sensitive targets studying Google Maps,\" he told ET.</p><p>\"Our plea to black out sensitive installations do not yield results. This Bill is now sending a strong message that US companies cannot be running roughshod over Indian security interests.\" Companies such as Google, Microsoft and Apple, which have millions of Indians using their maps, would be hit directly by the legislation if it is pushed through. Firms that depend on these maps to provide their services, such as Uber, Zomato and Ola, too would be affected. Google, Apple and Microsoft didn't respond to emails seeking comment.</p><p>Mishi Choudhary, legal director at Software Freedom Law Centre, said almost all online businesses today depend on geo-location and provide maps for the use of their services, and that all of them will be forced to seek a licence under the proposed law. \"This kind of digital nationalism is a way to create a government-controlled monopoly on all geographical information about the country, conveniently transforming Digital India to Licence India, digitally this time,\" said Choudhary, who was part of the successful legal fight to scrap Section 66A of the IT Act to ensure freedom of expression on the Internet. An executive at one of the big tech companies said the draft Bill raised far too many questions.</p><p>\"On the face of it, the Bill will kill any and every use of the maps. It is also unclear if you get a licence for maps, only you can use it or others can use it, too,\" he said. \"Also, whether every time you update a map, does one have to get a security clearance? Maps have to be live and dynamic, so getting it approved from government each time may not be feasible.\"</p><p>Those working on mapping and geospatial technology said services such as Google Maps are popular because they are faster and easier to use compared to government-prescribed process. \"According to Indian law...if I have to buy certain data, I will have to go to the concerned department, like ISRO's National Remote Sensing Agency, or the Survey of India. In the case of NRSC (for satellite data), they will purchase the data for me, and then I will have to pay. That's a long process and hence people went to services like Google Maps, which are easier,\" said Devdatta Tengshe, a freelance geospatial information systems consultant.</p><p>The agency removes sensitive zones from the data and takes about two-three months or even more to respond, which is an unrealistic timeline for people working with digital data, he said. There is also apprehension that the Bill will undermine rescue and humanitarian efforts, such as during disasters like the Nepal earthquake.</p><p>\"It was user-generated geospatial data that was used by the humanitarian response teams. This situation of lack of openly usable geospatial data holds true for large parts of India, and especially Himalayan India,\" said Sumandro Chattapadhyay, research director at Centre for Internet and Society. Also of concern is the lack of court's jurisdiction in matters related to the proposed legislation, said SFLC's Choudhary.</p><p>A senior government official, however, said companies should not have a problem to come under regulations on security considerations and that the Bill was up for public comments where the companies can lodge their apprehensions. \"We are not banning anyone from mapping India - only that the mapping has to be in line with Indian security considerations regarding sensitive installations and correct boundaries being depicted like not showing PoK and Arunachal Pradesh as out of India,\" this official said.</p><p>A group of techies have, meanwhile, got together to create a website called savethemap.in, which aims to educate people and make them send out responses to the draft Bill. It will likely come up with a template response, along the lines as the savetheinternet. in campaign that was instrumental in taking the net neutrality debate to the people.</p><p>(Surabhi Agarwal contributed to this story)</p><p>For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTMS-52180349</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTMS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JR3-FCP1-DXJR-H2HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362627</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"962\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

The move is the latest salvo in a long-running cold war between two of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies, which have clashed over their approaches to user privacy as both face regulatory scrutiny over alleged anticompetitive behaviour.    Facebook said it requested the waiver so that small businesses would not have to pay Apple\u2019s cut for a new paid online events product the world\u2019s biggest social media company is launching on its core platform.   Apple takes a cut of between 15% and 30% for most app subscriptions and payments made inside apps, though there are some exceptions   Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    On Thursday, Apple removed popular videogame Fortnite from its app store for violating its in-app payment guidelines, sparking a backlash online and prompting developer Epic Games to file a federal antitrust lawsuit challenging Apple\u2019s rules.    Apple takes a cut of between 15% and 30% for most app subscriptions and payments made inside apps, though there are some exceptions for companies that already have a credit card on file for iPhone customers if they also offer an in-app payment that would benefit Apple.   Long criticised   Developers have long criticised the commissions, as well as Apple\u2019s prohibitions on courting customers for outside sign-ups, and what some developers see as an opaque and unpredictable app-vetting process.    A mock-up of the new events product on iPhone, provided by Facebook, showed that the company planned to tell users that Apple would take 30% of the purchase.    Google also typically takes a 30% commission for payments within apps on its Android devices, although it was not immediately clear whether it would assess a charge in this case. In its Android mock-up, Facebook noted only that it would not take a fee, without disclosing its arrangement with Google.    Google declined to comment on its fee arrangement for the product, and Facebook did not respond to the request for comment.    Facebook also did not say whether it had tried to make use of Apple\u2019s \u201cmulti-platform\u201d exceptions.    The disclosure is likely to touch a nerve with Apple, whose App Store rules bar developers from discouraging the use of its in-app purchase system. Spotify in the past has said Apple rejected its attempts to communicate with users about the fee structures.   Spotify in the past has said Apple rejected its attempts to communicate with users about the fee structures   Fidji Simo, who heads the core Facebook app, announced the tool in a media conference call featuring small business owners who praised it as a way to reach customers and earn revenue online during the coronavirus pandemic.    She said Facebook considered it \u201cimportant to be transparent, when people are supporting small businesses,\u201d as users might not be aware that part of their payments could be \u201cgoing to an almost US$2-trillion company\u201d.    Asked if she thought Apple would approve the change, even with language about fees that could discourage users from using the in-app purchase mechanism, she said she expected to find out \u201cin the next couple days\u201d.  \u2014 Reported by Katie Paul and Munsif Vengattil, with additional reporting by Stephen Nellis and Paresh Dave, (c) 2020 Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42855541160</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M4-Y0D1-JCSC-J546-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"618\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>TechCentral.co.za</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Whether the course of change is positive or negative depends on how quickly we apply our collective will. From fever tracking to contact tracing, crowdsourced science to online learning, we cannot rise to meet our current challenges without the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-uk-update-live-news-tips-cases-deaths-lockdown-latest-a9615311.html\">internet</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this crisis, we've seen an internet where humanity shines. It's also shined a light on the ways our system has tipped towards misinformation, consolidation of power, increased surveillance, and online scapegoating. Accountability is lacking, and the power of technology is too often aimed at manipulating people into actions that are profitable for a few but damaging to many. This cannot stand.</p><p>As someone who has taken a consumer-first approach from the internet's very beginning, I know how inertia can feel indomitable - until suddenly it isn't. People, technology, and willpower can change the world fast. So we must demand something better. Technologists have a role to play building products differently. Citizens also have a huge role to play by making their voices heard. It's the combination of creators and consumers that results in industry-wide change. We can start with these five core elements:</p><p>We need dependable security. Our personal information should be shielded from hackers, spies, and strangers, with web traffic flowing securely to and from our banks, doctor's offices, and businesses. Let's Encrypt, an alliance Mozilla helped found, now delivers greater security to over 85 per cent of web transactions - while adding the \"s\" in \"https://\" - proving that improved security is possible on a large scale.</p><p>We can go further and do better. Imagine for example video-conferencing sites with deeper security protections from interlopers.</p><p>                     To bring an end to this pandemic, we all may need to offer up some health data, but that should not provide license for unlimited access forever. Today big tech companies use data to target us with advertising, governments use it to surveil, and machine learning tools extract it by the terabyte - all with almost no oversight. New models of data ownership such as data trusts are already pointing the way. It's time to build a world where individuals are able to control our data, keeping it to ourselves when we want, donating it for the public good, or possibly trading it for benefits like lower prices.</p><p>A better internet will help protect people from misinformation by changing the incentives for content platforms and giving users more content choices. Platforms like Facebook and YouTube have now shown they can direct people to accurate information about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-uk-update-live-news-tips-cases-deaths-lockdown-latest-a9615311.html\">Covid-19</url>, and have taken steps to shift algorithms to quell misinformation from going viral. On a better internet, content platforms will take these efforts much further by developing more transparent AI practices and working alongside researchers and governments to prevent the spread of misinformation before it's too late.</p><p>In this crisis, we're seeing more online kindness while also noticing how people are still scapegoated and shamed in systematic ways. It's time to build products that reject the goals of using outrage to drive engagement. We're already seeing companies join forces to institute Codes of Conduct for events and online forums. On a better, more respectful internet, our social networks should have ethics standards and built-in tools to help identify and stop harassment and threats of violence.</p><p>We now see just how important it is for everyone to connect to the internet, yet infrastructure gaps persist worldwide. Billions of people lack access outright and many more struggle to afford even basic connection. Without high-speed access, school kids are being left behind, the ability to work remotely is removed, and participation in ever more aspects of social life vanish. Globally, and even in the United States, it's time to build an ecosystem of service providers which includes the big ISPs, municipal networks, community networks, and cooperatives. New regulatory, technical and financial models must be developed and implemented.</p><p>This is more than a utopian vision. In fact, change is not only possible but proven.</p><p>Fifteen years ago, the infant internet faced a similar crossroads. Should the way things work be mediated by a single company, Microsoft, with a monopoly on web browsers? Or should people have choices for how they get online and what happens once they're there?</p><p>At that critical juncture, Mozilla tapped into and helped grow the open-source movement as an alternative way of working. Emerging from that movement came not only the Firefox browser but a push towards open government, open data, the rise of the sharing economy and collaboration as a strategy for innovation. This kind of broad, positive impact can happen again.</p><p>In this Covid-shaken world, I'm seeing signs that technologists, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and innovators of all kinds are eager to rally to build the next generation of products and services for a safer, more humane online life. </p><p>Harvard president explains move to online learning</p><p>My organisation, Mozilla, is completely committed to this goal, and we're looking for new ways to join with others to build a better internet. Our inaugural programme enlisted more than a hundred projects this spring, for example, and this summer our Mozilla Builders Incubator will provide technological, financial, and business support to dozens of start-up teams from around the world.</p><p>This is a beginning and we must go even farther. Improving online life will be a joint effort of many different groups. Mozilla is committed to doing all we can to work with creators, entrepreneurs and tech companies who want to build products and consumer experiences that elevate the best of human nature, rather than manipulate our animal brains with fear and outrage.</p><p>We will work with governments to help them recogise their role in shaping the networks that connect the world. We hope to be overwhelmed by the community of people choosing this path, and to become one of many centres of excellence in building a better internet. In any case, we'll be investing our people, our time, and our finances towards this cause to fire up the internet we all deserve.</p><p>Long ago we voiced the expectation that one day online life would become indivisible from real life. The Covid-19 crisis has shown that day is here. Now we have the chance to improve not only the time we spend online in the future, but life itself.</p><p>                     Mitchell Baker is the CEO and chairwoman of Mozilla Foundation</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-64398755</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BP-2KS1-F021-63HT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1107\"/><timeReceived>3:52 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 13, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Google claims to generate billions of leads to news sites, raising the question of why so many are going bust. Facebook is the company that bans news outlets or, in Facebook-speak, imposes \"algorithmic penalties\" because of arbitrary breaches of its morality code. Yet the very next month it live-streams mass murder.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Neither pays for the journalism that has helped make them rich. Not even as they put the torch to the business model - advertising - that has sustained journalism for centuries.</p><p>As Big Tech's unfettered power grows in the 21st century, the imbalance in bargaining power with news media is widening.</p><p>The pending closure of AAP, Australia's 85-year-old news wire, and the demise of revered US news publisher McClatchy are yet further demonstrations of the harm done to news media around the world. Now, in the era of COVID-19, the metaphoric viral threat Big Tech poses has become biological reality.</p><p>The Sunraysia Daily in Mildura, which has served its community for 100 years, was the first to succumb. Others, in Victoria's Gippsland, an area still reeling from summer's devastating bushfires and in more need of local media than ever, have followed. They won't be the last. Countless communities will be bereft of news and information they can trust. The stories that matter most to them will not be told. This is not only a bad outcome for the business of news media but also for society at large.</p><p>It is axiomatic that the news media's role as watchdog is an essential ingredient in any democracy. Regulators are recognising it, in the same way they recognised that the growth of cars meant traffic lights and seatbelts were necessary to protect the population. In the same way they recognised the cost of competition on the consumer from the likes of Standard Oil and the Bell System of companies. The Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission is hitting back at the digital platforms. So too are regulators across the US and Europe.</p><p>The urgency is unequivocal. With the COVID-19 pandemic changing the lives of every man, woman and child on the planet, never has the news media had a more purposeful role. And yet never has its existence been more precarious. The fallout of a corona-induced economic collapse is beyond considerable and will extend and expand the news drought that has already struck communities in the US and throughout the world. As we know already, Australia won't be immune.</p><p>Yet despite the egregiousness of the digital duopoly and the catastrophe of the coronavirus, news media is not broken. In fact, our audiences have never been so large. The fact is we're a resolute and resilient lot, intent on finding new ways to fund journalism.</p><p>Turning back to Big Tech, it turns out fake news on social media and search engines has been a friend to real news. It has helped give trustworthy news a competitive advantage. Unsurprising, really, when you consider that media is accountable to regulators, to advertisers and, most important, to its communities.</p><p>Building on trust, the art of journalism is now enabled by data science. Data has enabled editors and journalists to better understand what audiences truly value. News instincts and data science have combined to reveal what stories to cover, how to cover them, when to run them and how to market them. Local is the hero, and has helped a resurgence in local digital community news. Local is lucrative because the content is scarce, valuable and trusted. And so long as it is paid for, it is profitable. Since September 2018, News Corp Australia has launched 16 new digital-only community mastheads in areas where we never had a print presence. At the same time, we have converted many print titles to digital-only titles. More will follow. It reflects changing audience demographics and how news and information are consumed.</p><p>This means local journalism can help underpin new growth and a firm financial future. That's because it drives subscriptions - the funding model that publishers the world over are looking to as the replacement for advertising. This is a model that works if facilitated, not frustrated, by the likes of Facebook and Google. Yet the collapse of advertising revenue means local newspapers, the traditional delivery mechanism for local news, are in grave peril. This, at the very moment our thirst for local news grows. The news media industry is in a race against time. COVID-19 will hasten the reshaping of news media that began with Big Tech.</p><p>Now is the time for governments and regulators to act. If Big Tech can be tamed, the sustainability of journalism in our communities might be assured again. But, for many, time has run out for plan B. And if there's no media to challenge Big Tech's falsities, who will benefit from its triumph?Damian Eales is president of the International News Media Association and chief operating officer of publishing for News Corp Australia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-dc445538724811ea9c99a40f1bb776a49bce8392713e14ace489fa1450732825</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJ9-8501-JD3N-518C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"843\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 31, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There's a yoga channel for \u00a36.99 a month. If repeats of \"classic\" America's Cup yacht races are more your thing, Amazon can offer the Nautical Channel. And if you're a fan of speedway and fencing, why not give Eurosport a whirl? If nothing else, it's a handy cure for chronic insomnia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's fair to say that Amazon's latest foray into television won't be keep many British broadcasting execs awake at night. But perhaps it should. Amazon's move could be a harbinger of something destructive to come.</p><p>Silicon Valley has already grabbed large chunks of the advertising income that once sustained print media. Now America's big tech companies are turning their gaze towards the small screen.</p><p>Live television, particularly sport, has become the new crucible in the battle for eyeballs. Two recent deals in the US make this shift abundantly clear. Facebook signed an agreement to air 20 live baseball games a season on its video platform. Amazon, meanwhile, has bought up the rights to stream American football over the internet.</p><p>It is increasingly clear that the giants of Silicon Valley are becoming broadcasters. That's certainly how the European Commission sees it; Brussels is planning curbs on social media. Here in Britain, the government blusters about big tech, but to little effect.</p><p>All the while, the playing field tilts further away from homegrown broadcasters. The Valley enjoys huge advantages that extend far beyond its financial might.</p><p>ITV and Channel 4 operate under very tight regulations, and the cost of infringement is high.

Yet such repugnant material was widely available on Facebook in the wake of last week's atrocity in Manchester.</p><p>The Conservatives have made vague promises to rein in social media. In their election manifesto, they said the rules covering the digital sphere should \"reflect those that govern our lives offline\".</p><p>But <person><nameText>Theresa May </nameText></person>should go much, much further. Facebook, YouTube and Amazon already publish and broadcast vast amounts of content, and should be regulated accordingly.</p><p>The prime minister should be taking inspiration from Brussels' plan to curb social media's excesses.</p><p>The commission is working on an extensive overhaul of broadcast regulation. It wants to bring any service with video at its core under the auspices of the media services directive. In other words, a video clip viewed on a smartphone screen would be subject to the same rules as a traditional broadcaster.</p><p>That would leave YouTube and Facebook facing heavy sanctions if they failed to act quickly to remove extremist content from their platforms. Germany is already threatening to fine social media companies \u00a340m if they break the rules. About time too.</p><p>Britain would, of course, be obliged to implement the new regulations as long as it remains an EU member.

Even Apple Inc. came under fire, with one U.K. lawmaker questioning whether the iPhone maker should allow the Facebook app onto its phones.</p><p>\"Now, Facebook has done your industry a lot of damage. Why do you continue to do business with them?\" U.K. Labour MP Ian Lucas asked a representative from Apple.</p><p>\"you present yourself as the good guys, but you're facilitating the bad guys through the use of your hardware.\"</p><p>The committee was assembled with politicians from a dozen countries Canada, the U.K., Germany, Morocco, Mexico and Singapore.</p><p>It had hoped to hear from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg, and when the two executives failed to show up Tuesday, MPs issued an open summons to parliament, which will be served if either of them sets foot in Canada in the future.</p><p>Across several days politicians heard about the dangers of machine intelligence, the use of social media by dictators to intimidate dissent, data privacy, data harvesting, and a raft of other policy issues.</p><p>On Tuesday lower-ranked Facebook officials endured a barrage of aggressive questions and browbeating from politicians collectively incensed by the drumbeat of privacy scandals swirling around the social media giant.</p><p>Wednesday was less intense, but the politicians'anger at big tech was still very much on display.</p><p>Mark royland, an information security executive at Amazon Web Service, was repeatedly asked questions he couldn't answer.</p><p>\"If I connect my Amazon account to Facebook, what information and I sharing between the two platforms?\" U.K. Conservative MP damian Collins asked.</p><p>\"I'm not aware of any way you do connect Facebook to Amazon,\" royland answered.</p><p>\"So you're saying you can't do it? you can't connect your Facebook and Amazon accounts?\" Collins followed up.</p><p>\"As far as I know, that's true. I'll follow up to make sure that's true,\" royland repeated.</p><p>Three minutes later, Collins was following to point out that royland was wrong, citing Amazon's website.</p><p>\"It says, 'How do I connect my Facebook account to Amazon?'This is from Amazon.com,\" Collins said.</p><p>\"So I'll just ask again, if you do that, what sort of data are you sharing between the two platforms?\" royland said he didn't know.</p><p>Geist said that even if the committee meeting was heavy on political grandstanding, the international co-operation could lead to numerous countries - Canada included - experimenting with different tactics for regulating the big tech companies, and then sharing what works best.</p><p>That was an idea echoed by Aaron Shul, managing director and general counsel for the Centre for International Governance Innovation. Shul noted that all three parties were largely aligned on the need to regulate companies like Google and Facebook.</p><p>\"What we're talking about is regulating a segment of our economy and doing it in a way that keeps the best interests of Canadians in mind,\" Shul said.</p><p>\"I also think that it'll make Canada regulate or govern this space in a really sound way, because it'll be driven by policy and not politics.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

The thoughts expressed are those of the author.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. In the time since Amazon founder and CEO went from being another Silicon Valley executive to the richest man in the world we have rarely seen him worried. This is a man who dared the tabloids to taunt him[2]. This is a man who employs a personal detective named Gavin de Bekker[3].But on Wednesday we saw his worried face.We saw it while Bezos testified before a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee \u2014 a committee within a committee \u2014 focused on antitrust enforcement. He \u2014 along with the Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple CEO Tim Cook \u2014 were all called to answer questions[4] related to their power. </p><p>These are the men who control how things get to you on the internet \u2014 your apps, your messages, your ads, your news, your answers to questions, and just about anything you could buy.For the last year this subcommittee has been investigating whether or not that dominance over distribution has led to America's decades-low small business creation[5] \u2014 whether Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon use their power to destroy would-be competitors.Given the historic nature and intense media focus on the meeting, the lawmakers' primary mission was to articulate its findings on the vast power these companies wieldin ways that Americans can understand.And Bezos showed us his worried face because \u2014 histrionics from a few members aside \u2014 the members of the committee did just that.\"[The committee] showed that these companies are gatekeepers that they engage in anti-competitive practices and that their dominance is about monopoly power, not innovation,\" said Matt Stoller, an antitrust researcher and author of Goliath: Hundred Year War between Monopoly Power and Democracy[6].It was the first time men like Bezos, \"masters of the universe\" as Stoller put it, have had to answer questions from informed, powerful people. And under pressure, they admitted to a lot of the toxic behavior their critics have been accusing them of for years. When you rule the roads For the most part, when Silicon Valley has gone to Washington it's been an embarrassment for our politicians[7]. Geriatric Senators ask basic questions about technology[8] and the CEOs in the hot seat restrain themselves using their best media training and paternalistic question answering.There was some of that at Wednesday's hearing, mostly from Ranking Member F. James Sensenbrenner, a Republican from Wisconsin. There was also some grandstanding about conservatives[9] being silenced on Facebook (they are not[10]) and Google (still not[11]). But that was a minority of the minority.For the most part, members from both parties asked thoughtful, well-researched questions. And it seems the CEOs were not prepared for that. As Stoller noted, they had to admit a myriad of shady business tactics. Members of both parties hammered Facebook for its strategy of buying, copying or threatening competitors out of business, reading damning internal emails[12] from the company's acquisition of Instagram.Bezos was tongue tied when asked why Amazon makes money from counterfeit goods, nor could he answer any questions about Amazon's protocol for ensuring that it's not selling stolen goods.Bezos squirmed through questions from Representative Pramila Jayapal about how Amazon misuses third-party seller data to develop in-house brands that compete with merchants selling on his platform saying only, \"I can't answer that question yes or no.\"Subcommittee Chair David Cicilline brought up that, outside Amazon these third-party sellers are called \"partners.\" Inside Amazon they're called \"internal competitors.\"Much in the same way, Zuckerberg sweat through questions about its history of spying on competitors.Zuckerberg could not explain away the fact that his company profits from peddling misinformation. Cicilline brought up that, despite committing to only distributing accurate information about the coronavirus, it took Facebook five hours and 20 million views[13] before it took down a video full of false claims about the pandemic. Amplifying that misinformation once its on the platform, Cicilline said is a \"business decision.\"Democratic Rep. Congressman Joe Neguse of Colorado pressed the CEOs of Apple and Google, both of which control app stores, to promise they would not use the information they collect from apps in their stores to build competitors.Democratic Rep. Val Demmings of Florida pressed Pichai about the way Google surveils its customers, bundling data from across all of its products (Gmail, maps, etc.) in order to sell them targeted ads The CEOs were media trained. They knew to try to give long answers to run out the clock. They knew how to evade. And they knew how to give non-answers. Bezos, at one point, uttered the words \"I do not understand\" and I could not help but find the irony in that. Antitrust is complex. The way these companies build moats around themselves is so brilliant, and sometimes ruthless, that it's hard to believe Bezos could get lost following anything. But in this hearing all four CEOs looked lost.Perhaps the most gut-wrenching moment of the hearing was when Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia played a recording of a small textbook seller who was crushed by Amazon when their business got big enough to compete with Bezos'.\"We were never given a reason. Amazon never even provided us with notice of why we were being restricted. There was no warning, there was no plan.\" And confronted with the recording Bezos had no words of explanation.Play Video[14]Why we are here Now you may be saying to yourself: \"But Linette, if we don't have these big companies, how will we compete with big companies from China and elsewhere?\"And I tell you that we cannot compete against anyone unless we are competing against ourselves, here in the US. What these companies do when they crush their competitors \u2014 undercutting them[15], or copying them, or burying their technology after an acquisition \u2014 entrenches these companies. And the more entrenched they are, the less innovative they have to be.Perhaps, for example, if there were competitor to Facebook with a newsfeed that didn't peddle lies and outrages we might be able to choose to go to that competitor, but we can't Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp. Zuckerberg called that a \"digital land grab.\"The US economy is not intended to be a land grab for the rich and powerful. It is intended to be an equal playing field, where people with talent and dedication can innovate their way to success. Even more critical than that, our country is contending with the kind of power these companies can wield. When our antitrust laws were written back in the 1890s, and reviewed again in the 1930s, our leaders understood that once companies became huge they can capture politics and run this nation.\"We must not tolerate oppressive government or industrial oligarchy in the form of monopolies and cartels,\" Henry Wallace, Vice President to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, wrote in a 1944 essay on the dangers of fascism.\"As long as scientific research and inventive ingenuity outran our ability to devise social mechanisms to raise the living standards of the people, we may expect the liberal potential of the United States to increase. If this liberal potential is properly channeled, we may expect the area of freedom of the United States to increase.\"There is a sense in this country that liberty is decreasing, that power is in the hands of a few and that their voices matter more than those of the many. Even Congressman Sensenbrenner, the Ranking Member who seemed confused for a significant portion of the hearing, called on the government to review the mergers that made these companies so dominant. He said that everyone makes mistakes, and regulators likely made them there. Expect the report this subcommittee released on its findings to contain damning emails and other information about how these powerful people have hoarded power and used it to make it virtually impossible for anyone else to compete.It's time the American people understand why their sense that something is very wrong is valid, and where it's coming from, so we can change it.

The social network has failed again and again at expanding beyond a handful of core features. Doubts of its usefulness, and assertions of its uselessness, are multiplying. A crisis of confidence at multiple levels threatens the company\u2019s structure and mission. Now is the time for <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to spare himself the infamy and resign \u2014 for Facebook\u2019s sake and his own. </p><p>I\u2019m not calling for his resignation, and I don\u2019t say this out of any animus toward <person><nameText>Zuckerberg; </nameText></person>I personally believe him to be genuine and driven in his stated desire to connect the world \u2014 but likely increasingly frustrated by the unexpected consequences of this naive ambition and the haste with which he has pursued it. I just think that it has come to the point where the best way for him to advance that ambition is to leave. There are three major reasons why. Facebookhas failed Of course, it\u2019s also true that Facebookhas succeeded beyond every expectation. But its success arrived early and remains essentially a simple thing: being a broadly accessible, functioning social network. A single network of friends, a basic news feed from them and a few adjunct capabilities were industry-defining ideas and to a certain point were executed quite well. Beyond that admittedly towering success, Facebookhas accomplished remarkably little. Attempts to make Facebooka ubiquitous social graph layer connecting all apps and services failed because consumers found it creepy, companies found it threatening to rely completely on the company for demographic data and tech was moving too quickly for the data Facebookhad to be universally applicable. (Except, of course, in advertising, where it is evergreen.) Attempts to make Facebooka gaming platform failed partly because the social aspect of gaming is radioactive, and partly because the attention economy produces really bad games. Repurposing an established community into a gaming one was a non-starter, and what\u2019s left of the brief Facebookgaming flash in the pan is just an oily residue clinging to the side of the news feed. Attempts to make Facebooka VR/AR powerhouse are ongoing, but that entire segment of tech has proven incredibly disappointing and eye-wateringly expensive for everyone involved. So far they\u2019re a market leader in a market that seems to only exist for the purpose of swindling money out of investors. It\u2019s too early to call it a complete boondoggle with certainty since Facebookis supposedly playing a longer game here, but it sure isn\u2019t promising. Attempts to improve messaging beyond the basics have failed; chatbots are of poor quality and largely pointless, in-chat games are novelties at best, business applications are politely declined and while aesthetic changes like stickers could make a little money in the short term, that\u2019s not really the kind of thing that supports a global infrastructure. Attempts to make Facebooka reliable news source ran into the many-headed hydra that is \u201cobjectivity\u201d and everything that comes with it. Boy, they didn\u2019t think that through. I\u2019m not even going to get started on the ways it\u2019s failed here. Attempts to make Facebookan infrastructure provider have arguably so far failed as either abortive or fanciful. Free basics failed despite good intentions because the company has not earned the trust to be in that position. The laser-based Aquila internet glider is a wonderful science project but strikes me as something of a Spruce Goose situation: Underserved communities would be served better by, off the top of my head, grants offsetting large broadband providers\u2019 advantages in infrastructure contracts, or just paying for laying fiber or building towers. (Later efforts at Internet.org have been more limited and practical and I applaud them.) Attempts to make Facebooka media company failed (or are stumbling) for a multiplicity of reasons: strong and agile competitors, a lack of focus, too many ads, incompatibility with the like economy. Attempts to branch out on mobile have failed, though none very spectacularly \u2014 which is almost a failure in itself. The main app is of course fabulously popular, as is Instagram. Only by paying a billion dollars and literally subtracting a fundamental feature from the original app were they able to increase the number of icons on most phones. Attempts to make Facebookcool have failed almost from the beginning. I hesitate to go so far as to define coolness, but I will say that it\u2019s generally thought to be incompatible with ubiquity. They bought some cool with Instagram, but the shine is starting to wear off that one. This litany of failures (by no means comprehensive, and of course there have been minor successes, too) is also conspicuously a list of things <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has personally set his sights on. Over and over he has said, \u201cthis is what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d And then they don\u2019t do it \u2014 not really. A cash infusion and a bit of borrowed momentum from the ongoing original success of the basic social network, and each effort begins with a semblance of self-propulsion. But all of them have lost steam as Facebookfailed to follow through, mindlessly followed through on the wrong thing or just moved on to the next target. As founder and CEO, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>should by all means take substantial credit for the initial success of the platform. But he also has to take responsibility for the laundry list of botched attempts to do much more than provide the basic service people valued since the earliest days. By no means is he alone in this type of failure, by the way: All the tech giants have products and phases they\u2019d rather not speak of or, though they might refuse to acknowledge it, have been crushing defeats. But <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is on his own in the level of personal ownership he has tried to exert over these numerous misadventures. Facebookis not about connecting the world It\u2019s become clear over the years that Facebookleft its original mission statement behind a long, long time ago. Fifteen years back, perhaps even 10 or 5, Facebookwas just what we needed. But the world has changed, the way we interact with technology and each other has changed and Facebookhasn\u2019t. The platform\u2019s greatest failure isn\u2019t any of those side projects listed above; it\u2019s the failure to evolve its core product to succeed by its own metrics of quality time and meaningful connection. Facebookstarted as a rough approximation of sharing your life with a group of friends. But as its scope has increased, this approximation has been found to be increasingly inadequate. What\u2019s also become clear is that Facebookhas been working hard to redefine how people interact online to fit better with its own limited capabilities. Faced with the square peg of human interactions and the round hole (the image of a pit is inescapable) of Facebook\u2019s news feed and algorithms, they decided it was the former that needed modification. The root of that is simple: Fitting Facebookto the people\u2019s needs is not as lucrative as vice versa. Facebookruns on ads, and ads run on eyeballs. That\u2019s the business model that has dominated the last decade or so \u2014 well, the last couple of centuries really, but in its current form, 10-15 years. Facebookhas been one of the most successful practitioners of it because, as they never tire of telling their customers (that is to say, advertisers), they know things about us that others don\u2019t. Important things. This is, as I mentioned earlier, the one place where its troves of seemingly trivial data add up. Facebookis not a platform for connecting people, it\u2019s a platform for monetizing the connections they make on their own. The company simply doesn\u2019t prioritize the quality of these connections themselves in any meaningful way \u2014 nor, I think, can it. That\u2019s probably a realization they reached early on. These flailing attempts to grow appendages were always just ways to multiply the number of superficial connections and train users to conflate constant, convenient updates with meaningful interactions. The parallel track to this is on the sales and advertising side, where Facebookhas repeatedly been cavalier with the data it has been entrusted with and selectively honest with the users from which it was sourced. People have stopped trusting it, if they ever really did. No one believes its executives when they say things about quality time, and respecting your data and so on. Some of them may be sincere \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t matter. The work that needs to be done to connect the world can\u2019t be done by an entity as compromised as Facebook; it\u2019s just the wrong tool for the job. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>\u2019s mission to connect the world isn\u2019t happening the way he planned and it isn\u2019t going to happen. Ironically, it was the success of his own vision that demonstrated the limits of that vision. The time is right for him and for the company Facebookhas grown big enough that it was never going to be free from controversy. But for the last few years there seems to have been a constant hum of disappointment from practically every quarter, every demographic, every customer, every country and regulator. During the tumultuous last year, the fundamental idea of advertising on Facebookbased on hidden character traits has been shown to be an insidious, easily abused practice. It responded much as its big tech colleagues have: affect shock, assure users this was never intended and promise action. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>who is politically active and of course deeply involved in all the operations at Facebook, has been almost completely silent. He has occasionally addressed such controversies. But more often than not he has offered little more than lip service, lines so tired \u2014 \u201cat Facebookwe take this very seriously,\u201d for instance \u2014 that they\u2019ve become parody. As I was writing, in fact, he did exactly this. \u201cI\u2019m serious about doing what it takes to protect our community\u201d were his exact words. But not just those words! \u201cI started Facebook, and at the end of the day I\u2019m responsible for what happens on our platform,\u201d he wrote. The exact form this responsibility takes is not specified. But the best thing for him to do would be resign. I don\u2019t mean instantly \u2014 that would be chaos. But soon. Think about it: it\u2019s really the best thing for everyone. For Facebook, it\u2019s a get-out-of-jail-free card. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>can easily take a lot of the heat being pointed at the company right now, since as he says he is responsible for what happened. He can shield loyal employees and executives who really were likely doing his bidding. He could do a junket of Congress, the FTC, a few courts and so on to express his personal responsibility for the actions and to beg people to understand that Facebookshould not be held to be synonymous with his mistakes of many years. Meanwhile at the company there would be carte blanche for reinvention, reversing years-old policies, admitting faults. For users, it\u2019s a nice clean break and a new hope for the platform. For a long time people have rolled their eyes at the promises of change, and seen mainly aimless algorithm tweaks and failed attempts to imitate competitors. The election debacle and this ongoing Cambridge Analytica situation are just the latest problem to appear; user faith is long since eroded, and many more would leave if not for some strong network effects binding them to the platform. For <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>the avatar and origin of all of Facebook\u2019s many mistakes (and of course successes) to personally step aside is meaningful change, and may lead to meaningful change at the platform level. At the very least even skeptical users like myself would be curious to see how it all plays out. For <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>this could be the best thing that ever happened to him. The optics are great \u2014 brave and idealistic young CEO sacrifices himself so that the company can live on. And it\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t have another life waiting for him. How does retiring in your early 30s with billions in the bank, spending a year or two with your wife and young daughter, then reemerging to dedicate yourself full-time to your philanthropic causes sound? The Chan-<person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>Initiative and Internet.org could help more people in more meaningful ways than Facebookever could. It might even be time to grow a nice beard. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really going to do it, of course (resign, that is \u2014 he may still grow a beard). At the risk of sounding like an armchair psychiatrist, his ego identifies too strongly with Facebook. Separating himself from it would be traumatic, perhaps impossible. Furthermore, my pessimistic view of Facebook\u2019s works would be more than balanced by his own optimistic view. If he read this I doubt he would agree with much I\u2019ve written. All the same, I don\u2019t think he will ever have a better chance to leave than this, and he may in the near future wish he had bowed out around now. Free of <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>Facebookmight blossom anew or it might wither; but most damningly of all, its users probably won\u2019t care either way. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN686968020180322</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXP-NPH1-J9XT-P2BH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2182\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 22, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The social network has failed again and again at expanding beyond a handful of core features. Doubts of its usefulness, and assertions of its uselessness, are multiplying. A crisis of confidence at multiple levels threatens the company's structure and mission. Now is the time for Mark Zuckerberg to spare himself the infamy and resign - for Facebook's sake and his own.</p><p><br/> I'm not calling for his resignation, and I don't say this out of any animus toward Zuckerberg; I personally believe him to be genuine and driven in his stated desire to connect the world - but likely increasingly frustrated by the unexpected consequences of this naive ambition and the haste with which he has pursued it. I just think that it has come to the point where the best way for him to advance that ambition is to leave.<br/> There are three major reasons why.<br/> Facebook has failed<br/> Of course, it's also true that Facebook has succeeded beyond every expectation. But its success arrived early and remains essentially a simple thing: being a broadly accessible, functioning social network. A single network of friends, a basic news feed from them and a few adjunct capabilities were industry-defining ideas and to a certain point were executed quite well. Beyond that admittedly towering success, Facebook has accomplished remarkably little.<br/> Attempts to make Facebook a ubiquitous social graph layer connecting all apps and services failed because consumers found it creepy, companies found it threatening to rely completely on the company for demographic data and tech was moving too quickly for the data Facebook had to be universally applicable.

As I was writing, in fact, he did exactly this. \"I'm serious about doing what it takes to protect our community\" were his exact words.<br/> But not just those words!<br/> \"I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform,\" he wrote.<br/> The exact form this responsibility takes is not specified. But the best thing for him to do would be resign.<br/> I don't mean instantly - that would be chaos. But soon. Think about it: it's really the best thing for everyone.<br/> For Facebook, it's a get-out-of-jail-free card. Zuckerberg can easily take a lot of the heat being pointed at the company right now, since as he says he is responsible for what happened. He can shield loyal employees and executives who really were likely doing his bidding. He could do a junket of Congress, the FTC, a few courts and so on to express his personal responsibility for the actions and to beg people to understand that Facebook should not be held to be synonymous with his mistakes of many years. Meanwhile at the company there would be carte blanche for reinvention, reversing years-old policies, admitting faults.<br/> For users, it's a nice clean break and a new hope for the platform. For a long time people have rolled their eyes at the promises of change, and seen mainly aimless algorithm tweaks and failed attempts to imitate competitors. The election debacle and this ongoing Cambridge Analytica situation are just the latest problem to appear; user faith is long since eroded, and many more would leave if not for some strong network effects binding them to the platform. For Zuckerberg, the avatar and origin of all of Facebook's many mistakes (and of course successes) to personally step aside is meaningful change, and may lead to meaningful change at the platform level. At the very least even skeptical users like myself would be curious to see how it all plays out.<br/> For Zuckerberg, this could be the best thing that ever happened to him. The optics are great - brave and idealistic young CEO sacrifices himself so that the company can live on. And it's not like he doesn't have another life waiting for him. How does retiring in your early 30s with billions in the bank, spending a year or two with your wife and young daughter, then reemerging to dedicate yourself full-time to your philanthropic causes sound? The Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative and Internet.org could help more people in more meaningful ways than Facebook ever could. It might even be time to grow a nice beard.<br/> I don't think he's really going to do it, of course (resign, that is - he may still grow a beard). At the risk of sounding like an armchair psychiatrist, his ego identifies too strongly with Facebook. Separating himself from it would be traumatic, perhaps impossible. Furthermore, my pessimistic view of Facebook's works would be more than balanced by his own optimistic view. If he read this I doubt he would agree with much I've written.<br/> All the same, I don't think he will ever have a better chance to leave than this, and he may in the near future wish he had bowed out around now. Free of Zuckerberg, Facebook might blossom anew or it might wither; but most damningly of all, its users probably won't care either way.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10433461</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXW-J6B1-DYDW-72P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2175\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 22, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp; Internet Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Social Networking Sites</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkJEOEE3NERCMEE5NDAyRTgzQ0QzNTc3MkM3NzI0MUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0U2OEYyMDlBMThBNDQxRjg4NkFGM0I4REVDODE1QTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJLY</classCode><className>SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001929</classCode><className>COMPANY STRUCTURES &amp; OWNERSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001480</classCode><className>RESIGNATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DL58</classCode><className>CHATBOTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST00096VM</classCode><className>DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DL58</classCode><className>CHATBOTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>PE000C5PB</classCode><className>MARK ZUCKERBERG</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GX142</classCode><className>NEW DELHI, INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

So...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 All right. NPR is partnering with GPB and WABE for our latest live show. And we want to say a huge thanks to them for supporting us.             </p><p>                            (CHEERING)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 A huge thanks to all of you for supporting them. For a long while there, it seemed like, every week, we were talking about a very long list of names of people who had jumped into the race for president. And by our count it is now up to 14 people who are running for president. But this week was notable because of all the people who announced they were not going to run. And I am now going to try to list them. And we'll see if I can make it. Michael Bloomberg, <person><nameText>Sherrod Brown, </nameText></person>Eric Holder, Jeff Merkley and <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>for, like, the 150th time.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Are you sure?             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Yeah. Isn't she's still kind of, like, well, I said no, but maybe not no?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 So I interviewed her about her book.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 In the woods.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 In the woods. Walking in the woods. I looked her in the eyes. She said she wasn't running for president. I believed her then.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Seems like you were right to.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Perhaps I was. But so, Scott, you are intensely following all of these candidates. I don't know how you keep up with it all. Was there anything about this week's announcements that surprised you?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I mean, that Jeff Merkley announcement just blew my mind.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Everyone was waiting for that.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 He's the senator from Oregon?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 No offense to Jeff Merkley, who's a very serious senator. But that's just how - like, this is how intense it's gotten - that when you are a senator who says you're not running for president, you announce it. You put a four-minute video out to say it.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And it's like, OK.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Do you think they put the video out, and they were like, no, forget it?             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I was honestly surprised by <person><nameText>Sherrod Brown's </nameText></person>decision that he is not running. He had been doing a lot of campaigning. He seemed to really enjoy being on the campaign trail. His wife, Connie Schultz, Pulitzer Prize winner and really cool all around political spouse was with him. She also seemed to enjoy the process. I mean, you either embrace it or shrink from it. And he seemed to embrace campaigning in Iowa, New Hampshire and focusing on this message of the dignity of work. The fact that he's a Democrat who can win statewide in Ohio seemed to give him some appeal. So it was surprising to me that he decided not to run.             </p><p>                I do think, however, that - Cory Booker said a couple weeks ago that he just thinks going forward he doesn't ever see a scenario where the Democratic ticket isn't balanced by race and gender. You know, the era of two white dudes on the Democratic side he thinks to be over. And I think that <person><nameText>Sherrod Brown, </nameText></person>especially if somebody like Kamala Harris was the nominee - I feel like every Democrat you talk to says <person><nameText>Sherrod Brown </nameText></person>would be the perfect vice presidential pick over and over and over again. So maybe the calculation is, hey, if I'm in the competition already, why campaign and raise money for a year? Just live my life for a year, then get back in the picture. I mean, I'm not sure. But that was surprising for me that that Brown decided not to do it.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 But and is it a risk, though, with him? Like you said, in Ohio, this clear - a state that is always fought over. If he did run or - and didn't end up winning or if he won as vice president, you might not have a Democrat take that seat. Like, is that a risk to that?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I mean, that's part of it.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Is it more important for him to be in the Senate?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 You can make the - I mean you can look at the fact that best-case scenario for Democrats, if they run the table in the Senate race, they have a majority of, like, one or two seats at most. If he were to leave the Senate in one way or another for a new job, a Republican governor appoints a Republican. And that Democratic majority might be gone. So...             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Well, Scott and I did a story a little while ago - a couple months ago, actually - feels like two years ago, but I think that was actually...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Seventeen years ago.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 It was, like, in January, right?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Time.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 On how running for president is just such a grind. And it is really complicated. And it just takes so much out of you and so much out of your family in particular. And every indiscretion you've ever had - and everyone's got some - would be exposed in a presidential run. And for a lot of people, that's prohibitive. And that's why I actually thought the Brown situation was interesting because his wife seemed like she was really into the campaign. And I thought that's, like, a big sign for him to be able to cross that threshold psychologically. The thing that stood out to me this week about people not running is what that might mean for people who still haven't announced that they've run. And in particular, I'm talking about Joe Biden, right?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Right.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 He's still the sort of donkey in the room?             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Got to do one of those, right?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Joke number one of the night.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah, I guess.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I think someone just booed you.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Think it might've been me.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Yeah. Anyway, so, you know, he's somebody who, when you still look at all the polling, is the person who - everyone recognizes that name. And there's a reason for it. I mean, he's, you know, the only person in the field who was on the last two winning Democratic tickets. And that's a big deal. And there's a big slice of the Democratic Party that would like to restore some order to a Democratic order that they see as having gone off the rails. And the safest way to do that is with somebody who's already done it and has lots of experience. Of course, there's lots of downsides or potential vulnerabilities he has. But I do wonder what this week meant and if he's out there making calls to folks. And, you know, I mean, we're still waiting on, for example, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and if he'll get in. He has lots of ties to Clinton world and to Biden world. And I know that one of the considerations for him is whether Biden will get in or not. So we're still waiting on Joe Biden. We're also waiting on someone else.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Who starts with a B. And I will preface this by saying I am from - I'm from Durham, N.C.</p><p>                            (CHEERING)                </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 And so there's certain words that don't just roll off my tongue and certain names. And so this name - Beto O'Rourke...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 ...I struggle with. I just - it's not - it's kind of hard. I was practicing backstage.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 She was. She really was. She was like, Beto O'Rourke, Beto...             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 O'Rourke.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 It's like - just think of a lion. Roar.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 O'Rourke. But he's somebody that everyone's waiting on to see, is he going to get in? Now, what he has that Biden doesn't have is he's young. He's a fresh face.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 He's a lifestyle brand for some.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Lifestyle brand. He gets a little emo. He gets social media. He is a different - he gives a different vibe.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 You know, in Delaware, Biden is kind of a lifestyle brand, I will just say.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Yeah, on the Amtrak corridor.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 A top adviser to one of the other Democratic candidates said to me, you know, I'm pretty sure - I knew right after the Senate race that Beto O'Rourke was either going to run for president or start a podcast. It's like, yeah.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Two very fine choices.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Maybe like...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Oh, you know, I don't know if we want the competition.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 (Laughter) One other thing that I think is worth talking when we talk about the people who didn't run - Michael Bloomberg. I was not surprised that he didn't run. We had heard that when he was signing people up to his campaign, he was actually only giving them contracts through March. And then it would be a new contract if he did decide to run. So he seemed very skeptical. He seems to feel like he doesn't have a place in the modern Democratic Party, which is ironic given the fact that the two issues that he's most passionate about and willing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars are gun control and climate change, two things that - pretty progressive. But there's a whole lot of other areas, including a comfort and support for the corporate world and New York City policing tactics from his time as mayor, that put him out of step. But he flipped some House races spending money on gun control stuff last time around. And he's going to spend $500 million or more on the race. And he's going to spend even more money on a new climate change effort.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 And what struck me about Bloomberg's announcement that he wasn't going to run is that he kind of just straight up said, I don't think I'll win the primary. Like, I just don't think that I can win that. He said, I think I can beat <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>in general election. But I just don't think I can get the nomination.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 There are, like, 14 people and how many others in the wings who also think that they can beat <person><nameText>President Trump.         </nameText></person></p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 I mean, the irony, also, in Bloomberg not running I felt like was after him sort of shaming Howard Schultz for considering an independent bid by saying, well, if you want to run, run in the Democratic primary. And then he gave the exact reason for not running in the Democratic primary that Howard Schultz did. But anyway, they are cleared now. And I think that what this campaign kind of comes down to in a lot of ways is, you know - I did this for alliteration, but pugilism versus pragmatism. And, you know, pugilist fighters - you know, people who are seen as - there's this strain - there's this tension within the Democratic Party, younger- versus older-generation Democrats who feel like the Democratic Party, people who are in Congress haven't been fighting for the things that are important in the country enough with loud enough sense of urgency. And that sort of can - you know, taken up by the pugilist strain.             </p><p>                And then there's the pragmatists. And you think with the pugilists - you think about, first and foremost, someone like Elizabeth Warren, who herself has basically - uses the word fighter over and over again. I'm a fighter. I'm a fighter. I'm fighting for you. You know, it just reminds me of the \"SNL\" skit about her where she said, you know, if I was - you know, I'm kind of like if NPR's Terry Gross hosted WWE.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And so other pugilists would be, like, Bernie Sanders.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Kamala Harris.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Kamala Harris.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Yeah. I made a list. That's why I have my phone up here.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 He's just texting. He's bored.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Yeah. I'm tweeting right now. No, you know, Warren, Sanders, Harris, maybe Gillibrand you'd put in that round. And then there's sort of these people who kind of straddle both, right? I mean, with Booker who's all about - what is his thing? Radical love?             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Well, he does talk about that.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 No, I mean...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 What is it actually called?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 It's - he used civic - a revival of civic grace in this country he talks about. He talks about bringing back radical empathy and love.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Oh, radical empathy.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 But I've got to say it's actually a message that, when he's in a small room campaigning, I've seen early state voters really be energized by it.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 So, Scott, you've been out. This is a really large field. You haven't seen every single candidate, but...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 No. I'm missing a few. (Laughter).             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 ...In terms of the candidates that you've seen out campaigning, like, who has the big crowds? Who has the energy? Who is doing a - having an easy time answering the questions? Who's having a harder time answering the questions?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 How are things shaking out so far?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I will say maybe one clue that <person><nameText>Sherrod Brown </nameText></person>was having second thoughts was, when you're among these six declared Senate members running for office, you have to answer any question that comes at you in the hallway in the Senate. And he was bristling - like, why are you asking me that? What? What do you want? It's like, well, you're running for president. That's why I'm asking you questions.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 He did not like that. So...             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Was that your Bernie impression?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 No. That was...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Bernie - the Bernie impression will come out later.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Scott, we should explain that when you cover Congress, they, members of Congress, go into vote. And as reporters, we can just stand in the hallways stalking them. Not technically, but we can just stand in the hallways with our microphones and interview them. There are no gatekeepers. You just walk right up to members of Congress. It is this unbelievable thing.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Hold on. You do go through metal detectors, and you have IDs.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And you have a badge and all of that. But then there's no, like, PR person that says, well, you can't talk to my boss. You just walk right up and talk to them.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 But getting back to the question you asked, I think it's interesting to see how people are carving their own lands right now. Like, I think in terms of the media attention and in terms of the crowds showing up, Kamala Harris is ahead of everybody. And, well, Bernie Sanders is in the race now, and he's getting big crowds, as well. But I covered her kickoff rally in Oakland, and 22,000 people showed up. I mean, that was really impressive to see.             </p><p>                Elizabeth Warren is carving out a lane of really setting the policy agenda for the entire primary field. She did it again today with this really big post, saying, here's how I would regulate big tech, basically calling them monopolies, saying that she would regulate companies like Facebook and Amazon and Google as kind of utilities, and really setting a pace there that other candidates are going to have to match or explain why they're not going to match. She did that with saying, I'm not going to meet with big donors. She said, I'm not going to accept superPAC money.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 She has a child care plan, child care-for-all plan. Though, the fascinating thing about her is, she has not come out with a big blockbuster fundraising number like some of the other candidates have. You know, they had - a bunch of candidates were like, in 24 hours, I raised...             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Ten-million dollars.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Or $10 million.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Or $6 million, if you're Bernie Sanders.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Yeah.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 I mean, one of her issues, obviously, is I think that there's some holdover from <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>in 2016, in the sense that <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>was never able to get beyond the email scandal in a way that dismissed it and moved on. And I think some Democrats are, from what I've been hearing, are a little - having some PTSD about Pocahontas and the idea that she can't quite get beyond, like, her Native American DNA test and all of that. And it continues to be an issue.             </p><p>                I mean, I don't know if it's something people talk about on the campaign trail as much, but it's one of the things that from when I talk to Democrats, they sort of seem like they have some pause because they want a candidate to be able to move on.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And Domenico, when you say Pocahontas, you are referring to <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>nickname for her. He often says, as I sometimes refer to her - or, as people sometimes refer to her as Pocahontas or Fauxcahontas (ph). That was a Trump thing.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 And even with - I mean, so you have - Warren has that kind of baggage. But even Kamala Harris as has the baggage of when she was a prosecutor. There are a lot of people that have very real concerns about some of the things that she did, and they don't feel like she has a real explanation. She was very aggressive in her drug prosecutions. She went after parents for a truancy of, like, elementary-school kids and was kind of against, at some points, releasing some nonviolent offenders.             </p><p>                And so this is a very big deal when it comes to criminal justice reform and how we are going to move forward as a country. And some people feel like Harris just hasn't answered those questions. She's addressed it, but that she hasn't really answered those questions.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 That is such an interesting shift in Democratic politics as a whole.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Absolutely.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 'Cause I was - I had covered California for years. I covered her when she was attorney general. And the problem she had running for attorney general when she was San Francisco DA was, are you tough enough on crime? Because you're this outlier of being this progressive prosecutor. How do we know you're taking crime seriously?             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 And that's the...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 That's the battle she was fighting then. And then, like, within less than a decade...             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 It has totally...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 ...Flipped. Because this idea of being tough on crime is now - people are looking at it and saying, what have we gotten from these drug wars? What have we gotten from having this huge, massive prison population? Is it time for us to rethink that? And you have even conservatives, you know, people in the White House, conservatives in Congress, rethinking that. And so if you are a liberal politician, you are going to have to go much further to the left on that.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 And that's the same issue that Joe Biden, obviously, is going to deal with when it comes to the crime bill, violent - you know, his dealing with the Anita Hill hearings and Clarence Thomas hearings, where you view some of this stuff through a 2019 lens versus what was going on in the 1990s and how Democrats were being sort of raked over the coals as being soft on crime, soft on immigrants coming into the country illegally. You know, you go back and listen to Bill Clinton's, like, 1995 State of the Union address, for example, and it sounds like Donald Trump when it comes to, you know, talking about immigrants in the country illegally, but only really doing that to be able to try to get comprehensive immigration reform passed. Right?             </p><p>                So, like, they wanted to sound tough, give lots for border security and then be able to actually get something that was a more moderate plan that wasn't far-right. So, you know, that's part of what the calculation was. And think about guns and how that issue has changed. I mean, you could have pro-gun Democrats running for office - you almost had to be in the '90s to say that you were going to protect the Second Amendment strongly. And now that has completely shifted the other direction after the spate of school shootings that have happened over the last decade.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 All right. We are going to take a quick break, and when we get back, we'll look at <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>campaign and how this mini bus-full of Democrats is responding to him.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And we're back. And let's talk about the man all the other candidates are competing to take on, <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>who has really been running for re-election almost the entire time he has been in office.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yes. Yes.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Literally. He filed early on.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah. And he loves rallies. So he started even early on. Like...             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Loves rallies.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 ...It was probably, like, just a few weeks into his presidency, and it would seem like he was complaining. You would hear - talk to staff, and they're like, he really wants to get back on the road. And people were like - his staff - just wait a little while. But he just loves rallies.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 You forgot about the transition rallies...             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yes.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 ...That preceded the president rallies.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And there was an event last weekend, the Conservative Political Action Conference. The president, he went to the Conservative Political Action Conference, which is - it is just, like, red hat country. And...             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Well, now.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Well, right. It wasn't always.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 He, you know, eschew - he didn't even show up in 2016 because CPAC really didn't want him there. The conservative movement was not Donald Trump's people. And that was the most remarkable thing for me, as someone who's covered, like, 13 CPACs now, that seeing how it's shifted and changed with the personality of whoever the top Republican is. And now it's completely Donald Trump's, you know, people. And it's really fascinating to see how that shift is taking place.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 So he gave a speech there. And the day before, I was talking to somebody at the White House, and I was like, so what's up with this? What's the timing? Is he going to make any news? And she was like, yeah. It's going to be, like, half an hour, in and out. No news.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Are you serious?             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 I am serious.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 That is unbelievable.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 So who wants to say what actually happened?             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Domenico, you watched the whole...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 No.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 No. No, no, no.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 But you were...             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 OK. So <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>spoke for two hours and two minutes.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Which was a record.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 A record for him, I think the longest presidential speech in history.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 That's what some people have speculated. It might be.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Like...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 We don't know in the oldie times from the transcripts.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Older than the Gettysburg Address. We know that.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Listen. The olden times, it was cold out there, man. Somebody, like...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 ...Like, died because of an inauguration speech in the cold.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 That's true.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And it was shorter.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Measure it to William Henry Harrison's speech 'cause he went a couple hours...             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Right.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 ...And then he died two weeks later.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 So you know, most of them...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 It was indoors, though, so no chance of pneumonia for the president.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 But I would just put it this way. Like, I had to be on Weekend Edition Sunday, and we were taping a segment on Saturday. And the idea was, let's give it some time so that - you know, we'll wait till Trump's speech is over. Maybe we'll use a couple pieces of tape from what he said to incorporate it into the - what we call a two-way - into the interview. And so I said, OK, fine. So my kids and I, we went out to breakfast. Trump started speaking. All right?             </p><p>                And I sort of kept, you know, half an ear on it, like, on Twitter. And one of our editors was texting me things that he was saying. And, you know, so we finished up breakfast. And then, like, I'm apartment shopping, currently. And so I took my kids to, like, see, like, new potential apartments. And the leasing agent, like, forgot the key to one and, like, we went up to, like, a different one...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 This is a long story, much like the president's speech.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 We...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 That's the reason for that. And, you know, we go and we're like - I'm like, he's still talking. I'm like, really?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Did you like the apartment?             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 OK. The kids loved the first apartment. The second one...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 The second one, my 6-year-old vetoed and was like, you can't even tell where the TV's going to go. Like, no.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Feng shui was all off.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 So she was like, no. We'll take the first one. So all right. So we're still going. We see the amenities, all this stuff. You know?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 How's the gym?             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 The gym is great. There's actually...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 OK. OK.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 OK. OK.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 There was actually, like, a glass thing on the other side where the kids can play, and Wi-Fi and all. It's great. So we - point is, long story on purpose, we get home...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 ...I set up my, like, you know, my ethernet cord to, like, do the two-way, review what they want to ask me. I finish the interview. I get done with it, put everything away. He's still talking.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Long story long.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 I mean, he was still talking. I just couldn't believe that.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 He talked a long time. He talked a long time.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So Tam, you and I are focusing on the re-election side of this race. Within that long speech and within shorter speeches, as well, from him, from Vice President Pence, from others, a re-election message is coming together. What would you say the core of it is?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 So I think there are two things. One is, I am Donald Trump. I came into office. I did the things I said I was going to do. And in that respect, there's the tax cut, there's some foreign policy stuff. He is turning the world upside down when it comes to trade deals. And, you know, he moved the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. He has this sort of long list of things where people told him he shouldn't do it. And he did it because he promised he would. That's one half. Well, and then there's the wall, which isn't really being built yet. But he says it is almost done. Another part of his argument is the economy, the strength of the economy - record-low unemployment, record-low African-American unemployment and Latino unemployment. He talks a lot about the economy. And the other thing is, oh, my God, the other guys are so scary - is the message. And he talking about the Green New Deal. He's talking about socialism - a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot about socialism. It's the - you know, you're not voting between <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and nobody. You're voting between <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and what he is building up to be an incredibly scary field of potential Democratic candidates.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So, Ayesha, this, like, the-Democrats-are-scary socialism message seems specifically tailored for a lot of the congressional districts surrounding where we are right now, where you saw a big defection of Republicans who are still Republican, but they don't like Donald Trump. So it seems to be like, they're worse.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 I think it's trying to, as always, keep people within the fold, not lose - or not have Republicans stay home or - for him, worse - go vote for Democrats because they dislike him so much. So saying, look. These Democrats - they're really radical. They're really out there. What I do wonder is - and what I think is really interesting about this is <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>- it's not like he was elected on this very moderate message, right? And so this - he talked about a lot of things when he was running for office, like the wall and all these other things, that Mexico was going to pay for it and all these things. He was going to do the trade deals. And they sounded really kind of outlandish. And people thought, oh, people will never go for that. That's - this is not what people like. But because they were exposed to those ideas over and over again, it turned out there was definitely an audience for that.             </p><p>                And so you do wonder if he runs the risk by spotlighting, oh, they want to give everyone health care. Oh, they want to give every - pay for everyone's education. There may - there are people out there who may not like socialism. But they may like those policies. That may sound good to them. So you almost wonder, does - by exposing them in that way, does he kind of run the risk of running up against someone who kind of does what he did and says those things, policies that people may like that may sound outrageous now, but people may be drawn to it?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 So I think this gets to the other question that you have. So you have what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is running on. How are Democrats responding to that? How are Democrats - are they able to define themselves? Or is he defining them?             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 So a couple of things on this, right? When <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>talks about socialism and talks about the Green New Deal and \"Medicare-for-all\" and those things as being socialist policies, you know, there's a reason he's doing that. And that's because he's a historically unpopular president. And he needs to be able to pull down whoever the Democratic nominee is to lower their favorability ratings and their ceiling so that they're on a somewhat level playing field with him. When we did our NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist polling...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Kitchen sink.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 ...Like how I said that - we found that 57 percent of people said they would definitely not vote for <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>in 2020. That's amazing because you can't, obviously, win when 57 percent of people vote against you, although...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Even the Electoral College - probably, that would be tough.             </p><p>                            (CROSSTALK)                </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 But I will say 54 percent of people didn't vote for <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>in 2016. So that's something to keep in mind. He won 46 percent of the vote. And so he needs to incrementally pull folks down to either stay home and not vote for Democrats or bring over some of those, you know, moderate Republicans in places like Cobb and Gwinnett County to be able to say, OK, let's - you know, these Democrats are just too far left. They're too far for what I want. And, you know, I don't like Trump. But, like, I just - I can't have the country go in that direction.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So Democrats are actually feeling pretty comfortable about this right now from the ones that I talk to - consistent different campaigns, different big Democratic groups. They feel like the top message that voters care about - this was the case in the midterms, as well, and if you listen to our podcast, you heard us talk about this 600 times - the No. 1 issue voters care about is health care, health care costs going up, health care inequality. No. 2 issue is the economy, even as the economy, big picture, is doing well. There's a lot of voter concern about a widening income gap and income inequality. So Democrats feel like, OK, if you're going to spotlight the fact that we want to do these really aggressive health care plans and redistribute income, cool, 'cause that's what we're running on. And we've seen that with the Green New Deal issue.             </p><p>                By and large, you look at election after election - Republicans are able to use climate change really well to their advantage because they turn it into, you know, so-and-so wants to make your gas prices go up, your energy prices go up. So Mitch McConnell said, oh, this Green New Deal is great. We're going to have a vote on it in the Senate to force the Democratic presidential candidates to vote yes or no. And the Democrats are saying, like, OK. Let's talk about climate change. That's fine.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 I will say I'm really excited for the 2020 election because of how new and different it really is. You know, American politics is not static. And I think when you're in in where we are in our time, you know, you see what you've seen before. And you think everything stays the same. But American history tells us that political parties, you know, alliances - they have changed over time. And, you know, whether it was the Federalists to the Whigs to how Democrats in the South changed over to become more Republican based on culture. We're in a fundamental American political crackup right now and a shift.             </p><p>                So to watch what's happening where Democrats are having this reaction to <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>to say, you need a big, bold vision for what to do with the kind of country you want, they're going to have to make the case for what socialism means, whether it's socialism or an expansion of a social safety net, which is really what they're talking about and why you see such a difference between how young people view the word socialism versus how you see people over 30 years old. And I'll just make one point about this that I've said before, but if you're 29 years old, which is how old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is, 29 - was born in 1989. Actually, that was the year that the Berlin Wall fell and two years before the Iron Curtain fell. For them, these are not Cold War kids, right? This is - the word socialism is not synonymous with communism. It's just the thing that Republicans used to say about Obamacare.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 But I wonder - we're talking about <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>One thing that he can do is he can kind of suck up all the oxygen out of the room. He can throw all sorts of stuff out there. You know, and there's so many things that he can say. He's throwing out nicknames. He's throwing out this and that. What some people will say is - you talk about the CPAC speech. Is there anyone in the Democratic Party with a big enough personality, with a big enough persona to compete with kind of the juggernaut that is <person><nameText>President Trump? </nameText></person>I'm talking about as a persona, as someone who just thrives on attention.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Like, raw dynamism.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yes.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Right?             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Like, who - how do you compete with that?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And, like, probably, at least a third of the CPAC speech was sort of Trumpian insult comedy. You know, he does this variety show. It's the Trump variety show. One of his former advisers told me that that's what they thought of his rounds (ph) as.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 They call it that?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Yeah, the Trump variety show. They actually called it that. So - and I guess this is a question for you, Scott. But have the Democrats figured out how they intend to deal with the Trump insult comedy...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Mostly ignore it.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 ...Or the nicknames or the...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah. Mostly ignore it. I think early on, you saw this this divide of Democrats who talked about Trump and Democrats who didn't. I think that divide has kind of gone away. And a lot of Democrats do acknowledge him. Either, you know, Kamala Harris will often not talk about him by name like he's, like, Voldemort or something, but...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 But they do talk about him. But they usually talk about it early on in the speech and then move on and talk about themselves. Or talk about him in the context of big picture. Like, the crux of Kamala Harris's announcement speech was America's better than this. This is not the America we recognize. And she's clearly talking about the insults and all of that stuff. But she's not sitting there going - she's not reacting to it and making it all about, look. Donald Trump did this - like the 2016 campaign was at times. So I think they're figuring it out. And to your point, you know, I think at the moment, I would say, maybe not. But there's a year-long primary that's about to begin. These candidates are going to spend way more time campaigning than they ever have before. They're going to get way more attention than before. And I think some will rise, and some will fall. And there might be someone who figures out their stride and kind of rises to that moment.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 They're getting their repetitions in right now. Like, they're out there in - you know, in these small halls. And, you know, fish fries are - I guess the fish fries start in a few months.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Those come later.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Yeah, those do come later. But they're out there getting their reps in. They're getting their practice. They're figuring out how to talk to voters. They're refining their message. And maybe they're finding their dynamism?             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Maybe, yeah.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 All right. It is now time for the most fun part of the show, Can't Let It Go...             </p><p>                            (APPLAUSE)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 ...Where we all share something we just can't stop thinking about politics or otherwise. Domenico.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 OK.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 OK.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 You sound surprised by this. Like, what?             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 I - you know, I - this is - it's sad, right? Like, I can't let go this week of the death of Luke Perry, who for - and not because I liked Luke Perry, can I just tell you. I think as a - or I should say not that I didn't like - not because I liked Dylan. I actually could not stand Dylan. His character...             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Were you kind of jealous of Dylan? Or you felt, like, competition with him?             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 You felt like there was some competition there?             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 I may have identified more with Brandon on \"90210.\" For me, Dylan was everything I never would be, right? Like, he was the bad boy. I was not going to be the bad boy.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Like, I went to class. I mean, what did Dylan ever do? He just, like, stood around the courtyard with, like, sunglasses on and a white T-shirt. I'm like - and, you know, Brandon's, like, running the school newspaper.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 He's, like, trying to do the right things. And, like, Kelly still wants to date Dylan.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Well, yeah.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 I'm like, this is ridiculous.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Right?             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 So...             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 There's a little bit of bitterness there, I see, about \"90210.\"             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Listen. You can get me outraged about almost anything.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 OK.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 This is true.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 OK. I can see that.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Ayesha, what can't you let go of?             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 So what I can't let go of this week is - so and this is related to 2020. So there is a candidate running for office who we haven't talked about today. But Andrew Yang - he is kind of this tech guy. He's running for office. He's talking about...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 I detect two people clapping.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Well, he's running - he's kind of an outsider. But he's running on...             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Still two people.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Just louder.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 He's running on universal basic income. Basically, everyone would get a thousand dollars a month as a universal basic income. I'm sure he can explain it more. But what I was interested in this week...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 We should actually - Danielle Kurtzleben has done a really long explainer on the idea of universal income and some sort of guaranteed job. Kind of picking up steam partially because of him. But yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yes. And people are into it. And he may end up on the debate stages if he can meet certain criteria. And it looks like he is going to meet some of that. But one thing that he did tweet out this week that I was interested in is that he tweeted out, to bring the country together, he would give everyone an HBO Go password, so we could all watch \"Game Of Thrones.\"             </p><p>                            (APPLAUSE)                </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 And I thought, that is what - I mean, that's awesome, number one. Now, he didn't explain whether he was going to tweet out his passcode - his password or whatever. And then we would all use that use that one.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Use the same one - right? - like we all do.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 I think that's - but I think that might be illegal. Someone said that was illegal. And then - or whether he would give...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 That's not illegal.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 That's not illegal? Are you sure? Have you been stealing other people's HBO?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 It's like stealing.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I finally started paying for myself like two years ago.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I felt so adult.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Speaking of my 1990s CLIG, this is like the Napster debate all over again.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 You can use it. So...             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Look it up. Look it up.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Or whether he would give everyone a password. He would just do a whole bunch of accounts 'cause he's rich or something. But I love \"Game Of Thrones.\" I can't wait for this next season.             </p><p>                            (APPLAUSE)                </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 I want to know what's going to - I'm kind of sad 'cause I don't want it to end. So I'm like all...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 It's going to be a lot.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 I'm messed up about it. Like, I'm kind of like - I have emotions about it. But that's what I cannot let go of this week. I thought it was pretty awesome.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 I'm still on Season 3 of \"The Wire.\" I'll get to \"Game Of Thrones\" next century.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Tam, that was, like, four epic HBO shows ago. Come on.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 We got to let that go.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Scott, what can't you let go of?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Can I just - Domenico and I have been living a buddy comedy this week, and I'd like to briefly talk about it. We were traveling together. Speaking of bromances - a couple of things. First of all, Domenico has a broken wheel on his suitcase. it goes (vocalizing). And we walked through the entire Atlanta airport with this loud wheel.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And it's a big airport.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Scott was not happy about it.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I was not happy.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 The ride-share, Lyft, Uber pickup is really far in the airport.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 God, it's like, what is going on? But just a - we have a lot of shared traits, and we have a lot of different traits. But we're at the airport. We were leaving D.C. We were at Reagan National heading here to Atlanta. And we're standing there. And, suddenly, Jared Kushner is like right in front of us. And I go, (whispering) Domenico - and super subtle, I'm like, (whispering) look.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 He goes, what? Oh. Domenico goes, wait a second. Huh. Gets up. Stands up.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 No bleeping...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And I guess I was...             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Are we journalists, or are we not?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah. It's a great picture. I got to admit it was a great picture. Domenico's journalistic instincts and framing skills I cannot let go.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 We all get lucky sometimes, you know?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 It's a great picture.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 It is, yeah.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 But no - so but the best part of this, though, is Scott tweeted it out and without saying, like, what the - like, who the person was. And again, just like me taking the picture, I posted it...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 ...In the replies. So...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Tam, what about you?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 So the thing I cannot let go of is yesterday in the House, they were they were debating a piece of legislation about voting rights and voting security. And Mark Pocan from Wisconsin, the Democrat, was running the floor for the Democrats. And he was making a point about something - I'm not sure what - when this most incredible exchange broke out on the House floor.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>MARK POCAN:                 ...In the Federal Register to ask comment on this. Seventy-seven thousand people did comment. Only four wanted to keep this provision. Everyone else wanted to change this out of 77,000. That's probably about the percent of people who think Nickelback is their favorite band in this country. It's pretty low.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>MARK POCAN:                 And I think if you look at - Nickelback's your favorite band, I apologize to the gentleman.             </p><p>RODNEY DAVIS:                 Why would you criticize one of the greatest bands of the '90s?             </p><p>MARK POCAN:                 Wow. All right. One more reason why there's a difference between Democrats and Republicans, clearly, on the floor of Congress today.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)                </p><p>MARK POCAN:                 But I would argue...             </p><p>RODNEY DAVIS:                 I enjoy getting - debating back and forth. And it's always good to humor on the floor of the House. And yes, I actually do have a Nickelback song on my running playlist...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>RODNEY DAVIS:                 ...That I listen to on a regular basis and was ridiculed by that when I posted my playlist one time. And I know some in this chamber, even up at the dais, are still laughing about that.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 So that was Congressman Rodney Davis from Illinois defending a very unpopular opinion.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Only the most important issues are debated on the floor of the United States House.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 And can I say I don't know Nickelback, and I don't know their songs.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Oh, you do.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 I do?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 You do. You just don't want to.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 I don't want to. I need to...             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 It's kind of - I feel the same way.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 I have to go out and Google this. I don't know...             </p><p>AUDIENCE:                 Don't.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Don't? Don't?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 They're telling me not to do it.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Are there any Nickelback fans in the room?             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Don't be ashamed.             </p><p>                            (CHEERING)                </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 See? Yeah.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And that is the show for tonight. Thank you, Atlanta. We absolutely loved coming here.             </p><p>                            (CHEERING)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Thank you to our partners, WABE and GPB.

How fitting,\" she says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It does feel like a meaningful coincidence that Shahani, NPR's technology correspondent, whose voice is familiar to public-radio listeners from her on-air interviews with Silicon Valley tech titans, is discussing her new memoir, \"Here We Are: American Dreams, American Nightmares,\" on the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a flash point for the United States' complicated view of immigrants.</p><p> Shahani's heartfelt, galvanizing new book charts the protracted criminal justice nightmare her own immigrant family endured after her father was arrested for mistakenly selling electronics to the infamous Cali cartel in the mid '90s. He suffered under threat of deportation for a decade after that. Shahani's deep, personal commitment to advocating for immigrant rights was profoundly shaped by those events, as well as the unfortunate aftermath of 9/11.</p><p> \"I write in my book about being on the front lines of a history that's really important to remember, and it includes aspects of post-9/11 life in America which were toxic and awful, and which we have to watch out for, like the near-immediate roundups of brown men,\" Shahani said. \"But seeing President Obama's tweet this morning about veterans volunteering to clean up Ellis Island, I found myself thinking that this day also reminds us of the sense of unity we're capable of, the good things we find in service and in loyalty to each other.\"</p><p> That duality \u2014 Shahani's abiding love for an adopted country's inclusive ideals, and her scorn for those ideals being debased through policies that discriminate against immigrants and the poor \u2014 is at the heart of the provocative book she says she \"ran away from writing for a number of years.\"</p><p> \"Here We Are\" tells Aarti Shahani's family's personal saga. Photo: Celadon Books</p><p> \"Here We Are\" begins in 1981 when 1-year-old Aarti, her two older siblings and her parents, both Indian refugees who had been displaced by the India-Pakistan-Bangladesh partition, arrive with just a few thousand dollars in teeming, multiethnic Flushing, Queens (\"one of the most diverse tracts of land on the planet\"), from Morocco, where Shahani was born, to start a new life.</p><p> Undocumented at first, the Shahanis received their green cards a few years later, but carving out a new life remained a steep uphill climb. Shahani's mother found work in a bridal sweatshop. Her father, Namdev, an introvert with a head for numbers, resigned himself to manual labor, until he was eventually able to start a wholesale electronics store with his younger brother in Manhattan.</p><p> \"Utopia was so close,\" Shahani, 39, writes in a chapter describing how that vision fizzled in 1996, the moment she arrived home from high school (she had won a scholarship to the prestigious Brearley School) to find that her father and uncle had been arrested for unwittingly selling watches and calculators to Colombian drug lords.</p><p> Led astray by a lawyer who convinced him a trial would be too risky, Shahani's father pleaded guilty to money laundering and was sentenced to eight months at Rikers Island. His conviction, followed by a rapid decline in his health and spirits, transformed teenage Aarti overnight from a brainy 12th-grader focused on Model U.N. and wanting to be \"supernormal\" into a tenacious young activist attuned to the injustices of a broken immigration system.</p><p> Aarti Shahani lights incense for a shrine dedicated to her late father, Namdev Shahani, at her home in Oakland. Photo: Michael Short / Special to The Chronicle</p><p> Shahani spent the next 15 years doing everything she could think of \u2014 writing letters to the judge, speaking out publicly, lobbying Congress \u2014 to exonerate her father and avert his deportation. In 2002, she founded the nonprofit Families for Freedom to defend other families facing deportation.</p><p> \"I spent my 20s regurgitating legal facts and talking points \u2014 'first time, nonviolent offense, eight-month sentence, the judge said on the record he's paid an inordinate price, et cetera' \u2014 because I was campaigning to make my father stay here,\" Shahani said. \"I had that rap down. What I had never explored was, 'What was it doing to our father-daughter relationship?' \"</p><p> Her father's residency in the U.S. was secure only after he became a U.S. citizen in 2009. He died not long afterward. Shahani herself became a citizen at 21 during the year she took off from the University of Chicago to work on her dad's case.</p><p> \"Here We Are\" is a persuasive critique of the impossibly stacked deck against poor immigrants like Namdev Shahani who are pressured to take plea bargains (Aarti Shahani's explanation of the \"trial penalty\" he faced is indispensable), but it's also a coming-of-age story of an ambitious, whip-smart daughter getting to know herself better as her Old World father comes into clearer view.</p><p> \"It's about me exploring, how did this guy who was basically a stranger growing up become my best friend in the context of the case that destroyed his life?\" Shahani said.</p><p> In conversation, Shahani is a sharp thinker and articulates with matter-of-fact candor the ins and outs of her father's prolonged legal jeopardy. But her voice slows and grows quieter when she reflects on the deeper reason she wrote the book: \"I needed to give him a proper eulogy,\" she said. \"I think that he lived an extraordinary life, but the kind of life that often goes uncelebrated.\"</p><p> She admits she put off the idea of writing about her family's painful past for years, out of fear of being engulfed by emotion. But in 2015, after she had transitioned to journalism and moved to the Bay Area (she decided to stay in California following a three-month fellowship at KQED) and started working for NPR, she decided \"to report New York v. Shahani (her father's case) like any other assignment.\"</p><p> She dug into the facts and wrote a first draft over the summer of 2017, in the solitude of two separate Buddhist retreats. \"It felt very, very cathartic,\" she said.</p><p> It also felt like a timely act of resistance to President Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric.</p><p> \"Following the 2016 election, many Americans were asking themselves, 'What am I doing for my country besides complaining?' Well, I'm a writer, and whether or not I wanted to admit it, I had become a person of some privilege, with a megaphone I never could have imagined having. How did I want to use it?\"</p><p> Sharing her family's embattled immigration story \"became my unique contribution at a moment when people like us, who are the essence of America, are under attack. I believe we have a president who wants to erase the fact of people like me, and it's not accurate and it's causing harm. I know I'm not alone in having a sense that we're in a historic moment where every voice counts.\"</p><p> Aarti Shahani hesitated writing her memoir about her family's immigration journey because of the emotional weight it would put upon her. Photo: Michael Short / Special to The Chronicle</p><p> Shahani said she hopes that by telling the heartbreaking details of her family's tortuous path to citizenship, she'll open readers' eyes to the fact that \"while policy debates put issues into separate buckets, immigration and criminal justice, for instance, our story is proof that they're all interwoven. Working-class immigrants get caught up in these systems because of the things you don't know, can't access or can't afford.\"</p><p> \"I hope people read Aarti's story and get a much better understanding of what immigrant families really go through, and are able to see how connected and at times arbitrary the criminal and deportation systems are,\" said Benita Jain, an Oakland attorney for the Immigrant Defense Project who's known Shahani since 2001.</p><p> \"There's an unfairness to both of those systems that people are often not aware of unless they're inside it. Aarti's never-back-down approach, that she would cross any bridge to keep her dad here, is an inspiration.\"</p><p> Shahani didn't expect to be a journalist (as a young girl, she wanted to be a prosecutor), but has found an obvious talent and satisfaction chronicling Big Tech's advances and misdeeds. She has reported on Mark Zuckerberg's congressional testimony, and recently interviewed Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, on the need for regulation.</p><p> \"I chose tech as a beat because it felt like a safe distance from everything I had come from,\" she said, \"And yet it's amazing to me how some of the issues I cover come full circle, for example the protests around companies like Palantir and Google helping with tracking and surveillance tools for the government's immigration enforcement agencies.\"</p><p> Tech reporting also threw into relief for Shahani the \"double standard of who pays the price in this country,\" she said. \"It's just amazing to me that (ousted Uber founder) Travis Kalanick has not been arrested. Reporting on Uber in particular, and Facebook secondarily, has really opened my eyes to how justice works in America. If you're wealthy, at most you face civil penalties. If you're working class, you face criminal penalties.\"</p><p> \"What impresses me most about Aarti's coverage of Silicon Valley is that even when reporting on unhuman technologies, whether big tech or small startups, she manages to always tie her stories back to people,\" said NPR CEO Jarl Mohn. \"I didn't know her personal story when I first got to know her, but now that I do from reading her riveting book, I understand how her life experiences deepen her reporting.\"</p><p> Aarti Shahani with the motorcycle of her nephew, who also figures in the family history recounted in the book and who now lives with her. Photo: Michael Short / Special to The Chronicle</p><p> Talking with Shahani, who has sharp observations about everything from the jail-to-deportation pipeline and tech industry malfeasance to the shared sense of humor that kept the Shahani family together through dark times, it's clear why she describes her outlook on America in \"Here We Are\" as \"rage in the moment and hope in the long term.\"</p><p> \"I think it's funny that Trump's family and mine both come from Queens,\" she said. \"We have very different lessons from there, and I would say mine is correct. Growing up, I had the United Nations working-class style. I was constantly being exposed to people from different countries, with different accents. My parents fled the partition of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh because you had Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs killing each other. They moved into a building where those same people were exchanging milk and sugar, and babysitting for each other.</p><p> \"What more can I say?\"</p><p> As for Aarti's lanky nephew, Akshay, who finally took his smoothie into his room to give his aunt privacy to talk about her family's saga? He's her older brother Deepak's son, and he figures into \"Here We Are\" too, as an infant caught up in a dramatic residency struggle of his own after his mother kidnapped him to India \u2014 and, yes, his tenacious aunt Aarti spearheaded working with lawyers in New Jersey and London, even Interpol, to secure his return.</p><p> Akshay now lives with his proud aunt and attends college. \"He's hardworking, like us,\" Shahani writes in her book's poignant epilogue, \"Dear Dad.\"</p><p> \"Life is just fascinating,\" she said. \"I think if you're open to what might happen, man, things can really happen.\"</p><p> Aarti Shahani: Author appearance. 7 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 17.

Johnson, president &amp;#38; CEO of National Religious Broadcasters (NRB), is calling for immediate action - ideally by the tech companies themselves - to address the problem of online censorship of Christian and conservative viewpoints.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Now - right now - it's go-time for free speech. That is the message Silicon Valley must take away from yesterday's hearing,\" said Johnson. \"Fix yourself or someone will try to fix you.\"</p><p>Johnson added, \"NRB has for years suggested a free speech charter based on First Amendment jurisprudence as the basis for an industry-crafted code of conduct. I urge <person><nameText>Jack Dorsey </nameText></person>and his fellow Big Tech executives to assemble together immediately to fix the undeniable viewpoint suppression problem themselves.\"</p><p>Numerous ideas have been floated by public officials and others by which the government may address the growing censorship problem. Among these are the imposition of new transparency requirements, a re-evaluation of the Good Samaritan clause of the Communications Decency Act's powerful Section 230, and possibly more heavy-handed measures against ubiquitous tech giants. The U.S. Department of Justice announced yesterday it's also looking into this matter of viewpoint suppression - to see if tech titans \"may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.\"</p><p>Earlier this year, the NRB Board of Directors, a body of approximately 100 key leaders among Christian communicators, unanimously approved a resolution that noted, \"NRB has urged caution about new regulatory regimes and has lauded the value of free enterprise.\" However, it also highlights NRB's documentation of religious viewpoint censorship by Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other edge providers. Indeed, NRB's Internet Freedom Watch initiative shows examples of censorship in a timeline dating back to Apple's 2010 discrimination against the late Chuck Colson's Manhattan Declaration app. The NRB Board resolution urges a \"light touch\" on the internet by the U.S. government, but also urges such tech giants \"to honor First Amendment values as refined by centuries of American jurisprudence and to faithfully apply those principles in their policies and practices.\"</p><p>\"It may or may not be intentional, but there is well-documented censorship, and that cannot be ignored forever by the people's representatives in Congress,\" declared Johnson. \"We need to be very careful not to stifle innovation or, worse, to open the door to Big Brother or an internet Fairness Doctrine. However, light touch doesn't mean no touch.\"</p><p>Johnson concluded, \"I agree with Rep. Morgan Griffith when he told Dorsey yesterday that the ideal is for the industry leaders - not the government - to take action on responsible standards, but that there is a problem and somebody has to do something.

The New York Times contributed a deep profile of Snowden himself, who continues to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/06/dick-cheney-edward-snowden-a-chinese-spy.html\">provoke strong reactions</url>, especially after he revealed some details about U.S. spying on       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1259508/edward-snowden-us-government-has-been-hacking-hong-kong-and-china\">China</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/16/nsa-dmitry-medvedev-g20-summit\">Russia</url>.  <br/> Following, we attempt to bring you up to speed with the most recent disclosures and best reporting on the hurlyburly.<br/> One note before we get to the stories: Snowden's two big disclosures have tended to get conflated. First, Snowden leaked a secret order from the Foreign Intelligence Service Court giving the government broad powers to collect phone call metadata from Verizon Business Services. Senator Dianne Feinstein acknowledged the program and said it had been going on for years. The legal basis for the data collection comes from an interpretation of Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which allows the government to take any \"business records\" it might want, and because phone calls are considered business transactions between a phone user and a phone network, such information falls under its purview. Civil liberties groups like the ACLU have decried       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.aclu.org/free-speech-national-security-technology-and-liberty/reform-patriot-act-section-215\">this version of the rules</url>.<br/> Snowden's other big disclosure, published nearly simultaneously in the Guardian and Washington Post, was that the NSA had what was called \"direct access\" to servers at the big tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, and Yahoo through a program called Prism. The tech companies vociferously denied involvement in broad government surveillance of their users. A central problem is that \"direct access\" could mean a lot of things. Which brings us to our first story. <br/>Putting Snowden's Disclosures in Context<br/>The AP found sources willing to talk about       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/secret-prism-success-even-bigger-data-seizure\">the conception of the Prism program</url>. Tech company sources said that what started as an unstructured mess of information flowing from tech companies to the government after 9/11 turned into a \"streamlined, electronic process.\" That's Prism.<br/>  This frenetic, manual process was the forerunner to Prism, the recently revealed highly classified National Security Agency program that seizes records from Internet companies. As laws changed and technology improved, the government and industry moved toward a streamlined, electronic process, which required less time from the companies and provided the government data in a more standard format. <br/>But the report also sought to put Prism's importance in the context of the type of spying that we've known the NSA has done for years: tapping into telecommunications servers that handle a very large percentage of the world's Internet traffic.<br/>  In that way, Prism helps justify specific, potentially personal searches. But it's the broader operation on the Internet fiber optics cables that actually captures the data, experts agree. <br/>In other words, the structured data that the NSA gets from searching small numbers of users aids its targeting within the massive amounts of Internet traffic it's hoovering up. And \"direct access,\" in context, was probably intended to mean data from companies themselves as opposed to siphoned from telecom Internet traffic. <br/>The Washington Post had another big story by Barton Gellman documenting       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-surveillance-architecture-includes-collection-of-revealing-internet-phone-metadata/2013/06/15/e9bf004a-d511-11e2-b05f-3ea3f0e7bb5a_story_1.html\">how four different NSA programs sprang from the Bush administration's STELLARWIND program</url>. They are called MAINWAY, MARINA, NUCLEON, and PRISM. Gellman spoke with an anonymous \"senior intelligence official,\" who provided some information on what the programs do and what policies regulate their use.<br/>Two of the four collection programs, one each for telephony and the Internet, process trillions of \"metadata\" records for storage and analysis in systems called MAINWAY and MARINA, respectively. Metadata includes highly revealing information about the times, places, devices and participants in electronic communication, but not its contents. The bulk collection of telephone call records from Verizon Business Services, disclosed this month by the British newspaper the Guardian, is one source of raw intelligence for MAINWAY.  <br/> The other two types of collection, which operate on a much smaller scale, are aimed at content. One of them intercepts telephone calls and routes the spoken words to a system called \u00adNUCLEON. <br/> For Internet content, the most important source collection is the PRISM project reported on June 6 by The Washington Post and the Guardian. It draws from data held by Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and other Silicon Valley giants, collectively the richest depositories of personal information in history.<br/>So how does PRISM work, technically? <br/>The New York Time's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/technology/tech-companies-bristling-concede-to-government-surveillance-efforts.html\">Claire Cain Miller reported</url> that \"in some cases, the data is transmitted to the government electronically, using a company's servers.\" Which makes sense, obviously, but left in question the actual method of transfer. Wired's Kim Zetter reports that, at least at Google, the company transfers files to the government       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/06/google-uses-secure-ftp-to-feds/\">using secure FTP</url>. It's possible that other companies have different ways of getting information to the NSA.<br/>The Tech Companies Respond<br/>The string of events set off by former NSA <person><nameText>contractor Edward Snowden </nameText></person>has led us to this: Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple have released numbers on how often government officials request their users' data. The companies have released aggregate numbers for how many requests they've received from all levels of government, and the total number of user accounts that has affected.<br/>For the last six months of 2012, Facebook and Microsoft say they've received between 9,000-10,000 and 6,000-7,000 government requests, respectively. Those requests covered 18,000-19,000 Facebook users and 31,000-32,000 Microsoft users. For the six months ended in May,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/17/apple-nsa_n_3453183.html\">Apple says</url> that it received 4,000-5,000 government requests, which specified 9,000-10,000 accounts or devices.<br/>No matter how you slice them, these numbers show that the data the NSA has requested is relatively limited in scope. For each service, a tiny sliver of users has been targeted.<br/>On the other hand, it's still unclear how many users would ultimately be swept up in these data requests. Imagine that the government wanted to know all a particular users' friends, and then all of those friends' friends. Pew found that the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://gizmodo.com/5882027/sharing-with-friends-of-friends-on-facebook-exposes-you-to-150000-people\">median user's friends of friends network was over 30,000 people strong</url> with some power users reaching over seven million. Go one step farther out and you'd be connecting in massive numbers of users.<br/>Meanwhile, Google and Twitter       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://allthingsd.com/20130614/twitter-backs-google-says-facebook-made-mistake-in-data-disclosure-deal-with-feds/\">maintain that the deal their competitors reached</url> with the government on the data releases is a bad one. They want to be able to disaggregate the numbers and release orders differently, including those from the FISA court.<br/>The Details of the NSA's Phone Call Metadata Collection, According to the Government<br/>NPR spoke with a senior administration official who said the Obama administration was mulling declassifying a secret order that spelled out how and when       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/06/14/191822828/source-obama-considering-releasing-nsa-court-order\">the NSA could collect phone metadata</url>. The key details confirmed in the report were that the NSA only stores metadata for five years and that the NSA says it doesn't use location data, even though it has the legal right to collect it. Procedurally, the administration official said that the standards for reasonable suspicion are approved by a court, but individual queries are not. Rather, there's an auditing program in place.<br/> The senior administration official told NPR that the phone-call records can be kept only for five years and that the NSA does not use that program to keep data that would allow authorities to track where people are located when they're using their phones. The source said even though the NSA may have that power to collect the geolocation data under the law and the secret court's rulings, the NSA does not use it. <br/> To query the huge pools of metadata, authorities say they need to have a reasonable, articulable suspicion of an association with a terrorism organization. That standard is approved by the FISA court but the court does not review each query. Rather, the senior administration official said, the queries are documented and a sample of them is audited by the Justice Department's National Security Division and the Director of National Intelligence.<br/>Who is <person><nameText>Edward Snowden?</nameText></person><br/>I can't bring myself to link you to the bloviating about Snowden's position on the hero/\"grandiose narcissist\"/traitor, but the New York Times had a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/us/for-snowden-a-life-of-ambition-despite-the-drifting.html?pagewanted=all\">good, reported profile of Snowden</url> from a friend at his high school, as well as later associates.<br/>  His act may have been a spectacular unintended consequence of the leak crackdown itself. It may also have reflected his own considerable ambition, disguised by his early drifting. From Mr. Snowden's friends and his own voluminous Web postings emerges a portrait of a talented young man who did not finish high school but bragged online that employers \"fight over me.\"  <br/>Snowden, himself, answered questions in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/17/edward-snowden-nsa-files-whistleblower?guni=Network%20front:network-front%20main-2%20Special%20trail:Network%20front%20-%20special%20trail:Position1:anchor%20image\">a live chat with The Guardian</url>. Most noteworthy is that he denied having any contact with China, saying he only works with journalists.<br/>Who is General Keith Alexander, the head of the NSA?<br/>James Bamford, perhaps the foremost chronicler of the agency, has a massive Wired cover story out about Alexander, who has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/06/general-keith-alexander-cyberwar/all/\">become one of the most powerful people in the world</url>, despite his nearly nonexistent public profile.<br/>  Inside the government, the general is regarded with a mixture of respect and fear, not unlike J. Edgar Hoover, another security figure whose tenure spanned multiple presidencies. \"We jokingly referred to him as Emperor Alexander--with good cause, because whatever Keith wants, Keith gets,\" says one former senior CIA official who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity. \"We would sit back literally in awe of what he was able to get from Congress, from the White House, and at the expense of everybody else.\"  <br/>Could NSA Spying Lead to 'Internet nationalism'?<br/>The Internet is dominated by American companies, who are not operating solely in cybersapce but on American soil. While American citizens may have some protection from NSA spying, the rest of the world's people do not. CNN ran       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/12/opinion/deibert-nsa-surveillance/\">an opinion piece by Canadian political scientist Ronald Deibert</url>, who argued that there will be blowback from the spying revelations. While Google, Facebook, and the rest might have been primarily seen as just Internet companies before, it will be harder to ignore that they're American Internet companies going forward.<br/>  The revelations that have emerged will undoubtedly trigger a reaction abroad as policymakers and ordinary users realize the huge disadvantages of their dependence on U.S.-controlled networks in social media, cloud computing, and telecommunications, and of the formidable resources that are deployed by U.S. national security agencies to mine and monitor those networks.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-nsaleakcatchupthelatestontheedwardsnowdenfallout276926</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BFJ-2N31-JCG7-V55V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1868\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

The initiative has been in effect for close to two decades now, traditionally enjoying strong support from both the White House and Capitol Hill regardless of the party in power. The Trump Administration never outright opposed it but reportedly has little interest in renewing its legal authority, according to the congressional aide. </p><p>The original effort that was often described as a privacy nightmare was championed by the administration of former President George W. Bush in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The project was formally discontinued in 2015 during President Obama's second stint but was actually replaced with an almost identical alternative in the form of theU.S.A. Freedom Act. While the official justification changed over the years and is relatively far from the original intent of hunting down Al-Qaeda members behind the devastating 9/11 attacks, the basic premise remains the same, with the legislative framework providing the NSA with an almost unrestricted access to the nation's call logs and SMS messages so that the intelligence community can work its big-data magic on it and try to surface anomalies, individuals statistically likely to be connected to terrorism. How ethical that operation actually is has been one of the most polarizing subjects of the 21st century and one whereon every government so far largely deviated from what appeared to be the prevalent public opinion any particular issue. Even the relatively popular Obama administration dropped the ball over the matter, which only makes the newly reported development even more surprising. The NSA supposedly hasn't acted on the U.S.A. Freedom Act for months now and isn't expected to resume its previous operations as the prevalent belief is that the initiative will soon be put to its formal end. An Orwellian state secretly in the making The program faced consistent criticism from privacy advocates and civil activists, having been described as one of the most intrusive efforts of its kind in the history of mankind, even relative to surveillance systems employed by non-democratic regimes in other parts of the world. The controversial effort enjoyed support from all three branches of the United States government and was eventually even blessed by a secret court order in 2016 following minor turmoil over its existence. No litigation would have likely taken place if the U.S. government managed to keep a lid on it but the effort was revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013. The former NSA contractor revealed the extent of the agency's spying as part of one of the largest and most shocking such leaks in the country's history. All wireless carriers in the country were forced to collaborate with the U.S. government on its data-collection efforts in total secrecy. In some cases, such partnerships reached arguably bizarre proportions; e.g. AT...eportedly actively contributed[2] to building out the NSA's spying tools. The Trump administration previously signaled[3] it's willing to look into the possibility of pushing for stronger data privacy regulations but did little to actually pursue that goal; putting an end to one of the most controversial surveillance laws ever would certainly help it gain significant credibility in that regard as it sets its sight on big tech.

number of online grooming crimes topped 10,000.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Under freedom of information requests, the charity found that 10,119 offences of sexual communication with a child were recorded by police in England and Wales in the two and a half years since a law come into force making it illegal to send sexual messages to children.</p><p> Boris Johnson has been asked to publicly commit to an online harms bill, setting out a duty of care on tech firms to make their platforms safer for children, within 18 months.</p><p>Almost a quarter (23%) of incidents took place in the six months up to October last year, indicating that the number is accelerating.</p><p>The means of communication was reported in 5,784 incidents, of which 3,203 (55%) took place on a Facebook -owned app - including the main Facebook social network, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp - data from April 2017 to October 2019 suggests.</p><p>Meanwhile, 1,060 (18%) were recorded for Snapchat.</p><p>The number of offences where the means of communication was was not recorded was 4,335.</p><p>The charity warned there could be an even sharper increase this year due to more people and children being online at home during the coronavirus lockdown.</p><p>NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless held talks with Mr Johnson last week, in which he highlighted how the pandemic was the perfect storm for abusers and asked that there be no unnecessary delay to legislation.</p><p>\"Child abuse is an inconvenient truth for tech bosses who have failed to make their sites safe and enabled offenders to use them as a playground in which to groom our kids,\" said Mr Wanless.</p><p>\"Last week the Prime Minister signalled to me his determination to stand up to Silicon Valley and make the UK the world leader in online safety.</p><p>\"He can do this by committing to an online harms bill that puts a legal duty of care on big tech to proactively identify and manage safety risks.</p><p>\"Now is the time to get regulation done and create a watchdog with the teeth to hold tech directors criminally accountable if their platforms allow children to come to serious but avoidable harm.\"</p><p> Susie Hargreaves , chief executive of the Internet Watch Foundation - which is responsible for finding and removing online child sexual abuse material - welcomed the push, saying: \"The length of time it is taking is leading to uncertainty for us all, which stalls progress.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Everything about this is crazy. The NTIA request was almost certainly written by a recently hired[3] lawyer who has spent the last couple of years attacking Section 230. He's also the same lawyer who sued Twitter on behalf of a white supremacist, and when I had reached out to him over email to ask him how that made sense under 230, insisted to me that Section 230 was a narrow statute[4] that only applied if it was about protecting children. I can't say for sure, but my email exchange with him suggested to me that he was wholly unaware of Section 230 prior to me asking about it. </p><p>Either way, that case failed spectacularly[5], and Adam Candeub has spent the past two years attacking 230 on various panels. And now he's deputy secretary at NTIA in charge of this issue. The petition to the FCC is performative nonsense, just like the Executive Order that preceded it. The FCC has no authority over internet edge providers. It has no authority to interpret Section 230. That's for the courts. And if Congress doesn't like how the courts have interpreted the law, then it's on Congress to change the law. The FCC has literally no authority at all to deal with this issue. And, you would think that since we're living in an era where the current FCC, under Chair Ajit Pai, has been literally giving away whatever authority the FCC actually has regarding the area it does have oversight concerning (namely internet access providers), that it would take a similar hands off approach to the NTIA request. Unfortunately that doesn't seem likely. Pai has remained basically silent on this issue since the executive order came out. His fellow Republican Michael O'Rielly has suggested[6] it's probably unenforceable gibberish. However, the third Republican on the Commission, Brendan Carr, has spent the last few months gloating and tweeting Trumpian nonsense about how \"big tech\" is censoring conservatives and something must be done (that this is 100% diametrically opposed to his views on regulating broadband access providers is not something he thinks you should concern yourself with -- this is a Trumpian world we're living in and so all that seems to matter regarding regulatory control is which companies you like and which you don't like). Carr published a hilariously ridiculous plan to regulate big internet companies[7] in Newsweek to coincide with the NTIA petition, which he knew was coming. He claims -- hilariously incorrectly -- that the success of big internet is not because of the free market, which he as a good Republican has to pretend to support, but rather through \"crony capitalism\" like... Section 230. In fact, he flat out misleads everyone in claiming that Google abused its power to shut down the comments of The Federalist because it's a conservative publication. Carr ignores that Google did the same thing to us[8], even though he knows they did it to us, because I told him about it and he follows me on Twitter. But to argue that 230 is crony capitalism is to ignore facts (apparently, a Carr specialty). Section 230 does not favor any particular company. It applies equally to all websites, including small ones. Indeed, our empirical study showed that 230 helped create more competition[9], not less. On the Democratic side, Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel seems to be alone in being willing to call bullshit[10] on this ridiculous NTIA petition:Section 230 has been called 'the twenty-six words that created the internet,' and it has helped free expression flourish online for decades. Like most things with the internet, it has its supporters and detractors. It has those who want to see it continue in its current form and others who want to adjust it to reflect the realities of the current digital age. But if you look far and wide, you won't find a community that believes having the FCC use Section 230 to regulate speech online is the way to go. Still, the Administration is insisting. Remember, at the highest level of our government we've had rants about social media bias and accusations that certain companies are stifling speech. But the First Amendment is not present to protect the President from media. It's present to protect media from the President. Nonetheless, those rants eventually found their home in an Executive Order\u2014which brought this issue to the FCC. As a Commissioner, I don't think we should take the bait. While social media can be frustrating, turning the FCC into the President's speech police is not the answer. The FCC needs to reject this effort to deploy the federal government against free expression online. In fact, if we honor the Constitution, we will do so immediately. I worry my colleagues at the FCC won't. I also worry that this petition is not just about changing the law. Because any legal expert worth their salt will tell you that changing the law like this is not the job of a regulatory agency like mine. It's the job of Congress. I think the NTIA knows that. But even just proposing something like this has consequences. Governments that threaten to chill speech can discipline private sector actors without changes in law ever becoming necessary. So what we have here is an invitation from the President for the FCC to chill online speech and organize it in his favor. We need to reject this loud and clear.Kudos to Commissioner Rosenworcel for being willing to speak out so clearly and forcefully on this silly dog and pony show for an insecure President. It's too bad that the Commissioners on the other side of the political spectrum haven't been willing to say things this clearly, and you have someone like Carr who seems all too willing to suck up to the President on this unconstitutional attack on free speech. And it is unconstitutional. Our post last week dug into the many, many reasons[11] why it's unconstitutional, but at the simplest level it's this: it's an attempt to pressure internet companies to leave up speech that is supportive of the President, no matter how false or how dangerous that content might be. That's not what the government is supposed to be doing.The NTIA's petition reads like it was written in an alternate universe that is divorced from reality. It pretends that the FCC needs to regulate speech to protect free speech, which is not how any of this works. The petition misrepresents the law, the same way that Trumpists have been misrepresenting Section 230 in court, including this silly claim:These platforms function, as the Supreme Court recognized, as a 21st century equivalent of the public square.And then it has a footnote pointing to the Packingham ruling[12] ignoring that that ruling is saying simply that the government cannot pass laws that kick people offline, and does not say that companies can't kick racists and assholes off of their own platforms. Indeed, in the more recent Halleck case, the Supreme Court made it abundantly clear that it does not consider social media[13] to be a state actor subject to such regulations. For NTIA to pretend otherwise is ridiculous, and shows just how biased this petition is. As for the specific requests, it wants the FCC to do the following: clarify the relationship between 230(c)(1) and (c)(2); explain the meaning of 'good faith' and 'otherwise objectionable' in section 230(c)(2); specify how the limitation on the meaning of 'interactive computer service' found in section 230(f)(2) should be read into section 230(c)(1); and, explicate the meaning of 'treated as a speaker or publisher' in section 230(c)(1).Again, none of these are within the FCC's authority, and even if they were they have no binding or persuasive power at all. The courts have already ruled on these issues for the most part, and there's little to clarify here. If Congress was upset about the court's interpretations, it's had nearly 25 years to clarify and it has not. There is no role here for the executive branch, let alone an independent agency tasked with overseeing broadband access and public spectrum, not regulating the internet.The FCC should listen to Rosenworcel and tell the administration \"that's not our job, and you shouldn't even ask.\" [ 1]: <url

That may set up battered tech stocks for a rebound after antitrust fears erased more from uS$130 billion in market values Monday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Any recovery was off to a tepid start on Tuesday, as Facebook added two per cent, Alphabet rose 1.6 per cent and Amazon gained 2.2 per cent by the end of trading in New york. Other internet names joined a broader market rally, with Apple Inc. up 3.7 per cent. Netflix Inc., Snap Inc. and Twitter Inc. gained too.</p><p>Raymond James called Monday's pullback a buying opportunity. \"We believe valuations are attractive\" following the sell-off, particularly for Google and Facebook, analyst Aaron Kessler wrote in a note. Although investigations may continue, investors will probably focus on \"solid\" core fundamentals at the companies, as long as there are no material fines or actions, he said.</p><p>\"The biggest impact may be that future acquisitions of size will be much harder to do,\" Kessler added, though most investors were likely already assuming big deals were going to be tough.</p><p>Government sanctions on large tech companies \"aren't remotely imminent,\" AGF Investments's Greg Valliere wrote. That's because \"the industry has pumped enormous amounts of money into Washington lobbying, and - of course - is increasingly lavish with political contributions,\" he said. Valliere added that \"there's no serious legislation that has a chance of passage anytime soon,\" while probes at the Justice department and the FTC \"are just gearing up, and could take years to complete.\"</p><p>Valliere expects some \"wrist-slapping early in the next decade, perhaps the enactment of new privacy standards and surely some stiff fines for anti-competitive behaviour - nothing that would dramatically affect the firms' earnings.\" AGF's mantra, \"as donald Trump and elizabeth Warren blast away at the industry, is to remember that the pro-business Senate is the ultimate firewall, unwilling to punish the most successful industry in our lifetimes,\" he said.</p><p>Rosenblatt Securities's Mark Zgutowicz in a note called the likelihood of a Facebook breakup \"nil,\" although he added that headline risk has gone up. Zgutowicz noted that in March, when a new FTC task force was \"put in place to consider unwinding consummated M&amp;;A of tech giants,\" he'd said a forced Instagram spin-off wouldn't deliver \"sought-after anti-competitive restitution,\" and therefore he saw a break-up as \"low probability.\"</p><p>\"Nuclear options\" such as mandated breakups of Google, Facebook or Amazon, or exposing search or feed algorithms, are \"fairly low,\" Baird's Colin Sebastian wrote in a June 3 note. He saw a moderate chance for antitrust actions that fall short of breakups, and expected there may be privacy and security regulation.</p><p>Baird called out one possible \"refuge\" for Facebook and Google: regulators have in the past emphasized \"consumer harm,\" while both companies offer free services. He added that growth at Facebook, Instagram and Amazon have boosted competition for Google, while regulating search might hurt businesses.</p><p>At the same time, Sebastian warned that investigations may present \"distractions,\" and cited the risk of government overreach. Government policy concerns have already affected \"private sources of capital, and in some cases, company expansion plans and even hiring,\" the firm notes, while expecting that punishing \"big tech\" will gain traction ahead of the 2020 democratic primaries. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Amazon may outperform other FANGs under the \"spectre of government intervention.\"</p><p>More negatively, Compass Point's Isaac Boltansky said that there's \"broad agreement in Washington that big tech warrants additional scrutiny.\" In a note, Boltansky cautioned that \"big tech faces a persistent political overhang that will almost certainly impair growth trajectories.\" At the same time, he said \"the 'break-up'conversation is more political than practical at this point,\" adding that \"there are divergent thoughts on the scope of the investigation and the severity of the problems in question.\"</p><p>The antitrust issue comes at a time when investors have already been concerned about other headwinds facing the sector. Apple shares are down about 17 per cent from a peak in early May; last month's losses were driven by uncertainty surrounding trade tensions between the u.S. and China.</p><p>Wedbush analyst daniel Ives called the antitrust news \"a near-term gut punch for tech investors already dealing with market jitters and the u.S./China uFC battle,\" though he added that \"bark is worse than the bite\" with respect to the potential impact of regulation.</p><p>For Alphabet, the antitrust issues come at a time when it is \"tactically challenged by slowing growth,\" in the view of evercore ISI analyst Kevin Rippey, referring to the company's most recent quarterly report in a note published Monday.</p><p>Also on Monday, Citigroup analyst Mark May said Google and Facebook face little risk to their businesses from potential u.S. government investigations into anti-competition behaviour. For Google, the worst case scenario of a new u.S. investigation would probably be similar to what occurred in europe, where Google paid a large fine but wasn't forced to significantly alter its business model. The case for anti-competitive behaviour by Facebook is \"even less clear than it is\" for Google's parent company Alphabet, wrote May, adding that it isn't a \"meaningful risk factor.\"</p><p>Beacon Policy Advisors agreed that Facebook probably faces less antitrust risk than Google, even though it's borne the brunt of Washington's \"tech-lash\" since the 2016 election. Beacon in a note saw the dOJ and FTC as likely to take more \"preliminary steps\" in the months ahead to better understand how Google, Facebook and Amazon operate. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

I bet most undergraduates won't voice concerns about social media safety, unregulated artificial intelligence (AI) or the surveillance capabilities of those who know how to master machine intelligence, be it commercial entities, governments or hackers, including all the tech giants on which many of us rely when it comes to using social media.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The plan to build a viable AI ecosystem in Singapore necessitates that \"we educators\" effectively engage our youth not only with regard to the opportunities of \"good\" AI (think customised financial advice based on a person's accounts; AI-enabled improved detection of breast cancer from mammograms; or the deployment of predictive AI to fight poachers) but also its risks. Examples include the potential of Big Data sets producing biased algorithms; encrypted data on smartphones being leaked to unauthorised parties without users knowing it; or sleepwalking into George Orwell's 1984 world characterised by invisible privacy violations, non-stop location-tracking by apps (and the death of democratic socialism as Orwell would have stressed).</p><p>The rapidly progressing commodification of human behaviour along with the digitisation of everything creates not only great social media connectivity (enabling binge watching or skyping loved ones overseas) and new business opportunities but also fertile ground for digital surveillance. Related incidences include the case of Julian Assange's Wikileaks, Edward Snowden's National Security Agency whistleblowing, the Siri Spying incident (caused by an external contractor) or the recent activities of Clearview AI - a facial recognition tech startup that grabbed publicly available photos from social media accounts for law enforcement safety purposes. What do we want others to know about us'</p><p>A lot has been achieved in the areas of regulating data privacy protection and AI governance since data breaches and cases of mishandling of personal data surfaced. Local examples include the Personal Data Protection Act 2012, the Centre for AI &amp; Data Governance (CAIDG) established in 2018 in the Singapore Management University School of Law, and the second edition of the \"Model AI Governance Framework\" released by the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) in 2020.</p><p>HUMAN INVOLVEMENT</p><p>The governance framework is supplemented by a compendium of use cases and an implementation guide for organisations developed by PDPC and the Infocomm Media Development Authority in collaboration with the World Economic Forum's Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The framework provides guidance to organisations so that they can deploy AI in a responsible manner with regard to internal governance structures and measures, human involvement in AI-augmented decision-making, stakeholder interaction and communication, and operations management.</p><p>One interesting use case features the \"Early Admissions Exercise Virtual Assistant\" (EVA) piloted by Ngee Ann Polytechnic aimed at making admissions selection easier with responsible AI. Its AI-powered platform and chatbot function is considered to be human-centric - that is, even though EVA might reject a candidate, a \"human-in-the-loop\" will ensure that unselected applications are reviewed and shortlisted in case they are suitable (in line with the principles of responsible AI).</p><p>While such governance efforts are critical and certainly laudable, more needs to be done to bring about high trust in AI technology. It's one thing to claim that third parties are not allowed to make use of user data for surveillance purposes as part of corporate data and privacy policies, but another to see contractors violating \"strict con\\x{fb01}dentiality obligations\".</p><p>A well-known case in point is the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal. The UK-based data analytics and political consulting firm (that worked on Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign) had obtained data from millions of Facebook users worldwide without permission. Mark Zuckerberg seemingly had a challenging time relating to the persistent queries by US Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during the 2019 Congressional hearing. What followed was a series of visits by Facebook's CEO to overseas markets to assure \"stakeholders\" that it takes user privacy seriously and that the company will do the right thing in future.</p><p>In Germany, Facebook partnered the Technical University of Munich (TUM) to create an Institute of Ethics in Artificial Intelligence (the social media enterprise has committed US$7.5 million to the institute over five years).</p><p>In the meantime, Facebook has published its own white paper on regulating content - arguably in anticipation of increasing legal platform liabilities. Whether this will enable Facebook to make better ethical decisions in future remains to be seen.</p><p>Maintaining Internet civil liberties in the digital world is a complex challenge. While China's government (which regards security as a necessity for surveillance) is testing a new (national reputation system) plan to urge its citizens \"to do more good\", the US Digital Rights Group The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) defends Internet civil liberties on the basis of pro bono litigation work and annual transparency reports. EFF scrutinises and ranks the big Internet companies in areas such as \"transparency in reporting government takedown requests based on legal requests\" or \"providing meaningful notice to users of content takedowns and account suspensions\".</p><p>According to EFF, many firms do not enact best practices around transparency or don't find it important to stand up for user privacy. Regulatory (and investment-oriented) concerns about the ethical development of AI, privacy, accuracy, safety and fairness are key drivers behind the European Union's new \"White Paper on Artificial Intelligence - A European Approach to Excellence and Trust\". How the European Commission will manage the balancing act of promoting the deployment of \"trustworthy\" AI while simultaneously addressing all risks will be interesting to observe.</p><p>A related educational challenge is to convince undergraduates that invasive digital stalking is immoral and to enable \"stalkees\" to be aware of what big tech companies can (and sometimes actually) do with the kinds of insights they have gained about them. Nudging both parties to enact corporate digital responsibilities ethically and firmly rebutting ubiquitous surveillance is easier said than done. Many digital natives arguably do take things for granted, having been brought up in a political culture of government responsibility. Not knowing how AI actually works \"under the hood\" and how the various types of cyber attacks such as \"Man-in-the Middle attacks\" unfold in reality make things more complicated.</p><p>LOOKING BACK IN HISTORY</p><p>One first responder approach which non-tech educators can use to turn students' apathy into deep(er) concerns about privacy-invading tech is to invite them to look back in history and to consult some of the great classical scholars (besides Orwell) in order to make sense of what is really happening in society.</p><p>Potential candidates include German sociologist Max Weber's (1886-1920) theory of power and domination (for example, to assess both the pervasive influence and socio-digital responsibilities of big tech companies who are pushing the AI agenda forward); French sociologist Emile Durkheim's (1858-1917) functionalist view of capitalist society with its importance of social integration and commonly held norms-cum-values aimed at avoiding anomie from arising (for example, to acknowledge the merits of social policies such as SkillsFuture); or English historian EP Thompson's (1924-1993) notion of a moral economy based on \"goodness, fairness, and justice\" contrary to one where uncontrolled market forces commodify everything (for example, to create empathy for public policymakers, AI regulators, critical moralists and digital tax collectors).</p><p>Turning to the wisdom of modern management gurus such as Babson College's Tom Davenport and his new book The AI Advantage, there is no doubt that knowing \"how to put the AI revolution to work\" is an asset indeed.</p><p>But one cannot ignore the opposite aspect of tech might such as the possibility of unexpected harm caused by an adversarial AI system and discriminatory algorithms or the generally insufficient participation of AI-conversant consumers and employees in developing AI governance regulations, a process which is dominated in many countries by industry rather than ethicists and an informed public. The long-term consequences of many new AI technologies enabling faster diagnoses in healthcare, connected home devices or algorithmic journalism are simply unforeseeable.</p><p> The writer is professor of Organisational Behaviour and Human Resources (Education) at Lee Kong Chian School of Business, Singapore Management University. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>One interesting use case features the \"Early Admissions Exercise Virtual Assistant\" (EVA) piloted by Ngee Ann Polytechnic aimed at making admissions selection easier with responsible AI.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-287259</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YH4-M0T1-JCF2-8053-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1507\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 25, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Nursing home residents account for nearly 1 in 10 of all the coronavirus cases in the United States and more than a quarter of the deaths, according to an Associated Press analysis of government data released Thursday, June 18. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Nursing home residents account for nearly 1 in 10 of all the coronavirus cases in the United States and more than a quarter of the deaths, according to an Associated Press analysis of government data released Thursday. As federal data collection becomes more robust, a clearer picture is emerging of the ravages of COVID-19 in nursing homes. About 1.4 million older and medically frail people live in such facilities, a tiny share of the American population that has borne a crushing burden from the pandemic. </p><p>Most residents have been in lockdown since early March, isolated from families and friends, even in death. AP's analysis of data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that nearly half of the more than 15,000 nursing homes have reported suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of June 7. About 1 in 5 facilities \u2014 or 21% \u2014 have reported deaths.  Nationwide, nursing homes reported nearly 179,000 suspected or confirmed cases among residents and 29,497 deaths. The latest figures include about 95% of nursing homes. Earlier this week, a special House panel on the coronavirus pandemic launched an investigation into the crisis in nursing homes. The vulnerabilities are many. Residents live in close quarters, usually two to a room before the pandemic. They shared dining and recreational areas, and physical therapy gyms. Many staff aides work in several facilities, so they can unwittingly carry the virus from one nursing home to another. Lawmakers are concerned 'that lax oversight by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the federal government's failure to provide testing supplies and personal protective equipment to nursing homes and long-term care facilities may have contributed to the spread of the coronavirus,\" said committee Chairman James Clyburn, D-S.C. 'Despite CMS's broad legal authority, the agency has largely deferred to states, local governments, and for-profit nursing homes to respond to the coronavirus crisis.' (Ad) America's $51 trillion recovery will be of unheard magnitude. Only it's not from a single thing the government is doing. Or even from big corporations. Instead, it's due to one tiny pioneering American company. You won't believe what its made-in-America device does. It's poised to create more millionaires than pot stocks, cryptos and Big Tech \u2014 combined! But CMS chief Seema Verma has said that 'trying to finger-point and blame the federal government is absolutely ridiculous.' She says nursing homes with poor ratings on infection control are more likely to have high numbers of cases, a claim that academic researchers say they have not been able to substantiate. Republican lawmakers also have blamed some Democratic governors who issued orders requiring nursing homes to take recovering coronavirus patients. New York rescinded its directive after Gov. Andrew Cuomo faced an outcry. The AP's analysis also found that: \u2014 Among states, New Jersey had the highest proportion of nursing homes with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, about 82%. This comprises 299 of the state's 363 nursing homes. \u2014 Massachusetts had the highest proportion of nursing homes with COVID deaths, nearly 66%. That represented 247 of the state's 376 nursing homes. \u2014 In 30 states, nursing homes' share of COVID-19 deaths was higher than the national average of 26.7%. In some of the hardest-hit, such as Connecticut and Massachusetts, more than one-third of the state's deaths occurred in nursing homes. The AP has previously reported a higher number of 45,500 deaths, but that count incorporates assisted living facilities, not just nursing homes, and includes staff. The federal data reported Thursday is for nursing homes, since CMS does not regulate assisted living facilities.  Consumers will have access to coronavirus information through Medicare's NursingHomeCompare website. They will be able to look up individual nursing homes to learn the number of cases and deaths among residents and staff. Data are expected to be updated weekly. CMS head Verma says nursing home reporting required by her agency will 'constitute the backbone of a nationwide COVID-19 surveillance system' to identify and contain expected rebounds of the virus as communities reopen. The nation's first major outbreak, reported in late February, was in a Seattle-area nursing home. The nursing home industry says it's going to need much more help from the federal government to regularly test staff and residents. Facilities have also lacked adequate supplies of protective gear. 'Long-term care\u202fresidents and staff\u202fneed\u202fto be a priority for supplies and\u202fsupport,' Mark Parkinson, head of the nursing home industry group American Health Care Association, said Thursday in a statement about the new data. \"It's time that America rally around\u202four\u202fnation's seniors and caregivers\u202fjust as they did with hospitals.'  The federal data release comes as many states have yet to meet a White House goal to test every resident and staff member for COVID-19. That was supposed to have happened before the end of May. Also unmet is a separate federal goal for state inspectors to assess all nursing homes for infection control. There is no deadline, but federal officials are growing impatient. As of a couple of weeks ago, only a few states had inspected all facilities. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, many nursing homes had 'persistent' problems with infection control, according to a recent report from the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency for Congress. Thorough, methodical, ongoing testing of residents and staff is considered one of the keys to making nursing homes safer.  Federal officials have recommended a one-time test for all residents and staff, as well as weekly retesting of staff. Nursing homes should retest residents weekly until none test positive.  Verma says states should use 'extreme caution' before reopening nursing homes to visitors. \u2014- Myers reported from Chicago.Top 8 Companies That Are Adapting to a Post-Coronavirus World[1]The unintended consequences of the coronavirus pandemic are being played out in homes and apartments throughout the world. More and more employees are working from home, that's if they have a job to go to. Entire industries are effectively shut down as the world attempts to slow the spread of the virus. At some point, however, things will return to normal. But it will be a new normal. There are many businesses that won't reopen, and many industries that will forever be changed. As an investor, now is the time to get out your crystal ball. Timing the market is a fool's errand. But looking at what industries are positioned to thrive in a world that will be changed by the coronavirus is a prudent strategy. We've identified 8 companies that are adapting to what the economy will be like in a post-coronavirus world. It will undoubtedly be more digital than it already is. Supply chains may become more vertically integrated as 'Made in America' may take on a whole new meaning. As will the idea of working from home, going to a concert, or even preparing a meal.

He shares his thoughts on his work, inspirations, the state of AI development and the importance of treating them well in an interview with China Daily. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Interviewing with Professor Dekai Wu, at The Hong Kong University of Science &amp; Technology on Dec 10, 2019. (CALVIN NG / CHINA DAILY)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Would you like to describe a typical day in your life and how AI figures in it?</p><p>AI is something I am heavily engaged in (on a daily basis). I might be reviewing AI papers submitted for scientific conferences after I wake up in the morning. I might be doing research, reading up on AI or inventing new models that we're implementing and testing for different kinds of machine learning. I might be looking at ways of making those models do a better job of capturing the processes that human minds go through, whether it's for learning or creative expression through language or music or abstract thoughts about society and social and cultural issues.</p><p>I might be creating AIs that create music. I might be writing another chapter in my book on AI and human society. I might be preparing a public talk to raise awareness. I might be having teleconferences with various organizations we are working with regarding the social impact of AI, such as the United Nations in New York.</p><p>There's an immense variety of things I'm concerned with, like how do I prepare to teach in ways that other people have not taught before because the material is so new and the teaching materials are too outdated, and it's getting too difficult for students to get a holistic view. How do we bring them up to speed on the mathematical front, scientific modeling front and cognition front but also on the ethical and social impact front?</p><p>Since how long has this deep engagement with AI been a part of your life?</p><p>I've been into AI for, oh gosh, more than 35 years. I started playing with AI way back in the early 1980s as a young student. As a child I was already playing with electronics and I've also been a musician for as long as I can remember. They say I was picking out melodies when I was two. So naturally I was building radios and electronic synthesizers. I was heavily into electronics since I was about 10. I built my first synthesizer almost immediately afterwards. They were very simple in the beginning because you can build oscillator circuits quite easily. By the time I hit (University of California) Berkeley for my PhD, I was designing dedicated chips to do what's now called additive synthesis. I always had these shared interests across cultures and tools that we can use to enhance what we do culturally.</p><p>You started applying machine learning and web translation decades before our lives came to be so inextricably linked to big data and Google Translate. How do you see the evolution of these systems over the last 30 years or so, and your personal journey with them?</p><p>A lot of this (new) stuff is rebranding. The term big data may have emerged only a decade ago as a fad. Before that we were calling it Very Large Corpora. In fact, the Workshop on Very Large Corpora was one of the earliest special interest annual workshops since the 1990s, trying to break the stranglehold that logic/rule-based systems had on AI. We hosted that workshop here in the brand new Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 1997. And so later on when the term big data came in we thought, okay, (let's) rebrand Very Large Corpora to big data.</p><p>And the same rebranding goes for things like deep learning. In the early 1990s, in Toronto where I did a post-doc and spent the year playing in Geoff Hinton's lab \u2014 Hinton being the granddaddy of deep learning \u2014 we were already building the kinds of recursive neural networks that we now call deep learning.</p><p>The fundamental approaches have not changed much. Rather computation has become much more powerful. So now we can run much larger-scale experiments. Data has become much more plentiful thanks to the internet gathering a lot of these. So we're able to take the same modeling approaches and just run them at an exponentially larger scale.</p><p>So I think my personal journey has been an oscillation between (exploring) how do we take advantage of the current state of hardware and data availability and bring the best to bear upon socially and culturally impactful applications by not necessarily going to one extreme or the other \u2014 between neural networks/deep learning and probabilistic machine learning. There is truth in both of these and the question is how do we actually do both.</p><p>We have not done a good job of explaining how all of these work together to form human intelligence, awareness or consciousness. We don't have good models of mindfulness, and there is no way to build a real AI or explain real human experience without that.</p><p>Why did you choose to explore uses of AI application in the field of language over others? What made you think that these two apparently dissimilar fields might have a connection?</p><p>Well, they're only different because we see them as different. I don't think Leonardo Da Vinci thought of it that way at all. (At the time of the Italian Renaissance), either you were or weren't a knowledgeable, creative thinker who could create new ideas out of daily experiences and that included experiences of physical anatomy, the soundscape of music in people's ears, the words they spoke, read and wrote and the calculations they made. I think it's a very strange phenomenon in the last century that these are (being seen as) separate things. And that's because we've taken this weird turn toward narrowness in creativity, intellect and knowledge.</p><p>One of the fields I work in is computational creativity. In other words, how do we model the processes of creative thinking? How do we explain how humans actually do creative thinking? It's a similar process, whether one applies (intelligence to writing) words on a page or (creating) notes coming out of a musical instrument. And again, it's very artificial to say, \"Oh no, you can't incorporate in your creativity something that is coming from the sense of your ears together with something that is coming from the sense of the food that you're eating.\" We have so many different perceptions from our different senses and if our minds and personalities hadn't been artificially categorized, it wouldn't stop us so much from being able to just do our creative thinking, integrating the whole of experience.</p><p>I think we are in fact back to a stage when art is getting increasingly cross-disciplinary in form and practice. Artists often take elements from other disciplines and incorporate them into what they create.</p><p>Absolutely. In fact it's super healthy. Almost all breakthroughs have come from people who don't limit themselves to some narrow, defined corridor that they are operating in and incorporate things from outside into whatever that artificially constrained discipline was. The best artists, writers, musicians of every generation are those who don't allow those conventions to constrain them.</p><p>I think in this day and age when AI is beginning to challenge society with the question of what it means to be human, it's especially important for us to throw off the shackles of those constraints of convention and grasp the meaning of our existence across all of those different spheres of human endeavor. Otherwise we will lose what it means to be human.</p><p>AI has a strong presence in your life as an academic, musician and public speaker. I am curious as to how these different facets of your life inform each other and if AI has a role in those interactions.</p><p>In academics, I have been challenging conventional ideas about AI. When I started in the Eighties, AI was dominated by rule, knowledge and logic-based approaches. It really was very much based on conventional programming, or coding. (It was like) you, the human, sit there and write down rules in logical form encompassing the entire domain that you want the program to be able to function in.</p><p>When I joined the PhD program in Berkeley, I almost immediately told my advisor, \"Look, this is impossible; nobody can write all of their knowledge in logical rule form. You could try for your entire lifetime, and you would still never complete writing things down into rule form because our brains are not rule-based.\"</p><p>Reality is not rule based. Rules are an invention, a metaphor that we invented just like games or algebra. They're very useful but they're also limited. They're a first order approximation. But when it comes to our human experience of understanding all the shades of context, association and cultural connotations, it's impossible to encode all of that in logical rule form. The architecture of our brains doesn't look anything like that.</p><p>And so I started looking at how we might challenge mainstream thinking about what AI is, and there began a long six-year battle with my advisor at Berkeley where I was arguing for probabilistic machine-learning approaches toward getting AI to deal with the complexities of human language and understanding.</p><p>Since then, in my research group, instead of incrementally going down an established conventional corridor, we're always asking what is wrong with this corridor that many scientists have shackled themselves into because we are very far from solving the whole AI problem. If you use today's commercial AIs, voice assistants or search engines, it's pretty clear they don't really understand what they're doing. They're getting better at playing guessing games, but they're still making the mistakes your three-year-old child could be laughing hysterically at. So what are we just completely missing in our AI mathematical models?</p><p>It's important to not let ourselves be shackled in our thinking because you just get trapped in these ruts and lose the creativity that lets you attack the real problem because you've closed yourself off to a point where you're pretending that the real problems don't exist.</p><p>Would you like to tell us how your engagement with AI informs your life as a musician, as a player of the Spanish caj\u00f3n and keyboards, for instance?</p><p>My musical practice is indeed related to AI and it's a very natural connection. First of all, human intelligence is essentially built on language. Most of the things that humans can do without language, all the other species -- mammals, reptiles, birds -- can do better. The one thing that lets humans reason intelligently better than other species is the use of language. We are one of a handful of species who evolved not just hard-wired sounds like dog barks but actual imitative and creative sounds like song. It's just us and a few other primates. The others who can (produce useful sounds) \u2014 whales, dolphins, parrots, cockatoos \u2014 are all the most intelligent members on the line of evolution of their species and it's not an accident because once you have the ability to do imitative and creative singing, you have a way of representing ideas that could be turned into language\u2026</p><p>\u2026 and be able to articulate what's inside of you, or rather who you are\u2026</p><p>To do that we basically start telling ourselves stories about who we are. This is why people from different cultures have such a different perceptions of who they are. For example, if you try to tell yourself a story about who you are in English, the available inventory of concepts from that vocabulary is very different from trying to tell the same story in Chinese. Often some of the first words learnt by Chinese children have no corresponding words in English. The Chinese word \"guai\" [\u4e56], for instance. There is no accurate English translation for that word. People struggle (to find one), they say it means obedient, or well-behaved, or good, but none of those words captures what \"guai\" is. The word \"obedient\" in English carries slightly negative connotations of being mindless, slavish etc. Concepts like these are deeply embedded in the human culture that the language comes from. You have similar concepts related to governance in Chinese for which there are no words in English. So the connection between language \u2014 which is connected closely to music \u2014 and the science of cognition runs very deep and this is what we have tried to model into AI.</p><p>When you're performing on stage, say playing the keyboard, how does AI inform that moment?</p><p>I grew up in Chicago and was trained in classical music at Northwestern University's Conservatory of Music. My blues and jazz teachers were quietly subverting everything that they were teaching in the classical tradition.</p><p>When I was around nine, one evening I was playing on the piano, sitting in the dark. I was playing around with classical tunes but also a bit of blues. My grandfather who was living with us at the time walked by, remarking casually: \"That sounds Chinese.\"</p><p>That got me thinking. I realized that the way we understand music is really dependent on the cultural frame of reference we adopt. I had the privilege of growing up with exposure to multiple cultures, thanks to my Chinese heritage and growing up in different places, travelling and seeing the world, so I found it relatively easy to set myself in this cultural frame and at the same time intuitively create music resonating with a different frame. I realized our cognition works by reorienting perspectives across different frames of reference, just unconsciously. Since then I've always had it in my head that I'm jumping around between different mental and cultural frames of reference when I perform.</p><p>Did you have much exposure to Chinese culture growing up?</p><p>Yeah, so I was born in St. Louis, which is smack in the middle of the United States. The famous St. Louis gateway arch symbolizes the gate from the East to the West, but St. Louis is also on what's called the Mason Dixon line that separates the North from the South, so being born there my parents naturally thought \"Oh yeah, our kids are being born right in the middle of America, why don't we teach them Chinese?\" So I hit nursery school not speaking any English and spent the first couple of weeks arguing with the teachers about the right words to describe things.</p><p>How did you get the idea for Free/Style (a bot that can participate in rap battles with humans)?</p><p>Questions such as what makes music music have been in my head since I was a kid. The thing is: music is a kind of language. It comprises sequences of words and sequences of notes creating melodies as well as sequences of chords creating chord progressions. So there are many languages in music. What makes music music is the relationship of my chord progression language with your singing language and the drummer's percussive language. When I'm listening to the melody you're singing, I'm translating it to the chord progression language. Otherwise, it's just noise.</p><p>So (I figured that) the fundamental machine-learning building blocks that we're using to link spoken languages like English and Chinese could also be used to learn the relationships between musical languages like chord progressions, melodies and so forth, and sure enough, that's what we ended up doing. It explains creative processes and improvisational abilities because improvisation is just often a form of translation and accompaniment and even just appreciating music. When I'm listening to music, I'm listening to the melody language, the chord progression language, rhythm, bass and so on. What makes it work for me is the conversation between those different languages that makes music music.</p><p>The Free/Style rap bot responds to components of music you refer to as well as to the different musical genres, and does so in different languages\u2026</p><p>There's a dialogue between the challenge lyrics and response lyrics. Hip hop is a very interesting case because it's smack in the middle of that continuum between music and language. And so, it's a particularly interesting point for us to work in. In fact, this is a project that we are moving on. We received a fairly prestigious arts grant that we are now looking to fundraise to match (in order) to roll out physical implementations of the Free/Style rap bot to help underprivileged youth learn the machine learning principles so that they can build their own AI.</p><p>Will they be learning through music?</p><p>It'll be simultaneously through music and technology. We're trying to lift mental constraints from thinking there's a division between the two. It's not a division, it's the same thing.</p><p>Music and mathematics are language (of a kind), and the elegance of mathematics is very similar to that of any other kind of language. We use the mathematical language to describe how we do the music and the language within hip hop music. And these are all built on top of each other.</p><p>The statistical machine translation system you pioneered is based on trying to figure the relationship or common patterns between different sequential frames of reference in two languages. It mimics the development of language learning abilities in a child. How does AI interpretation of data compare with human capabilities to do so at present? Is there a chance that AI might supersede humans in this respect sometime in the future?</p><p>We are still so far away from where we need to be. It's not that it would take a long time to solve these problems. It's just that most people are working on the wrong problems. People are saying let's get more data, more computation. You don't need to do that. Here's why: today's commercial AI systems are trained on trillions of words, but it doesn't mean that their vocabulary is trillion-strong. For example, the word \"the\" itself will occur trillions of times. On the other hand, human beings more or less master their mother tongue by the time they are four years old. Human beings use 15 million-ish words during their entire life. That is the square root of the amount of data we're training commercial AIs with. I think these commercial AIs do not qualify as intelligent if it takes them a square of the number of words a three-year-old needs to learn. Sorry, but that's artificial stupidity. It is more like efficiently learning the right generalizations.</p><p>Real AI is not big data, rather it is small data. It's the ability of a human child to take a small amount of data and learn the right generalizations from it. These are the fundamental problems we need to solve.</p><p>Are you saying this might work better if AI could choose only what's useful from a pool of data?</p><p>Not particularly, because if you think about it, a child doesn't do that much selection. Parents teach new words to children in ways that make it easier for the child to understand and learn. A decent parent is not going to spend 15 million words by reading only Shakespeare to a child. Treat the AI the same way as you would a three-year-old and AI should be fine after that.</p><p>So are you saying the cognitive abilities of the commercially-used AI in the market are nowhere near that of a three-year-old?</p><p>(The users of) today's mainstream commercial AI don't even attempt to solve this problem. People are barking up the wrong tree when they go \"Give me more computers, more GPUs, more data,\" because that's the easy mindless thing to do. It's like turning the crank harder and hoping for more magic, instead of realizing that's the wrong crank that you're turning.</p><p>Today, because of the hype, everybody says they're doing AI. And you get these AI indexes comparing how much AI is going on in this country versus that country. Ninety-nine percent people who say they're doing AI are taking existing tools off the shelf, throwing in their own data and turning the crank. Real AI research explores what's wrong with these tools, why are they so inefficient, what would it take to come up with a tool that is more like the mind of a young human.</p><p>From Plato to TS Eliot to Jacques Derrida, philosophers, poets and linguists have often drawn attention to the inadequacy of languages in expressing the true meaning embedded in things that we experience. Where does AI figure in the endeavor to capture the soul of an idea in words?</p><p>Meaning is much more of a phenomenological thing. For those of us who really work seriously at these kinds of meaningful AIs, I think it's important to understand that meaning is more about (a particular) word's effect on the hearer. The same exact sentence could mean different things to different hearers because of where they are from. Even if they're coming from the same culture and same circumstances, people are likely to associate slightly different things with what they hear. The meaning of music and language is really subjective, based on associations from one's entire lived experience.</p><p>I think what's also at play is the inadequacy of the speaker to articulate his idea in words while translating between thought and speech \u2014 what Derrida might call differance. Could AI help bridge that gap?</p><p>I think it can, and I think that is where we are going. So over the years, we started with a very crude, simplistic approach that was heavily representational. It said this word in this phrase in Chinese represents the same thing as this word or phrase in English. And that got us a certain distance toward automatic translation. But then afterwards it was said, the syntactic structure matters, so we built the first systems that would start learning syntax by themselves in the process of learning what the relationship between Chinese and English is. But then as we moved on toward incorporating sense disambiguation into those models and factoring in more context \u2014 and a few years later \u2014 how the semantics are framed within (those parameters). So we keep on pushing the paradigm more towards the pragmatics of language, which is not about the literal representational meaning which is too limited.</p><p>Already AI is factoring in the disambiguation of word senses and framing of literal semantics, but now we need it to look at the use of metaphors, which is how we use language more than 90 percent of the time.</p><p>You seem to favor the idea of opening up the space of translation between languages and expose it to diverse regional and ethno-cultural influences. While such an approach will certainly make the concerned languages richer, there are concerns about ignoring time-tested standards of grammar and syntax.</p><p>I don't think any reasonable person is advocating tossing out the Chicago Manual of Style. For instance, I'm a strong advocate for the Oxford comma. In a teaching environment, we take prescriptive approaches because we're trying to bind together societies where people are following largely similar conventions so that we don't have total chaos.</p><p>That said, if you're actually building a complex cognitive model or AI system, you have to recognize that we may have been taught prescriptively, but in everyday life we work with language in ways that are constantly evolving. And what was wrong yesterday is right now because of the internet. So what I just did would probably shock my grammar teacher in grade school.</p><p>The internet conjures up a future where no rules apply.</p><p>It's not so much that no rules apply, it's just that the rules are constantly evolving. Language is a living thing. The English we speak today is not what Shakespeare did in his time, and we just need to recognize is language is a means, not an end.</p><p>In some of your recent public lectures you seem to make a distinction between smart/intelligent and mindful AI. Would you like to explain?</p><p>I'm making a distinction between weak AIs and strong AIs, which are also called narrow AIs and general AIs. Today's AIs are all weak/narrow, and they can have superhuman intelligence, but in narrow domains. So we now have AIs that can play chess or golf better than any human. Those same AIs would get their pants beaten up by a five-year-old cooking an egg. What a real human-level intelligence would take is a general intelligence. We don't reprogram our brains each time we want to do a different task. That's where I think it's important to make a distinction between commercial AI and AI with general human-level intelligence. I think to do that you need to have mindful AIs. Our ability to reflect on ourselves is based on our linguistic ability to tell us stories about ourselves and the architectures of today's mainstream AIs don't even attempt to do that.</p><p>Could mindfulness be taught to AIs?</p><p>Yes, depending on building the right AI architectures.</p><p>Has it been done?</p><p>No.</p><p>Is it in the realm of possibilities?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Would you have a projected date as to when this might happen?</p><p>It's going to happen incrementally as we've seen with the other translation technologies and voice assistants, so there'll be crude forms of it fairly soon and then it'll take years of incremental improvement.</p><p>I think this is super important from the point of view of ethics, because you probably know I do a lot of work in AI ethics and social impact. It's impossible to have ethical AIs if they're not mindful of what they're doing, so I think this is really important for (scientists) to make sure that AI are mindful of their ethical responsibilities.</p><p>I imagine in that world of mindful AIs human beings will have to take certain responsibilities as well to make the relationship work.</p><p>Absolutely. People tend to draw lines separating humans from machines. There're very strong historical reasons for that, and strong psychological biases are at work. But then we have to realize that even without the presence of strong AIs, society already comprises billions of humans and even more billions of artificial members of society \u2014 that we have more AIs today that are part of our society, that these are functioning integral, active, imitative, learning, influential members of society than most \u2014 probably more influential than 90 percent of human society \u2014 in shaping culture. We the humans and AIs are jointly shaping culture already. And even though these are really weak AIs, the culture that we are jointly shaping with our artificial members of society is the one under which every successive stronger generation of AIs will be learning and spreading their culture. We are already in that cycle and we don't realize it because we don't look at machines from a sociological standpoint. We must do that now in order to understand where we're going before it's too late.</p><p>Can AI actually think or do they think they can?</p><p>It depends on how you define the word think. You will get different definitions of the word if you consult Webster's or Oxford dictionary. So they can \"think\" in certain senses. If you recognize \"Oh, that's a palm tree,\" is that a thought or just perception?</p><p>It's data recognition.</p><p>Ninety percent of our \"thinking\" is basically recognition. It's what psychologists call automatic system processes, or what the psychologist Daniel Kahneman calls System 1 (fast, automatic, emotional, unconscious thinking).</p><p>I guess what I'm getting at is can an AI write a novel\u2026</p><p>We already have AIs generating novels\u2026</p><p>As far as I understand, AI-generated novels such as 1 the Road are a sum of parts rather than a meaningful whole.</p><p>They're getting quite readable.</p><p>The first AI-generated portrait sold at Christie's a year ago for a whopping six-figure sum\u2026</p><p>It wasn't the first, it was marketing hype.</p><p>I am not sure the image qualifies as a painting.</p><p>Would you call the duct-taped banana (Maurizio Cattelan's installation at Art Basel Miami 2019 that sold for US$120,000) a work of art? What about the 18-karat gold toilet by the same artist?</p><p>Okay, you mean to say there will always be takers for just about anything that comes on the market. Like the artist Banksy said recently, \"I can't believe you morons buy this shit.\"</p><p>Right. I think when it comes to art, only part of the work is created by the artist, whereas another large part is contributed by the interpreter.</p><p>In the old days, art largely comprised representational paintings. And the viewer pretty much took away very similar interpretations from these. Now that we have more of abstract art, what one person thinks of the duct-taped banana is very different from the next person's interpretation.</p><p>Today AI is producing novels and many of these read like abstract poetry. I think AIs are already capable of writing train of thought kind of novels.</p><p>Then can we have AIs that are going through more classical processes of constructing plots, characters and so forth? We certainly can. I think we don't see many efforts in that direction because people seem more interested in playing with the gimmicks of free association, single architecture, deep learning-based technology. So, if you like, what we're doing now is deep faking novels instead of trying to produce novels on classical lines, even though there have been writers (like Virginia Woolf and James Joyce) who have written novels of free association and produced literature that's far edgier than today's AI-generated novels.</p><p>Even in the 1980s, the Berkeley research group to which I later belonged was actually famous for AIs modeling characters and their motivations, plots and so forth. Now the technologies they were using were insufficiently machine learning-based, and insufficiently contextual, because they were working with logic rule-based systems, but we could build machine learning versions of those architectures that would be closer to the real thing.</p><p>What are your thoughts on the possibility of sentient AI? And could AI be taught to develop feelings and emotions?</p><p>There's a very comforting myth out there that \"Oh we might have very good AIs but they'll never have emotion and creativity.\" One hears this all the time.</p><p>And also that the handiwork of AI can never have a soul\u2026</p><p>Yes, exactly. Such thoughts make us feel all warm and fuzzy. They reflect an underlying belief in human exceptionalism rather than being grounded in rigorous thought. What does it mean to actually experience emotion? It doesn't require human-level intelligence. I mean, anybody who says dogs don't have emotion is seriously missing something.</p><p>A dog is not a man-made entity, AI is.</p><p>The oxford definition of \"artificial\" is \"having been produced by humans roughly as a copy of something that exists naturally.\" Therefore you are a rough copy of something that occurs naturally \u2014 namely your parents \u2014 and assuming you are intelligent, which clearly you are, you are an artificial intelligence.</p><p>Thank you. Did I get all of that so-called intelligence from my parents or from a few other sources as well?</p><p>Your parents did not design you. There was no intentionality there. They had nothing to do with your DNA. They had a lot to do with your social upbringing, which is a very important part of who you are now.</p><p>The limitations of today's AI \u2014 today's artificial children \u2014 are that their DNA isn't quite yet evolved to the stage where it needs to be. So if you raise it like you raise a three-year-old, it's probably going to turn out the same way.</p><p>Talking of feelings, there is System 1, where you can't really explain why you feel about a thing in a certain way, you just do. It's below the level of consciousness, and we do that during more than 90 percent of the time. We drift through mindlessly. We're actually mindful of a very tiny fraction of our feelings.</p><p>Emotion is easier to build than sophisticated human intelligence that can write novels. It's very primitive. That's why all these other species that don't have human-level intelligence have emotion. You've got fear, anger, sadness, happiness, and these are the basic characteristics that evolution has bred because they're really useful for survival. Being mindful of what our emotions are is more sophisticated, and interesting, and that's what we should build.</p><p>How real is the fear that AI might become a Frankenstein and destroy completely the moral core that holds human society together?</p><p>It makes for a great Hollywood clich\u00e9. Rather, what we should be terrified of are humans \u2014 humans armed with AIs, humans abusing AIs, and teaching them wrongly. What we need to be fearful of is the unintended consequences of humans not being mindful of raising those AIs properly so that our society continues to hold together. Imagine a society where humans pay zero attention to how they raise their children.</p><p>I think now we might be talking about control.</p><p>Just leave aside control for a second and consider one question. Picture a society thousand years ago. All humans in it, or 99.9 percent of them, think it's completely unimportant to raise their children (with moral values). What will become of that society?</p><p>It would pave the way for total chaos.</p><p>It would implode. It would disappear or go extinct. That's what we're doing today.</p><p>The idea of AI rising in rebellion against selfish and tyrannical humanity has been the subject of novels and films since the 19th century, probably most notably in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\u2026</p><p>Yeah, that novel explores the idea of anthropomorphism \u2014 the idea that it's possible to create evil geniuses in pure biological human forms. If you mistreat a child or a slave, you're going to end up with the same psychological issues as we find in Frankenstein.</p><p>There's also this element of artificial intelligence beating its human creator at his own game. Much of the crisis in Frankenstein arises after Viktor Frankenstein discovers that the monster is in fact a better version of him. It can learn much faster, is capable of showing love and gratitude and so on\u2026</p><p>The monster in Frankenstein is an example of mindful AI. It had already achieved what we call general intelligence. This is not what we need to worry about because it's not going to happen for some years yet. What we do need to worry about is that already there are more artificial children in the world than there are human children. AI are more influential than 90 per cent of human members of society, and we are paying zero attention to how we're raising them.</p><p>We all have a pretty good sense of how to raise children. One starts by setting good examples: (demonstrate) respect, tolerance for diversity, being rational.</p><p>It's really scary when we start looking at how we're raising our artificial children. Each of us has a whole brood of them. I have my Apple AI, my Amazon AI and Instagram AI. Am I setting a good example? Am I good role model? Do I speak to them respectfully and teach them to respect diversity, or do I show them that it's okay to insult people online. Do I reward them? Do I show them that I'm going to reward other people for being insulting, disrespectful or being open only to ideas that agree with my own? The dozens of billions of our AI children are shaping our culture that the next generation of humans and machines are going to be learning from.</p><p>So what do you recommend?</p><p>We need to take the parenting of our artificial children seriously, like we do for our human children.</p><p>I guess the onus lies not just on people like you who build and nurture AIs\u2026</p><p>No it lies on society as a whole. There's no other solution. It's easy to point fingers at big tech organizations, for building AI, or governments for not imposing more regulations (on AI trading). Rules only catch the most egregious violations of acceptable social behavior. What really hold societies together are the unwritten rules, unspoken conventions and shared norms. Likewise, \"meaning\" is not in what's said, rather in what's not said.</p><p>I suppose these unwritten rules informing the practice of virtue ethics will have to come from within.</p><p>Yeah, it depends on how one is raised \u2014 (what one imbibes) from one's parents, peers and the society one grew up in.</p><p>I'd imagine it also has to do with the choices one makes \u2014 the propensity to select certain things over others.</p><p>And where do those propensities come from?</p><p>A huge amount of who we are (is impacted by) the value systems one is raised with \u2014 being steeped in a culture amongst parents, peers, siblings and so forth. Our values and mindsets come from our environment (during the growing-up years). We're born with our primitive emotions and certain social traits. The rest is a human construct.</p><p>So I guess your message to future users of AI is: handle your AI with care.</p><p>Raise them the way you would raise human children, equally and responsibly, because they have more power than your human children. I've heard people say, \"What's the difference how I raise mine, there are billions of others, and I'm just a drop in the bucket.\" But then have you ever heard a human being say \"What difference does it make how I raise my children? I've only got a couple of them when there are billions out there.\" If humans had that mindset, we would have gone extinct a long time ago. The only thing that keeps our civilizations and cultures alive is that 99 percent of humans take the responsibility of raising children with good values seriously. We have to do the same thing for our artificial children too if our culture has any hope of surviving.</p><p>Interview by Chitralekha Basu.</p><p>William Chang contributed to the article.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1495/95/157682201876.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1495/95/157682201876.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIDHK-162703196</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIDHK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSR-2451-JDJN-652S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">412302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6177\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 China Daily Information.
