We need something more concrete to expect or anticipate than this economy and this world can give us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This morning I went over 300 stocks - three hundred stocks! - with an eye toward finding a new stock to introduce to members of the <url normalizedValue=\"http://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=019297\">Action Alerts PLUS</url> club where I give a talk each month and offer a compelling idea.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You know how many I found? How about four. That's right, four stocks that I think could survive the tests that I am looking for.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What would make a good stock in this environment? Let me give you the items I want to see before I bless buying anything in what has become a plain, out and out, treacherous market.</p><p>First, I want a stock that does not need a trade deal to make me money. As these talks drag on the list of those impacted grows and grows. Earlier this week we had David Farr on, the long-service CEO of Emerson  , and I think the company might be willing to do something big, literally split in half, if management thinks that it can bring out value. Classically that's great and worth buying, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">if</emphasis> the fundamentals allow you to hold it through the process.</p><p>However, I don't think you can do that with Emerson. Farr's been a visionary. He has a gigantic presence in China because he correctly anticipated that's where the growth will be. But he, along with pretty much everyone else, didn't see the dramatic shift in policy when President Trump came into office. What do you do now? Hope things blow over? Hope the Chinese economy isn't hurt too badly? Hope that your factories aren't expropriated and your executives kicked out of China? What a terrible parade of potential horribles awaits the most forward thinking U.S. manufacturer.</p><p>To me Emerson has become binary: a deal no deal situation and that makes the stock too difficult to own.</p><p>China can be totally toxic. Remember when the 2% of Cisco  business that was China played a role in its shortfall last quarter? Here's Cisco going down again today and while it has become incredibly cheap how do I know that numbers aren't done coming down?</p><p>Of course the ramifications are so huge we never know when a solid story can spring a leak. Who knew that Nvidia's  stock would plummet seven points because our government is cracking down on technologies that could be used for facial recognition against Muslim enemies of the Chinese state? What would have happened if Apple  hadn't pulled its app showing where police were located in Hong Kong because it puts its policy in jeopardy violating its safety promise? How about if you are a retailer without the clout of a WATCH, a Walmart  , Amazon  , Target  , Costco  or Home Depot  ? How about if you are a supplier who can't switch supply chains fast enough ahead of the next round of tariff increases next week? When I was flipping through the S&amp;P a huge number of stocks had one or more of these flash points.</p><p>Next, am I about to buy a stock that's going to be disrupted by those who play with free money? Think about Domino's  the other day when CEO Ritch Allison talked about how third party delivery companies are willing to lose big money to get business with companies that Domino's competes with. Domino's has the best distribution system in the food delivery business but it can't compete effectively with a pizza chain that has a delivery option that's sold below the cost of delivery because the venture funds backing the company are insensitive to anything but scale. Where does that leave the publicly traded GrubHub  ? How about near the 52 week low list?</p><p>There are disruptions going on all over the place. Amazon has disrupted freight deliverers like FedEx  . Online and off price retailers have disrupted traditional brick and mortar companies like Macy's  and Kohl's  . Merck  has disrupted the oncology protocols with Keytruda. Wind and solar have disrupted coal and natural gas. Pipelines have disrupted crude by rail. Roku  has disrupted traditional cable. Facebook  and Alphabet  have crushed newspapers and magazines. Rent the Runway has disrupted clothes buying. Harry's and Dollar Shave have disrupted razors. And most visible of all? Cloud and its derivatives are crushing anything on premise.</p><p>It's tough to be worried about something that hasn't happened but there are fewer and fewer stocks of companies that are immune to disruption.</p><p>Some markets can't be sold into and therefore some stocks can't be owned. GM's  on strike. I didn't want to own any stock of a company that sells into autos to begin with. Now with a strike that's expected to linger anything from a paint company to a glass company to a seat company to a parts company to a steel company to an aluminum company to a plastics company is likely to miss numbers. You can't miss numbers in this environment.</p><p>Then there's Boeing's  woes. There are so many companies that make parts for airplanes that they are too numerous to list. But you will soon hear from them and they will all tell the street to lower numbers. Total no-fly zone.</p><p>Fossil fuels? They are toxic wherever they are found, whether they are involved in the drilling, the servicing, the packaging, the piping and, of course, the actual liquids. Of course this extends to plastic, which the millennial fund managers think is the new coal.</p><p>Finally, there's the Warren factor. This is the one that fund managers can't stop talking about. She's a one person disruptor in the eyes of Wall Street. Single Payor? The end of managed care and the beginning of the end of big profits for drug stocks. Banks? Break-ups and re-regulations. Fracking? Out of the question, which eliminates any growth that's left from the fossil fuel cohort. Big tech? Massive antitrust investigations.</p><p>Fund managers fear for their own livelihood if Warren is elected.</p><p>I think all of this is alarmist. I do think that Warren stands for ending the great wealth disparities in this country and that is a very popular view among all but the millionaire and billionaires.</p><p>But my view means absolutely nothing when it comes to what Wall Street regards as the second coming of Lenin or at least a mixture of Huey Long and Mary \"raise less corn and more hell\" Lease.</p><p>Now the problem isn't that there are no stocks to find given those off-limits parameters. There are. There's just not enough of them. They are too hard to find. And because there are so many that are in trouble or potential trouble you are not going to be immune from huge waves of S&amp;P futures selling. Sure, you can buy the stocks of companies that can escape the grim reaper after they are knocked down by endless S&amp;P futures tsunamis. But then when the next wave occurs you just go down again with them.</p><p>Of course, we could get a trade deal of sorts. I think it is possible that the President forestalls the next round of tariffs if the Chinese give him any concessions, including a buy of something like all the hogs we produce given that the African Swine Flu has decimated the supply which is vital to the Chinese.</p><p>But then there will just be another deadline and another set of talks and another rinse and repeat. And throughout the water torture bankers will heap more and more supply on the market with hapless Smile Direct  like IPOs.</p><p>It's an unhealthy moment with the only saving grace being that I don't know a soul who feels it isn't. Sentiment is so negative. But occasionally, rarely, the sentiment is correct. If we don't do some sort of trade deal on the President's terms, then the sentiment will be right.</p><p>(Cisco, Nvidia, Apple, Amazon. Home Depot, Kohl's, Facebook and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's  . Want to be alerted before Jim Cramer buys or sells these stocks?   )</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSCSRM-15122255</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSCSRM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7V-R4X1-F00X-J3G8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420101</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1274\"/><timeReceived>7:01 PM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc.

The companies behind the currencies are beavering away to create essentially great investable companies. But, are you ready yet to buy into the crypto markets?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As I write, the cryptocurrency \u00admarket cap is hovering at around $134 billion (\u00a3102bn). There are more than 2,100 cryptocurrencies listed and Bitcoin has market dominance of 51 per cent. While the value of this market is way off its peak, many investors are still in for the long term. </p><p>The carpetbaggers and millennials who were hoping for their small holdings to go \"to the moon\" have since all gone quiet. No longer the lengthy chats in crypto chatrooms about this coin or that token rocketing. No, it's radio silence. Well almost...</p><p>I have a small holding in crypto and as I have written here before, my favourite is Tron. To be clear, this is no recommendation, and you should always do your own research. I am hoping one day in the next ten years that this particular coin will grow and I can have a surprise pension enhancement. </p><p>To be honest, I had forgotten about it as it was a small investment. Somewhat speculative, if you will. But, only last week I received a text from one of those millennial types who had laughed his socks off when I bought Tron initially. Not only did he chortle, but he told others how funny it was watching an old fart dabble in the cryptocurrency markets and buy an \u00adoutsider with no real hope. Yes, it did feel like taking a punt on a 200/1 shot in the Grand National. But, what a surprise to hear from the laughing laddie again.</p><p>The text read: \"I'm hearing great things about Dapps. Hope you still have your Tron.\" This was as close to an endorsement that I was going to get. But, it made me curious as to how the crypto world was performing. Dapps, by the way, are ostensibly apps that run on the Tron blockchain.</p><p>The CEO of Tron, a young entrepreneur called Justin Sun, has been a busy chap. Sun has had much criticism over the last two years as he is a colourful character, not afraid to say it how it is. He has \u00adstellar ambitions for his company. In short, to reinvent the internet so that users, instead of Big Tech, own the content and have more control over it. He has the likes of YouTube in his sights. He has worked hard and now, it seems, has some credibility.   </p><p>Tron is just one of the exciting little gems surfacing and creating companies that have purpose, potential customers, users and some form of end goal. But it has taken, and will take, a long time for these fledgling start-ups to truly be the next generation of tech. However, and this is the important element, credibility is starting to kick in. Only then will institutional investors think about putting their capital at risk.</p><p>Bitcoin, Ethereum and other larger coins have seen their values slashed and some argue that Bitcoin has no real future and may even disappear.  This is where the smaller companies who are creating firms that can generate revenue and hold up to closer scrutiny see the opportunity. For too long, cryptocurrencies have had no real regulation or governance. But the new generation of crypto CEO wants this built in to the market to ease future investors nerves, while at the same time adding value to their stock. This is key to this $134bn marketplace becoming ten times that in the next ten years. Who knows, in the future, \u00adpension companies may hold the likes of Tron in the funds. But, not quite yet...</p><p>The USA is the key as, if it weighs in with cash, then regulation will ease nerves. Even Facebook is introducing its own cryptocurrency. Mind you, I'm not sure that will do \u00adanything to boost the image of crypto.

Together, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Alphabet's Sundar Pichai run companies that have a combined valuation of $4.85 trillion. There were relevant questions worth asking them about how their businesses operate \u2014 and some were asked \u2014 but on several occasions, the hearing devolved into a farce; questions about censorship decisions made by tech companies not even included in the hearing were asked, while at other times, representatives yelled at each other to wear their masks. If you missed the hearing, don't worry about it. </p><p>Here are the seven moments that stood out.

Censorship was a hot topic Wednesday's hearing was nominally focused on anti-competitive practices by the four tech giants. But social media censorship, as some might have expected, remained a topic several GOP congressmen preferred to discuss. Things did not get off to a great start, though. Early in the hearing, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) asked Zuckerberg why his company had taken down Donald Trump Jr.'s recent post about hydroxychloroquine. The problem, though, was Sensenbrenner was referring to something Twitter did, not Facebook. 'I think you might be referring to what happened on Twitter,' Zuckerberg said. At other points, Zuckerberg defended Facebook's track record on censoring content, saying the company had 'distinguished ourselves as one of the companies that defends free expression the most.' He added that Facebook has no interest in being the 'arbiters of truth,' but that it remains focused on weeding out hateful content. The dividing line on Wednesday seemed to be Republicans worrying Facebook was cracking down too much on content, while Democratic representatives like Dave Cicilline ripped Facebook for not doing enough to censor hate speech. 2. Bezos had it easy \u2014 until he didn't Amazon's head honcho went nearly two hours without being asked a single question \u2014 a conspicuous length of time that many Twitter users were quick to point out. Circumstances changed, though, when Rep. Pramila Jayapal, from Amazon's home state of Washington, pressed Bezos on Amazon's business practices. 'Let me ask you, Mr. Bezos, does Amazon ever access and use seller data when making business decisions?' the Democrat asked. Bezos said Amazon's policy prohibits such a move, but that he 'can't guarantee' it's never happened. Later, Bezos was asked whether Amazon had purposely slashed the price of diapers to undermine Diapers.com; Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-Penn.) said documents showed Amazon was willing to lose $200 million on selling cheap diapers to bust its competitor. Ultimately, Amazon bought Diapers.com in 2010 for $450 million. The move, according to Scanlon, was a prime example of Amazon using its weight to systematically weed out rivals. Bezos said he didn't agree with the premise, and that he didn't remember too much about the events, which happened a decade ago. The two exchanges stood out as rare moments when Wednesday's hearing seemed to stick to the script. Also Read: Triller Nears Deal to Raise at Least $200 Million[2] 3. Masks became the new muzzle There were a few testy moments, including when Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) was told to put on his mask when he took exception to Scanlon saying he was pushing 'fringe conspiracy theories' on censorship.

Jim Jordan is pushing \"fringe conspiracy theories\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/83sKht0bRx\">https://t.co/83sKht0bRx</url>[3] pic.twitter.com/E6fEZKT6tO[4] \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) July 29, 2020[5]Also Read: Triller Nears Deal to Raise at Least $200 Million[6] 4. Zuckerberg defends Instagram acquisition Zuckerberg animatedly pushed back when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said Facebook violated antitrust laws when it acquired Instagram for $1 billion in 2012. The move was not illegal, Zuckerberg said, because Facebook and Instagram had a number of competitors at the time in terms of photo-sharing apps; he also pointed out the Federal Trade Commission understood this when it approved the deal. Zuckerberg acknowledged that the deal doesn't look as fair now that Instagram has more than 1 billion users, but that the platform's success wasn't a guarantee at the time. 'I think with hindsight it looks probably obvious that Instagram would have reached the scale that it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious,' Zuckerberg said. Nadler doubled down, saying Zuckerberg's admission Instagram was a threat to Facebook's business only shows it was a corrupt deal in the first place. 'This is exactly the kind of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent,' Nadler said. 'This should never have happened in the first place, this should never have been permitted to happen, and it cannot happen again.'

Pichai says Google isn't playing political favorites Despite concerns from many conservatives, Pichai said Google isn't deliberately weeding out conservative outlets from its search results. Pichai added that Google is politically 'neutral' and isn't doing anything to unfairly push stories in favor of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden at the expense of President Trump. 'We won't do any work to politically tilt anything one way or another,' Pichai said. 'It's against our core values.' His comments come after Breitbart.com  editor-in-chief Alex Marlow told Fox News' Tucker Carlson his website had seen its Google-referred traffic fall off a cliff[8] since the 2016 election.; 6. No slave labor All four tech execs vowed to never use slave labor to create their products in response to a question from Rep. Ken Buck from Colorado. 'I would love to engage on the legislation with you, congressman. Let me be clear: Forced labor is abhorrent, and we would not tolerate it in Apple,' Cook said. The question wasn't completely out of the blue; Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri)'s office recently said a number of global companies, including Nike, have been tied to slave labor camps of the ethnic Uighur minority in China. Considering Apple's close business ties to China, as well as Alphabet's connections to the country, the collective response was good to hear. Ultimately, Cook \u2014 the man running the world's most valuable company \u2014 had a relatively quiet day. He did defend the App Store at a few different points, saying the company may charge a 30% commission on all App Store sales, but that it's nowhere near a monopoly when it comes to the app market (or any other market).

Email problems One of the funnier moments \u2014 or bigger wastes of time, depending on your point of view \u2014 came when Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) asked Pichai a simple question: Why are his campaign emails going directly to Gmail's spam folder?[10] Steube worried his parents and followers were having a hard time getting his campaign emails \u2014 and wondered if it had anything to do with an anti-Republican bias at Google. Pichai said that certainly wasn't the case, and that it merely boiled down to Gmail prioritizing emails from accounts it knew were connected to friends and family. You can see Steube's full question here: Rep. Steube complains to Google CEO about his campaign emails going to Gmail spam boxes and says that it's only happening to republicans. (No, pretty much every campaign deals with email delivery issues.) pic.twitter.com/XH1floO9ff[11] \u2014 Tony Webster (@webster) July 29, 2020[12]The exchange was a microcosm of the day. The hearing not only gravitated toward questions that weren't germane to the topic at hand, it also failed to provided few worthwhile details on whether the four companies have participated in anti-competitive practices. Don't expect much to come of Wednesday's hearing.Related  stories from TheWrap: Coronavirus: The Canceled and Postponed Events in Tech, Media, Sports and Entertainment (Updating)[13]Ben &amp;#38; Jerry's Joins Growing Facebook Ad Boycott, Says Tech Giant Helps 'Spread and Amplify Racism'[14]Justice Department Targets Law Allowing Tech Giants to Regulate Content[15] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/overseas-theater-reopenings\">https://www.thewrap.com/overseas-theater-reopenings</url>/ [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/triller-nears-raise-several-hundred-million-dollars\">https://www.thewrap.com/triller-nears-raise-several-hundred-million-dollars</url>/ [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/83sKht0bRx\">https://t.co/83sKht0bRx</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/E6fEZKT6tO\">https://t.co/E6fEZKT6tO</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/1288558652513820673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/1288558652513820673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/triller-nears-raise-several-hundred-million-dollars\">https://www.thewrap.com/triller-nears-raise-several-hundred-million-dollars</url>/ [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/ctam-tca-summer-press-tour-questions-executive-sessions-new-footage-the-boys-aretha\">https://www.thewrap.com/ctam-tca-summer-press-tour-questions-executive-sessions-new-footage-the-boys-aretha</url>/ [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/07/29/marlow-google-has-diminished-breitbart-search-results-99-7-big-tech-will-do-anything-in-their-power-to-get-biden-elected/\">https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/07/29/marlow-google-has-diminished-breitbart-search-results-99-7-big-tech-will-do-anything-in-their-power-to-get-biden-elected/</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/four-apps-that-could-benefit-from-tiktok-ban\">https://www.thewrap.com/four-apps-that-could-benefit-from-tiktok-ban</url>/ [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thewrap.com/greg-steube-gmail-spam-sundar-pichai\">http://www.thewrap.com/greg-steube-gmail-spam-sundar-pichai</url>/ [ 11]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/XH1floO9ff\">https://t.co/XH1floO9ff</url> [ 12]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/webster/status/1288555617926316032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/webster/status/1288555617926316032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</url> [ 13]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/everything-canceled-by-coronavirus\">https://www.thewrap.com/everything-canceled-by-coronavirus</url>/ [ 14]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/ben-jerrys-facebook-ad-boycott\">https://www.thewrap.com/ben-jerrys-facebook-ad-boycott</url>/ [ 15]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/justice-department-targets-law-allowing-tech-giants-to-regulate-content\">https://www.thewrap.com/justice-department-targets-law-allowing-tech-giants-to-regulate-content</url>/ </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-WRAP105650159606398702275776100108</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WRAP-5357</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-H9H1-F03R-N4BF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1670\"/><timeReceived>11:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Wrap</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Joining us now is Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors.   </p><p>      Great to see you, Jim, good morning to you --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Good morning. Great to be here.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Yes, thank you for giving us some of your time while you're in London. In terms of the risks around an escalation of a trade war, this is one of the sort of scenarios that you see as more of an outlier, among other things. A 20 to 30 percent probability of risk. How do you see this evolving?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Well, I think that the market consensus is actually, in this case, valid. Which is that the administration, President Trump in particular, are using the threat of tariffs as a bargaining counter in order to get other things.   </p><p>      It was very interesting, when the steel and aluminum tariffs were announced, what, three weeks ago or three or four weeks ago, you had the photo up in the Oval Office with the steelworkers.   </p><p>      You then went straight to Mr. Trump's comments, in which he walked back the tariffs almost immediately. He said, \"Canada and Mexico are our friends, we won't target them. And the Germans might get better treatment if they pay for their own defense.\"  </p><p>      So in other words, using the tariffs as a threat to actually get other agenda items. Now. My 20 or 30 percent probability is that others call his bluff, and we end -- we end up, by default, with a rather unintended trade war. But I don't think that's the course that they think they're on.   </p><p>      And I think that some of the more free trade-oriented heads within government -- you're talking to Larry Kudlow later in the day -- I think many of them would actually sympathize with the idea of using tariffs as a bargaining counter.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  So buying very much into this argument that this is posturing, this is not where we end up, then, Jim. But things do seem to be escalating pretty quickly, don't they? I mean, the market's just getting its head around the $50 billion versus $50 billion --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  -- the two countries. And then we get this announcement overnight, that the Trump administration wants to investigate the possibility of further tariffs on another $100 billion of Chinese imports.   </p><p>      I've got this chart, 7061, which shows that, actually, it would be very difficult for China to match this toe-to-toe because of the scale of the imbalance in deficit. It would be difficult for China to find enough U.S. imports to, then, match this. So then it begs the question, how China then retaliates. What other tools do they have in their toolkit.   </p><p>      I mean, I wonder whether we need to get to a point where we've got a date in the diary, an announcement of a meeting, some kind of firm commitment to -- to negotiate something away from this posturing.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yes. I think the negotiation is happening behind the scenes anyway. I don't think it necessarily needs President Xi to go to Mar-a-Lago for the two sides to be talking. I think there is quite a lot of conversation going on.   </p><p>      Having said that, it's not yet decisive and constructive conversation. And I think that's something that the market expects to develop over the next few weeks. You probably will see some sort of head-of-government-type conversation between the U.S. and China.   </p><p>      But it's -- it needn't be imminent. The conversations can happen. The -- the concessions can be made at a lower level and get ratified later. The market thinks that's where it's going.   </p><p>      But, you know, it's so political. If you look at what the Chines retaliation was, you know, soybeans and pork. That's aimed at the people who elected Trump. It's not aimed at the U.S. economy more broadly. And so it's highly politicized when you look at the specific targeting of tariffs that's been suggested.   </p><p>      And I think that's the clue to what's really going on, that there is this 20 or 30 percent possibility that bluffs get called, things degenerate --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  -- and that would be very bad for the market, and quite bad for the economy.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Yes. And, Jim, you sort of advised to not really adjust your portfolio based on that 20 to 30 percent probability. But before we get to there with what's happening now, we've seen a lot of equity volatility, more volatility in equities than in other asset classes as we've --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  -- talked a lot about this week. I just want to take you to a chart which shows the relative performance of stocks versus bonds. And that has actually come down recently --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  -- you can see towards the end of the chart, it's coming up a little bit. In the scenario that we're in now, before we get to that 20 to 30 percent probability, how would you allocate? Would you reduce your exposure to equities, or not yet?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Probably not yet. I think you're -- in U.S. equities, you should be keeping up to wait (ph) because, you know, the U.S. equity market is, in terms of average rating, it's now on about between 16 and 17 times current-year earnings on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.  </p><p>      That's about in line with a long-term average, at a time when the fundamental background is better than usual. You know, you've got the impact of the new tax code coming through. You've got at least the late stages of a synchronized global upturn.   </p><p>      It's actually pretty good conditions for profitability and for the equity market. That's why I nervously say, \"Stay up to wait,\" even in spite of the possibility of some pretty nasty policy mistakes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  And -- and you don't attach a very high probability to those policy mistakes, as Nejra was saying, then, Jim. But do you have a handle on what the end goal of the Trump administration is here?   </p><p>      I mean, is it about bringing down the deficit, as he talks about so often? Is it about a decent performance in the midterms? It seems that we need to understand on what basis he will rate his own success, to understand where this goes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  And he measures his success very clearly, by popularity on -- among his base. And so what he wants to see, I suspect, is better job picture for his base, rising wages for the middle of the country, for the people that really elected him. And I think that's his ultimate aim.   </p><p>      I think a lot of the anti-foreigner rhetoric is really just aimed at the elements in that who are anti-foreigner. And I think that, in a sense, that's the noise around the fundamental economic aim, which is to try to take away the decline, relatively speaking, in living standards among the -- basically the white working class.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, stays with us.   </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Now, Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, still with us here on-set in London.   </p><p>      Jim, let's dive into the U.S. economy. We mentioned the job story. What do you expect to see today from the report, more broadly from the report?   </p><p>      I got a message overnight from Ben Emons at Intellectus Partners. He talks about how market activity, in his view, is starting to impact on economic activity. Do you see any early signs of that in the United States? Or it's way too soon?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  I think it's too soon. What I see when we -- we at Principal have a lot of contact with small- and mid-size businesses all over the U.S. Morale is actually quite high.   </p><p>      There is a very strong feeling that federal regulation is getting less in the way of small- and mid-size business. And that's kind of away from the political rhetoric and what's happening in the stock market.   </p><p>      So I think that that momentum is actually leading to a more positive, more constructive approach to hiring by small- and mid-size business. It's interesting, Mr. Bostic was talking about inflation. What we've seen is that wage rates are actually rising in small, mid-size and growing businesses more than they are in big companies and state and local employment.   </p><p>      So I think you've already got a kind of leading indicator of job -- of -- of wage growth here, which I think is quite healthy for the underlying tone of the U.S. economy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  When it comes to wage growth, I was reading a note yesterday, somebody saying, \"Look, payrolls are eventually going to pay. That wage growth that everyone's waiting for is going to come through.\"  </p><p>      Meanwhile, yesterday, we were talking about the fact that the U.S. sort of jobs picture, the employment picture, looking like the 1960s. We all know what happened then. Unemployment fell, inflation ratcheted up.   </p><p>      But this isn't really the '60s, is it, Chairman? I mean, it's very different globally. We're a much more globalized world. That's what's keeping wages down.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  It's globalized. It's also technology, Nejra --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  -- that's the -- to me, that's the big difference from the '60s, is the impact of e-commerce and of communication, the deflationary impact of automation.   </p><p>      There's an enormous amount of deflation in the economy that's actually not properly recorded in the inflation numbers. So for example, where people used to buy stuff from department stores, a big proportion of them now go through e-commerce, primarily Amazon.   </p><p>      Why do they do that? Because the prices are maybe 30 percent lower. But that's not recorded in the inflation numbers. You have a very large outlet substitution effect, meaning that there is more deflation around than the reported inflation numbers suggest.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  And a lot of price discover as well, and we --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  -- we -- yes. We all know President Trump's views on Amazon.   </p><p>      Just on the subject of the U.S. economy more broadly, then, Jim, how does this trade story stick to the Fed? Because on the one had, you could argue this gives the -- the Fed reason to pause, to assess what damage, if any, is done or -- or benefit is achieved.   </p><p>      On the other hand, though, you could say tariffs put (ph) up inflation, and therefore it forces the Fed to act more quickly.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yes, although that's not really inflation. It's simply an extra tax, which puts prices up but it's a relative price effect. Tariffs actually ultimately decrease inflation by decreasing economic activity.   </p><p>      So I think they'd be making a policy mistake if tariffs come in and they say, \"Hey, inflation needs to be choked back by higher interest rates.\" That could compound the felony (ph), actually, and make -- make the -- a -- a policy error on the interest rate front.   </p><p>      I -- I suspect if the Fed does four rate rises this year, they're probably making a policy mistake. I think they run the risk of getting yields into a territory that will slow the economy. And I don't think that has to happen yet. Even though unemployment is very low, the safety valve here is increasing the labor force participation --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  -- we're seeing that happening quite consistently, and I think that's a benign situation if they can keep on the current policy track.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Indeed. Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, stays with us.   </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Let's talk about tech, then. Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, is still with us.   </p><p>      And, Jim, we often talk about technology and its role on inflation. And you mentioned that in the previous half hour. But let's talk about regulatory risks.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Regulatory risk, specifically -- specifically around those business models in technology that are funded by advertising and therefore rely on data.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  How big a threat to these types of business is more regulation?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Oh. I think that Facebook in particular is in an existential threat. You mentioned earlier, the 10 or 15 percent setback we've seen in the stock price. That seems to me like a modest setback compared with the dangers they face, particularly on regulation.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  So existential. So this could really threaten the whole of what we know as Facebook? This could threaten the business model in its entirety?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yes, it could. Now what's happened with Facebook is, it's gone -- two or three years ago, everybody loved them. They were well-intentioned, they were positive. There was -- the tech sector and Facebook in particular were just extraordinarily popular.   </p><p>      Now with the stories around how they share data, with the use of data, with the monopoly power that comes from being in so many parts of social media, you have -- they're moving, to be honest, as unpopular as banks.   </p><p>      And, you know, I think that that --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  I don't know about journalists.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  I wouldn't go there.   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE</emphasis>:  A (ph) state agent?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  I wouldn't go there. Yes, maybe. But the point I'd make here is, when that sort of political problem hits, regulators come after them.   </p><p>      How might that end up? It might end up with regulation on (ph) use of data. The U.S. has a -- has a track record over the very long term, of breaking up companies --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  -- that become too powerful. I wouldn't rule that out on a three-year view. It's not going to happen under the current administration. But, you know, what happens in the midterms? What happens in the next presidential election?   </p><p>      You could well see a political situation where even a breakup of Facebook is in -- is on the cards.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  So there is a lot of risk there. I've been saying, \"Buy the U.S. market on the dips.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  I'm not (ph) sure I'd buy Facebook on the dips. I think I'd probably go to others that don't have the specific --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  -- perils that they have.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Yes. I mean, and, Jim, tech stocks were a big part of the sell-off and the volatility in the U.S. equity market generally, but you say we're not looking at a bubble-like situation circa '99, it's more like early 1998.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  How? What are the signs that you see there?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yes, the main one I would point to is that the stock market rating got very high at late '99. We got to 25 times our earnings on the S&amp;P 500.   </p><p>      The reason I think we're still in a much -- in a less perilous situation is that the average rating on the fundamentals is a lot lower at a time when things are really pretty good for particularly American business.   </p><p>      So I -- I think that what would get me to a feeling that we were in late-'99 and in real peril in the market is one of two things. It's either the market going up a long way to get to that 25-times earnings-plus --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE</emphasis>:  Right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  -- or it's something that brings the next recession much closer. Now that could be tariffs. The fashionable one six months ago is it could be military hostility in Korea. It could be an interruption of oil supplies. It could be credit problems.   </p><p>      You know, there's a lot of different things which are in that 20 or 30 percent probability of things going wrong. The main one at the moment is tariffs --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  -- but it's not the only one.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Volatile (ph) risks. And some people have pointed to recent appointments in -- in Washington, and when that changes --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  -- the percentages around some of the -- the possibility --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  That's right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  -- of military action. In terms of the debate around technology, then, Jim, so Facebook and business models such as that, perhaps, maybe face regulatory risk.   </p><p>      What about hardware businesses that operate in technology? We have numbers out of Samsung overnight, supported by their chip business. Are you more interested in hardware stories around tech, or are you not loading up on those either?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yeah, I'm not sure particularly a hardware story. Because the hardware is -- the -- the intrinsic value, the value to the consumer is dependent on the software and the apps.   </p><p>      You know, Apple is very modestly rated and a very strong company. I think I'd rather have that than Facebook in the current market. I might even rather have Amazon, actually, even though the president appears to want to get his claws into them. Because I'm not sure there's really so much that can be done about that. They're in a more competitive market anyway.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE</emphasis>:  They don't face an existential threat?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  I don't think they do, actually. I don't see it yet. So I do think that my \"buy the dips\" on markets is a little bit qualified.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  And it -- you -- you have to look at companies that have particular dangers at the moment, and the two that are being talked about on this show are right here, Deutsche Bank and Facebook.   </p><p>      You also have to look at other markets. Here's one place I go with the equity market. The rest of the world is more at peril from tariffs than the U.S. is. The U.S. is a massive, integrated domestic economy.   </p><p>      That's why I'm beginning to say, and have been beginning to say over the last two or three months, \"Sell the international markets on strength\" as opposed to continue to buy the dips on the U.S. I think that the U.S. will do better even with tariffs than many of the international markets.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  That's interesting. I was going to ask you about Big Tech and whether you were still positive on it, given that valuations in tech are three times the broader market --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  -- so we may not be looking at 1999, but still the tech valuation's that high. But you've sort of answered the question with what you said about Amazon.   </p><p>      But on what you said about global versus U.S., I want to show you this chart, which is the VIX topping the European volatility gauge as trade issues and the tech stock slump have played out.   </p><p>      And this is unusual, U.S. stocks being more volatile than their counterparts in Europe. So the euro stocks, 50 volatility index. The V (ph) stocks. Given that, you still think that you should be more positive on the U.S. versus the rest of the world?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yes, I do. I don't really buy the VIX as a measure of risk. It's too volatile to be anything to do with fundamental risk.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  And these are normal volatility levels, historically, right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Well, that's -- that's the point. You know, the -- the volatility, so far this year, looks high compared with where it's been over most of the last decade. What is it, 26 or 27 1 percent days so far this year. In the '80s and '90s, that wouldn't have been unusual.   </p><p>      Whereas in the current time, it's thought of as very unusual because the last 10 years have been a period of moderation and of gradual upturn in markets.   </p><p>      I think we probably, because of changes in market structure, just have to get used to be a bit -- to a bit more day-to-day volatility. I think that that's not really making the market fundamentally more risky.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  OK. Jim, thank you very much for your thoughts so far.   </p><p>      Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors. He stays with us here on the program.   </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  And Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, is still with us.   </p><p>      So, Jim, what's your view on Deutsche Bank and -- and German banks in general? And how they kind of fit into the broader European banking picture.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  I think the thing I would add to Jan-Patrick's comments about the succession at Deutsche Bank is, the ideal new person would also be something of a change agent. So it's an awful lot of things to ask for in one chief executive.   </p><p>      Now, why do I say that? If I look at the period when Deutsche Bank was doing particularly well in market share terms, they were very aggressive. They were aggressive on trading, they were aggressive on the investment banking products they were offering. So aggressive, quite highly leveraged.   </p><p>      Secondly, if I look at European banks in general and Deutsche Bank by extension, they're not well-capitalized. The non-performing (ph) loans were not dealt with after the crisis as effectively as they were in the United States.   </p><p>      So I would think that the new chief executive, if there is a new one at Deutsche Bank, will have to look very carefully at how to shrink some activities, notably in the aggressive end of investment banking.   </p><p>      They don't really need to compete with Goldman as a global investment bank. They need to be much more satisfying their base in Germany. And also to look at the capital situation. So there's (ph) going to be some unpopular things to do.   </p><p>      And I think it's a microcosm of the European banking picture. You know, there are strengths and weaknesses in the European economy. One of the weaknesses is, how will they create enough credit once growth gets going? I don't see that at the moment and I think there is an issue there.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Would be a big task, then, for a new -- a new CEO in there, yes (ph). If they could speak German, I like the way Jan-Patrick said that would be an added bonus, of course, as well.   </p><p>      So in terms of the underlying picture for the eurozone economy, then, Jim, I've got a chart here that shows a couple of data points on the eurozone economy that maybe have been ticking down.   </p><p>      In fact, this is on German factory orders, eurozone retail sales, (INAUDIBLE) to inflation, to output numbers, as being a bit disappointing. And blame a host of factors. The weather, flu, even, the movement of Easter, the stronger euro. How concerned are you about data points that disappoint a little bit or come in below estimate?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  I think they're symptomatic, Anna, of an economy that may not be quite as robust as many people hoped. And which may well not be in an -- such an escape velocity, self-sustaining recovery mode.   </p><p>      I think that, you know, Europe has done well. There has been improved sentiment, particularly in Germany. The French election put the European business sentiment on a much better course. Monsieur Macron has been a -- a big asset to the European economy by being very pro-business.   </p><p>      But what's happening next? You know, you're seeing recurrent resurgence of populism, even in Germany. You're seeing a very difficult outcome of the Italian election. Still not clear who will form a government.   </p><p>      So, you know, if you just (ph) look at the political situation in Europe, it's deteriorating. I would suggest that the European recovery is pretty fragile, and I go back to the banks as one of the reasons for that being the case.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  What does this mean for the bond markets, Jim? Earlier you were saying that you prefer U.S. equities over European. If we look at the Treasury-Bund spread, for example, does -- do Treasuries outperform?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  I think they probably do, relative to the Bunds. Although I don't -- I'm not one of those who think that -- that eurozone interest rates are going up rapidly.   </p><p>      I think they're -- I think they're going to be pinned to zero for a while because of this lack of sustainability about the recovery. So I think that, if anything, the -- the difference between U.S. and European rates might edge up a little rather than -- rather than closing.   </p><p>      But eventually, there will be a convergence. But it will really be very dependent on economic conditions' demand for funds. But at the moment, I would actually be more bullish of the dollar. And that's one of the reasons why I am favoring U.S. investments rather than -- rather than international.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  That's interesting, Jim. So you think you've got a -- a clear idea of how further trade tension, if that's what we're in for, impacts the dollar?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yes. I think that trade tension, if it leads to recession, which eventually it would do, then it will tend to lead to a push towards safe harbors, which will include the dollar and U.S. Treasuries.   </p><p>      That may seem a little perverse since the U.S. basically seems to have started these trade skirmishes, but I think they were started on a fairly clear calculation, that if it all goes wrong, it hurts everybody else much more than it hurts the U.S.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  I remember the height of the financial crisis, lots of people asked -- or at the start of it, lots of people asked if this kind of started in the United States, how come we find safe harbor in -- in U.S. assets? That --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  -- similar, again --   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  -- still serve (ph) currency.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Yes. It's the reserve currency, which is a -- which is an extraordinary privilege. And, you know, I -- I do think that the openness of foreign economies is one of the reasons they're vulnerable. It's one of the reasons they've grown, of course.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Yes. All right, Jim. Thank you so much for spending the last hour with us --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCAUGHAN</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  -- we appreciate it. Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S27-V7G1-JDPT-T2HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Joining us now is Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Great to see you, Jim, good morning to you --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JIM MCCAUGHAN, CEO, PRINCIPAL GLOBAL INVESTORS:  Good morning.  Great to be  here.</p><p>CEHIC:  Yes, thank you for giving us some of your time while you're in  London.  In terms of the risks around an escalation of a trade war, this is  one of the sort of scenarios that you see as more of an outlier, among  other things.  A 20 to 30 percent probability of risk.  How do you see this  evolving?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Well, I think that the market consensus is actually, in this  case, valid.  Which is that the administration, President Trump in  particular, are using the threat of tariffs as a bargaining counter in  order to get other things.</p><p>It was very interesting, when the steel and aluminum tariffs were  announced, what, three weeks ago or three or four weeks ago, you had the  photo up in the Oval Office with the steelworkers.</p><p>You then went straight to Mr. Trump's comments, in which he walked back the  tariffs almost immediately.  He said, \"Canada and Mexico are our friends,  we won't target them.  And the Germans might get better treatment if they  pay for their own defense.\"</p><p>So in other words, using the tariffs as a threat to actually get other  agenda items.  Now.  My 20 or 30 percent probability is that others call  his bluff, and we end -- we end up, by default, with a rather unintended  trade war.  But I don't think that's the course that they think they're on.</p><p>And I think that some of the more free trade-oriented heads within  government -- you're talking to Larry Kudlow later in the day -- I think  many of them would actually sympathize with the idea of using tariffs as a  bargaining counter.</p><p>ANNA EDWARDS, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  So buying very much into this argument  that this is posturing, this is not where we end up, then, Jim.  But things  do seem to be escalating pretty quickly, don't they?  I mean, the market's  just getting its head around the $50 billion versus $50 billion --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS:  -- the two countries.  And then we get this announcement  overnight, that the Trump administration wants to investigate the  possibility of further tariffs on another $100 billion of Chinese imports.</p><p>I've got this chart, 7061, which shows that, actually, it would be very  difficult for China to match this toe-to-toe because of the scale of the  imbalance in deficit.  It would be difficult for China to find enough U.S.  imports to, then, match this.  So then it begs the question, how China then  retaliates.  What other tools do they have in their toolkit.</p><p>I mean, I wonder whether we need to get to a point where we've got a date  in the diary, an announcement of a meeting, some kind of firm commitment to  -- to negotiate something away from this posturing.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.  I think the negotiation is happening behind the scenes  anyway.  I don't think it necessarily needs President Xi to go to Mar-a- Lago for the two sides to be talking.  I think there is quite a lot of  conversation going on.</p><p>Having said that, it's not yet decisive and constructive conversation.  And  I think that's something that the market expects to develop over the next  few weeks.  You probably will see some sort of head-of-government-type  conversation between the U.S. and China.</p><p>But it's -- it needn't be imminent.  The conversations can happen.  The --  the concessions can be made at a lower level and get ratified later.  The  market thinks that's where it's going.</p><p>But, you know, it's so political.  If you look at what the Chines  retaliation was, you know, soybeans and pork.  That's aimed at the people  who elected Trump.  It's not aimed at the U.S. economy more broadly.  And  so it's highly politicized when you look at the specific targeting of  tariffs that's been suggested.</p><p>And I think that's the clue to what's really going on, that there is this  20 or 30 percent possibility that bluffs get called, things degenerate --</p><p>CEHIC:  Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  -- and that would be very bad for the market, and quite bad for  the economy.</p><p>CEHIC:  Yes.  And, Jim, you sort of advised to not really adjust your  portfolio based on that 20 to 30 percent probability.  But before we get to  there with what's happening now, we've seen a lot of equity volatility,  more volatility in equities than in other asset classes as we've --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p>CEHIC:  -- talked a lot about this week.  I just want to take you to a  chart which shows the relative performance of stocks versus bonds.  And  that has actually come down recently --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p>CEHIC:  -- you can see towards the end of the chart, it's coming up a  little bit.  In the scenario that we're in now, before we get to that 20 to  30 percent probability, how would you allocate?  Would you reduce your  exposure to equities, or not yet?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Probably not yet.  I think you're -- in U.S. equities, you  should be keeping up to wait (ph) because, you know, the U.S. equity market  is, in terms of average rating, it's now on about between 16 and 17 times  current-year earnings on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.</p><p>That's about in line with a long-term average, at a time when the  fundamental background is better than usual.  You know, you've got the  impact of the new tax code coming through.  You've got at least the late  stages of a synchronized global upturn.</p><p>It's actually pretty good conditions for profitability and for the equity  market.  That's why I nervously say, \"Stay up to wait,\" even in spite of  the possibility of some pretty nasty policy mistakes.</p><p>EDWARDS:  And -- and you don't attach a very high probability to those  policy mistakes, as Nejra was saying, then, Jim.  But do you have a handle  on what the end goal of the Trump administration is here?</p><p>I mean, is it about bringing down the deficit, as he talks about so often?   Is it about a decent performance in the midterms?  It seems that we need to  understand on what basis he will rate his own success, to understand where  this goes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  And he measures his success very clearly, by popularity on --  among his base.  And so what he wants to see, I suspect, is better job  picture for his base, rising wages for the middle of the country, for the  people that really elected him.  And I think that's his ultimate aim.</p><p>I think a lot of the anti-foreigner rhetoric is really just aimed at the  elements in that who are anti-foreigner.  And I think that, in a sense,  that's the noise around the fundamental economic aim, which is to try to  take away the decline, relatively speaking, in living standards among the - - basically the white working class.</p><p>CEHIC:  Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>EDWARDS:  Now, Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, still with  us here on-set in London.</p><p>Jim, let's dive into the U.S. economy.  We mentioned the job story.  What  do you expect to see today from the report, more broadly from the report?</p><p>I got a message overnight from Ben Emons at Intellectus Partners.  He talks  about how market activity, in his view, is starting to impact on economic  activity.  Do you see any early signs of that in the United States?  Or  it's way too soon?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  I think it's too soon.  What I see when we -- we at Principal  have a lot of contact with small- and mid-size businesses all over the U.S.   Morale is actually quite high.</p><p>There is a very strong feeling that federal regulation is getting less in  the way of small- and mid-size business.  And that's kind of away from the  political rhetoric and what's happening in the stock market.</p><p>So I think that that momentum is actually leading to a more positive, more  constructive approach to hiring by small- and mid-size business.  It's  interesting, Mr. Bostic was talking about inflation.  What we've seen is  that wage rates are actually rising in small, mid-size and growing  businesses more than they are in big companies and state and local  employment.</p><p>So I think you've already got a kind of leading indicator of job -- of --  of wage growth here, which I think is quite healthy for the underlying tone  of the U.S. economy.</p><p>CEHIC:  When it comes to wage growth, I was reading a note yesterday,  somebody saying, \"Look, payrolls are eventually going to pay.  That wage  growth that everyone's waiting for is going to come through.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, yesterday, we were talking about the fact that the U.S. sort of  jobs picture, the employment picture, looking like the 1960s.  We all know  what happened then.  Unemployment fell, inflation ratcheted up.</p><p>But this isn't really the '60s, is it, Chairman?  I mean, it's very  different globally.  We're a much more globalized world.  That's what's  keeping wages down.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  It's globalized.  It's also technology, Nejra --</p><p>CEHIC:  Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  -- that's the -- to me, that's the big difference from the  '60s, is the impact of e-commerce and of communication, the deflationary  impact of automation.</p><p>There's an enormous amount of deflation in the economy that's actually not  properly recorded in the inflation numbers.  So for example, where people  used to buy stuff from department stores, a big proportion of them now go  through e-commerce, primarily Amazon.</p><p>Why do they do that?  Because the prices are maybe 30 percent lower.  But  that's not recorded in the inflation numbers.  You have a very large outlet  substitution effect, meaning that there is more deflation around than the  reported inflation numbers suggest.</p><p>EDWARDS:  And a lot of price discover as well, and we --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS:  -- we -- yes.  We all know President Trump's views on Amazon.</p><p>Just on the subject of the U.S. economy more broadly, then, Jim, how does  this trade story stick to the Fed?  Because on the one had, you could argue  this gives the -- the Fed reason to pause, to assess what damage, if any,  is done or -- or benefit is achieved.</p><p>On the other hand, though, you could say tariffs put (ph) up inflation, and  therefore it forces the Fed to act more quickly.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yes, although that's not really inflation.  It's simply an  extra tax, which puts prices up but it's a relative price effect.  Tariffs  actually ultimately decrease inflation by decreasing economic activity.</p><p>So I think they'd be making a policy mistake if tariffs come in and they  say, \"Hey, inflation needs to be choked back by higher interest rates.\"   That could compound the felony (ph), actually, and make -- make the -- a --  a policy error on the interest rate front.</p><p>I -- I suspect if the Fed does four rate rises this year, they're probably  making a policy mistake.  I think they run the risk of getting yields into  a territory that will slow the economy.  And I don't think that has to  happen yet.  Even though unemployment is very low, the safety valve here is  increasing the labor force participation --</p><p>EDWARDS:  Yes.</p><p>CEHIC:  Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  -- we're seeing that happening quite consistently, and I think  that's a benign situation if they can keep on the current policy track.</p><p>CEHIC:  Indeed.  Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, stays  with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>EDWARDS:  Let's talk about tech, then.  Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal  Global Investors, is still with us.</p><p>And, Jim, we often talk about technology and its role on inflation.  And  you mentioned that in the previous half hour.  But let's talk about  regulatory risks.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Regulatory risk, specifically -- specifically around those  business models in technology that are funded by advertising and therefore  rely on data.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS:  How big a threat to these types of business is more regulation?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Oh.  I think that Facebook in particular is in an existential  threat.  You mentioned earlier, the 10 or 15 percent setback we've seen in  the stock price.  That seems to me like a modest setback compared with the  dangers they face, particularly on regulation.</p><p>EDWARDS:  So existential.  So this could really threaten the whole of what  we know as Facebook?  This could threaten the business model in its  entirety?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yes, it could.  Now what's happened with Facebook is, it's gone  -- two or three years ago, everybody loved them.  They were well- intentioned, they were positive.  There was -- the tech sector and Facebook  in particular were just extraordinarily popular.</p><p>Now with the stories around how they share data, with the use of data, with  the monopoly power that comes from being in so many parts of social media,  you have -- they're moving, to be honest, as unpopular as banks.</p><p>And, you know, I think that that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  I don't know about journalists.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  I wouldn't go there.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  A (ph) state agent?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  I wouldn't go there.  Yes, maybe.  But the point I'd make here  is, when that sort of political problem hits, regulators come after them.</p><p>How might that end up?  It might end up with regulation on (ph) use of  data.  The U.S. has a -- has a track record over the very long term, of  breaking up companies --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  -- that become too powerful.  I wouldn't rule that out on a  three-year view.  It's not going to happen under the current  administration.  But, you know, what happens in the midterms?  What happens  in the next presidential election?</p><p>You could well see a political situation where even a breakup of Facebook  is in -- is on the cards.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  So there is a lot of risk there.  I've been saying, \"Buy the  U.S. market on the dips.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  I'm not (ph) sure I'd buy Facebook on the dips.  I think I'd  probably go to others that don't have the specific --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  -- perils that they have.</p><p>CEHIC:  Yes.  I mean, and, Jim, tech stocks were a big part of the sell-off  and the volatility in the U.S. equity market generally, but you say we're  not looking at a bubble-like situation circa '99, it's more like early  1998.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p>CEHIC:  How?  What are the signs that you see there?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yes, the main one I would point to is that the stock market  rating got very high at late '99.  We got to 25 times our earnings on the  S&amp;P 500.</p><p>The reason I think we're still in a much -- in a less perilous situation is  that the average rating on the fundamentals is a lot lower at a time when  things are really pretty good for particularly American business.</p><p>So I -- I think that what would get me to a feeling that we were in late- '99 and in real peril in the market is one of two things.  It's either the  market going up a long way to get to that 25-times earnings-plus --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  -- or it's something that brings the next recession much  closer.  Now that could be tariffs.  The fashionable one six months ago is  it could be military hostility in Korea.  It could be an interruption of  oil supplies.  It could be credit problems.</p><p>You know, there's a lot of different things which are in that 20 or 30  percent probability of things going wrong.  The main one at the moment is  tariffs --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  -- but it's not the only one.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Volatile (ph) risks.  And some people have pointed to recent  appointments in -- in Washington, and when that changes --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS:  -- the percentages around some of the -- the possibility --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  That's right.</p><p>EDWARDS:  -- of military action.  In terms of the debate around technology,  then, Jim, so Facebook and business models such as that, perhaps, maybe  face regulatory risk.</p><p>What about hardware businesses that operate in technology?  We have numbers  out of Samsung overnight, supported by their chip business.  Are you more  interested in hardware stories around tech, or are you not loading up on  those either?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yeah, I'm not sure particularly a hardware story.  Because the  hardware is -- the -- the intrinsic value, the value to the consumer is  dependent on the software and the apps.</p><p>You know, Apple is very modestly rated and a very strong company.  I think  I'd rather have that than Facebook in the current market.  I might even  rather have Amazon, actually, even though the president appears to want to  get his claws into them.  Because I'm not sure there's really so much that  can be done about that.  They're in a more competitive market anyway.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They don't face an existential threat?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  I don't think they do, actually.  I don't see it yet.  So I do  think that my \"buy the dips\" on markets is a little bit qualified.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  And it -- you -- you have to look at companies that have  particular dangers at the moment, and the two that are being talked about  on this show are right here, Deutsche Bank and Facebook.</p><p>You also have to look at other markets.  Here's one place I go with the  equity market.  The rest of the world is more at peril from tariffs than  the U.S. is.  The U.S. is a massive, integrated domestic economy.</p><p>That's why I'm beginning to say, and have been beginning to say over the  last two or three months, \"Sell the international markets on strength\" as  opposed to continue to buy the dips on the U.S.  I think that the U.S. will  do better even with tariffs than many of the international markets.</p><p>CEHIC:  That's interesting.  I was going to ask you about Big Tech and  whether you were still positive on it, given that valuations in tech are  three times the broader market --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p>CEHIC:  -- so we may not be looking at 1999, but still the tech valuation's  that high.  But you've sort of answered the question with what you said  about Amazon.</p><p>But on what you said about global versus U.S., I want to show you this  chart, which is the VIX topping the European volatility gauge as trade  issues and the tech stock slump have played out.</p><p>And this is unusual, U.S. stocks being more volatile than their  counterparts in Europe. So the euro stocks, 50 volatility index.  The V  (ph) stocks.  Given that, you still think that you should be more positive  on the U.S. versus the rest of the world?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yes, I do.  I don't really buy the VIX as a measure of risk.   It's too volatile to be anything to do with fundamental risk.</p><p>CEHIC:  And these are normal volatility levels, historically, right?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Well, that's -- that's the point.  You know, the -- the  volatility, so far this year, looks high compared with where it's been over  most of the last decade.  What is it, 26 or 27 1 percent days so far this  year.  In the '80s and '90s, that wouldn't have been unusual.</p><p>Whereas in the current time, it's thought of as very unusual because the  last 10 years have been a period of moderation and of gradual upturn in  markets.</p><p>I think we probably, because of changes in market structure, just have to  get used to be a bit -- to a bit more day-to-day volatility.  I think that  that's not really making the market fundamentally more risky.</p><p>EDWARDS:  OK.  Jim, thank you very much for your thoughts so far.</p><p>Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors.  He stays with us here on  the program.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CEHIC:  And Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, is still with  us.</p><p>So, Jim, what's your view on Deutsche Bank and -- and German banks in  general?  And how they kind of fit into the broader European banking  picture.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  I think the thing I would add to Jan-Patrick's comments about  the succession at Deutsche Bank is, the ideal new person would also be  something of a change agent.  So it's an awful lot of things to ask for in  one chief executive.</p><p>Now, why do I say that?  If I look at the period when Deutsche Bank was  doing particularly well in market share terms, they were very aggressive.   They were aggressive on trading, they were aggressive on the investment  banking products they were offering.  So aggressive, quite highly  leveraged.</p><p>Secondly, if I look at European banks in general and Deutsche Bank by  extension, they're not well-capitalized.  The non-performing (ph) loans  were not dealt with after the crisis as effectively as they were in the  United States.</p><p>So I would think that the new chief executive, if there is a new one at  Deutsche Bank, will have to look very carefully at how to shrink some  activities, notably in the aggressive end of investment banking.</p><p>They don't really need to compete with Goldman as a global investment bank.   They need to be much more satisfying their base in Germany.  And also to  look at the capital situation.  So there's (ph) going to be some unpopular  things to do.</p><p>And I think it's a microcosm of the European banking picture.  You know,  there are strengths and weaknesses in the European economy.  One of the  weaknesses is, how will they create enough credit once growth gets going?   I don't see that at the moment and I think there is an issue there.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Would be a big task, then, for a new -- a new CEO in there, yes  (ph).  If they could speak German, I like the way Jan-Patrick said that  would be an added bonus, of course, as well.</p><p>So in terms of the underlying picture for the eurozone economy, then, Jim,  I've got a chart here that shows a couple of data points on the eurozone  economy that maybe have been ticking down.</p><p>In fact, this is on German factory orders, eurozone retail sales,  (INAUDIBLE) to inflation, to output numbers, as being a bit disappointing.   And blame a host of factors.  The weather, flu, even, the movement of  Easter, the stronger euro.  How concerned are you about data points that  disappoint a little bit or come in below estimate?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  I think they're symptomatic, Anna, of an economy that may not  be quite as robust as many people hoped.  And which may well not be in an - - such an escape velocity, self-sustaining recovery mode.</p><p>I think that, you know, Europe has done well.  There has been improved  sentiment, particularly in Germany.  The French election put the European  business sentiment on a much better course.  Monsieur Macron has been a --  a big asset to the European economy by being very pro-business.</p><p>But what's happening next?  You know, you're seeing recurrent resurgence of  populism, even in Germany.   You're seeing a very difficult outcome of the  Italian election.  Still not clear who will form a government.</p><p>So, you know, if you just (ph) look at the political situation in Europe,  it's deteriorating.  I would suggest that the European recovery is pretty  fragile, and I go back to the banks as one of the reasons for that being  the case.</p><p>CEHIC:  What does this mean for the bond markets, Jim?  Earlier you were  saying that you prefer U.S. equities over European.  If we look at the  Treasury-Bund spread, for example, does -- do Treasuries outperform?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  I think they probably do, relative to the Bunds.  Although I  don't -- I'm not one of those who think that -- that eurozone interest  rates are going up rapidly.</p><p>I think they're -- I think they're going to be pinned to zero for a while  because of this lack of sustainability about the recovery.  So I think  that, if anything, the -- the difference between U.S. and European rates  might edge up a little rather than -- rather than closing.</p><p>But eventually, there will be a convergence.  But it will really be very  dependent on economic conditions' demand for funds.  But at the moment, I  would actually be more bullish of the dollar.  And that's one of the  reasons why I am favoring U.S. investments rather than -- rather than  international.</p><p>EDWARDS:  That's interesting, Jim.  So you think you've got a -- a clear  idea of how further trade tension, if that's what we're in for, impacts the  dollar?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.  I think that trade tension, if it leads to recession,  which eventually it would do, then it will tend to lead to a push towards  safe harbors, which will include the dollar and U.S. Treasuries.</p><p>That may seem a little perverse since the U.S. basically seems to have  started these trade skirmishes, but I think they were started on a fairly  clear calculation, that if it all goes wrong, it hurts everybody else much  more than it hurts the U.S.</p><p>EDWARDS:  I remember the height of the financial crisis, lots of people  asked -- or at the start of it, lots of people asked if this kind of  started in the United States, how come we find safe harbor in -- in U.S.  assets?  That --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CEHIC:  Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS:  -- similar, again --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CEHIC:  -- still serve (ph) currency.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.  It's the reserve currency, which is a -- which is an  extraordinary privilege.  And, you know, I -- I do think that the openness  of foreign economies is one of the reasons they're vulnerable.  It's one of  the reasons they've grown, of course.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Yes.  All right, Jim.  Thank you so much for spending the last  hour with us --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN:  Thank you.</p><p>EDWARDS:  -- we appreciate it.

Joining us now is Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Great to see you, Jim, good morning to you --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JIM MCCAUGHAN, CEO, PRINCIPAL GLOBAL INVESTORS: Good morning. Great to be here.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes, thank you for giving us some of your time while you're in London. In terms of the risks around an escalation of a trade war, this is one of the sort of scenarios that you see as more of an outlier, among other things. A 20 to 30 percent probability of risk. How do you see this evolving?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Well, I think that the market consensus is actually, in this case, valid. Which is that the administration, President Trump in particular, are using the threat of tariffs as a bargaining counter in order to get other things.</p><p>It was very interesting, when the steel and aluminum tariffs were announced, what, three weeks ago or three or four weeks ago, you had the photo up in the Oval Office with the steelworkers.</p><p>You then went straight to Mr. Trump's comments, in which he walked back the tariffs almost immediately. He said, \"Canada and Mexico are our friends, we won't target them. And the Germans might get better treatment if they pay for their own defense.\"</p><p>So in other words, using the tariffs as a threat to actually get other agenda items. Now. My 20 or 30 percent probability is that others call his bluff, and we end -- we end up, by default, with a rather unintended trade war. But I don't think that's the course that they think they're on.</p><p>And I think that some of the more free trade-oriented heads within government -- you're talking to Larry Kudlow later in the day -- I think many of them would actually sympathize with the idea of using tariffs as a bargaining counter.</p><p>ANNA EDWARDS, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: So buying very much into this argument that this is posturing, this is not where we end up, then, Jim. But things do seem to be escalating pretty quickly, don't they? I mean, the market's just getting its head around the $50 billion versus $50 billion --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS: -- the two countries. And then we get this announcement overnight, that the Trump administration wants to investigate the possibility of further tariffs on another $100 billion of Chinese imports.</p><p>I've got this chart, 7061, which shows that, actually, it would be very difficult for China to match this toe-to-toe because of the scale of the imbalance in deficit. It would be difficult for China to find enough U.S. imports to, then, match this. So then it begs the question, how China then retaliates. What other tools do they have in their toolkit.</p><p>I mean, I wonder whether we need to get to a point where we've got a date in the diary, an announcement of a meeting, some kind of firm commitment to -- to negotiate something away from this posturing.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes. I think the negotiation is happening behind the scenes anyway. I don't think it necessarily needs President Xi to go to Mar-a- Lago for the two sides to be talking. I think there is quite a lot of conversation going on.</p><p>Having said that, it's not yet decisive and constructive conversation. And I think that's something that the market expects to develop over the next few weeks. You probably will see some sort of head-of-government-type conversation between the U.S. and China.</p><p>But it's -- it needn't be imminent. The conversations can happen. The -- the concessions can be made at a lower level and get ratified later. The market thinks that's where it's going.</p><p>But, you know, it's so political. If you look at what the Chines retaliation was, you know, soybeans and pork. That's aimed at the people who elected Trump. It's not aimed at the U.S. economy more broadly. And so it's highly politicized when you look at the specific targeting of tariffs that's been suggested.</p><p>And I think that's the clue to what's really going on, that there is this 20 or 30 percent possibility that bluffs get called, things degenerate --</p><p>CEHIC: Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS: Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: -- and that would be very bad for the market, and quite bad for the economy.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes. And, Jim, you sort of advised to not really adjust your portfolio based on that 20 to 30 percent probability. But before we get to there with what's happening now, we've seen a lot of equity volatility, more volatility in equities than in other asset classes as we've --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>CEHIC: -- talked a lot about this week. I just want to take you to a chart which shows the relative performance of stocks versus bonds. And that has actually come down recently --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>CEHIC: -- you can see towards the end of the chart, it's coming up a little bit. In the scenario that we're in now, before we get to that 20 to 30 percent probability, how would you allocate? Would you reduce your exposure to equities, or not yet?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Probably not yet. I think you're -- in U.S. equities, you should be keeping up to wait (ph) because, you know, the U.S. equity market is, in terms of average rating, it's now on about between 16 and 17 times current-year earnings on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.</p><p>That's about in line with a long-term average, at a time when the fundamental background is better than usual. You know, you've got the impact of the new tax code coming through. You've got at least the late stages of a synchronized global upturn.</p><p>It's actually pretty good conditions for profitability and for the equity market. That's why I nervously say, \"Stay up to wait,\" even in spite of the possibility of some pretty nasty policy mistakes.</p><p>EDWARDS: And -- and you don't attach a very high probability to those policy mistakes, as Nejra was saying, then, Jim. But do you have a handle on what the end goal of the Trump administration is here?</p><p>I mean, is it about bringing down the deficit, as he talks about so often? Is it about a decent performance in the midterms? It seems that we need to understand on what basis he will rate his own success, to understand where this goes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: And he measures his success very clearly, by popularity on -- among his base. And so what he wants to see, I suspect, is better job picture for his base, rising wages for the middle of the country, for the people that really elected him. And I think that's his ultimate aim.</p><p>I think a lot of the anti-foreigner rhetoric is really just aimed at the elements in that who are anti-foreigner. And I think that, in a sense, that's the noise around the fundamental economic aim, which is to try to take away the decline, relatively speaking, in living standards among the - - basically the white working class.</p><p>CEHIC: Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>EDWARDS: Now, Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, still with us here on-set in London.</p><p>Jim, let's dive into the U.S. economy. We mentioned the job story. What do you expect to see today from the report, more broadly from the report?</p><p>I got a message overnight from Ben Emons at Intellectus Partners. He talks about how market activity, in his view, is starting to impact on economic activity. Do you see any early signs of that in the United States? Or it's way too soon?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I think it's too soon. What I see when we -- we at Principal have a lot of contact with small- and mid-size businesses all over the U.S. Morale is actually quite high.</p><p>There is a very strong feeling that federal regulation is getting less in the way of small- and mid-size business. And that's kind of away from the political rhetoric and what's happening in the stock market.</p><p>So I think that that momentum is actually leading to a more positive, more constructive approach to hiring by small- and mid-size business. It's interesting, Mr. Bostic was talking about inflation. What we've seen is that wage rates are actually rising in small, mid-size and growing businesses more than they are in big companies and state and local employment.</p><p>So I think you've already got a kind of leading indicator of job -- of -- of wage growth here, which I think is quite healthy for the underlying tone of the U.S. economy.</p><p>CEHIC: When it comes to wage growth, I was reading a note yesterday, somebody saying, \"Look, payrolls are eventually going to pay. That wage growth that everyone's waiting for is going to come through.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, yesterday, we were talking about the fact that the U.S. sort of jobs picture, the employment picture, looking like the 1960s. We all know what happened then. Unemployment fell, inflation ratcheted up.</p><p>But this isn't really the '60s, is it, Chairman? I mean, it's very different globally. We're a much more globalized world. That's what's keeping wages down.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: It's globalized. It's also technology, Nejra --</p><p>CEHIC: Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: -- that's the -- to me, that's the big difference from the '60s, is the impact of e-commerce and of communication, the deflationary impact of automation.</p><p>There's an enormous amount of deflation in the economy that's actually not properly recorded in the inflation numbers. So for example, where people used to buy stuff from department stores, a big proportion of them now go through e-commerce, primarily Amazon.</p><p>Why do they do that? Because the prices are maybe 30 percent lower. But that's not recorded in the inflation numbers. You have a very large outlet substitution effect, meaning that there is more deflation around than the reported inflation numbers suggest.</p><p>EDWARDS: And a lot of price discover as well, and we --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS: -- we -- yes. We all know President Trump's views on Amazon.</p><p>Just on the subject of the U.S. economy more broadly, then, Jim, how does this trade story stick to the Fed? Because on the one had, you could argue this gives the -- the Fed reason to pause, to assess what damage, if any, is done or -- or benefit is achieved.</p><p>On the other hand, though, you could say tariffs put (ph) up inflation, and therefore it forces the Fed to act more quickly.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes, although that's not really inflation. It's simply an extra tax, which puts prices up but it's a relative price effect. Tariffs actually ultimately decrease inflation by decreasing economic activity.</p><p>So I think they'd be making a policy mistake if tariffs come in and they say, \"Hey, inflation needs to be choked back by higher interest rates.\" That could compound the felony (ph), actually, and make -- make the -- a -- a policy error on the interest rate front.</p><p>I -- I suspect if the Fed does four rate rises this year, they're probably making a policy mistake. I think they run the risk of getting yields into a territory that will slow the economy. And I don't think that has to happen yet. Even though unemployment is very low, the safety valve here is increasing the labor force participation --</p><p>EDWARDS: Yes.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: -- we're seeing that happening quite consistently, and I think that's a benign situation if they can keep on the current policy track.</p><p>CEHIC: Indeed. Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>EDWARDS: Let's talk about tech, then. Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, is still with us.</p><p>And, Jim, we often talk about technology and its role on inflation. And you mentioned that in the previous half hour. But let's talk about regulatory risks.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS: Regulatory risk, specifically -- specifically around those business models in technology that are funded by advertising and therefore rely on data.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS: How big a threat to these types of business is more regulation?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Oh. I think that Facebook in particular is in an existential threat. You mentioned earlier, the 10 or 15 percent setback we've seen in the stock price. That seems to me like a modest setback compared with the dangers they face, particularly on regulation.</p><p>EDWARDS: So existential. So this could really threaten the whole of what we know as Facebook? This could threaten the business model in its entirety?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes, it could. Now what's happened with Facebook is, it's gone -- two or three years ago, everybody loved them. They were well- intentioned, they were positive. There was -- the tech sector and Facebook in particular were just extraordinarily popular.</p><p>Now with the stories around how they share data, with the use of data, with the monopoly power that comes from being in so many parts of social media, you have -- they're moving, to be honest, as unpopular as banks.</p><p>And, you know, I think that that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I don't know about journalists.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I wouldn't go there.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A (ph) state agent?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I wouldn't go there. Yes, maybe. But the point I'd make here is, when that sort of political problem hits, regulators come after them.</p><p>How might that end up? It might end up with regulation on (ph) use of data. The U.S. has a -- has a track record over the very long term, of breaking up companies --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: -- that become too powerful. I wouldn't rule that out on a three-year view. It's not going to happen under the current administration. But, you know, what happens in the midterms? What happens in the next presidential election?</p><p>You could well see a political situation where even a breakup of Facebook is in -- is on the cards.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: So there is a lot of risk there. I've been saying, \"Buy the U.S. market on the dips.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I'm not (ph) sure I'd buy Facebook on the dips. I think I'd probably go to others that don't have the specific --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: -- perils that they have.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes. I mean, and, Jim, tech stocks were a big part of the sell-off and the volatility in the U.S. equity market generally, but you say we're not looking at a bubble-like situation circa '99, it's more like early 1998.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>CEHIC: How? What are the signs that you see there?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes, the main one I would point to is that the stock market rating got very high at late '99. We got to 25 times our earnings on the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>The reason I think we're still in a much -- in a less perilous situation is that the average rating on the fundamentals is a lot lower at a time when things are really pretty good for particularly American business.</p><p>So I -- I think that what would get me to a feeling that we were in late- '99 and in real peril in the market is one of two things. It's either the market going up a long way to get to that 25-times earnings-plus --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: -- or it's something that brings the next recession much closer. Now that could be tariffs. The fashionable one six months ago is it could be military hostility in Korea. It could be an interruption of oil supplies. It could be credit problems.</p><p>You know, there's a lot of different things which are in that 20 or 30 percent probability of things going wrong. The main one at the moment is tariffs --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: -- but it's not the only one.</p><p>EDWARDS: Volatile (ph) risks. And some people have pointed to recent appointments in -- in Washington, and when that changes --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS: -- the percentages around some of the -- the possibility --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: That's right.</p><p>EDWARDS: -- of military action. In terms of the debate around technology, then, Jim, so Facebook and business models such as that, perhaps, maybe face regulatory risk.</p><p>What about hardware businesses that operate in technology? We have numbers out of Samsung overnight, supported by their chip business. Are you more interested in hardware stories around tech, or are you not loading up on those either?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yeah, I'm not sure particularly a hardware story. Because the hardware is -- the -- the intrinsic value, the value to the consumer is dependent on the software and the apps.</p><p>You know, Apple is very modestly rated and a very strong company. I think I'd rather have that than Facebook in the current market. I might even rather have Amazon, actually, even though the president appears to want to get his claws into them. Because I'm not sure there's really so much that can be done about that. They're in a more competitive market anyway.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They don't face an existential threat?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I don't think they do, actually. I don't see it yet. So I do think that my \"buy the dips\" on markets is a little bit qualified.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: And it -- you -- you have to look at companies that have particular dangers at the moment, and the two that are being talked about on this show are right here, Deutsche Bank and Facebook.</p><p>You also have to look at other markets. Here's one place I go with the equity market. The rest of the world is more at peril from tariffs than the U.S. is. The U.S. is a massive, integrated domestic economy.</p><p>That's why I'm beginning to say, and have been beginning to say over the last two or three months, \"Sell the international markets on strength\" as opposed to continue to buy the dips on the U.S. I think that the U.S. will do better even with tariffs than many of the international markets.</p><p>CEHIC: That's interesting. I was going to ask you about Big Tech and whether you were still positive on it, given that valuations in tech are three times the broader market --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>CEHIC: -- so we may not be looking at 1999, but still the tech valuation's that high. But you've sort of answered the question with what you said about Amazon.</p><p>But on what you said about global versus U.S., I want to show you this chart, which is the VIX topping the European volatility gauge as trade issues and the tech stock slump have played out.</p><p>And this is unusual, U.S. stocks being more volatile than their counterparts in Europe. So the euro stocks, 50 volatility index. The V (ph) stocks. Given that, you still think that you should be more positive on the U.S. versus the rest of the world?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes, I do. I don't really buy the VIX as a measure of risk. It's too volatile to be anything to do with fundamental risk.</p><p>CEHIC: And these are normal volatility levels, historically, right?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Well, that's -- that's the point. You know, the -- the volatility, so far this year, looks high compared with where it's been over most of the last decade. What is it, 26 or 27 1 percent days so far this year. In the '80s and '90s, that wouldn't have been unusual.</p><p>Whereas in the current time, it's thought of as very unusual because the last 10 years have been a period of moderation and of gradual upturn in markets.</p><p>I think we probably, because of changes in market structure, just have to get used to be a bit -- to a bit more day-to-day volatility. I think that that's not really making the market fundamentally more risky.</p><p>EDWARDS: OK. Jim, thank you very much for your thoughts so far.</p><p>Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors. He stays with us here on the program.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CEHIC: And Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, is still with us.</p><p>So, Jim, what's your view on Deutsche Bank and -- and German banks in general? And how they kind of fit into the broader European banking picture.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I think the thing I would add to Jan-Patrick's comments about the succession at Deutsche Bank is, the ideal new person would also be something of a change agent. So it's an awful lot of things to ask for in one chief executive.</p><p>Now, why do I say that? If I look at the period when Deutsche Bank was doing particularly well in market share terms, they were very aggressive. They were aggressive on trading, they were aggressive on the investment banking products they were offering. So aggressive, quite highly leveraged.</p><p>Secondly, if I look at European banks in general and Deutsche Bank by extension, they're not well-capitalized. The non-performing (ph) loans were not dealt with after the crisis as effectively as they were in the United States.</p><p>So I would think that the new chief executive, if there is a new one at Deutsche Bank, will have to look very carefully at how to shrink some activities, notably in the aggressive end of investment banking.</p><p>They don't really need to compete with Goldman as a global investment bank. They need to be much more satisfying their base in Germany. And also to look at the capital situation. So there's (ph) going to be some unpopular things to do.</p><p>And I think it's a microcosm of the European banking picture. You know, there are strengths and weaknesses in the European economy. One of the weaknesses is, how will they create enough credit once growth gets going? I don't see that at the moment and I think there is an issue there.</p><p>EDWARDS: Would be a big task, then, for a new -- a new CEO in there, yes (ph). If they could speak German, I like the way Jan-Patrick said that would be an added bonus, of course, as well.</p><p>So in terms of the underlying picture for the eurozone economy, then, Jim, I've got a chart here that shows a couple of data points on the eurozone economy that maybe have been ticking down.</p><p>In fact, this is on German factory orders, eurozone retail sales, (INAUDIBLE) to inflation, to output numbers, as being a bit disappointing. And blame a host of factors. The weather, flu, even, the movement of Easter, the stronger euro. How concerned are you about data points that disappoint a little bit or come in below estimate?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I think they're symptomatic, Anna, of an economy that may not be quite as robust as many people hoped. And which may well not be in an - - such an escape velocity, self-sustaining recovery mode.</p><p>I think that, you know, Europe has done well. There has been improved sentiment, particularly in Germany. The French election put the European business sentiment on a much better course. Monsieur Macron has been a -- a big asset to the European economy by being very pro-business.</p><p>But what's happening next? You know, you're seeing recurrent resurgence of populism, even in Germany. You're seeing a very difficult outcome of the Italian election. Still not clear who will form a government.</p><p>So, you know, if you just (ph) look at the political situation in Europe, it's deteriorating. I would suggest that the European recovery is pretty fragile, and I go back to the banks as one of the reasons for that being the case.</p><p>CEHIC: What does this mean for the bond markets, Jim? Earlier you were saying that you prefer U.S. equities over European. If we look at the Treasury-Bund spread, for example, does -- do Treasuries outperform?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I think they probably do, relative to the Bunds. Although I don't -- I'm not one of those who think that -- that eurozone interest rates are going up rapidly.</p><p>I think they're -- I think they're going to be pinned to zero for a while because of this lack of sustainability about the recovery. So I think that, if anything, the -- the difference between U.S. and European rates might edge up a little rather than -- rather than closing.</p><p>But eventually, there will be a convergence. But it will really be very dependent on economic conditions' demand for funds. But at the moment, I would actually be more bullish of the dollar. And that's one of the reasons why I am favoring U.S. investments rather than -- rather than international.</p><p>EDWARDS: That's interesting, Jim. So you think you've got a -- a clear idea of how further trade tension, if that's what we're in for, impacts the dollar?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes. I think that trade tension, if it leads to recession, which eventually it would do, then it will tend to lead to a push towards safe harbors, which will include the dollar and U.S. Treasuries.</p><p>That may seem a little perverse since the U.S. basically seems to have started these trade skirmishes, but I think they were started on a fairly clear calculation, that if it all goes wrong, it hurts everybody else much more than it hurts the U.S.</p><p>EDWARDS: I remember the height of the financial crisis, lots of people asked -- or at the start of it, lots of people asked if this kind of started in the United States, how come we find safe harbor in -- in U.S. assets? That --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CEHIC: Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS: -- similar, again --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CEHIC: -- still serve (ph) currency.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes. It's the reserve currency, which is a -- which is an extraordinary privilege. And, you know, I -- I do think that the openness of foreign economies is one of the reasons they're vulnerable. It's one of the reasons they've grown, of course.</p><p>EDWARDS: Yes. All right, Jim. Thank you so much for spending the last hour with us --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Thank you.</p><p>EDWARDS: -- we appreciate it.

Joining us now is Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Great to see you, Jim, good morning to you --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> JIM MCCAUGHAN, CEO, PRINCIPAL GLOBAL INVESTORS:  Good morning.  Great to be  here.</p><p> CEHIC:  Yes, thank you for giving us some of your time while you're in  London.  In terms of the risks around an escalation of a trade war, this is  one of the sort of scenarios that you see as more of an outlier, among  other things.  A 20 to 30 percent probability of risk.  How do you see this  evolving?</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Well, I think that the market consensus is actually, in this  case, valid.  Which is that the administration, President Trump in  particular, are using the threat of tariffs as a bargaining counter in  order to get other things.</p><p> It was very interesting, when the steel and aluminum tariffs were  announced, what, three weeks ago or three or four weeks ago, you had the  photo up in the Oval Office with the steelworkers.</p><p> You then went straight to Mr. Trump's comments, in which he walked back the  tariffs almost immediately.  He said, \"Canada and Mexico are our friends,  we won't target them.  And the Germans might get better treatment if they  pay for their own defense.\"</p><p> So in other words, using the tariffs as a threat to actually get other  agenda items.  Now.  My 20 or 30 percent probability is that others call  his bluff, and we end -- we end up, by default, with a rather unintended  trade war.  But I don't think that's the course that they think they're on.</p><p> And I think that some of the more free trade-oriented heads within  government -- you're talking to Larry Kudlow later in the day -- I think  many of them would actually sympathize with the idea of using tariffs as a  bargaining counter.</p><p> ANNA EDWARDS, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  So buying very much into this argument  that this is posturing, this is not where we end up, then, Jim.  But things  do seem to be escalating pretty quickly, don't they?  I mean, the market's  just getting its head around the $50 billion versus $50 billion --</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p> EDWARDS:  -- the two countries.  And then we get this announcement  overnight, that the Trump administration wants to investigate the  possibility of further tariffs on another $100 billion of Chinese imports.</p><p> I've got this chart, 7061, which shows that, actually, it would be very  difficult for China to match this toe-to-toe because of the scale of the  imbalance in deficit.  It would be difficult for China to find enough U.S.  imports to, then, match this.  So then it begs the question, how China then  retaliates.  What other tools do they have in their toolkit.</p><p> I mean, I wonder whether we need to get to a point where we've got a date  in the diary, an announcement of a meeting, some kind of firm commitment to  -- to negotiate something away from this posturing.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.  I think the negotiation is happening behind the scenes  anyway.  I don't think it necessarily needs President Xi to go to Mar-a- Lago for the two sides to be talking.  I think there is quite a lot of  conversation going on.</p><p> Having said that, it's not yet decisive and constructive conversation.  And  I think that's something that the market expects to develop over the next  few weeks.  You probably will see some sort of head-of-government-type  conversation between the U.S. and China.</p><p> But it's -- it needn't be imminent.  The conversations can happen.  The --  the concessions can be made at a lower level and get ratified later.  The  market thinks that's where it's going.</p><p> But, you know, it's so political.  If you look at what the Chines  retaliation was, you know, soybeans and pork.  That's aimed at the people  who elected Trump.  It's not aimed at the U.S. economy more broadly.  And  so it's highly politicized when you look at the specific targeting of  tariffs that's been suggested.</p><p> And I think that's the clue to what's really going on, that there is this  20 or 30 percent possibility that bluffs get called, things degenerate --</p><p> CEHIC:  Yes.</p><p> EDWARDS:  Yes.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  -- and that would be very bad for the market, and quite bad for  the economy.</p><p> CEHIC:  Yes.  And, Jim, you sort of advised to not really adjust your  portfolio based on that 20 to 30 percent probability.  But before we get to  there with what's happening now, we've seen a lot of equity volatility,  more volatility in equities than in other asset classes as we've --</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p> CEHIC:  -- talked a lot about this week.  I just want to take you to a  chart which shows the relative performance of stocks versus bonds.  And  that has actually come down recently --</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p> CEHIC:  -- you can see towards the end of the chart, it's coming up a  little bit.  In the scenario that we're in now, before we get to that 20 to  30 percent probability, how would you allocate?  Would you reduce your  exposure to equities, or not yet?</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Probably not yet.  I think you're -- in U.S. equities, you  should be keeping up to wait (ph) because, you know, the U.S. equity market  is, in terms of average rating, it's now on about between 16 and 17 times  current-year earnings on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.</p><p> That's about in line with a long-term average, at a time when the  fundamental background is better than usual.  You know, you've got the  impact of the new tax code coming through.  You've got at least the late  stages of a synchronized global upturn.</p><p> It's actually pretty good conditions for profitability and for the equity  market.  That's why I nervously say, \"Stay up to wait,\" even in spite of  the possibility of some pretty nasty policy mistakes.</p><p> EDWARDS:  And -- and you don't attach a very high probability to those  policy mistakes, as Nejra was saying, then, Jim.  But do you have a handle  on what the end goal of the Trump administration is here?</p><p> I mean, is it about bringing down the deficit, as he talks about so often?   Is it about a decent performance in the midterms?  It seems that we need to  understand on what basis he will rate his own success, to understand where  this goes.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  And he measures his success very clearly, by popularity on --  among his base.  And so what he wants to see, I suspect, is better job  picture for his base, rising wages for the middle of the country, for the  people that really elected him.  And I think that's his ultimate aim.</p><p> I think a lot of the anti-foreigner rhetoric is really just aimed at the  elements in that who are anti-foreigner.  And I think that, in a sense,  that's the noise around the fundamental economic aim, which is to try to  take away the decline, relatively speaking, in living standards among the - - basically the white working class.</p><p> CEHIC:  Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, stays with us.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> EDWARDS:  Now, Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, still with  us here on-set in London.</p><p> Jim, let's dive into the U.S. economy.  We mentioned the job story.  What  do you expect to see today from the report, more broadly from the report?</p><p> I got a message overnight from Ben Emons at Intellectus Partners.  He talks  about how market activity, in his view, is starting to impact on economic  activity.  Do you see any early signs of that in the United States?  Or  it's way too soon?</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  I think it's too soon.  What I see when we -- we at Principal  have a lot of contact with small- and mid-size businesses all over the U.S.   Morale is actually quite high.</p><p> There is a very strong feeling that federal regulation is getting less in  the way of small- and mid-size business.  And that's kind of away from the  political rhetoric and what's happening in the stock market.</p><p> So I think that that momentum is actually leading to a more positive, more  constructive approach to hiring by small- and mid-size business.  It's  interesting, Mr. Bostic was talking about inflation.  What we've seen is  that wage rates are actually rising in small, mid-size and growing  businesses more than they are in big companies and state and local  employment.</p><p> So I think you've already got a kind of leading indicator of job -- of --  of wage growth here, which I think is quite healthy for the underlying tone  of the U.S. economy.</p><p> CEHIC:  When it comes to wage growth, I was reading a note yesterday,  somebody saying, \"Look, payrolls are eventually going to pay.  That wage  growth that everyone's waiting for is going to come through.\"</p><p> Meanwhile, yesterday, we were talking about the fact that the U.S. sort of  jobs picture, the employment picture, looking like the 1960s.  We all know  what happened then.  Unemployment fell, inflation ratcheted up.</p><p> But this isn't really the '60s, is it, Chairman?  I mean, it's very  different globally.  We're a much more globalized world.  That's what's  keeping wages down.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  It's globalized.  It's also technology, Nejra --</p><p> CEHIC:  Yes.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  -- that's the -- to me, that's the big difference from the  '60s, is the impact of e-commerce and of communication, the deflationary  impact of automation.</p><p> There's an enormous amount of deflation in the economy that's actually not  properly recorded in the inflation numbers.  So for example, where people  used to buy stuff from department stores, a big proportion of them now go  through e-commerce, primarily Amazon.</p><p> Why do they do that?  Because the prices are maybe 30 percent lower.  But  that's not recorded in the inflation numbers.  You have a very large outlet  substitution effect, meaning that there is more deflation around than the  reported inflation numbers suggest.</p><p> EDWARDS:  And a lot of price discover as well, and we --</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p> EDWARDS:  -- we -- yes.  We all know President Trump's views on Amazon.</p><p> Just on the subject of the U.S. economy more broadly, then, Jim, how does  this trade story stick to the Fed?  Because on the one had, you could argue  this gives the -- the Fed reason to pause, to assess what damage, if any,  is done or -- or benefit is achieved.</p><p> On the other hand, though, you could say tariffs put (ph) up inflation, and  therefore it forces the Fed to act more quickly.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yes, although that's not really inflation.  It's simply an  extra tax, which puts prices up but it's a relative price effect.  Tariffs  actually ultimately decrease inflation by decreasing economic activity.</p><p> So I think they'd be making a policy mistake if tariffs come in and they  say, \"Hey, inflation needs to be choked back by higher interest rates.\"   That could compound the felony (ph), actually, and make -- make the -- a --  a policy error on the interest rate front.</p><p> I -- I suspect if the Fed does four rate rises this year, they're probably  making a policy mistake.  I think they run the risk of getting yields into  a territory that will slow the economy.  And I don't think that has to  happen yet.  Even though unemployment is very low, the safety valve here is  increasing the labor force participation --</p><p> EDWARDS:  Yes.</p><p> CEHIC:  Yes.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  -- we're seeing that happening quite consistently, and I think  that's a benign situation if they can keep on the current policy track.</p><p> CEHIC:  Indeed.  Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, stays  with us.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> EDWARDS:  Let's talk about tech, then.  Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal  Global Investors, is still with us.</p><p> And, Jim, we often talk about technology and its role on inflation.  And  you mentioned that in the previous half hour.  But let's talk about  regulatory risks.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p> EDWARDS:  Regulatory risk, specifically -- specifically around those  business models in technology that are funded by advertising and therefore  rely on data.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p> EDWARDS:  How big a threat to these types of business is more regulation?</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Oh.  I think that Facebook in particular is in an existential  threat.  You mentioned earlier, the 10 or 15 percent setback we've seen in  the stock price.  That seems to me like a modest setback compared with the  dangers they face, particularly on regulation.</p><p> EDWARDS:  So existential.  So this could really threaten the whole of what  we know as Facebook?  This could threaten the business model in its  entirety?</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yes, it could.  Now what's happened with Facebook is, it's gone  -- two or three years ago, everybody loved them.  They were well- intentioned, they were positive.  There was -- the tech sector and Facebook  in particular were just extraordinarily popular.</p><p> Now with the stories around how they share data, with the use of data, with  the monopoly power that comes from being in so many parts of social media,  you have -- they're moving, to be honest, as unpopular as banks.</p><p> And, you know, I think that that --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  I don't know about journalists.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  I wouldn't go there.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  A (ph) state agent?</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  I wouldn't go there.  Yes, maybe.  But the point I'd make here  is, when that sort of political problem hits, regulators come after them.</p><p> How might that end up?  It might end up with regulation on (ph) use of  data.  The U.S. has a -- has a track record over the very long term, of  breaking up companies --</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  -- that become too powerful.  I wouldn't rule that out on a  three-year view.  It's not going to happen under the current  administration.  But, you know, what happens in the midterms?  What happens  in the next presidential election?</p><p> You could well see a political situation where even a breakup of Facebook  is in -- is on the cards.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  So there is a lot of risk there.  I've been saying, \"Buy the  U.S. market on the dips.\"</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  I'm not (ph) sure I'd buy Facebook on the dips.  I think I'd  probably go to others that don't have the specific --</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  -- perils that they have.</p><p> CEHIC:  Yes.  I mean, and, Jim, tech stocks were a big part of the sell-off  and the volatility in the U.S. equity market generally, but you say we're  not looking at a bubble-like situation circa '99, it's more like early  1998.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p> CEHIC:  How?  What are the signs that you see there?</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yes, the main one I would point to is that the stock market  rating got very high at late '99.  We got to 25 times our earnings on the  S&amp;P 500.</p><p> The reason I think we're still in a much -- in a less perilous situation is  that the average rating on the fundamentals is a lot lower at a time when  things are really pretty good for particularly American business.</p><p> So I -- I think that what would get me to a feeling that we were in late- '99 and in real peril in the market is one of two things.  It's either the  market going up a long way to get to that 25-times earnings-plus --</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  -- or it's something that brings the next recession much  closer.  Now that could be tariffs.  The fashionable one six months ago is  it could be military hostility in Korea.  It could be an interruption of  oil supplies.  It could be credit problems.</p><p> You know, there's a lot of different things which are in that 20 or 30  percent probability of things going wrong.  The main one at the moment is  tariffs --</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  -- but it's not the only one.</p><p> EDWARDS:  Volatile (ph) risks.  And some people have pointed to recent  appointments in -- in Washington, and when that changes --</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p> EDWARDS:  -- the percentages around some of the -- the possibility --</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  That's right.</p><p> EDWARDS:  -- of military action.  In terms of the debate around technology,  then, Jim, so Facebook and business models such as that, perhaps, maybe  face regulatory risk.</p><p> What about hardware businesses that operate in technology?  We have numbers  out of Samsung overnight, supported by their chip business.  Are you more  interested in hardware stories around tech, or are you not loading up on  those either?</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yeah, I'm not sure particularly a hardware story.  Because the  hardware is -- the -- the intrinsic value, the value to the consumer is  dependent on the software and the apps.</p><p> You know, Apple is very modestly rated and a very strong company.  I think  I'd rather have that than Facebook in the current market.  I might even  rather have Amazon, actually, even though the president appears to want to  get his claws into them.  Because I'm not sure there's really so much that  can be done about that.  They're in a more competitive market anyway.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They don't face an existential threat?</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  I don't think they do, actually.  I don't see it yet.  So I do  think that my \"buy the dips\" on markets is a little bit qualified.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  And it -- you -- you have to look at companies that have  particular dangers at the moment, and the two that are being talked about  on this show are right here, Deutsche Bank and Facebook.</p><p> You also have to look at other markets.  Here's one place I go with the  equity market.  The rest of the world is more at peril from tariffs than  the U.S. is.  The U.S. is a massive, integrated domestic economy.</p><p> That's why I'm beginning to say, and have been beginning to say over the  last two or three months, \"Sell the international markets on strength\" as  opposed to continue to buy the dips on the U.S.  I think that the U.S. will  do better even with tariffs than many of the international markets.</p><p> CEHIC:  That's interesting.  I was going to ask you about Big Tech and  whether you were still positive on it, given that valuations in tech are  three times the broader market --</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p> CEHIC:  -- so we may not be looking at 1999, but still the tech valuation's  that high.  But you've sort of answered the question with what you said  about Amazon.</p><p> But on what you said about global versus U.S., I want to show you this  chart, which is the VIX topping the European volatility gauge as trade  issues and the tech stock slump have played out.</p><p> And this is unusual, U.S. stocks being more volatile than their  counterparts in Europe. So the euro stocks, 50 volatility index.  The V  (ph) stocks.  Given that, you still think that you should be more positive  on the U.S. versus the rest of the world?</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yes, I do.  I don't really buy the VIX as a measure of risk.   It's too volatile to be anything to do with fundamental risk.</p><p> CEHIC:  And these are normal volatility levels, historically, right?</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Well, that's -- that's the point.  You know, the -- the  volatility, so far this year, looks high compared with where it's been over  most of the last decade.  What is it, 26 or 27 1 percent days so far this  year.  In the '80s and '90s, that wouldn't have been unusual.</p><p> Whereas in the current time, it's thought of as very unusual because the  last 10 years have been a period of moderation and of gradual upturn in  markets.</p><p> I think we probably, because of changes in market structure, just have to  get used to be a bit -- to a bit more day-to-day volatility.  I think that  that's not really making the market fundamentally more risky.</p><p> EDWARDS:  OK.  Jim, thank you very much for your thoughts so far.</p><p> Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors.  He stays with us here on  the program.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> CEHIC:  And Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, is still with  us.</p><p> So, Jim, what's your view on Deutsche Bank and -- and German banks in  general?  And how they kind of fit into the broader European banking  picture.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  I think the thing I would add to Jan-Patrick's comments about  the succession at Deutsche Bank is, the ideal new person would also be  something of a change agent.  So it's an awful lot of things to ask for in  one chief executive.</p><p> Now, why do I say that?  If I look at the period when Deutsche Bank was  doing particularly well in market share terms, they were very aggressive.   They were aggressive on trading, they were aggressive on the investment  banking products they were offering.  So aggressive, quite highly  leveraged.</p><p> Secondly, if I look at European banks in general and Deutsche Bank by  extension, they're not well-capitalized.  The non-performing (ph) loans  were not dealt with after the crisis as effectively as they were in the  United States.</p><p> So I would think that the new chief executive, if there is a new one at  Deutsche Bank, will have to look very carefully at how to shrink some  activities, notably in the aggressive end of investment banking.</p><p> They don't really need to compete with Goldman as a global investment bank.   They need to be much more satisfying their base in Germany.  And also to  look at the capital situation.  So there's (ph) going to be some unpopular  things to do.</p><p> And I think it's a microcosm of the European banking picture.  You know,  there are strengths and weaknesses in the European economy.  One of the  weaknesses is, how will they create enough credit once growth gets going?   I don't see that at the moment and I think there is an issue there.</p><p> EDWARDS:  Would be a big task, then, for a new -- a new CEO in there, yes  (ph).  If they could speak German, I like the way Jan-Patrick said that  would be an added bonus, of course, as well.</p><p> So in terms of the underlying picture for the eurozone economy, then, Jim,  I've got a chart here that shows a couple of data points on the eurozone  economy that maybe have been ticking down.</p><p> In fact, this is on German factory orders, eurozone retail sales,  (INAUDIBLE) to inflation, to output numbers, as being a bit disappointing.   And blame a host of factors.  The weather, flu, even, the movement of  Easter, the stronger euro.  How concerned are you about data points that  disappoint a little bit or come in below estimate?</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  I think they're symptomatic, Anna, of an economy that may not  be quite as robust as many people hoped.  And which may well not be in an - - such an escape velocity, self-sustaining recovery mode.</p><p> I think that, you know, Europe has done well.  There has been improved  sentiment, particularly in Germany.  The French election put the European  business sentiment on a much better course.  Monsieur Macron has been a --  a big asset to the European economy by being very pro-business.</p><p> But what's happening next?  You know, you're seeing recurrent resurgence of  populism, even in Germany.   You're seeing a very difficult outcome of the  Italian election.  Still not clear who will form a government.</p><p> So, you know, if you just (ph) look at the political situation in Europe,  it's deteriorating.  I would suggest that the European recovery is pretty  fragile, and I go back to the banks as one of the reasons for that being  the case.</p><p> CEHIC:  What does this mean for the bond markets, Jim?  Earlier you were  saying that you prefer U.S. equities over European.  If we look at the  Treasury-Bund spread, for example, does -- do Treasuries outperform?</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  I think they probably do, relative to the Bunds.  Although I  don't -- I'm not one of those who think that -- that eurozone interest  rates are going up rapidly.</p><p> I think they're -- I think they're going to be pinned to zero for a while  because of this lack of sustainability about the recovery.  So I think  that, if anything, the -- the difference between U.S. and European rates  might edge up a little rather than -- rather than closing.</p><p> But eventually, there will be a convergence.  But it will really be very  dependent on economic conditions' demand for funds.  But at the moment, I  would actually be more bullish of the dollar.  And that's one of the  reasons why I am favoring U.S. investments rather than -- rather than  international.</p><p> EDWARDS:  That's interesting, Jim.  So you think you've got a -- a clear  idea of how further trade tension, if that's what we're in for, impacts the  dollar?</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.  I think that trade tension, if it leads to recession,  which eventually it would do, then it will tend to lead to a push towards  safe harbors, which will include the dollar and U.S. Treasuries.</p><p> That may seem a little perverse since the U.S. basically seems to have  started these trade skirmishes, but I think they were started on a fairly  clear calculation, that if it all goes wrong, it hurts everybody else much  more than it hurts the U.S.</p><p> EDWARDS:  I remember the height of the financial crisis, lots of people  asked -- or at the start of it, lots of people asked if this kind of  started in the United States, how come we find safe harbor in -- in U.S.  assets?  That --</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CEHIC:  Yes.</p><p> EDWARDS:  -- similar, again --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CEHIC:  -- still serve (ph) currency.</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Yes.  It's the reserve currency, which is a -- which is an  extraordinary privilege.  And, you know, I -- I do think that the openness  of foreign economies is one of the reasons they're vulnerable.  It's one of  the reasons they've grown, of course.</p><p> EDWARDS:  Yes.  All right, Jim.  Thank you so much for spending the last  hour with us --</p><p> MCCAUGHAN:  Thank you.</p><p> EDWARDS:  -- we appreciate it.

Joining us now is Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Great to see you, Jim, good morning to you --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JIM MCCAUGHAN, CEO, PRINCIPAL GLOBAL INVESTORS: Good morning. Great to be here.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes, thank you for giving us some of your time while you're in London. In terms of the risks around an escalation of a trade war, this is one of the sort of scenarios that you see as more of an outlier, among other things. A 20 to 30 percent probability of risk. How do you see this evolving?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Well, I think that the market consensus is actually, in this case, valid. Which is that the administration, President Trump in particular, are using the threat of tariffs as a bargaining counter in order to get other things.</p><p>It was very interesting, when the steel and aluminum tariffs were announced, what, three weeks ago or three or four weeks ago, you had the photo up in the Oval Office with the steelworkers.</p><p>You then went straight to Mr. Trump's comments, in which he walked back the tariffs almost immediately. He said, \"Canada and Mexico are our friends, we won't target them. And the Germans might get better treatment if they pay for their own defense.\"</p><p>So in other words, using the tariffs as a threat to actually get other agenda items. Now. My 20 or 30 percent probability is that others call his bluff, and we end -- we end up, by default, with a rather unintended trade war. But I don't think that's the course that they think they're on.</p><p>And I think that some of the more free trade-oriented heads within government -- you're talking to Larry Kudlow later in the day -- I think many of them would actually sympathize with the idea of using tariffs as a bargaining counter.</p><p>ANNA EDWARDS, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: So buying very much into this argument that this is posturing, this is not where we end up, then, Jim. But things do seem to be escalating pretty quickly, don't they? I mean, the market's just getting its head around the $50 billion versus $50 billion --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS: -- the two countries. And then we get this announcement overnight, that the Trump administration wants to investigate the possibility of further tariffs on another $100 billion of Chinese imports.</p><p>I've got this chart, 7061, which shows that, actually, it would be very difficult for China to match this toe-to-toe because of the scale of the imbalance in deficit. It would be difficult for China to find enough U.S. imports to, then, match this. So then it begs the question, how China then retaliates. What other tools do they have in their toolkit.</p><p>I mean, I wonder whether we need to get to a point where we've got a date in the diary, an announcement of a meeting, some kind of firm commitment to -- to negotiate something away from this posturing.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes. I think the negotiation is happening behind the scenes anyway. I don't think it necessarily needs President Xi to go to Mar-a- Lago for the two sides to be talking. I think there is quite a lot of conversation going on.</p><p>Having said that, it's not yet decisive and constructive conversation. And I think that's something that the market expects to develop over the next few weeks. You probably will see some sort of head-of-government-type conversation between the U.S. and China.</p><p>But it's -- it needn't be imminent. The conversations can happen. The -- the concessions can be made at a lower level and get ratified later. The market thinks that's where it's going.</p><p>But, you know, it's so political. If you look at what the Chines retaliation was, you know, soybeans and pork. That's aimed at the people who elected Trump. It's not aimed at the U.S. economy more broadly. And so it's highly politicized when you look at the specific targeting of tariffs that's been suggested.</p><p>And I think that's the clue to what's really going on, that there is this 20 or 30 percent possibility that bluffs get called, things degenerate --</p><p>CEHIC: Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS: Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: -- and that would be very bad for the market, and quite bad for the economy.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes. And, Jim, you sort of advised to not really adjust your portfolio based on that 20 to 30 percent probability. But before we get to there with what's happening now, we've seen a lot of equity volatility, more volatility in equities than in other asset classes as we've --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>CEHIC: -- talked a lot about this week. I just want to take you to a chart which shows the relative performance of stocks versus bonds. And that has actually come down recently --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>CEHIC: -- you can see towards the end of the chart, it's coming up a little bit. In the scenario that we're in now, before we get to that 20 to 30 percent probability, how would you allocate? Would you reduce your exposure to equities, or not yet?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Probably not yet. I think you're -- in U.S. equities, you should be keeping up to wait (ph) because, you know, the U.S. equity market is, in terms of average rating, it's now on about between 16 and 17 times current-year earnings on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.</p><p>That's about in line with a long-term average, at a time when the fundamental background is better than usual. You know, you've got the impact of the new tax code coming through. You've got at least the late stages of a synchronized global upturn.</p><p>It's actually pretty good conditions for profitability and for the equity market. That's why I nervously say, \"Stay up to wait,\" even in spite of the possibility of some pretty nasty policy mistakes.</p><p>EDWARDS: And -- and you don't attach a very high probability to those policy mistakes, as Nejra was saying, then, Jim. But do you have a handle on what the end goal of the Trump administration is here?</p><p>I mean, is it about bringing down the deficit, as he talks about so often? Is it about a decent performance in the midterms? It seems that we need to understand on what basis he will rate his own success, to understand where this goes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: And he measures his success very clearly, by popularity on -- among his base. And so what he wants to see, I suspect, is better job picture for his base, rising wages for the middle of the country, for the people that really elected him. And I think that's his ultimate aim.</p><p>I think a lot of the anti-foreigner rhetoric is really just aimed at the elements in that who are anti-foreigner. And I think that, in a sense, that's the noise around the fundamental economic aim, which is to try to take away the decline, relatively speaking, in living standards among the - - basically the white working class.</p><p>CEHIC: Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>EDWARDS: Now, Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, still with us here on-set in London.</p><p>Jim, let's dive into the U.S. economy. We mentioned the job story. What do you expect to see today from the report, more broadly from the report?</p><p>I got a message overnight from Ben Emons at Intellectus Partners. He talks about how market activity, in his view, is starting to impact on economic activity. Do you see any early signs of that in the United States? Or it's way too soon?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I think it's too soon. What I see when we -- we at Principal have a lot of contact with small- and mid-size businesses all over the U.S. Morale is actually quite high.</p><p>There is a very strong feeling that federal regulation is getting less in the way of small- and mid-size business. And that's kind of away from the political rhetoric and what's happening in the stock market.</p><p>So I think that that momentum is actually leading to a more positive, more constructive approach to hiring by small- and mid-size business. It's interesting, Mr. Bostic was talking about inflation. What we've seen is that wage rates are actually rising in small, mid-size and growing businesses more than they are in big companies and state and local employment.</p><p>So I think you've already got a kind of leading indicator of job -- of -- of wage growth here, which I think is quite healthy for the underlying tone of the U.S. economy.</p><p>CEHIC: When it comes to wage growth, I was reading a note yesterday, somebody saying, \"Look, payrolls are eventually going to pay. That wage growth that everyone's waiting for is going to come through.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, yesterday, we were talking about the fact that the U.S. sort of jobs picture, the employment picture, looking like the 1960s. We all know what happened then. Unemployment fell, inflation ratcheted up.</p><p>But this isn't really the '60s, is it, Chairman? I mean, it's very different globally. We're a much more globalized world. That's what's keeping wages down.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: It's globalized. It's also technology, Nejra --</p><p>CEHIC: Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: -- that's the -- to me, that's the big difference from the '60s, is the impact of e-commerce and of communication, the deflationary impact of automation.</p><p>There's an enormous amount of deflation in the economy that's actually not properly recorded in the inflation numbers. So for example, where people used to buy stuff from department stores, a big proportion of them now go through e-commerce, primarily Amazon.</p><p>Why do they do that? Because the prices are maybe 30 percent lower. But that's not recorded in the inflation numbers. You have a very large outlet substitution effect, meaning that there is more deflation around than the reported inflation numbers suggest.</p><p>EDWARDS: And a lot of price discover as well, and we --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS: -- we -- yes. We all know President Trump's views on Amazon.</p><p>Just on the subject of the U.S. economy more broadly, then, Jim, how does this trade story stick to the Fed? Because on the one had, you could argue this gives the -- the Fed reason to pause, to assess what damage, if any, is done or -- or benefit is achieved.</p><p>On the other hand, though, you could say tariffs put (ph) up inflation, and therefore it forces the Fed to act more quickly.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes, although that's not really inflation. It's simply an extra tax, which puts prices up but it's a relative price effect. Tariffs actually ultimately decrease inflation by decreasing economic activity.</p><p>So I think they'd be making a policy mistake if tariffs come in and they say, \"Hey, inflation needs to be choked back by higher interest rates.\" That could compound the felony (ph), actually, and make -- make the -- a -- a policy error on the interest rate front.</p><p>I -- I suspect if the Fed does four rate rises this year, they're probably making a policy mistake. I think they run the risk of getting yields into a territory that will slow the economy. And I don't think that has to happen yet. Even though unemployment is very low, the safety valve here is increasing the labor force participation --</p><p>EDWARDS: Yes.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: -- we're seeing that happening quite consistently, and I think that's a benign situation if they can keep on the current policy track.</p><p>CEHIC: Indeed. Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>EDWARDS: Let's talk about tech, then. Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, is still with us.</p><p>And, Jim, we often talk about technology and its role on inflation. And you mentioned that in the previous half hour. But let's talk about regulatory risks.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS: Regulatory risk, specifically -- specifically around those business models in technology that are funded by advertising and therefore rely on data.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS: How big a threat to these types of business is more regulation?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Oh. I think that Facebook in particular is in an existential threat. You mentioned earlier, the 10 or 15 percent setback we've seen in the stock price. That seems to me like a modest setback compared with the dangers they face, particularly on regulation.</p><p>EDWARDS: So existential. So this could really threaten the whole of what we know as Facebook? This could threaten the business model in its entirety?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes, it could. Now what's happened with Facebook is, it's gone -- two or three years ago, everybody loved them. They were well- intentioned, they were positive. There was -- the tech sector and Facebook in particular were just extraordinarily popular.</p><p>Now with the stories around how they share data, with the use of data, with the monopoly power that comes from being in so many parts of social media, you have -- they're moving, to be honest, as unpopular as banks.</p><p>And, you know, I think that that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I don't know about journalists.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I wouldn't go there.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A (ph) state agent?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I wouldn't go there. Yes, maybe. But the point I'd make here is, when that sort of political problem hits, regulators come after them.</p><p>How might that end up? It might end up with regulation on (ph) use of data. The U.S. has a -- has a track record over the very long term, of breaking up companies --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: -- that become too powerful. I wouldn't rule that out on a three-year view. It's not going to happen under the current administration. But, you know, what happens in the midterms? What happens in the next presidential election?</p><p>You could well see a political situation where even a breakup of Facebook is in -- is on the cards.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: So there is a lot of risk there. I've been saying, \"Buy the U.S. market on the dips.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I'm not (ph) sure I'd buy Facebook on the dips. I think I'd probably go to others that don't have the specific --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: -- perils that they have.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes. I mean, and, Jim, tech stocks were a big part of the sell-off and the volatility in the U.S. equity market generally, but you say we're not looking at a bubble-like situation circa '99, it's more like early 1998.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>CEHIC: How? What are the signs that you see there?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes, the main one I would point to is that the stock market rating got very high at late '99. We got to 25 times our earnings on the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>The reason I think we're still in a much -- in a less perilous situation is that the average rating on the fundamentals is a lot lower at a time when things are really pretty good for particularly American business.</p><p>So I -- I think that what would get me to a feeling that we were in late- '99 and in real peril in the market is one of two things. It's either the market going up a long way to get to that 25-times earnings-plus --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: -- or it's something that brings the next recession much closer. Now that could be tariffs. The fashionable one six months ago is it could be military hostility in Korea. It could be an interruption of oil supplies. It could be credit problems.</p><p>You know, there's a lot of different things which are in that 20 or 30 percent probability of things going wrong. The main one at the moment is tariffs --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: -- but it's not the only one.</p><p>EDWARDS: Volatile (ph) risks. And some people have pointed to recent appointments in -- in Washington, and when that changes --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS: -- the percentages around some of the -- the possibility --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: That's right.</p><p>EDWARDS: -- of military action. In terms of the debate around technology, then, Jim, so Facebook and business models such as that, perhaps, maybe face regulatory risk.</p><p>What about hardware businesses that operate in technology? We have numbers out of Samsung overnight, supported by their chip business. Are you more interested in hardware stories around tech, or are you not loading up on those either?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yeah, I'm not sure particularly a hardware story. Because the hardware is -- the -- the intrinsic value, the value to the consumer is dependent on the software and the apps.</p><p>You know, Apple is very modestly rated and a very strong company. I think I'd rather have that than Facebook in the current market. I might even rather have Amazon, actually, even though the president appears to want to get his claws into them. Because I'm not sure there's really so much that can be done about that. They're in a more competitive market anyway.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They don't face an existential threat?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I don't think they do, actually. I don't see it yet. So I do think that my \"buy the dips\" on markets is a little bit qualified.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: And it -- you -- you have to look at companies that have particular dangers at the moment, and the two that are being talked about on this show are right here, Deutsche Bank and Facebook.</p><p>You also have to look at other markets. Here's one place I go with the equity market. The rest of the world is more at peril from tariffs than the U.S. is. The U.S. is a massive, integrated domestic economy.</p><p>That's why I'm beginning to say, and have been beginning to say over the last two or three months, \"Sell the international markets on strength\" as opposed to continue to buy the dips on the U.S. I think that the U.S. will do better even with tariffs than many of the international markets.</p><p>CEHIC: That's interesting. I was going to ask you about Big Tech and whether you were still positive on it, given that valuations in tech are three times the broader market --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>CEHIC: -- so we may not be looking at 1999, but still the tech valuation's that high. But you've sort of answered the question with what you said about Amazon.</p><p>But on what you said about global versus U.S., I want to show you this chart, which is the VIX topping the European volatility gauge as trade issues and the tech stock slump have played out.</p><p>And this is unusual, U.S. stocks being more volatile than their counterparts in Europe. So the euro stocks, 50 volatility index. The V (ph) stocks. Given that, you still think that you should be more positive on the U.S. versus the rest of the world?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes, I do. I don't really buy the VIX as a measure of risk. It's too volatile to be anything to do with fundamental risk.</p><p>CEHIC: And these are normal volatility levels, historically, right?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Well, that's -- that's the point. You know, the -- the volatility, so far this year, looks high compared with where it's been over most of the last decade. What is it, 26 or 27 1 percent days so far this year. In the '80s and '90s, that wouldn't have been unusual.</p><p>Whereas in the current time, it's thought of as very unusual because the last 10 years have been a period of moderation and of gradual upturn in markets.</p><p>I think we probably, because of changes in market structure, just have to get used to be a bit -- to a bit more day-to-day volatility. I think that that's not really making the market fundamentally more risky.</p><p>EDWARDS: OK. Jim, thank you very much for your thoughts so far.</p><p>Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors. He stays with us here on the program.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CEHIC: And Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors, is still with us.</p><p>So, Jim, what's your view on Deutsche Bank and -- and German banks in general? And how they kind of fit into the broader European banking picture.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I think the thing I would add to Jan-Patrick's comments about the succession at Deutsche Bank is, the ideal new person would also be something of a change agent. So it's an awful lot of things to ask for in one chief executive.</p><p>Now, why do I say that? If I look at the period when Deutsche Bank was doing particularly well in market share terms, they were very aggressive. They were aggressive on trading, they were aggressive on the investment banking products they were offering. So aggressive, quite highly leveraged.</p><p>Secondly, if I look at European banks in general and Deutsche Bank by extension, they're not well-capitalized. The non-performing (ph) loans were not dealt with after the crisis as effectively as they were in the United States.</p><p>So I would think that the new chief executive, if there is a new one at Deutsche Bank, will have to look very carefully at how to shrink some activities, notably in the aggressive end of investment banking.</p><p>They don't really need to compete with Goldman as a global investment bank. They need to be much more satisfying their base in Germany. And also to look at the capital situation. So there's (ph) going to be some unpopular things to do.</p><p>And I think it's a microcosm of the European banking picture. You know, there are strengths and weaknesses in the European economy. One of the weaknesses is, how will they create enough credit once growth gets going? I don't see that at the moment and I think there is an issue there.</p><p>EDWARDS: Would be a big task, then, for a new -- a new CEO in there, yes (ph). If they could speak German, I like the way Jan-Patrick said that would be an added bonus, of course, as well.</p><p>So in terms of the underlying picture for the eurozone economy, then, Jim, I've got a chart here that shows a couple of data points on the eurozone economy that maybe have been ticking down.</p><p>In fact, this is on German factory orders, eurozone retail sales, (INAUDIBLE) to inflation, to output numbers, as being a bit disappointing. And blame a host of factors. The weather, flu, even, the movement of Easter, the stronger euro. How concerned are you about data points that disappoint a little bit or come in below estimate?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I think they're symptomatic, Anna, of an economy that may not be quite as robust as many people hoped. And which may well not be in an - - such an escape velocity, self-sustaining recovery mode.</p><p>I think that, you know, Europe has done well. There has been improved sentiment, particularly in Germany. The French election put the European business sentiment on a much better course. Monsieur Macron has been a -- a big asset to the European economy by being very pro-business.</p><p>But what's happening next? You know, you're seeing recurrent resurgence of populism, even in Germany. You're seeing a very difficult outcome of the Italian election. Still not clear who will form a government.</p><p>So, you know, if you just (ph) look at the political situation in Europe, it's deteriorating. I would suggest that the European recovery is pretty fragile, and I go back to the banks as one of the reasons for that being the case.</p><p>CEHIC: What does this mean for the bond markets, Jim? Earlier you were saying that you prefer U.S. equities over European. If we look at the Treasury-Bund spread, for example, does -- do Treasuries outperform?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: I think they probably do, relative to the Bunds. Although I don't -- I'm not one of those who think that -- that eurozone interest rates are going up rapidly.</p><p>I think they're -- I think they're going to be pinned to zero for a while because of this lack of sustainability about the recovery. So I think that, if anything, the -- the difference between U.S. and European rates might edge up a little rather than -- rather than closing.</p><p>But eventually, there will be a convergence. But it will really be very dependent on economic conditions' demand for funds. But at the moment, I would actually be more bullish of the dollar. And that's one of the reasons why I am favoring U.S. investments rather than -- rather than international.</p><p>EDWARDS: That's interesting, Jim. So you think you've got a -- a clear idea of how further trade tension, if that's what we're in for, impacts the dollar?</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes. I think that trade tension, if it leads to recession, which eventually it would do, then it will tend to lead to a push towards safe harbors, which will include the dollar and U.S. Treasuries.</p><p>That may seem a little perverse since the U.S. basically seems to have started these trade skirmishes, but I think they were started on a fairly clear calculation, that if it all goes wrong, it hurts everybody else much more than it hurts the U.S.</p><p>EDWARDS: I remember the height of the financial crisis, lots of people asked -- or at the start of it, lots of people asked if this kind of started in the United States, how come we find safe harbor in -- in U.S. assets? That --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CEHIC: Yes.</p><p>EDWARDS: -- similar, again --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CEHIC: -- still serve (ph) currency.</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Yes. It's the reserve currency, which is a -- which is an extraordinary privilege. And, you know, I -- I do think that the openness of foreign economies is one of the reasons they're vulnerable. It's one of the reasons they've grown, of course.</p><p>EDWARDS: Yes. All right, Jim. Thank you so much for spending the last hour with us --</p><p>MCCAUGHAN: Thank you.</p><p>EDWARDS: -- we appreciate it.

Mellon is one of the key offshore talents that will be speaking at the <url normalizedValue=\"http://sohnheartsandminds.com.au/events/2017/\">Sohn Hearts and Minds charity conference in Sydney next month</url>.</p><p>So what is Mellon buying and selling at the moment?</p><p>He's \"totally long \"gold which he expects to hit $US1500 by the end of the year, and he's a buyer of Japanese stocks, which \"remain undervalued\", given the governance changes that are taking hold.</p><p>The Nikkei, he says, will hit 25,000 by the end of the year.</p><p>But Mellon is betting against some of tech's biggest names. On his short list are Facebook, Netflix and Tesla, which he quipped is \"hand-making their cars\".</p><p>Part of his short thesis is that firms like Facebook will suffer from \"elephantitis\".</p><p>\"The juiciest markets have been quite saturated and the Chinese will never let them into their market.\"</p><p>At their core, Facebook and Google are advertising companies, and while Facebook is able to better target users, Mellon believes that much of what the sell is \"junk advertising\" that isn't adding much value.</p><p>But he's most critical of the huge power and influence of social media companies that should come under far more regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>These businesses are not monopolies (where there is a dominant seller) but monopsonies (a market where there is only one buyer), he says.</p><p>\"They can't be controlled by dividing them up - so fine them, tax them and regulate them. Make knowledge a utility like water gas and electricity.</p><p>\"What they are doing is taking all this information about us and recycling it for a profit, so shouldn't we be paid?\"</p><p>So far betting against the big tech stocks has proved expensive. Mellon says he's down around 20 to 30 per cent on his position which equates to a few hundred thousand dollars.</p><p>But these trades are \"more a hobby than a profession\".</p><p>\"This is distraction from what I really do which is invest long-term in companies.\"</p><p>These bets are biotechnology and, more specifically, longevity or rejuvenation science.</p><p>Technology that makes people live longer and live better sounds like a big deal, but somewhat inexplicably, it isn't exactly luring capital.</p><p>A few years ago, Mellon explains \"there wasn't even a dribble\" of capital flowing in the space with all the funding coming via endowments, charities and research foundations.</p><p>Mellon, who co-wrote a book about longevity technology titled <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.juvenescence-book.com/\">Juvenescene </url>says he's one of the few investors looking to back companies solving what is arguably man's greatest problem.</p><p>\"The technology is here today and policymakers don't see it - it will affect anything from pensions to life insurance to patterns of consumption.\"</p><p>One would think that if people are living longer, the life insurance companies will be paying out less, but Mellon predicts that in actual fact people won't bother insuring themselves.</p><p>That's a problem for another decade. Right now insurers are battling stubbornly low interest rates, which Mellon thinks should be on the rise.</p><p>Persistently low rates have fostered wealth inequality and allowed \"zombie companies that should have been put out of business to stay alive\".</p><p>\"Governments aren't measuring inflation properly and rates back up to 3 to 4 per cent in a few years. We need a price clearing mechanism for money and we don't have that.\"</p><p>Higher rates while painful \"for people with mortgages will allow younger people to get back in to the property market\".</p><p>What is Mellon's advice to aspiring young investor?</p><p>\"Focus on one or two big ideas.</p><p>\"They will sustain you. You don't need to invest in everything from stocks to bonds to soya beans - you just need to know more than other people [about those ideas].\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1026512398</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PSG-FWH1-DY19-C2KH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"677\"/><timeReceived>10:33 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The Nikkei, he says, will hit 25,000 by the end of the year.</p><p>But Mellon is betting against some of tech's biggest names. On his short list are Facebook, Netflix and Tesla, which he quipped is \"hand-making their cars\". Part of his short thesis is that firms such as Facebook will suffer from \"elephantitis\".</p><p>\"The juiciest markets have been quite saturated and the Chinese will never let them into their market.\"</p><p>At their core, Facebook and Google are advertising companies, and while Facebook is able to better target users, Mellon believes that much of what they sell is \"junk advertising\" that isn't adding much value.</p><p>But he's most critical of the huge power and influence of social media companies that should come under far more regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>These businesses are not monopolies (where there is a dominant seller) but monopsonies (a market where there is only one buyer), he says.</p><p>\"They can't be controlled by dividing them up - so fine them, tax them and regulate them. Make knowledge a utility like water, gas and electricity.</p><p>\"What they are doing is taking all this information about us and recycling it for a profit, so shouldn't we be paid?\"</p><p>So far, betting against the big tech stocks has proved expensive. Mellon says he's down around 20 per cent to 30 per cent on his position which equates to a few hundred thousand dollars.</p><p>But these trades are \"more a hobby than a profession\". \"This is a distraction from what I really do which is invest long-term in companies.\"</p><p>These bets are biotechnology and, more specifically, longevity or rejuvenation science.</p><p>Technology that makes people live longer and live better sounds like a big deal, but somewhat inexplicably, it isn't luring capital. A few years ago, Mellon explains, \"there wasn't even a dribble\" of capital flowing in the space with all the funding coming via endowments, charities and research foundations.</p><p>Mellon, who co-wrote a book about longevity technology titled Juvenescene says he's one of the few investors looking to back companies solving what is arguably man's greatest problem.</p><p>\"The technology is here today and policymakers don't see it - it will affect anything from pensions to life insurance to patterns of consumption.\"</p><p>One would think that if people are living longer, the life insurance companies will be paying out less, but Mellon predicts that people won't bother insuring themselves.</p><p>That's a problem for another decade. Right now insurers are battling stubbornly low interest rates, which Mellon believes should be on the rise. Persistently low rates have fostered wealth inequality and allowed \"zombie companies that should have been put out of business to stay alive\", he says.</p><p>\"Governments aren't measuring inflation properly and rates back up to 3-4 per cent in a few years. We need a price clearing mechanism for money and we don't have that.\"</p><p>Higher rates, while painful \"for people with mortgages, will allow younger people to get back in to the property market\".</p><p>What is Mellon's advice to aspiring young investor? \"Focus on one or two big ideas. They will sustain you. You don't need to invest in everything from stocks to bonds to soya beans - you just need to know more than other people [about those ideas].\"</p><p>[Facebook, Google] can't be controlled by dividing them up - so fine them, tax them, regulate them.

Trade, let's start with trade. Jim, how much focus do you do on trade? And when you take over as Chairman of Chatham House, how much do you think -- how many lectures or how many sessions and seminars will there be on U.S.-China relationships?  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  A lot. Judging by the emails I've received with the news about me becoming Chair, a large number of them have got to do with issues about China, especially China's engagement with the rest of the world. So that's one of the reasons I think I was asked to do it, so it's hugely important. It's hugely important.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Viraj, when you look at the currency markets and you kind of fold in to geopolitics and a bit of trade, do we just assume right now that actually the allies will be exempted? It was kind of -- we thought it was an America-first policy. And then as time progresses, President Trump is kind of backtracking, saying, but you're an ally, you'll be fine. You're an ally, you'll be fine.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PATEL</emphasis>:  Yes. But it's a thorn in the side of FX markets. So I think this is only in the mid placed (ph) until June the 1st. So you've always got this perennial uncertainty. But what it's done is -- it's ambiguous. It's not some of the global as global animal spirits started those pro-cyclical currencies, like the euro, that have been benefitting on sort of cycles. Now, that's -- the idea there is that can we look through that? Will investors -- will activity, really activity look through that and sort of the second quarter activity news (ph), so it bounce back. We get on back on track with the normalization story that fuelled the euro sort of upward swing, that's our base case, that's what we're looking forward.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Jim, do you worry that global growth has peaked? And I don't whether it's a trade question or whether it's just, in general, we kind of reached the (inaudible).  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  With the usual caveat, one among here that I don't look at this stuff as much or as closely as they do, it is still in my veins, so I do. And actually probably with Chatham House, I'll probably look at it more. It looks that way. I mean, these five things I say every time I'm here, I look at every month whenever I see those five things and I think I know exactly what's going on with the world and both slowed. Some of it's actually surprisingly in Europe, most of it. And I don't really understand that. It's not from the lead leading indicators that I'm used to. It wasn't predictable that Europe had just suddenly slowed, so it could weather related. I think here in the U.K., a lot of it is almost definitely weather related. So I wouldn't -- I think today, we get the PMI, don't we? It would be very interesting to see if you've got any kind of bounce back in some places, because I'm suspicious that the slowdown is temporary, but it certainly looks like the world has slowed since (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Yes. Viraj, I think last time you were on, we were talking about the German economy overheating, and suddenly we're talking about a possible slowdown. Do you think that economy has peaked and what does that mean for euro?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PATEL</emphasis>:  Yes, it's kind of with (ph) because I think we went 2018 with sort of overexuberant expectations. So the economy has underperformed and underperformed a bit more than we expected relative to high expectations. What you now look at and what we look at as sort of the (inaudible) for the Eurozone, that's at its sort of three, four-year low. So the only way that we can see that sort of worsening is if this is a more structural sort of slowdown in the Eurozone economy. But if it's cyclical, we would expect the expectations to adjust (ph) lower and surge (ph) and in line with the data. And that, in itself, should keep the euro supported. So I think the euro is probably running on hot air at the start of the year but were back to sort of more at normal levels, I would say, but not that -- nothing that should take the euro any further though in our view.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Yes. What does that mean for central banks? So the central banks kind of -- we've been talking about the normalizing for quite some time. Do you think, Jim, they need the arsenal to deal with the next crisis or should they temperate down if we're seeing the slowdown kind of (inaudible)?  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  Well, I think it's a bit of a tag team battle, right? So as a couple of them have indicated recently, they want to get rates up when they can. So when the inevitable next problem comes, the (inaudible) will cut them. But the residue of what's happened in the past decade and the first signs of a slip, especially if it turns out to be more than just a couple of months blip, then I think the panic thing for some will set in pretty quickly. So I think it's going to be a tricky call about the (inaudible) of how -- outside the U.S., how some of these guys move in the next month or so?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  What do you expect from the fed, Viraj, and what does it mean for dollar overall?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PATEL</emphasis>:  We think the fed story is probably priced in, right? The mutual rate, when you look at the short end of the curve, it's there or thereabout with the sort of terminal or the end of the fed tightening. So 25 basis points here or there just doesn't set the dollar trend unless we start to see inflation in the U.S. escape out of control such that markets -- the consensus shifts above mutual pricing of the fed cycle, we don't think that that's going to happen soon. It's really a story about the rest of the world. That's where the FX markets will take the key from going forward.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right. Thank you both. Both will stick around. Jim O'Neill, Former U.K. Commercial Secretary to the Treasury and incoming Chairman of Chatham House, and Viraj Patel from ING Bank.  </p><p>      Still with us, Viraj Patel from ING and Jim O'Neill, former U.K. Commercial Secretary to the Treasury and incoming Chairman of Chatham House. Once you become Chairman, we're going to lose all the other titles and make it hosrter.  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  It sounds very grand, doesn't it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  It does sound very grand, and, of course, the House of Lords. Lord Jim, when you look at Iran, is it geopolitics story or is it an old story?  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  I don't know, obviously a bit of both. It seems to me there's all sorts of tactical things going on as well as strategic things. Yes, you imagine that the U.S. were eager for the Israelis to say what they just did (ph) today. And obviously in hindsight, it looks like the French and German visits to Washington were heavily designed to influence this. Very interesting for Macron, right? How does he -- he's positioned himself as this globally outward guy, at the same time, a big (inaudible) of Donald Trump's, intriguing. So as he made a really smart (inaudible) that he can rescue some kind of an Iranian deal. It's tough but --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  But, Jim, when you saw headline cross, right, from the Israeli Prime Minister, who was he speaking to? Was it --  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  I think he was speaking to all of us. I think he was speaking to the international media and trying to perhaps get the U.S. media more --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  To pick up on it?  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  Yes, I would guess. But underlying, one of -- I remember being at some Middle Eastern -- a huge Middle Eastern oil event last autumn. And because of the strength of the world economy, for some reason, I was asked about oil in this panel. I said, I think it's more likely to be 80 than 40 in one year's time. And that was without any of these. So it seems to me notwithstanding what we've said earlier about a bit of a slowing of the world. The world has picked up so much in so many places. The oil market is in a position that is right to price in some kind of risk of a new disruption because it's probably that outside (ph), unless we see a lot more slowing in the world economy, I would have thought.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Yes. And, Viraj, we did see that the oil price basically spiked up. Did we see similar moves for oil currencies?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PATEL</emphasis>:  Well, you saw the Canadian dollar sort of have a bit of support. But I think when you're at these elevated levels, the marginal follow-through is quite limited especially for the FX markets which kind of takes its cue right now from the equity and bond market. The oil market is kind of a second or tertiary flatter (ph) for these currencies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Okay. How do you see it panning out? I mean, again, it's so unpredictable, right? First, because you have President Trump having to decide on the accord by May 12. But does -- how much? Is it difficult to price in these big geopolitics moves in currency markets away from the dollar (ph)?  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  That's what all these guys get paid for.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  (Inaudible) to do it?  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  I used to do that in first (inaudible.)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  But is it a nightmare?  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  That's what it's all about.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  It might have changed, right, in the last 30 years. Now, the world is much more complicated or am I -- or is it not?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PATEL</emphasis>:  It's interchanging, right? But there is, to some extent, the short-term risk premium priced into the dollar. That's why it's been disconnected from rates differentials with pretty much six months, six to 12 months. I think the idea now is just kind of how much can U.S. political uncertainty elevate to another. And I think what we're seeing is sort of a consolidation in that uncertainty, but it needs to move massively one way or the other. All these short-term stories don't take us in either direction.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  But we used to have Kissinger. Now, you have President Trump that you have to model. I mean, how do you --  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  Clearly, we've not had a President quite like this. But this idea that we're in some world of uncertainty, I mean, it's likely rubbish from what I can see. It's always -- that's what makes markets potentially interesting for somebody that's good at them. But you cannot try to anticipate and make some kind of risk adjusted debt which way it's going to go. I mean, remember if I go back -- my pre-Goldman days arriving in Q8, the morning after the U.S. had just bombed Iraq. That's what's --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Good. No, you're right. But then we saw the Koreas, right, on Friday, you saw the Peninsula. Then you see Russia and the role they're trying to play in the Middle East. It just feels like we could be going through a massive shift without really realizing the consequences five years down the line.  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  I mean, there is lots of media attention to unknown uncertainties. But this big issue about known unknowns and unknown unknowns and it's a fact of life. I'm reminded as you asked me of another book that I'd reviewed actually recently. Remember Hans Rosling, a posthumous book called Factfulness, which is fantastic. Because it points out just how well the world has done the past 20-30 years despite all of these things we all worry about and (inaudible), including Trump and Brexit. There're a lot of good things that -- such as people living longer and people trying to give attention to getting new antibiotics. And so, yes, they start to worry about it. But for me, for the financial markets, that's why these guys get paid a lot of money to kind of deal with that. Otherwise, what's the point of the (inaudible)?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Well, let's see if they're making money in Brexit. Let's give it to Brexit. Let's change the focus. The U.K. is proposing a new plan to kick start stalled Brexit talks. It's hoping to make progress on the issue of the Irish border when negotiations resume in Brussels tomorrow. Speaking at the Milken Institute conference in California, the former Prime Minister and remain campaigner, Tony Blair, told me Bloomberg, when it comes to the customs union, there's no easy solution.  </p><p>      Okay. Let's get back to Jim and Viraj. Viraj, let me bring you over to a chart that Hillary Clark, the queen of charts, have kind of made for me this morning, and this is looking at fair value of sterling. We have a Bloomberg economics pound fair value estimate. In white, we have IMF U.K. real effective exchange rate. I mean, what do you look at? Do you just look at trade weighted?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PATEL</emphasis>:  Trade weighted in terms of -- for the sterling sort of appreciation in the short-term. But I think when we look at sort of fair value, fair value is the black box right now when the Brexit sort of end state is still highly unknown. So I think for us, what we see is this is gravitational pull, which is sterling is cheap. One of the reasons why we've kind of seen it as like a long run sort of a move higher. And you're seeing is a structural repricing of the Brexit tail risk, that the tail risk risk premium of a cliff edge Brexit in 2019. That's been postponed thanks to sort of the transition deal. But we're still caught between where it ends. And I think it just wants to, especially against, say, a clearer currencies, like the dollar, which is the sort of their trend. It wants to gradually move higher. The Bank of England story is a short-term story. It doesn't actually affect it from a long run perspective. That's not what is keeping sort of the pound at these elevated depressed levels.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Okay. I do want to ask you about Governor Carney and the label that he's got, fairly or unfairly, but the unreliable boyfriend. But first of all, do you think it will all play out in parliament? But actually we talk about Brexit but the people.  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  My colleagues goes a bit at first last night in the house.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  They did. But will they decide yes or no, actually, Brexit goes through in the end?  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  It seems to me that there is a growing appetite, although the most passionate Brexiteers are going to fight it, for some kind of extension of the customs union going on. Last night though takes some of the attention away from that in a way but it brings it more to the realities of what (inaudible) tactics are and notwithstanding Amber Rudd's disappearance, so the cabinet balance has shifted a bit. But I smell that some kind of extension or underlying replication of the customs union is the way that things are shifting.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Okay. In 30 seconds, do you expect to hike from BOE in May?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PATEL</emphasis>:  Not officially, but it's not dead and buried. I think it's just more about sentiment just coming back on when -- it's moving in line with data. Data will drive the pound, not political directions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right. Thank you both for joining us. Viraj Patel, FX Strategist at ING Bank. They're on some pretty bold pound moves in the past. And Jim O'Neill, former U.K. Commercial Secretary to the Treasury, incoming Chairman of Chatham, stays with us.  </p><p>      Jim O'Neill, as we look at these numbers and we're talking a little bit about Brexit, does that actually have an impact? I mean, should Governor Carney look through or are we going to see a slowdown because of Brexit?  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  It's like days gone by for me. That should be on the trade floor talking to the (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Which you're going straightaway, right?  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  I am slightly surprised and my immediate reaction to that is slightly boring (ph). Because if it was weather related, we should be getting some stabilization or bounce backs. So that is -- if I were an MPC voting member and had been thinking about a hike, I might be backing off a bit.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Yes. And so just to put that into context, the U.K. manufacturing slows more than forecast. It's now at a 17-month low and actually does seem to be adding two signs that the poor first quarter performance of the U.K. could actually persist. So we'll be back with Jim O'Neill and we also have the former Chief Executive of Barclays with us to talk Fintech shortly. 437 LACQUA:  We're now joined by Antony Jenkins. He's the former Chief Executive of Barclays, the current Chief Executive of 10x Future Technology, a Fintech firm that aims to use technology to redefine how banks operate. And still with us, Jim O'Neill, former Commercial Secretary to the U.K. Treasury and incoming Chairman for Chatham House. Antony, thank you so much for joining us. What exactly are you working on? So we have you regularly on the program every three to four months. What's fundamentally changed from the last time you were on? You were kind of going deeper into technologies that you really think will transform the way banks operate.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ANTONY JENKINS, CHAIRMAN, BITC</emphasis>:  It's really fascinating. 2.5 years ago, I gave a speech actually at Chatham House, which Jim is now Chair, and I talked about uber moments and financial services, moments where there was transformation. And since that speech 2.5 years ago, we've seen I think two of them. So the first is in the growth of mobile banking, which has caused a phenomenal drop in branch traffic, and that's a problem for the big banks because they have that cost base to sustain even while customers are going elsewhere. Secondarily, we've seen a huge rise in crypto. Now, crypto itself is a huge topic, whether subcategories of that, like the ICO market, which I think is very interesting. And I think the third uber moment that we're going to see is about data, who controls data, how that's used, how that's monetized to solve customer problems. In my business, we basically rethought how to deliver banking services around the customer data. And we've made a huge progress in proving that we can deliver the 10x benefit that we've talked about.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  What does that mean? Do you sell it to the big banks, because if you look at Uber, Airbnb, it's things that directly impact me as a consumer? But actually Fintech, will it change fundamentally my experience with the bank, is it challenger banks or is it kind of the old way but it's stuff that I don't realize is going?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  So I think the trend is going to be that consumers are going to embrace services that make their lives much better. How do you make your life better in banking? Firstly, you make it just easier, all the paperwork and forms you have to get at to get a mortgage take that away. Secondarily, you make it instant because everybody wants their problems solved instantly. Thirdly, you make it more cost effective by better pricing decisions, eliminating things like fraud. And what our platform does is deliver that but we do it through a third party. So we're a B2B2C business. We can do it through banks and we're mostly talking to banks at the moment. We can also do it through people who have digitally engaged customer base.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  But, for me, to get a mortgage easier or to get a decision quicker, does it not mean that I have to give up all of my data so the bank can make an informed decision in 2.5 seconds?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  Somebody has to take your data, collect it, curate it and put it together in a way that works for you. Now, if you think about how it works today, your data is fragmented and spread across hundreds of different sources, probably thousands of different sources, employment, education, healthcare, financial, all of those things. And those things are assembled rather painfully and slowly today through things like credit bureaus. I mean, credit bureaus have an imperfect snapshot of you as a credit risk. The more you can collect that data and make better decisions, the better they customer will be. At the moment, it's very difficult to do that because the data is so fragmented. But the new technologies allow those things to be collected and curated much more efficiently.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Do you look at Fintech, Jim?  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  I think about it a lot. But because part of the many things about the change in (inaudible), certainly my new life as Chairman at Chatham House, it's something I think we should with many other things, be it the forefront of the right thing to do, whatever that is globally. So, yes, it's something I do think about. And before I had my investment trust, I made some personal direct investments and some of the emerging players. So, yes, I assume my trust is to all --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  I'm sure they're watching. So I'm sure they are probably trying to do the right thing. Are big banks thinking about this and are they thinking about it in the right way?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  Yes. So in the course of my business, I speak to be banks all around the world. I would say, the big change between now and 2.5 years ago is that the banks are now aware of this issue and they are worried about it. And so they're all thinking about how can we transform. They've done a job of innovation and mobile banking is a great example of innovation in banking. But it's painful, it's slow and expensive. Transformation is something completely different. You have to rebuild from scratch. And many banks are thinking about that now.  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  There's not the dilemma, right, we're talking (inaudible) big banks, just a shift quickly. It's just really a hard thing to do that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  The only way you can do it is if you take a bunch of resources and put them off to the side and just let them have their head. But as we know from other industries, it's very unusual for incumbents to be able to reinvent themselves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  What does it mean for the banks? Do they have to consolidate? And we also have a story on the Bloomberg talking about transfer-wise now joining the banks in the U.K. payment system. If a lot of these kind of banking services are opened up, where does it leave the big banks?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  Well, of course, what's happening is the barriers to entry are massively falling. To support a big bank 10 or 15 years ago, you need to run huge datacenters you don't need to do and you do it in the cloud now. And as those barriers to entry fall, it exposes the flanks of the banks to people who can create better more effective customer experience using technologies. And so what is the response for a bank? I think there are very few things the bank can do. They've got to keep elevating in their core business. But recommendation would be take some resources, set them outside the existing organization and let them build the future, unconstrained by the cultural and other restrictions of the main organization.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Jim, is it impossible to figure out the jobs of tomorrow? I'm thinking of A.I. I'm thinking about the future of transport. I'm thinking of Fintech. How do we train the workforce of today to have jobs in 15 to 20 year?  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  I have contradictory views in my own head about this. The biggest one is that I don't think it's right to worry so much about one of the jobs tomorrow. Who would have dreamt 25 years ago that Apple and Google would have been the kind of things that they are today or the kind of employers that we have in areas that are employing a lot of people. (Inaudible) very importantly, the big surprise the past decade in this country, not with all the chaos that's going on, is just how strong employment is. And you could have some of these arguments about job displacements a decade ago.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  But certain people feel left out.  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  So the flipside is, of course, and I see a lot with my northern powerhouse hat on, when you've got a local community that has been dominated by a big employer that is being arbitraged away in some areas like this, the consequences are a bit like, what will happen when we lost all the pit villages and steel mills in various parts of the country, and dealing with that on a social perspective is tough. So the other part of your life, we need some much more imaginative and more serious focus on skills that don't equate to going to Oxford and Cambridge, in my view.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Which is apprenticeships?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  Yes. And as Chair of the Institute for Apprenticeships, that's one of the other things that I work on. I think, Francine, the key to this is not to try and predict the future because you're always wrong. But we do know the skills -- the sorts of skills that people need. People need to be more entrepreneurial. They're living longer and the world of work is changing faster. So they need to be able to re-skill themselves many times in their lives. We know people need to be creative, they need to be able to collaborate, to do things that humans are good at, right, to create new things, new opportunities. And these are areas where we need to build into our educational system. So we need to get our systems aware of that. But I do think there's a huge demand in this country for engineering talent and software. I mean, I've got a software business, I need engineers. They're impossible to hire in London. We need to develop centers of excellence for engineering in places like the north (ph) where we've got fantastic universities, we've got great talent and people love living there. So I am actually quite positive about this for the U.K. if we act now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right. But -- I mean, want to study it or they don't want to study it? I guess it's getting people interested in this subject matter, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  Yes. People think it's just all bits and bytes, but it's not. It's problem solving, right? Now, you do need a certain level of math attainment to write code and do engineering, but it's a fascinating work. And you could be on the forefront of changing huge aspects of our lives.  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  Tangentially, getting back to my life in antibiotics, a couple of months ago, I went to open a new antimicrobial resistance research center in a place on the edge, just in Cheshire, South of Manchester. It's on the old AstraZeneca site. But the end of the week, I was there. The number of high paid people working on that site was actually bigger than AstraZeneca's peak. So there's lots of things going on there that relates to the north, so called four prime areas, life sciences. Using modern technology, for example, is a probably enormous future employer of talent would be my guess.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Blockchain, what will blockchain become? How many questions you get about cryptocurrencies? And you always try and kind of bring you back to blockchain.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  No. I think crypto is fascinating use case for what is probably going to be the most defining technology over the next hundred years, which is distributed ledger technology. If you think about most of the systems in our life, they rely on centralization. So if you want to make a payment in this country, you go to a system like chats or faster payments, and there's many, many parties in the middle. Using restricted ledger technology, you don't need to do that at all. So it's faster, cheaper, more secure. Now, crypto is just the first incarnation of that. We can debate whether it's going to be a massive that's going to be in future (ph). Personally, I think there is a market for cryptocurrencies. I think the ability to trade, to support international trade with crypto, to take out the friction and the cost that goes along with that is very important and could help global GDP. I also believe that the connection of these technologies, and what Jim referred to a moment ago about biotech, I mean, these technologies don't exist in a vacuum. They come together and they stack on top of each other. Why can we have driverless cars now? It's not just because of tech. it is because you've got 5G coming in, it's because you've got LIDAR and all the radar technologies improving. It's the same here, internet of things, which allows you to track to physical and then finance them along the supply chain combined with a distributed ledger for its huge economic opportunities.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Can regulators keep up?  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  Can they ever?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  I think that's a genuine question. Because if you think about the internet, nobody really regulates the internet. There's a set of protocols that allow computers to talk to each other. But there isn't a sort of department for the internet globally. And that some of these financial transmission mechanism become global, regulation is going to become increasingly difficult. And it will be a balance between the benefit that these systems bring and the loss of control that nations face.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Antony, who do you think should regulate cryptocurrencies? The G20, there was a push from the European Central Bank and G20 kind of shied away from it. Does it have to be domestic? Do you think it should be regulated?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  I think in a way, it's too soon to say. I do think that (inaudible) to self-regulation is going to be incredibly important here, particularly as you say, where regulators are increasingly racing to keep up with the tech. So self-regulation becomes very important. And I think it's a little early to say whether we're going to have an overarching regulatory body for crypto, for example.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Do you think we're --  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  Like Antony's answer, I don't, I think, have too strong a view about the right way to do it is dangerous. In fact, part of the problem of regulation, in general, for my adult life is they kind of don't and they come like a battering ram and they end up overregulating yesterday's problems. So obviously we need way -- but if you look at the Facebook, the whole Facebook issue, I mean, clearly, something has got to change. Listening to Antony early, maybe added to one of my beliefs that I have a suspicion that individual might end up having to pay. Facebook's future model might be -- people pay to have access, which would certainly influence some of these issues. But it's very hard to be overly prescriptive is exactly what's the right thing. But the scale of change going on, it will be my guess.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  I think they may -- I think you're right, Jim. They might pay but they're going to get much more back in terms of value they don't get because that value --  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  By the price mechanism.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  Exactly.  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  So it is up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Okay. But where are these -- all of these technology companies, where do you see them going? Does it impact your world? Actually, I know it's kind of like at the margins. But do you see Facebook becoming a bang or because of the concerns we've had about data protection. That's now something that is more unlikely than it was six months ago.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  I think it's -- my view is that it's quite unlikely that the big tech companies would want to become banks as we know them because it's a highly regulated space, and frankly, it's a low return space. I mean, when you're at a high returns space, why would you deploy a high capital in a low return space. It wouldn't make any economic sense. But I do think what's interesting is if you accept that data is going to be what drives the future, people who are good at data are going to be good at doing financials. We all go into shopping sites, like Amazon, and these ten recommendations of things you brought before. That's a very, very early version of what could happen with your financial life. For most people, their financial life is a tedious thing that they don't really want to spend time on. If you could have an intelligent agent do that for you, wouldn't we all love that? And if we see --  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  I wouldn't be surprised in the wealth management space where it's also not super returns but at least it's more stable and relatively easy to get returns. So I have a suspicion that some of them might get into that part of finance. But standard banking is too low returns.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  The separation of the customer relationship from the balance sheet, that's the key. And if you've seen that in other areas, like shopping, like content, that you don't have to make all the content to sell it to customers when you position it at exactly the right time for them.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Antony, thank you so much. Antony Jenkins there, former Chief Executive of Barclays and Founder and Executive Chairman of 10x Futures Technology. Jim O'Neill stays with us and we'll be talking a little bit about microbiology.  </p><p>      Now, let's talk about Jim O'Neill's new book coming out, actually came out on Thursday, Superbugs:  An Arms Race Against Bacteria. Still with us Jim O'Neill and Antony Jenkins. Jim, this is something that you've just actually been working on for quite some time. And your premise is that we're oversubscribing antibiotics, which means that we have then these superbugs that we can't treat.  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  So there're ten different areas and it's -- we don't have time to go into them all. But at the core of it is we treat these things like sweets. We have to learn, in my generation, that they are a miracle cure but only if you use them when we have a bacterial infection, in the U.K., the U.S., where we have decent health systems, at least 30% over prescription. And going back to what we've chatted about before and where Antony is in the middle of, we need modern technology through diagnostics to force and our doctors to not have an antibiotic unless there is clear evidence that it's necessarily. As an aside (ph), it will dramatically reduce the pressure on the health service.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Okay. So is the U.S. the biggest defender? And actually, how much do these technologies cost? It all boils down to NHS, how much money you have.  </p><p>      O'NEILL:  In food, the U.S. is a horrific offender. Europe is one of the few areas where Europe is better than the U.S. in most things in life. In China and India, they're bad on both.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  And we have the technology.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  Yes. And there's definitely tech sold (ph) for this. I mean, I've got a colleague who works for me. He used to work in health centers. They came up with an A.I. program that could save 40,000 stroke deaths a year. So 40,000 lives saved, but also think of the save in resources against those. So if we can use technology to be more predictive, then we don't need to go down at (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Antony and Jim, thank you so much for your time. We'll have plenty more in this book and, of course, treasuries. This is Bloomberg.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S7K-3SH1-F15W-H4YD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Trade, let's start with trade. Jim, how much focus do you do on trade? And when you take over as Chairman of Chatham House, how much do you think -- how many lectures or how many sessions and seminars will there be on U.S.-China relationships?</p><p>O'NEILL: A lot. Judging by the emails I've received with the news about me becoming Chair, a large number of them have got to do with issues about China, especially China's engagement with the rest of the world. So that's one of the reasons I think I was asked to do it, so it's hugely important. It's hugely important.</p><p>LACQUA: Viraj, when you look at the currency markets and you kind of fold in to geopolitics and a bit of trade, do we just assume right now that actually the allies will be exempted? It was kind of -- we thought it was an America-first policy. And then as time progresses, President Trump is kind of backtracking, saying, but you're an ally, you'll be fine. You're an ally, you'll be fine.</p><p>VIRAJ PATEL, FX STRATEGIST, ING BANK: Yes. But it's a thorn in the side of FX markets. So I think this is only in the mid placed (ph) until June the 1st. So you've always got this perennial uncertainty. But what it's done is -- it's ambiguous. It's not some of the global as global animal spirits started those pro-cyclical currencies, like the euro, that have been benefitting on sort of cycles. Now, that's -- the idea there is that can we look through that? Will investors -- will activity, really activity look through that and sort of the second quarter activity news (ph), so it bounce back. We get on back on track with the normalization story that fuelled the euro sort of upward swing, that's our base case, that's what we're looking forward.</p><p>LACQUA: Jim, do you worry that global growth has peaked? And I don't whether it's a trade question or whether it's just, in general, we kind of reached the (inaudible).</p><p>O'NEILL: With the usual caveat, one among here that I don't look at this stuff as much or as closely as they do, it is still in my veins, so I do. And actually probably with Chatham House, I'll probably look at it more. It looks that way. I mean, these five things I say every time I'm here, I look at every month whenever I see those five things and I think I know exactly what's going on with the world and both slowed. Some of it's actually surprisingly in Europe, most of it. And I don't really understand that. It's not from the lead leading indicators that I'm used to. It wasn't predictable that Europe had just suddenly slowed, so it could weather related. I think here in the U.K., a lot of it is almost definitely weather related. So I wouldn't -- I think today, we get the PMI, don't we? It would be very interesting to see if you've got any kind of bounce back in some places, because I'm suspicious that the slowdown is temporary, but it certainly looks like the world has slowed since (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. Viraj, I think last time you were on, we were talking about the German economy overheating, and suddenly we're talking about a possible slowdown. Do you think that economy has peaked and what does that mean for euro?</p><p>PATEL: Yes, it's kind of with (ph) because I think we went 2018 with sort of overexuberant expectations. So the economy has underperformed and underperformed a bit more than we expected relative to high expectations. What you now look at and what we look at as sort of the (inaudible) for the Eurozone, that's at its sort of three, four-year low. So the only way that we can see that sort of worsening is if this is a more structural sort of slowdown in the Eurozone economy. But if it's cyclical, we would expect the expectations to adjust (ph) lower and surge (ph) and in line with the data. And that, in itself, should keep the euro supported. So I think the euro is probably running on hot air at the start of the year but were back to sort of more at normal levels, I would say, but not that -- nothing that should take the euro any further though in our view.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. What does that mean for central banks? So the central banks kind of -- we've been talking about the normalizing for quite some time. Do you think, Jim, they need the arsenal to deal with the next crisis or should they temperate down if we're seeing the slowdown kind of (inaudible)?</p><p>O'NEILL: Well, I think it's a bit of a tag team battle, right? So as a couple of them have indicated recently, they want to get rates up when they can. So when the inevitable next problem comes, the (inaudible) will cut them. But the residue of what's happened in the past decade and the first signs of a slip, especially if it turns out to be more than just a couple of months blip, then I think the panic thing for some will set in pretty quickly. So I think it's going to be a tricky call about the (inaudible) of how -- outside the U.S., how some of these guys move in the next month or so?</p><p>LACQUA: What do you expect from the fed, Viraj, and what does it mean for dollar overall?</p><p>PATEL: We think the fed story is probably priced in, right? The mutual rate, when you look at the short end of the curve, it's there or thereabout with the sort of terminal or the end of the fed tightening. So 25 basis points here or there just doesn't set the dollar trend unless we start to see inflation in the U.S. escape out of control such that markets -- the consensus shifts above mutual pricing of the fed cycle, we don't think that that's going to happen soon. It's really a story about the rest of the world. That's where the FX markets will take the key from going forward.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Thank you both. Both will stick around. Jim O'Neill, Former U.K. Commercial Secretary to the Treasury and incoming Chairman of Chatham House, and Viraj Patel from ING Bank.</p><p>Still with us, Viraj Patel from ING and Jim O'Neill, former U.K. Commercial Secretary to the Treasury and incoming Chairman of Chatham House. Once you become Chairman, we're going to lose all the other titles and make it hosrter.</p><p>O'NEILL: It sounds very grand, doesn't it?</p><p>LACQUA: It does sound very grand, and, of course, the House of Lords. Lord Jim, when you look at Iran, is it geopolitics story or is it an old story?</p><p>O'NEILL: I don't know, obviously a bit of both. It seems to me there's all sorts of tactical things going on as well as strategic things. Yes, you imagine that the U.S. were eager for the Israelis to say what they just did (ph) today. And obviously in hindsight, it looks like the French and German visits to Washington were heavily designed to influence this. Very interesting for Macron, right? How does he -- he's positioned himself as this globally outward guy, at the same time, a big (inaudible) of Donald Trump's, intriguing. So as he made a really smart (inaudible) that he can rescue some kind of an Iranian deal. It's tough but --</p><p>LACQUA: But, Jim, when you saw headline cross, right, from the Israeli Prime Minister, who was he speaking to? Was it --</p><p>O'NEILL: I think he was speaking to all of us. I think he was speaking to the international media and trying to perhaps get the U.S. media more --</p><p>LACQUA: To pick up on it?</p><p>O'NEILL: Yes, I would guess. But underlying, one of -- I remember being at some Middle Eastern -- a huge Middle Eastern oil event last autumn. And because of the strength of the world economy, for some reason, I was asked about oil in this panel. I said, I think it's more likely to be 80 than 40 in one year's time. And that was without any of these. So it seems to me notwithstanding what we've said earlier about a bit of a slowing of the world. The world has picked up so much in so many places. The oil market is in a position that is right to price in some kind of risk of a new disruption because it's probably that outside (ph), unless we see a lot more slowing in the world economy, I would have thought.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. And, Viraj, we did see that the oil price basically spiked up. Did we see similar moves for oil currencies?</p><p>PATEL: Well, you saw the Canadian dollar sort of have a bit of support. But I think when you're at these elevated levels, the marginal follow-through is quite limited especially for the FX markets which kind of takes its cue right now from the equity and bond market. The oil market is kind of a second or tertiary flatter (ph) for these currencies.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. How do you see it panning out? I mean, again, it's so unpredictable, right? First, because you have President Trump having to decide on the accord by May 12. But does -- how much? Is it difficult to price in these big geopolitics moves in currency markets away from the dollar (ph)?</p><p>O'NEILL: That's what all these guys get paid for.</p><p>LACQUA: (Inaudible) to do it?</p><p>O'NEILL: I used to do that in first (inaudible.)</p><p>LACQUA: But is it a nightmare?</p><p>O'NEILL: That's what it's all about.</p><p>LACQUA: It might have changed, right, in the last 30 years. Now, the world is much more complicated or am I -- or is it not?</p><p>PATEL: It's interchanging, right? But there is, to some extent, the short- term risk premium priced into the dollar. That's why it's been disconnected from rates differentials with pretty much six months, six to 12 months. I think the idea now is just kind of how much can U.S. political uncertainty elevate to another. And I think what we're seeing is sort of a consolidation in that uncertainty, but it needs to move massively one way or the other. All these short-term stories don't take us in either direction.</p><p>LACQUA: But we used to have Kissinger. Now, you have President Trump that you have to model. I mean, how do you --</p><p>O'NEILL: Clearly, we've not had a President quite like this. But this idea that we're in some world of uncertainty, I mean, it's likely rubbish from what I can see. It's always -- that's what makes markets potentially interesting for somebody that's good at them. But you cannot try to anticipate and make some kind of risk adjusted debt which way it's going to go. I mean, remember if I go back -- my pre-Goldman days arriving in Q8, the morning after the U.S. had just bombed Iraq. That's what's --</p><p>LACQUA: Good. No, you're right. But then we saw the Koreas, right, on Friday, you saw the Peninsula. Then you see Russia and the role they're trying to play in the Middle East. It just feels like we could be going through a massive shift without really realizing the consequences five years down the line.</p><p>O'NEILL: I mean, there is lots of media attention to unknown uncertainties. But this big issue about known unknowns and unknown unknowns and it's a fact of life. I'm reminded as you asked me of another book that I'd reviewed actually recently. Remember Hans Rosling, a posthumous book called Factfulness, which is fantastic. Because it points out just how well the world has done the past 20-30 years despite all of these things we all worry about and (inaudible), including Trump and Brexit. There're a lot of good things that -- such as people living longer and people trying to give attention to getting new antibiotics. And so, yes, they start to worry about it. But for me, for the financial markets, that's why these guys get paid a lot of money to kind of deal with that. Otherwise, what's the point of the (inaudible)?</p><p>LACQUA: Well, let's see if they're making money in Brexit. Let's give it to Brexit. Let's change the focus. The U.K. is proposing a new plan to kick start stalled Brexit talks. It's hoping to make progress on the issue of the Irish border when negotiations resume in Brussels tomorrow. Speaking at the Milken Institute conference in California, the former Prime Minister and remain campaigner, Tony Blair, told me Bloomberg, when it comes to the customs union, there's no easy solution.</p><p>Okay. Let's get back to Jim and Viraj. Viraj, let me bring you over to a chart that Hillary Clark, the queen of charts, have kind of made for me this morning, and this is looking at fair value of sterling. We have a Bloomberg economics pound fair value estimate. In white, we have IMF U.K. real effective exchange rate. I mean, what do you look at? Do you just look at trade weighted?</p><p>PATEL: Trade weighted in terms of -- for the sterling sort of appreciation in the short-term. But I think when we look at sort of fair value, fair value is the black box right now when the Brexit sort of end state is still highly unknown. So I think for us, what we see is this is gravitational pull, which is sterling is cheap. One of the reasons why we've kind of seen it as like a long run sort of a move higher. And you're seeing is a structural repricing of the Brexit tail risk, that the tail risk risk premium of a cliff edge Brexit in 2019. That's been postponed thanks to sort of the transition deal. But we're still caught between where it ends. And I think it just wants to, especially against, say, a clearer currencies, like the dollar, which is the sort of their trend. It wants to gradually move higher. The Bank of England story is a short-term story. It doesn't actually affect it from a long run perspective. That's not what is keeping sort of the pound at these elevated depressed levels.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. I do want to ask you about Governor Carney and the label that he's got, fairly or unfairly, but the unreliable boyfriend. But first of all, do you think it will all play out in parliament? But actually we talk about Brexit but the people.</p><p>O'NEILL: My colleagues goes a bit at first last night in the house.</p><p>LACQUA: They did. But will they decide yes or no, actually, Brexit goes through in the end?</p><p>O'NEILL: It seems to me that there is a growing appetite, although the most passionate Brexiteers are going to fight it, for some kind of extension of the customs union going on. Last night though takes some of the attention away from that in a way but it brings it more to the realities of what (inaudible) tactics are and notwithstanding Amber Rudd's disappearance, so the cabinet balance has shifted a bit. But I smell that some kind of extension or underlying replication of the customs union is the way that things are shifting.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. In 30 seconds, do you expect to hike from BOE in May?</p><p>PATEL: Not officially, but it's not dead and buried. I think it's just more about sentiment just coming back on when -- it's moving in line with data. Data will drive the pound, not political directions.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Thank you both for joining us. Viraj Patel, FX Strategist at ING Bank. They're on some pretty bold pound moves in the past. And Jim O'Neill, former U.K. Commercial Secretary to the Treasury, incoming Chairman of Chatham, stays with us.</p><p>Jim O'Neill, as we look at these numbers and we're talking a little bit about Brexit, does that actually have an impact? I mean, should Governor Carney look through or are we going to see a slowdown because of Brexit?</p><p>O'NEILL: It's like days gone by for me. That should be on the trade floor talking to the (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: Which you're going straightaway, right?</p><p>O'NEILL: I am slightly surprised and my immediate reaction to that is slightly boring (ph). Because if it was weather related, we should be getting some stabilization or bounce backs. So that is -- if I were an MPC voting member and had been thinking about a hike, I might be backing off a bit.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. And so just to put that into context, the U.K. manufacturing slows more than forecast. It's now at a 17-month low and actually does seem to be adding two signs that the poor first quarter performance of the U.K. could actually persist. So we'll be back with Jim O'Neill and we also have the former Chief Executive of Barclays with us to talk Fintech shortly. 437 LACQUA: We're now joined by Antony Jenkins. He's the former Chief Executive of Barclays, the current Chief Executive of 10x Future Technology, a Fintech firm that aims to use technology to redefine how banks operate. And still with us, Jim O'Neill, former Commercial Secretary to the U.K. Treasury and incoming Chairman for Chatham House. Antony, thank you so much for joining us. What exactly are you working on? So we have you regularly on the program every three to four months. What's fundamentally changed from the last time you were on? You were kind of going deeper into technologies that you really think will transform the way banks operate.</p><p>ANTONY JENKINS, CHAIRMAN, BITC: It's really fascinating. 2.5 years ago, I gave a speech actually at Chatham House, which Jim is now Chair, and I talked about uber moments and financial services, moments where there was transformation. And since that speech 2.5 years ago, we've seen I think two of them. So the first is in the growth of mobile banking, which has caused a phenomenal drop in branch traffic, and that's a problem for the big banks because they have that cost base to sustain even while customers are going elsewhere. Secondarily, we've seen a huge rise in crypto. Now, crypto itself is a huge topic, whether subcategories of that, like the ICO market, which I think is very interesting. And I think the third uber moment that we're going to see is about data, who controls data, how that's used, how that's monetized to solve customer problems. In my business, we basically rethought how to deliver banking services around the customer data. And we've made a huge progress in proving that we can deliver the 10x benefit that we've talked about.</p><p>LACQUA: What does that mean? Do you sell it to the big banks, because if you look at Uber, Airbnb, it's things that directly impact me as a consumer? But actually Fintech, will it change fundamentally my experience with the bank, is it challenger banks or is it kind of the old way but it's stuff that I don't realize is going?</p><p>JENKINS: So I think the trend is going to be that consumers are going to embrace services that make their lives much better. How do you make your life better in banking? Firstly, you make it just easier, all the paperwork and forms you have to get at to get a mortgage take that away. Secondarily, you make it instant because everybody wants their problems solved instantly. Thirdly, you make it more cost effective by better pricing decisions, eliminating things like fraud. And what our platform does is deliver that but we do it through a third party. So we're a B2B2C business. We can do it through banks and we're mostly talking to banks at the moment. We can also do it through people who have digitally engaged customer base.</p><p>LACQUA: But, for me, to get a mortgage easier or to get a decision quicker, does it not mean that I have to give up all of my data so the bank can make an informed decision in 2.5 seconds?</p><p>JENKINS: Somebody has to take your data, collect it, curate it and put it together in a way that works for you. Now, if you think about how it works today, your data is fragmented and spread across hundreds of different sources, probably thousands of different sources, employment, education, healthcare, financial, all of those things. And those things are assembled rather painfully and slowly today through things like credit bureaus. I mean, credit bureaus have an imperfect snapshot of you as a credit risk. The more you can collect that data and make better decisions, the better they customer will be. At the moment, it's very difficult to do that because the data is so fragmented. But the new technologies allow those things to be collected and curated much more efficiently.</p><p>LACQUA: Do you look at Fintech, Jim?</p><p>O'NEILL: I think about it a lot. But because part of the many things about the change in (inaudible), certainly my new life as Chairman at Chatham House, it's something I think we should with many other things, be it the forefront of the right thing to do, whatever that is globally. So, yes, it's something I do think about. And before I had my investment trust, I made some personal direct investments and some of the emerging players. So, yes, I assume my trust is to all --</p><p>LACQUA: I'm sure they're watching. So I'm sure they are probably trying to do the right thing. Are big banks thinking about this and are they thinking about it in the right way?</p><p>JENKINS: Yes. So in the course of my business, I speak to be banks all around the world. I would say, the big change between now and 2.5 years ago is that the banks are now aware of this issue and they are worried about it. And so they're all thinking about how can we transform. They've done a job of innovation and mobile banking is a great example of innovation in banking. But it's painful, it's slow and expensive. Transformation is something completely different. You have to rebuild from scratch. And many banks are thinking about that now.</p><p>O'NEILL: There's not the dilemma, right, we're talking (inaudible) big banks, just a shift quickly. It's just really a hard thing to do that.</p><p>JENKINS: The only way you can do it is if you take a bunch of resources and put them off to the side and just let them have their head. But as we know from other industries, it's very unusual for incumbents to be able to reinvent themselves.</p><p>LACQUA: What does it mean for the banks? Do they have to consolidate? And we also have a story on the Bloomberg talking about transfer-wise now joining the banks in the U.K. payment system. If a lot of these kind of banking services are opened up, where does it leave the big banks?</p><p>JENKINS: Well, of course, what's happening is the barriers to entry are massively falling. To support a big bank 10 or 15 years ago, you need to run huge datacenters you don't need to do and you do it in the cloud now. And as those barriers to entry fall, it exposes the flanks of the banks to people who can create better more effective customer experience using technologies. And so what is the response for a bank? I think there are very few things the bank can do. They've got to keep elevating in their core business. But recommendation would be take some resources, set them outside the existing organization and let them build the future, unconstrained by the cultural and other restrictions of the main organization.</p><p>LACQUA: Jim, is it impossible to figure out the jobs of tomorrow? I'm thinking of A.I. I'm thinking about the future of transport. I'm thinking of Fintech. How do we train the workforce of today to have jobs in 15 to 20 year?</p><p>O'NEILL: I have contradictory views in my own head about this. The biggest one is that I don't think it's right to worry so much about one of the jobs tomorrow. Who would have dreamt 25 years ago that Apple and Google would have been the kind of things that they are today or the kind of employers that we have in areas that are employing a lot of people. (Inaudible) very importantly, the big surprise the past decade in this country, not with all the chaos that's going on, is just how strong employment is. And you could have some of these arguments about job displacements a decade ago.</p><p>LACQUA: But certain people feel left out.</p><p>O'NEILL: So the flipside is, of course, and I see a lot with my northern powerhouse hat on, when you've got a local community that has been dominated by a big employer that is being arbitraged away in some areas like this, the consequences are a bit like, what will happen when we lost all the pit villages and steel mills in various parts of the country, and dealing with that on a social perspective is tough. So the other part of your life, we need some much more imaginative and more serious focus on skills that don't equate to going to Oxford and Cambridge, in my view.</p><p>LACQUA: Which is apprenticeships?</p><p>JENKINS: Yes. And as Chair of the Institute for Apprenticeships, that's one of the other things that I work on. I think, Francine, the key to this is not to try and predict the future because you're always wrong. But we do know the skills -- the sorts of skills that people need. People need to be more entrepreneurial. They're living longer and the world of work is changing faster. So they need to be able to re-skill themselves many times in their lives. We know people need to be creative, they need to be able to collaborate, to do things that humans are good at, right, to create new things, new opportunities. And these are areas where we need to build into our educational system. So we need to get our systems aware of that. But I do think there's a huge demand in this country for engineering talent and software. I mean, I've got a software business, I need engineers. They're impossible to hire in London. We need to develop centers of excellence for engineering in places like the north (ph) where we've got fantastic universities, we've got great talent and people love living there. So I am actually quite positive about this for the U.K. if we act now.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. But -- I mean, want to study it or they don't want to study it? I guess it's getting people interested in this subject matter, right?</p><p>JENKINS: Yes. People think it's just all bits and bytes, but it's not. It's problem solving, right? Now, you do need a certain level of math attainment to write code and do engineering, but it's a fascinating work. And you could be on the forefront of changing huge aspects of our lives.</p><p>O'NEILL: Tangentially, getting back to my life in antibiotics, a couple of months ago, I went to open a new antimicrobial resistance research center in a place on the edge, just in Cheshire, South of Manchester. It's on the old AstraZeneca site. But the end of the week, I was there. The number of high paid people working on that site was actually bigger than AstraZeneca's peak. So there's lots of things going on there that relates to the north, so called four prime areas, life sciences. Using modern technology, for example, is a probably enormous future employer of talent would be my guess.</p><p>LACQUA: Blockchain, what will blockchain become? How many questions you get about cryptocurrencies? And you always try and kind of bring you back to blockchain.</p><p>JENKINS: No. I think crypto is fascinating use case for what is probably going to be the most defining technology over the next hundred years, which is distributed ledger technology. If you think about most of the systems in our life, they rely on centralization. So if you want to make a payment in this country, you go to a system like chats or faster payments, and there's many, many parties in the middle. Using restricted ledger technology, you don't need to do that at all. So it's faster, cheaper, more secure. Now, crypto is just the first incarnation of that. We can debate whether it's going to be a massive that's going to be in future (ph). Personally, I think there is a market for cryptocurrencies. I think the ability to trade, to support international trade with crypto, to take out the friction and the cost that goes along with that is very important and could help global GDP. I also believe that the connection of these technologies, and what Jim referred to a moment ago about biotech, I mean, these technologies don't exist in a vacuum. They come together and they stack on top of each other. Why can we have driverless cars now? It's not just because of tech. it is because you've got 5G coming in, it's because you've got LIDAR and all the radar technologies improving. It's the same here, internet of things, which allows you to track to physical and then finance them along the supply chain combined with a distributed ledger for its huge economic opportunities.</p><p>LACQUA: Can regulators keep up?</p><p>O'NEILL: Can they ever?</p><p>JENKINS: I think that's a genuine question. Because if you think about the internet, nobody really regulates the internet. There's a set of protocols that allow computers to talk to each other. But there isn't a sort of department for the internet globally. And that some of these financial transmission mechanism become global, regulation is going to become increasingly difficult. And it will be a balance between the benefit that these systems bring and the loss of control that nations face.</p><p>LACQUA: Antony, who do you think should regulate cryptocurrencies? The G20, there was a push from the European Central Bank and G20 kind of shied away from it. Does it have to be domestic? Do you think it should be regulated?</p><p>JENKINS: I think in a way, it's too soon to say. I do think that (inaudible) to self-regulation is going to be incredibly important here, particularly as you say, where regulators are increasingly racing to keep up with the tech. So self-regulation becomes very important. And I think it's a little early to say whether we're going to have an overarching regulatory body for crypto, for example.</p><p>LACQUA: Do you think we're --</p><p>O'NEILL: Like Antony's answer, I don't, I think, have too strong a view about the right way to do it is dangerous. In fact, part of the problem of regulation, in general, for my adult life is they kind of don't and they come like a battering ram and they end up overregulating yesterday's problems. So obviously we need way -- but if you look at the Facebook, the whole Facebook issue, I mean, clearly, something has got to change. Listening to Antony early, maybe added to one of my beliefs that I have a suspicion that individual might end up having to pay. Facebook's future model might be -- people pay to have access, which would certainly influence some of these issues. But it's very hard to be overly prescriptive is exactly what's the right thing. But the scale of change going on, it will be my guess.</p><p>JENKINS: I think they may -- I think you're right, Jim. They might pay but they're going to get much more back in terms of value they don't get because that value --</p><p>O'NEILL: By the price mechanism.</p><p>JENKINS: Exactly.</p><p>O'NEILL: So it is up.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. But where are these -- all of these technology companies, where do you see them going? Does it impact your world? Actually, I know it's kind of like at the margins. But do you see Facebook becoming a bang or because of the concerns we've had about data protection. That's now something that is more unlikely than it was six months ago.</p><p>JENKINS: I think it's -- my view is that it's quite unlikely that the big tech companies would want to become banks as we know them because it's a highly regulated space, and frankly, it's a low return space. I mean, when you're at a high returns space, why would you deploy a high capital in a low return space. It wouldn't make any economic sense. But I do think what's interesting is if you accept that data is going to be what drives the future, people who are good at data are going to be good at doing financials. We all go into shopping sites, like Amazon, and these ten recommendations of things you brought before. That's a very, very early version of what could happen with your financial life. For most people, their financial life is a tedious thing that they don't really want to spend time on. If you could have an intelligent agent do that for you, wouldn't we all love that? And if we see --</p><p>O'NEILL: I wouldn't be surprised in the wealth management space where it's also not super returns but at least it's more stable and relatively easy to get returns. So I have a suspicion that some of them might get into that part of finance. But standard banking is too low returns.</p><p>JENKINS: The separation of the customer relationship from the balance sheet, that's the key. And if you've seen that in other areas, like shopping, like content, that you don't have to make all the content to sell it to customers when you position it at exactly the right time for them.</p><p>LACQUA: Antony, thank you so much. Antony Jenkins there, former Chief Executive of Barclays and Founder and Executive Chairman of 10x Futures Technology. Jim O'Neill stays with us and we'll be talking a little bit about microbiology.</p><p>Now, let's talk about Jim O'Neill's new book coming out, actually came out on Thursday, Superbugs: An Arms Race Against Bacteria. Still with us Jim O'Neill and Antony Jenkins. Jim, this is something that you've just actually been working on for quite some time. And your premise is that we're oversubscribing antibiotics, which means that we have then these superbugs that we can't treat.</p><p>O'NEILL: So there're ten different areas and it's -- we don't have time to go into them all. But at the core of it is we treat these things like sweets. We have to learn, in my generation, that they are a miracle cure but only if you use them when we have a bacterial infection, in the U.K., the U.S., where we have decent health systems, at least 30% over prescription. And going back to what we've chatted about before and where Antony is in the middle of, we need modern technology through diagnostics to force and our doctors to not have an antibiotic unless there is clear evidence that it's necessarily. As an aside (ph), it will dramatically reduce the pressure on the health service.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. So is the U.S. the biggest defender? And actually, how much do these technologies cost? It all boils down to NHS, how much money you have.</p><p>O'NEILL: In food, the U.S. is a horrific offender. Europe is one of the few areas where Europe is better than the U.S. in most things in life. In China and India, they're bad on both.</p><p>LACQUA: And we have the technology.</p><p>JENKINS: Yes. And there's definitely tech sold (ph) for this. I mean, I've got a colleague who works for me. He used to work in health centers. They came up with an A.I. program that could save 40,000 stroke deaths a year. So 40,000 lives saved, but also think of the save in resources against those. So if we can use technology to be more predictive, then we don't need to go down at (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: Antony and Jim, thank you so much for your time. We'll have plenty more in this book and, of course, treasuries.

Trade, let's start with trade. Jim, how much focus do you do on trade? And when you take over as Chairman of Chatham House, how much do you think -- how many lectures or how many sessions and seminars will there be on U.S.-China relationships?</p><p>O'NEILL: A lot. Judging by the emails I've received with the news about me becoming Chair, a large number of them have got to do with issues about China, especially China's engagement with the rest of the world. So that's one of the reasons I think I was asked to do it, so it's hugely important. It's hugely important.</p><p>LACQUA: Viraj, when you look at the currency markets and you kind of fold in to geopolitics and a bit of trade, do we just assume right now that actually the allies will be exempted? It was kind of -- we thought it was an America-first policy. And then as time progresses, President Trump is kind of backtracking, saying, but you're an ally, you'll be fine. You're an ally, you'll be fine.</p><p>VIRAJ PATEL, FX STRATEGIST, ING BANK: Yes. But it's a thorn in the side of FX markets. So I think this is only in the mid placed (ph) until June the 1st. So you've always got this perennial uncertainty. But what it's done is -- it's ambiguous. It's not some of the global as global animal spirits started those pro-cyclical currencies, like the euro, that have been benefitting on sort of cycles. Now, that's -- the idea there is that can we look through that? Will investors -- will activity, really activity look through that and sort of the second quarter activity news (ph), so it bounce back. We get on back on track with the normalization story that fuelled the euro sort of upward swing, that's our base case, that's what we're looking forward.</p><p>LACQUA: Jim, do you worry that global growth has peaked? And I don't whether it's a trade question or whether it's just, in general, we kind of reached the (inaudible).</p><p>O'NEILL: With the usual caveat, one among here that I don't look at this stuff as much or as closely as they do, it is still in my veins, so I do. And actually probably with Chatham House, I'll probably look at it more. It looks that way. I mean, these five things I say every time I'm here, I look at every month whenever I see those five things and I think I know exactly what's going on with the world and both slowed. Some of it's actually surprisingly in Europe, most of it. And I don't really understand that. It's not from the lead leading indicators that I'm used to. It wasn't predictable that Europe had just suddenly slowed, so it could weather related. I think here in the U.K., a lot of it is almost definitely weather related. So I wouldn't -- I think today, we get the PMI, don't we? It would be very interesting to see if you've got any kind of bounce back in some places, because I'm suspicious that the slowdown is temporary, but it certainly looks like the world has slowed since (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. Viraj, I think last time you were on, we were talking about the German economy overheating, and suddenly we're talking about a possible slowdown. Do you think that economy has peaked and what does that mean for euro?</p><p>PATEL: Yes, it's kind of with (ph) because I think we went 2018 with sort of overexuberant expectations. So the economy has underperformed and underperformed a bit more than we expected relative to high expectations. What you now look at and what we look at as sort of the (inaudible) for the Eurozone, that's at its sort of three, four-year low. So the only way that we can see that sort of worsening is if this is a more structural sort of slowdown in the Eurozone economy. But if it's cyclical, we would expect the expectations to adjust (ph) lower and surge (ph) and in line with the data. And that, in itself, should keep the euro supported. So I think the euro is probably running on hot air at the start of the year but were back to sort of more at normal levels, I would say, but not that -- nothing that should take the euro any further though in our view.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. What does that mean for central banks? So the central banks kind of -- we've been talking about the normalizing for quite some time. Do you think, Jim, they need the arsenal to deal with the next crisis or should they temperate down if we're seeing the slowdown kind of (inaudible)?</p><p>O'NEILL: Well, I think it's a bit of a tag team battle, right? So as a couple of them have indicated recently, they want to get rates up when they can. So when the inevitable next problem comes, the (inaudible) will cut them. But the residue of what's happened in the past decade and the first signs of a slip, especially if it turns out to be more than just a couple of months blip, then I think the panic thing for some will set in pretty quickly. So I think it's going to be a tricky call about the (inaudible) of how -- outside the U.S., how some of these guys move in the next month or so?</p><p>LACQUA: What do you expect from the fed, Viraj, and what does it mean for dollar overall?</p><p>PATEL: We think the fed story is probably priced in, right? The mutual rate, when you look at the short end of the curve, it's there or thereabout with the sort of terminal or the end of the fed tightening. So 25 basis points here or there just doesn't set the dollar trend unless we start to see inflation in the U.S. escape out of control such that markets -- the consensus shifts above mutual pricing of the fed cycle, we don't think that that's going to happen soon. It's really a story about the rest of the world. That's where the FX markets will take the key from going forward.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Thank you both. Both will stick around. Jim O'Neill, Former U.K. Commercial Secretary to the Treasury and incoming Chairman of Chatham House, and Viraj Patel from ING Bank.</p><p>Still with us, Viraj Patel from ING and Jim O'Neill, former U.K. Commercial Secretary to the Treasury and incoming Chairman of Chatham House. Once you become Chairman, we're going to lose all the other titles and make it hosrter.</p><p>O'NEILL: It sounds very grand, doesn't it?</p><p>LACQUA: It does sound very grand, and, of course, the House of Lords. Lord Jim, when you look at Iran, is it geopolitics story or is it an old story?</p><p>O'NEILL: I don't know, obviously a bit of both. It seems to me there's all sorts of tactical things going on as well as strategic things. Yes, you imagine that the U.S. were eager for the Israelis to say what they just did (ph) today. And obviously in hindsight, it looks like the French and German visits to Washington were heavily designed to influence this. Very interesting for Macron, right? How does he -- he's positioned himself as this globally outward guy, at the same time, a big (inaudible) of Donald Trump's, intriguing. So as he made a really smart (inaudible) that he can rescue some kind of an Iranian deal. It's tough but --</p><p>LACQUA: But, Jim, when you saw headline cross, right, from the Israeli Prime Minister, who was he speaking to? Was it --</p><p>O'NEILL: I think he was speaking to all of us. I think he was speaking to the international media and trying to perhaps get the U.S. media more --</p><p>LACQUA: To pick up on it?</p><p>O'NEILL: Yes, I would guess. But underlying, one of -- I remember being at some Middle Eastern -- a huge Middle Eastern oil event last autumn. And because of the strength of the world economy, for some reason, I was asked about oil in this panel. I said, I think it's more likely to be 80 than 40 in one year's time. And that was without any of these. So it seems to me notwithstanding what we've said earlier about a bit of a slowing of the world. The world has picked up so much in so many places. The oil market is in a position that is right to price in some kind of risk of a new disruption because it's probably that outside (ph), unless we see a lot more slowing in the world economy, I would have thought.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. And, Viraj, we did see that the oil price basically spiked up. Did we see similar moves for oil currencies?</p><p>PATEL: Well, you saw the Canadian dollar sort of have a bit of support. But I think when you're at these elevated levels, the marginal follow-through is quite limited especially for the FX markets which kind of takes its cue right now from the equity and bond market. The oil market is kind of a second or tertiary flatter (ph) for these currencies.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. How do you see it panning out? I mean, again, it's so unpredictable, right? First, because you have President Trump having to decide on the accord by May 12. But does -- how much? Is it difficult to price in these big geopolitics moves in currency markets away from the dollar (ph)?</p><p>O'NEILL: That's what all these guys get paid for.</p><p>LACQUA: (Inaudible) to do it?</p><p>O'NEILL: I used to do that in first (inaudible.)</p><p>LACQUA: But is it a nightmare?</p><p>O'NEILL: That's what it's all about.</p><p>LACQUA: It might have changed, right, in the last 30 years. Now, the world is much more complicated or am I -- or is it not?</p><p>PATEL: It's interchanging, right? But there is, to some extent, the short- term risk premium priced into the dollar. That's why it's been disconnected from rates differentials with pretty much six months, six to 12 months. I think the idea now is just kind of how much can U.S. political uncertainty elevate to another. And I think what we're seeing is sort of a consolidation in that uncertainty, but it needs to move massively one way or the other. All these short-term stories don't take us in either direction.</p><p>LACQUA: But we used to have Kissinger. Now, you have President Trump that you have to model. I mean, how do you --</p><p>O'NEILL: Clearly, we've not had a President quite like this. But this idea that we're in some world of uncertainty, I mean, it's likely rubbish from what I can see. It's always -- that's what makes markets potentially interesting for somebody that's good at them. But you cannot try to anticipate and make some kind of risk adjusted debt which way it's going to go. I mean, remember if I go back -- my pre-Goldman days arriving in Q8, the morning after the U.S. had just bombed Iraq. That's what's --</p><p>LACQUA: Good. No, you're right. But then we saw the Koreas, right, on Friday, you saw the Peninsula. Then you see Russia and the role they're trying to play in the Middle East. It just feels like we could be going through a massive shift without really realizing the consequences five years down the line.</p><p>O'NEILL: I mean, there is lots of media attention to unknown uncertainties. But this big issue about known unknowns and unknown unknowns and it's a fact of life. I'm reminded as you asked me of another book that I'd reviewed actually recently. Remember Hans Rosling, a posthumous book called Factfulness, which is fantastic. Because it points out just how well the world has done the past 20-30 years despite all of these things we all worry about and (inaudible), including Trump and Brexit. There're a lot of good things that -- such as people living longer and people trying to give attention to getting new antibiotics. And so, yes, they start to worry about it. But for me, for the financial markets, that's why these guys get paid a lot of money to kind of deal with that. Otherwise, what's the point of the (inaudible)?</p><p>LACQUA: Well, let's see if they're making money in Brexit. Let's give it to Brexit. Let's change the focus. The U.K. is proposing a new plan to kick start stalled Brexit talks. It's hoping to make progress on the issue of the Irish border when negotiations resume in Brussels tomorrow. Speaking at the Milken Institute conference in California, the former Prime Minister and remain campaigner, Tony Blair, told me Bloomberg, when it comes to the customs union, there's no easy solution.</p><p>Okay. Let's get back to Jim and Viraj. Viraj, let me bring you over to a chart that Hillary Clark, the queen of charts, have kind of made for me this morning, and this is looking at fair value of sterling. We have a Bloomberg economics pound fair value estimate. In white, we have IMF U.K. real effective exchange rate. I mean, what do you look at? Do you just look at trade weighted?</p><p>PATEL: Trade weighted in terms of -- for the sterling sort of appreciation in the short-term. But I think when we look at sort of fair value, fair value is the black box right now when the Brexit sort of end state is still highly unknown. So I think for us, what we see is this is gravitational pull, which is sterling is cheap. One of the reasons why we've kind of seen it as like a long run sort of a move higher. And you're seeing is a structural repricing of the Brexit tail risk, that the tail risk risk premium of a cliff edge Brexit in 2019. That's been postponed thanks to sort of the transition deal. But we're still caught between where it ends. And I think it just wants to, especially against, say, a clearer currencies, like the dollar, which is the sort of their trend. It wants to gradually move higher. The Bank of England story is a short-term story. It doesn't actually affect it from a long run perspective. That's not what is keeping sort of the pound at these elevated depressed levels.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. I do want to ask you about Governor Carney and the label that he's got, fairly or unfairly, but the unreliable boyfriend. But first of all, do you think it will all play out in parliament? But actually we talk about Brexit but the people.</p><p>O'NEILL: My colleagues goes a bit at first last night in the house.</p><p>LACQUA: They did. But will they decide yes or no, actually, Brexit goes through in the end?</p><p>O'NEILL: It seems to me that there is a growing appetite, although the most passionate Brexiteers are going to fight it, for some kind of extension of the customs union going on. Last night though takes some of the attention away from that in a way but it brings it more to the realities of what (inaudible) tactics are and notwithstanding Amber Rudd's disappearance, so the cabinet balance has shifted a bit. But I smell that some kind of extension or underlying replication of the customs union is the way that things are shifting.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. In 30 seconds, do you expect to hike from BOE in May?</p><p>PATEL: Not officially, but it's not dead and buried. I think it's just more about sentiment just coming back on when -- it's moving in line with data. Data will drive the pound, not political directions.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Thank you both for joining us. Viraj Patel, FX Strategist at ING Bank. They're on some pretty bold pound moves in the past. And Jim O'Neill, former U.K. Commercial Secretary to the Treasury, incoming Chairman of Chatham, stays with us.</p><p>Jim O'Neill, as we look at these numbers and we're talking a little bit about Brexit, does that actually have an impact? I mean, should Governor Carney look through or are we going to see a slowdown because of Brexit?</p><p>O'NEILL: It's like days gone by for me. That should be on the trade floor talking to the (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: Which you're going straightaway, right?</p><p>O'NEILL: I am slightly surprised and my immediate reaction to that is slightly boring (ph). Because if it was weather related, we should be getting some stabilization or bounce backs. So that is -- if I were an MPC voting member and had been thinking about a hike, I might be backing off a bit.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. And so just to put that into context, the U.K. manufacturing slows more than forecast. It's now at a 17-month low and actually does seem to be adding two signs that the poor first quarter performance of the U.K. could actually persist. So we'll be back with Jim O'Neill and we also have the former Chief Executive of Barclays with us to talk Fintech shortly. 437 LACQUA: We're now joined by Antony Jenkins. He's the former Chief Executive of Barclays, the current Chief Executive of 10x Future Technology, a Fintech firm that aims to use technology to redefine how banks operate. And still with us, Jim O'Neill, former Commercial Secretary to the U.K. Treasury and incoming Chairman for Chatham House. Antony, thank you so much for joining us. What exactly are you working on? So we have you regularly on the program every three to four months. What's fundamentally changed from the last time you were on? You were kind of going deeper into technologies that you really think will transform the way banks operate.</p><p>ANTONY JENKINS, CHAIRMAN, BITC: It's really fascinating. 2.5 years ago, I gave a speech actually at Chatham House, which Jim is now Chair, and I talked about uber moments and financial services, moments where there was transformation. And since that speech 2.5 years ago, we've seen I think two of them. So the first is in the growth of mobile banking, which has caused a phenomenal drop in branch traffic, and that's a problem for the big banks because they have that cost base to sustain even while customers are going elsewhere. Secondarily, we've seen a huge rise in crypto. Now, crypto itself is a huge topic, whether subcategories of that, like the ICO market, which I think is very interesting. And I think the third uber moment that we're going to see is about data, who controls data, how that's used, how that's monetized to solve customer problems. In my business, we basically rethought how to deliver banking services around the customer data. And we've made a huge progress in proving that we can deliver the 10x benefit that we've talked about.</p><p>LACQUA: What does that mean? Do you sell it to the big banks, because if you look at Uber, Airbnb, it's things that directly impact me as a consumer? But actually Fintech, will it change fundamentally my experience with the bank, is it challenger banks or is it kind of the old way but it's stuff that I don't realize is going?</p><p>JENKINS: So I think the trend is going to be that consumers are going to embrace services that make their lives much better. How do you make your life better in banking? Firstly, you make it just easier, all the paperwork and forms you have to get at to get a mortgage take that away. Secondarily, you make it instant because everybody wants their problems solved instantly. Thirdly, you make it more cost effective by better pricing decisions, eliminating things like fraud. And what our platform does is deliver that but we do it through a third party. So we're a B2B2C business. We can do it through banks and we're mostly talking to banks at the moment. We can also do it through people who have digitally engaged customer base.</p><p>LACQUA: But, for me, to get a mortgage easier or to get a decision quicker, does it not mean that I have to give up all of my data so the bank can make an informed decision in 2.5 seconds?</p><p>JENKINS: Somebody has to take your data, collect it, curate it and put it together in a way that works for you. Now, if you think about how it works today, your data is fragmented and spread across hundreds of different sources, probably thousands of different sources, employment, education, healthcare, financial, all of those things. And those things are assembled rather painfully and slowly today through things like credit bureaus. I mean, credit bureaus have an imperfect snapshot of you as a credit risk. The more you can collect that data and make better decisions, the better they customer will be. At the moment, it's very difficult to do that because the data is so fragmented. But the new technologies allow those things to be collected and curated much more efficiently.</p><p>LACQUA: Do you look at Fintech, Jim?</p><p>O'NEILL: I think about it a lot. But because part of the many things about the change in (inaudible), certainly my new life as Chairman at Chatham House, it's something I think we should with many other things, be it the forefront of the right thing to do, whatever that is globally. So, yes, it's something I do think about. And before I had my investment trust, I made some personal direct investments and some of the emerging players. So, yes, I assume my trust is to all --</p><p>LACQUA: I'm sure they're watching. So I'm sure they are probably trying to do the right thing. Are big banks thinking about this and are they thinking about it in the right way?</p><p>JENKINS: Yes. So in the course of my business, I speak to be banks all around the world. I would say, the big change between now and 2.5 years ago is that the banks are now aware of this issue and they are worried about it. And so they're all thinking about how can we transform. They've done a job of innovation and mobile banking is a great example of innovation in banking. But it's painful, it's slow and expensive. Transformation is something completely different. You have to rebuild from scratch. And many banks are thinking about that now.</p><p>O'NEILL: There's not the dilemma, right, we're talking (inaudible) big banks, just a shift quickly. It's just really a hard thing to do that.</p><p>JENKINS: The only way you can do it is if you take a bunch of resources and put them off to the side and just let them have their head. But as we know from other industries, it's very unusual for incumbents to be able to reinvent themselves.</p><p>LACQUA: What does it mean for the banks? Do they have to consolidate? And we also have a story on the Bloomberg talking about transfer-wise now joining the banks in the U.K. payment system. If a lot of these kind of banking services are opened up, where does it leave the big banks?</p><p>JENKINS: Well, of course, what's happening is the barriers to entry are massively falling. To support a big bank 10 or 15 years ago, you need to run huge datacenters you don't need to do and you do it in the cloud now. And as those barriers to entry fall, it exposes the flanks of the banks to people who can create better more effective customer experience using technologies. And so what is the response for a bank? I think there are very few things the bank can do. They've got to keep elevating in their core business. But recommendation would be take some resources, set them outside the existing organization and let them build the future, unconstrained by the cultural and other restrictions of the main organization.</p><p>LACQUA: Jim, is it impossible to figure out the jobs of tomorrow? I'm thinking of A.I. I'm thinking about the future of transport. I'm thinking of Fintech. How do we train the workforce of today to have jobs in 15 to 20 year?</p><p>O'NEILL: I have contradictory views in my own head about this. The biggest one is that I don't think it's right to worry so much about one of the jobs tomorrow. Who would have dreamt 25 years ago that Apple and Google would have been the kind of things that they are today or the kind of employers that we have in areas that are employing a lot of people. (Inaudible) very importantly, the big surprise the past decade in this country, not with all the chaos that's going on, is just how strong employment is. And you could have some of these arguments about job displacements a decade ago.</p><p>LACQUA: But certain people feel left out.</p><p>O'NEILL: So the flipside is, of course, and I see a lot with my northern powerhouse hat on, when you've got a local community that has been dominated by a big employer that is being arbitraged away in some areas like this, the consequences are a bit like, what will happen when we lost all the pit villages and steel mills in various parts of the country, and dealing with that on a social perspective is tough. So the other part of your life, we need some much more imaginative and more serious focus on skills that don't equate to going to Oxford and Cambridge, in my view.</p><p>LACQUA: Which is apprenticeships?</p><p>JENKINS: Yes. And as Chair of the Institute for Apprenticeships, that's one of the other things that I work on. I think, Francine, the key to this is not to try and predict the future because you're always wrong. But we do know the skills -- the sorts of skills that people need. People need to be more entrepreneurial. They're living longer and the world of work is changing faster. So they need to be able to re-skill themselves many times in their lives. We know people need to be creative, they need to be able to collaborate, to do things that humans are good at, right, to create new things, new opportunities. And these are areas where we need to build into our educational system. So we need to get our systems aware of that. But I do think there's a huge demand in this country for engineering talent and software. I mean, I've got a software business, I need engineers. They're impossible to hire in London. We need to develop centers of excellence for engineering in places like the north (ph) where we've got fantastic universities, we've got great talent and people love living there. So I am actually quite positive about this for the U.K. if we act now.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. But -- I mean, want to study it or they don't want to study it? I guess it's getting people interested in this subject matter, right?</p><p>JENKINS: Yes. People think it's just all bits and bytes, but it's not. It's problem solving, right? Now, you do need a certain level of math attainment to write code and do engineering, but it's a fascinating work. And you could be on the forefront of changing huge aspects of our lives.</p><p>O'NEILL: Tangentially, getting back to my life in antibiotics, a couple of months ago, I went to open a new antimicrobial resistance research center in a place on the edge, just in Cheshire, South of Manchester. It's on the old AstraZeneca site. But the end of the week, I was there. The number of high paid people working on that site was actually bigger than AstraZeneca's peak. So there's lots of things going on there that relates to the north, so called four prime areas, life sciences. Using modern technology, for example, is a probably enormous future employer of talent would be my guess.</p><p>LACQUA: Blockchain, what will blockchain become? How many questions you get about cryptocurrencies? And you always try and kind of bring you back to blockchain.</p><p>JENKINS: No. I think crypto is fascinating use case for what is probably going to be the most defining technology over the next hundred years, which is distributed ledger technology. If you think about most of the systems in our life, they rely on centralization. So if you want to make a payment in this country, you go to a system like chats or faster payments, and there's many, many parties in the middle. Using restricted ledger technology, you don't need to do that at all. So it's faster, cheaper, more secure. Now, crypto is just the first incarnation of that. We can debate whether it's going to be a massive that's going to be in future (ph). Personally, I think there is a market for cryptocurrencies. I think the ability to trade, to support international trade with crypto, to take out the friction and the cost that goes along with that is very important and could help global GDP. I also believe that the connection of these technologies, and what Jim referred to a moment ago about biotech, I mean, these technologies don't exist in a vacuum. They come together and they stack on top of each other. Why can we have driverless cars now? It's not just because of tech. it is because you've got 5G coming in, it's because you've got LIDAR and all the radar technologies improving. It's the same here, internet of things, which allows you to track to physical and then finance them along the supply chain combined with a distributed ledger for its huge economic opportunities.</p><p>LACQUA: Can regulators keep up?</p><p>O'NEILL: Can they ever?</p><p>JENKINS: I think that's a genuine question. Because if you think about the internet, nobody really regulates the internet. There's a set of protocols that allow computers to talk to each other. But there isn't a sort of department for the internet globally. And that some of these financial transmission mechanism become global, regulation is going to become increasingly difficult. And it will be a balance between the benefit that these systems bring and the loss of control that nations face.</p><p>LACQUA: Antony, who do you think should regulate cryptocurrencies? The G20, there was a push from the European Central Bank and G20 kind of shied away from it. Does it have to be domestic? Do you think it should be regulated?</p><p>JENKINS: I think in a way, it's too soon to say. I do think that (inaudible) to self-regulation is going to be incredibly important here, particularly as you say, where regulators are increasingly racing to keep up with the tech. So self-regulation becomes very important. And I think it's a little early to say whether we're going to have an overarching regulatory body for crypto, for example.</p><p>LACQUA: Do you think we're --</p><p>O'NEILL: Like Antony's answer, I don't, I think, have too strong a view about the right way to do it is dangerous. In fact, part of the problem of regulation, in general, for my adult life is they kind of don't and they come like a battering ram and they end up overregulating yesterday's problems. So obviously we need way -- but if you look at the Facebook, the whole Facebook issue, I mean, clearly, something has got to change. Listening to Antony early, maybe added to one of my beliefs that I have a suspicion that individual might end up having to pay. Facebook's future model might be -- people pay to have access, which would certainly influence some of these issues. But it's very hard to be overly prescriptive is exactly what's the right thing. But the scale of change going on, it will be my guess.</p><p>JENKINS: I think they may -- I think you're right, Jim. They might pay but they're going to get much more back in terms of value they don't get because that value --</p><p>O'NEILL: By the price mechanism.</p><p>JENKINS: Exactly.</p><p>O'NEILL: So it is up.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. But where are these -- all of these technology companies, where do you see them going? Does it impact your world? Actually, I know it's kind of like at the margins. But do you see Facebook becoming a bang or because of the concerns we've had about data protection. That's now something that is more unlikely than it was six months ago.</p><p>JENKINS: I think it's -- my view is that it's quite unlikely that the big tech companies would want to become banks as we know them because it's a highly regulated space, and frankly, it's a low return space. I mean, when you're at a high returns space, why would you deploy a high capital in a low return space. It wouldn't make any economic sense. But I do think what's interesting is if you accept that data is going to be what drives the future, people who are good at data are going to be good at doing financials. We all go into shopping sites, like Amazon, and these ten recommendations of things you brought before. That's a very, very early version of what could happen with your financial life. For most people, their financial life is a tedious thing that they don't really want to spend time on. If you could have an intelligent agent do that for you, wouldn't we all love that? And if we see --</p><p>O'NEILL: I wouldn't be surprised in the wealth management space where it's also not super returns but at least it's more stable and relatively easy to get returns. So I have a suspicion that some of them might get into that part of finance. But standard banking is too low returns.</p><p>JENKINS: The separation of the customer relationship from the balance sheet, that's the key. And if you've seen that in other areas, like shopping, like content, that you don't have to make all the content to sell it to customers when you position it at exactly the right time for them.</p><p>LACQUA: Antony, thank you so much. Antony Jenkins there, former Chief Executive of Barclays and Founder and Executive Chairman of 10x Futures Technology. Jim O'Neill stays with us and we'll be talking a little bit about microbiology.</p><p>Now, let's talk about Jim O'Neill's new book coming out, actually came out on Thursday, Superbugs: An Arms Race Against Bacteria. Still with us Jim O'Neill and Antony Jenkins. Jim, this is something that you've just actually been working on for quite some time. And your premise is that we're oversubscribing antibiotics, which means that we have then these superbugs that we can't treat.</p><p>O'NEILL: So there're ten different areas and it's -- we don't have time to go into them all. But at the core of it is we treat these things like sweets. We have to learn, in my generation, that they are a miracle cure but only if you use them when we have a bacterial infection, in the U.K., the U.S., where we have decent health systems, at least 30% over prescription. And going back to what we've chatted about before and where Antony is in the middle of, we need modern technology through diagnostics to force and our doctors to not have an antibiotic unless there is clear evidence that it's necessarily. As an aside (ph), it will dramatically reduce the pressure on the health service.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. So is the U.S. the biggest defender? And actually, how much do these technologies cost? It all boils down to NHS, how much money you have.</p><p>O'NEILL: In food, the U.S. is a horrific offender. Europe is one of the few areas where Europe is better than the U.S. in most things in life. In China and India, they're bad on both.</p><p>LACQUA: And we have the technology.</p><p>JENKINS: Yes. And there's definitely tech sold (ph) for this. I mean, I've got a colleague who works for me. He used to work in health centers. They came up with an A.I. program that could save 40,000 stroke deaths a year. So 40,000 lives saved, but also think of the save in resources against those. So if we can use technology to be more predictive, then we don't need to go down at (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: Antony and Jim, thank you so much for your time. We'll have plenty more in this book and, of course, treasuries.

Trade, let's start with trade. Jim, how much focus do  you do on trade? And when you take over as Chairman of Chatham House, how  much do you think -- how many lectures or how many sessions and seminars  will there be on U.S.-China relationships?</p><p> O'NEILL: A lot. Judging by the emails I've received with the news about me  becoming Chair, a large number of them have got to do with issues about  China, especially China's engagement with the rest of the world. So that's  one of the reasons I think I was asked to do it, so it's hugely important.  It's hugely important.</p><p> LACQUA: Viraj, when you look at the currency markets and you kind of fold  in to geopolitics and a bit of trade, do we just assume right now that  actually the allies will be exempted? It was kind of -- we thought it was  an America-first policy. And then as time progresses, President Trump is  kind of backtracking, saying, but you're an ally, you'll be fine. You're an  ally, you'll be fine.</p><p> VIRAJ PATEL, FX STRATEGIST, ING BANK: Yes. But it's a thorn in the side of  FX markets. So I think this is only in the mid placed (ph) until June the  1st. So you've always got this perennial uncertainty. But what it's done is  -- it's ambiguous. It's not some of the global as global animal spirits  started those pro-cyclical currencies, like the euro, that have been  benefitting on sort of cycles. Now, that's -- the idea there is that can we  look through that? Will investors -- will activity, really activity look  through that and sort of the second quarter activity news (ph), so it  bounce back. We get on back on track with the normalization story that  fuelled the euro sort of upward swing, that's our base case, that's what  we're looking forward.</p><p> LACQUA: Jim, do you worry that global growth has peaked? And I don't  whether it's a trade question or whether it's just, in general, we kind of  reached the (inaudible).</p><p> O'NEILL: With the usual caveat, one among here that I don't look at this  stuff as much or as closely as they do, it is still in my veins, so I do.  And actually probably with Chatham House, I'll probably look at it more. It  looks that way. I mean, these five things I say every time I'm here, I look  at every month whenever I see those five things and I think I know exactly  what's going on with the world and both slowed. Some of it's actually  surprisingly in Europe, most of it. And I don't really understand that.  It's not from the lead leading indicators that I'm used to. It wasn't  predictable that Europe had just suddenly slowed, so it could weather  related. I think here in the U.K., a lot of it is almost definitely weather  related. So I wouldn't -- I think today, we get the PMI, don't we? It would  be very interesting to see if you've got any kind of bounce back in some  places, because I'm suspicious that the slowdown is temporary, but it  certainly looks like the world has slowed since (inaudible).</p><p> LACQUA: Yes. Viraj, I think last time you were on, we were talking about  the German economy overheating, and suddenly we're talking about a possible  slowdown. Do you think that economy has peaked and what does that mean for  euro?</p><p> PATEL: Yes, it's kind of with (ph) because I think we went 2018 with sort  of overexuberant expectations. So the economy has underperformed and  underperformed a bit more than we expected relative to high expectations.  What you now look at and what we look at as sort of the (inaudible) for the  Eurozone, that's at its sort of three, four-year low. So the only way that  we can see that sort of worsening is if this is a more structural sort of  slowdown in the Eurozone economy. But if it's cyclical, we would expect the  expectations to adjust (ph) lower and surge (ph) and in line with the data.  And that, in itself, should keep the euro supported. So I think the euro is  probably running on hot air at the start of the year but were back to sort  of more at normal levels, I would say, but not that -- nothing that should  take the euro any further though in our view.</p><p> LACQUA: Yes. What does that mean for central banks? So the central banks  kind of -- we've been talking about the normalizing for quite some time. Do  you think, Jim, they need the arsenal to deal with the next crisis or  should they temperate down if we're seeing the slowdown kind of  (inaudible)?</p><p> O'NEILL: Well, I think it's a bit of a tag team battle, right? So as a  couple of them have indicated recently, they want to get rates up when they  can. So when the inevitable next problem comes, the (inaudible) will cut  them. But the residue of what's happened in the past decade and the first  signs of a slip, especially if it turns out to be more than just a couple  of months blip, then I think the panic thing for some will set in pretty  quickly. So I think it's going to be a tricky call about the (inaudible) of  how -- outside the U.S., how some of these guys move in the next month or  so?</p><p> LACQUA: What do you expect from the fed, Viraj, and what does it mean for  dollar overall?</p><p> PATEL: We think the fed story is probably priced in, right? The mutual  rate, when you look at the short end of the curve, it's there or thereabout  with the sort of terminal or the end of the fed tightening. So 25 basis  points here or there just doesn't set the dollar trend unless we start to  see inflation in the U.S. escape out of control such that markets -- the  consensus shifts above mutual pricing of the fed cycle, we don't think that  that's going to happen soon. It's really a story about the rest of the  world. That's where the FX markets will take the key from going forward.</p><p> LACQUA: All right. Thank you both. Both will stick around. Jim O'Neill,  Former U.K. Commercial Secretary to the Treasury and incoming Chairman of  Chatham House, and Viraj Patel from ING Bank.</p><p> Still with us, Viraj Patel from ING and Jim O'Neill, former U.K. Commercial  Secretary to the Treasury and incoming Chairman of Chatham House. Once you  become Chairman, we're going to lose all the other titles and make it  hosrter.</p><p> O'NEILL: It sounds very grand, doesn't it?</p><p> LACQUA: It does sound very grand, and, of course, the House of Lords. Lord  Jim, when you look at Iran, is it geopolitics story or is it an old story?</p><p> O'NEILL: I don't know, obviously a bit of both. It seems to me there's all  sorts of tactical things going on as well as strategic things. Yes, you  imagine that the U.S. were eager for the Israelis to say what they just did  (ph) today. And obviously in hindsight, it looks like the French and German  visits to Washington were heavily designed to influence this. Very  interesting for Macron, right? How does he -- he's positioned himself as  this globally outward guy, at the same time, a big (inaudible) of Donald  Trump's, intriguing. So as he made a really smart (inaudible) that he can  rescue some kind of an Iranian deal. It's tough but --</p><p> LACQUA: But, Jim, when you saw headline cross, right, from the Israeli  Prime Minister, who was he speaking to? Was it --</p><p> O'NEILL: I think he was speaking to all of us. I think he was speaking to  the international media and trying to perhaps get the U.S. media more --</p><p> LACQUA: To pick up on it?</p><p> O'NEILL: Yes, I would guess. But underlying, one of -- I remember being at  some Middle Eastern -- a huge Middle Eastern oil event last autumn. And  because of the strength of the world economy, for some reason, I was asked  about oil in this panel. I said, I think it's more likely to be 80 than 40  in one year's time. And that was without any of these. So it seems to me  notwithstanding what we've said earlier about a bit of a slowing of the  world. The world has picked up so much in so many places. The oil market is  in a position that is right to price in some kind of risk of a new  disruption because it's probably that outside (ph), unless we see a lot  more slowing in the world economy, I would have thought.</p><p> LACQUA: Yes. And, Viraj, we did see that the oil price basically spiked up.  Did we see similar moves for oil currencies?</p><p> PATEL: Well, you saw the Canadian dollar sort of have a bit of support. But  I think when you're at these elevated levels, the marginal follow-through  is quite limited especially for the FX markets which kind of takes its cue  right now from the equity and bond market. The oil market is kind of a  second or tertiary flatter (ph) for these currencies.</p><p> LACQUA: Okay. How do you see it panning out? I mean, again, it's so  unpredictable, right? First, because you have President Trump having to  decide on the accord by May 12. But does -- how much? Is it difficult to  price in these big geopolitics moves in currency markets away from the  dollar (ph)?</p><p> O'NEILL: That's what all these guys get paid for.</p><p> LACQUA: (Inaudible) to do it?</p><p> O'NEILL: I used to do that in first (inaudible.)</p><p> LACQUA: But is it a nightmare?</p><p> O'NEILL: That's what it's all about.</p><p> LACQUA: It might have changed, right, in the last 30 years. Now, the world  is much more complicated or am I -- or is it not?</p><p> PATEL: It's interchanging, right? But there is, to some extent, the short- term risk premium priced into the dollar. That's why it's been disconnected  from rates differentials with pretty much six months, six to 12 months. I  think the idea now is just kind of how much can U.S. political uncertainty  elevate to another. And I think what we're seeing is sort of a  consolidation in that uncertainty, but it needs to move massively one way  or the other. All these short-term stories don't take us in either  direction.</p><p> LACQUA: But we used to have Kissinger. Now, you have President Trump that  you have to model. I mean, how do you --</p><p> O'NEILL: Clearly, we've not had a President quite like this. But this idea  that we're in some world of uncertainty, I mean, it's likely rubbish from  what I can see. It's always -- that's what makes markets potentially  interesting for somebody that's good at them. But you cannot try to  anticipate and make some kind of risk adjusted debt which way it's going to  go. I mean, remember if I go back -- my pre-Goldman days arriving in Q8,  the morning after the U.S. had just bombed Iraq. That's what's --</p><p> LACQUA: Good. No, you're right. But then we saw the Koreas, right, on  Friday, you saw the Peninsula. Then you see Russia and the role they're  trying to play in the Middle East. It just feels like we could be going  through a massive shift without really realizing the consequences five  years down the line.</p><p> O'NEILL: I mean, there is lots of media attention to unknown uncertainties.  But this big issue about known unknowns and unknown unknowns and it's a  fact of life. I'm reminded as you asked me of another book that I'd  reviewed actually recently. Remember Hans Rosling, a posthumous book called  Factfulness, which is fantastic. Because it points out just how well the  world has done the past 20-30 years despite all of these things we all  worry about and (inaudible), including Trump and Brexit. There're a lot of  good things that -- such as people living longer and people trying to give  attention to getting new antibiotics. And so, yes, they start to worry  about it. But for me, for the financial markets, that's why these guys get  paid a lot of money to kind of deal with that. Otherwise, what's the point  of the (inaudible)?</p><p> LACQUA: Well, let's see if they're making money in Brexit. Let's give it to  Brexit. Let's change the focus. The U.K. is proposing a new plan to kick  start stalled Brexit talks. It's hoping to make progress on the issue of  the Irish border when negotiations resume in Brussels tomorrow. Speaking at  the Milken Institute conference in California, the former Prime Minister  and remain campaigner, Tony Blair, told me Bloomberg, when it comes to the  customs union, there's no easy solution.</p><p> Okay. Let's get back to Jim and Viraj. Viraj, let me bring you over to a  chart that Hillary Clark, the queen of charts, have kind of made for me  this morning, and this is looking at fair value of sterling. We have a  Bloomberg economics pound fair value estimate. In white, we have IMF U.K.  real effective exchange rate. I mean, what do you look at? Do you just look  at trade weighted?</p><p> PATEL: Trade weighted in terms of -- for the sterling sort of appreciation  in the short-term. But I think when we look at sort of fair value, fair  value is the black box right now when the Brexit sort of end state is still  highly unknown. So I think for us, what we see is this is gravitational  pull, which is sterling is cheap. One of the reasons why we've kind of seen  it as like a long run sort of a move higher. And you're seeing is a  structural repricing of the Brexit tail risk, that the tail risk risk  premium of a cliff edge Brexit in 2019. That's been postponed thanks to  sort of the transition deal. But we're still caught between where it ends.  And I think it just wants to, especially against, say, a clearer  currencies, like the dollar, which is the sort of their trend. It wants to  gradually move higher. The Bank of England story is a short-term story. It  doesn't actually affect it from a long run perspective. That's not what is  keeping sort of the pound at these elevated depressed levels.</p><p> LACQUA: Okay. I do want to ask you about Governor Carney and the label that  he's got, fairly or unfairly, but the unreliable boyfriend. But first of  all, do you think it will all play out in parliament? But actually we talk  about Brexit but the people.</p><p> O'NEILL: My colleagues goes a bit at first last night in the house.</p><p> LACQUA: They did. But will they decide yes or no, actually, Brexit goes  through in the end?</p><p> O'NEILL: It seems to me that there is a growing appetite, although the most  passionate Brexiteers are going to fight it, for some kind of extension of  the customs union going on. Last night though takes some of the attention  away from that in a way but it brings it more to the realities of what  (inaudible) tactics are and notwithstanding Amber Rudd's disappearance, so  the cabinet balance has shifted a bit. But I smell that some kind of  extension or underlying replication of the customs union is the way that  things are shifting.</p><p> LACQUA: Okay. In 30 seconds, do you expect to hike from BOE in May?</p><p> PATEL: Not officially, but it's not dead and buried. I think it's just more  about sentiment just coming back on when -- it's moving in line with data.  Data will drive the pound, not political directions.</p><p> LACQUA: All right. Thank you both for joining us. Viraj Patel, FX  Strategist at ING Bank. They're on some pretty bold pound moves in the  past. And Jim O'Neill, former U.K. Commercial Secretary to the Treasury,  incoming Chairman of Chatham, stays with us.</p><p> Jim O'Neill, as we look at these numbers and we're talking a little bit  about Brexit, does that actually have an impact? I mean, should Governor  Carney look through or are we going to see a slowdown because of Brexit?</p><p> O'NEILL: It's like days gone by for me. That should be on the trade floor  talking to the (inaudible).</p><p> LACQUA: Which you're going straightaway, right?</p><p> O'NEILL: I am slightly surprised and my immediate reaction to that is  slightly boring (ph). Because if it was weather related, we should be  getting some stabilization or bounce backs. So that is -- if I were an MPC  voting member and had been thinking about a hike, I might be backing off a  bit.</p><p> LACQUA: Yes. And so just to put that into context, the U.K. manufacturing  slows more than forecast. It's now at a 17-month low and actually does seem  to be adding two signs that the poor first quarter performance of the U.K.  could actually persist. So we'll be back with Jim O'Neill and we also have  the former Chief Executive of Barclays with us to talk Fintech shortly. 437 LACQUA: We're now joined by Antony Jenkins. He's the former Chief Executive  of Barclays, the current Chief Executive of 10x Future Technology, a  Fintech firm that aims to use technology to redefine how banks operate. And  still with us, Jim O'Neill, former Commercial Secretary to the U.K.  Treasury and incoming Chairman for Chatham House. Antony, thank you so much  for joining us. What exactly are you working on? So we have you regularly  on the program every three to four months. What's fundamentally changed  from the last time you were on? You were kind of going deeper into  technologies that you really think will transform the way banks operate.</p><p> ANTONY JENKINS, CHAIRMAN, BITC: It's really fascinating. 2.5 years ago, I  gave a speech actually at Chatham House, which Jim is now Chair, and I  talked about uber moments and financial services, moments where there was  transformation. And since that speech 2.5 years ago, we've seen I think two  of them. So the first is in the growth of mobile banking, which has caused  a phenomenal drop in branch traffic, and that's a problem for the big banks  because they have that cost base to sustain even while customers are going  elsewhere. Secondarily, we've seen a huge rise in crypto. Now, crypto  itself is a huge topic, whether subcategories of that, like the ICO market,  which I think is very interesting. And I think the third uber moment that  we're going to see is about data, who controls data, how that's used, how  that's monetized to solve customer problems. In my business, we basically  rethought how to deliver banking services around the customer data. And  we've made a huge progress in proving that we can deliver the 10x benefit  that we've talked about.</p><p> LACQUA: What does that mean? Do you sell it to the big banks, because if  you look at Uber, Airbnb, it's things that directly impact me as a  consumer? But actually Fintech, will it change fundamentally my experience  with the bank, is it challenger banks or is it kind of the old way but it's  stuff that I don't realize is going?</p><p> JENKINS: So I think the trend is going to be that consumers are going to  embrace services that make their lives much better. How do you make your  life better in banking? Firstly, you make it just easier, all the paperwork  and forms you have to get at to get a mortgage take that away. Secondarily,  you make it instant because everybody wants their problems solved  instantly. Thirdly, you make it more cost effective by better pricing  decisions, eliminating things like fraud. And what our platform does is  deliver that but we do it through a third party. So we're a B2B2C business.  We can do it through banks and we're mostly talking to banks at the moment.  We can also do it through people who have digitally engaged customer base.</p><p> LACQUA: But, for me, to get a mortgage easier or to get a decision quicker,  does it not mean that I have to give up all of my data so the bank can make  an informed decision in 2.5 seconds?</p><p> JENKINS: Somebody has to take your data, collect it, curate it and put it  together in a way that works for you. Now, if you think about how it works  today, your data is fragmented and spread across hundreds of different  sources, probably thousands of different sources, employment, education,  healthcare, financial, all of those things. And those things are assembled  rather painfully and slowly today through things like credit bureaus. I  mean, credit bureaus have an imperfect snapshot of you as a credit risk.  The more you can collect that data and make better decisions, the better  they customer will be. At the moment, it's very difficult to do that  because the data is so fragmented. But the new technologies allow those  things to be collected and curated much more efficiently.</p><p> LACQUA: Do you look at Fintech, Jim?</p><p> O'NEILL: I think about it a lot. But because part of the many things about  the change in (inaudible), certainly my new life as Chairman at Chatham  House, it's something I think we should with many other things, be it the  forefront of the right thing to do, whatever that is globally. So, yes,  it's something I do think about. And before I had my investment trust, I  made some personal direct investments and some of the emerging players. So,  yes, I assume my trust is to all --</p><p> LACQUA: I'm sure they're watching. So I'm sure they are probably trying to  do the right thing. Are big banks thinking about this and are they thinking  about it in the right way?</p><p> JENKINS: Yes. So in the course of my business, I speak to be banks all  around the world. I would say, the big change between now and 2.5 years ago  is that the banks are now aware of this issue and they are worried about  it. And so they're all thinking about how can we transform. They've done a  job of innovation and mobile banking is a great example of innovation in  banking. But it's painful, it's slow and expensive. Transformation is  something completely different. You have to rebuild from scratch. And many  banks are thinking about that now.</p><p> O'NEILL: There's not the dilemma, right, we're talking (inaudible) big  banks, just a shift quickly. It's just really a hard thing to do that.</p><p> JENKINS: The only way you can do it is if you take a bunch of resources and  put them off to the side and just let them have their head. But as we know  from other industries, it's very unusual for incumbents to be able to  reinvent themselves.</p><p> LACQUA: What does it mean for the banks? Do they have to consolidate? And  we also have a story on the Bloomberg talking about transfer-wise now  joining the banks in the U.K. payment system. If a lot of these kind of  banking services are opened up, where does it leave the big banks?</p><p> JENKINS: Well, of course, what's happening is the barriers to entry are  massively falling. To support a big bank 10 or 15 years ago, you need to  run huge datacenters you don't need to do and you do it in the cloud now.  And as those barriers to entry fall, it exposes the flanks of the banks to  people who can create better more effective customer experience using  technologies. And so what is the response for a bank? I think there are  very few things the bank can do. They've got to keep elevating in their  core business. But recommendation would be take some resources, set them  outside the existing organization and let them build the future,  unconstrained by the cultural and other restrictions of the main  organization.</p><p> LACQUA: Jim, is it impossible to figure out the jobs of tomorrow? I'm  thinking of A.I. I'm thinking about the future of transport. I'm thinking  of Fintech. How do we train the workforce of today to have jobs in 15 to 20  year?</p><p> O'NEILL: I have contradictory views in my own head about this. The biggest  one is that I don't think it's right to worry so much about one of the jobs  tomorrow. Who would have dreamt 25 years ago that Apple and Google would  have been the kind of things that they are today or the kind of employers  that we have in areas that are employing a lot of people. (Inaudible) very  importantly, the big surprise the past decade in this country, not with all  the chaos that's going on, is just how strong employment is. And you could  have some of these arguments about job displacements a decade ago.</p><p> LACQUA: But certain people feel left out.</p><p> O'NEILL: So the flipside is, of course, and I see a lot with my northern  powerhouse hat on, when you've got a local community that has been  dominated by a big employer that is being arbitraged away in some areas  like this, the consequences are a bit like, what will happen when we lost  all the pit villages and steel mills in various parts of the country, and  dealing with that on a social perspective is tough. So the other part of  your life, we need some much more imaginative and more serious focus on  skills that don't equate to going to Oxford and Cambridge, in my view.</p><p> LACQUA: Which is apprenticeships?</p><p> JENKINS: Yes. And as Chair of the Institute for Apprenticeships, that's one  of the other things that I work on. I think, Francine, the key to this is  not to try and predict the future because you're always wrong. But we do  know the skills -- the sorts of skills that people need. People need to be  more entrepreneurial. They're living longer and the world of work is  changing faster. So they need to be able to re-skill themselves many times  in their lives. We know people need to be creative, they need to be able to  collaborate, to do things that humans are good at, right, to create new  things, new opportunities. And these are areas where we need to build into  our educational system. So we need to get our systems aware of that. But I  do think there's a huge demand in this country for engineering talent and  software. I mean, I've got a software business, I need engineers. They're  impossible to hire in London. We need to develop centers of excellence for  engineering in places like the north (ph) where we've got fantastic  universities, we've got great talent and people love living there. So I am  actually quite positive about this for the U.K. if we act now.</p><p> LACQUA: All right. But -- I mean, want to study it or they don't want to  study it? I guess it's getting people interested in this subject matter,  right?</p><p> JENKINS: Yes. People think it's just all bits and bytes, but it's not. It's  problem solving, right? Now, you do need a certain level of math attainment  to write code and do engineering, but it's a fascinating work. And you  could be on the forefront of changing huge aspects of our lives.</p><p> O'NEILL: Tangentially, getting back to my life in antibiotics, a couple of  months ago, I went to open a new antimicrobial resistance research center  in a place on the edge, just in Cheshire, South of Manchester. It's on the  old AstraZeneca site. But the end of the week, I was there. The number of  high paid people working on that site was actually bigger than  AstraZeneca's peak. So there's lots of things going on there that relates  to the north, so called four prime areas, life sciences. Using modern  technology, for example, is a probably enormous future employer of talent  would be my guess.</p><p> LACQUA: Blockchain, what will blockchain become? How many questions you get  about cryptocurrencies? And you always try and kind of bring you back to  blockchain.</p><p> JENKINS: No. I think crypto is fascinating use case for what is probably  going to be the most defining technology over the next hundred years, which  is distributed ledger technology. If you think about most of the systems in  our life, they rely on centralization. So if you want to make a payment in  this country, you go to a system like chats or faster payments, and there's  many, many parties in the middle. Using restricted ledger technology, you  don't need to do that at all. So it's faster, cheaper, more secure. Now,  crypto is just the first incarnation of that. We can debate whether it's  going to be a massive that's going to be in future (ph). Personally, I  think there is a market for cryptocurrencies. I think the ability to trade,  to support international trade with crypto, to take out the friction and  the cost that goes along with that is very important and could help global  GDP. I also believe that the connection of these technologies, and what Jim  referred to a moment ago about biotech, I mean, these technologies don't  exist in a vacuum. They come together and they stack on top of each other.  Why can we have driverless cars now? It's not just because of tech. it is  because you've got 5G coming in, it's because you've got LIDAR and all the  radar technologies improving. It's the same here, internet of things, which  allows you to track to physical and then finance them along the supply  chain combined with a distributed ledger for its huge economic  opportunities.</p><p> LACQUA: Can regulators keep up?</p><p> O'NEILL: Can they ever?</p><p> JENKINS: I think that's a genuine question. Because if you think about the  internet, nobody really regulates the internet. There's a set of protocols  that allow computers to talk to each other. But there isn't a sort of  department for the internet globally. And that some of these financial  transmission mechanism become global, regulation is going to become  increasingly difficult. And it will be a balance between the benefit that  these systems bring and the loss of control that nations face.</p><p> LACQUA: Antony, who do you think should regulate cryptocurrencies? The G20,  there was a push from the European Central Bank and G20 kind of shied away  from it. Does it have to be domestic? Do you think it should be regulated?</p><p> JENKINS: I think in a way, it's too soon to say. I do think that  (inaudible) to self-regulation is going to be incredibly important here,  particularly as you say, where regulators are increasingly racing to keep  up with the tech. So self-regulation becomes very important. And I think  it's a little early to say whether we're going to have an overarching  regulatory body for crypto, for example.</p><p> LACQUA: Do you think we're --</p><p> O'NEILL: Like Antony's answer, I don't, I think, have too strong a view  about the right way to do it is dangerous. In fact, part of the problem of  regulation, in general, for my adult life is they kind of don't and they  come like a battering ram and they end up overregulating yesterday's  problems. So obviously we need way -- but if you look at the Facebook, the  whole Facebook issue, I mean, clearly, something has got to change.  Listening to Antony early, maybe added to one of my beliefs that I have a  suspicion that individual might end up having to pay. Facebook's future  model might be -- people pay to have access, which would certainly  influence some of these issues. But it's very hard to be overly  prescriptive is exactly what's the right thing. But the scale of change  going on, it will be my guess.</p><p> JENKINS: I think they may -- I think you're right, Jim. They might pay but  they're going to get much more back in terms of value they don't get  because that value --</p><p> O'NEILL: By the price mechanism.</p><p> JENKINS: Exactly.</p><p> O'NEILL: So it is up.</p><p> LACQUA: Okay. But where are these -- all of these technology companies,  where do you see them going? Does it impact your world? Actually, I know  it's kind of like at the margins. But do you see Facebook becoming a bang  or because of the concerns we've had about data protection. That's now  something that is more unlikely than it was six months ago.</p><p> JENKINS: I think it's -- my view is that it's quite unlikely that the big  tech companies would want to become banks as we know them because it's a  highly regulated space, and frankly, it's a low return space. I mean, when  you're at a high returns space, why would you deploy a high capital in a  low return space. It wouldn't make any economic sense. But I do think  what's interesting is if you accept that data is going to be what drives  the future, people who are good at data are going to be good at doing  financials. We all go into shopping sites, like Amazon, and these ten  recommendations of things you brought before. That's a very, very early  version of what could happen with your financial life. For most people,  their financial life is a tedious thing that they don't really want to  spend time on. If you could have an intelligent agent do that for you,  wouldn't we all love that? And if we see --</p><p> O'NEILL: I wouldn't be surprised in the wealth management space where it's  also not super returns but at least it's more stable and relatively easy to  get returns. So I have a suspicion that some of them might get into that  part of finance. But standard banking is too low returns.</p><p> JENKINS: The separation of the customer relationship from the balance  sheet, that's the key. And if you've seen that in other areas, like  shopping, like content, that you don't have to make all the content to sell  it to customers when you position it at exactly the right time for them.</p><p> LACQUA: Antony, thank you so much. Antony Jenkins there, former Chief  Executive of Barclays and Founder and Executive Chairman of 10x Futures  Technology. Jim O'Neill stays with us and we'll be talking a little bit  about microbiology.</p><p> Now, let's talk about Jim O'Neill's new book coming out, actually came out  on Thursday, Superbugs: An Arms Race Against Bacteria. Still with us Jim  O'Neill and Antony Jenkins. Jim, this is something that you've just  actually been working on for quite some time. And your premise is that  we're oversubscribing antibiotics, which means that we have then these  superbugs that we can't treat.</p><p> O'NEILL: So there're ten different areas and it's -- we don't have time to  go into them all. But at the core of it is we treat these things like  sweets. We have to learn, in my generation, that they are a miracle cure  but only if you use them when we have a bacterial infection, in the U.K.,  the U.S., where we have decent health systems, at least 30% over  prescription. And going back to what we've chatted about before and where  Antony is in the middle of, we need modern technology through diagnostics  to force and our doctors to not have an antibiotic unless there is clear  evidence that it's necessarily. As an aside (ph), it will dramatically  reduce the pressure on the health service.</p><p> LACQUA: Okay. So is the U.S. the biggest defender? And actually, how much  do these technologies cost? It all boils down to NHS, how much money you  have.</p><p> O'NEILL: In food, the U.S. is a horrific offender. Europe is one of the few  areas where Europe is better than the U.S. in most things in life. In China  and India, they're bad on both.</p><p> LACQUA: And we have the technology.</p><p> JENKINS: Yes. And there's definitely tech sold (ph) for this. I mean, I've  got a colleague who works for me. He used to work in health centers. They  came up with an A.I. program that could save 40,000 stroke deaths a year.  So 40,000 lives saved, but also think of the save in resources against  those. So if we can use technology to be more predictive, then we don't  need to go down at (inaudible).</p><p> LACQUA: Antony and Jim, thank you so much for your time. We'll have plenty  more in this book and, of course, treasuries.

Trade, let's start with trade. Jim, how much focus do  you do on trade? And when you take over as Chairman of Chatham House, how  much do you think -- how many lectures or how many sessions and seminars  will there be on U.S.-China relationships?</p><p>O'NEILL: A lot. Judging by the emails I've received with the news about me  becoming Chair, a large number of them have got to do with issues about  China, especially China's engagement with the rest of the world. So that's  one of the reasons I think I was asked to do it, so it's hugely important.  It's hugely important.</p><p>LACQUA: Viraj, when you look at the currency markets and you kind of fold  in to geopolitics and a bit of trade, do we just assume right now that  actually the allies will be exempted? It was kind of -- we thought it was  an America-first policy. And then as time progresses, President Trump is  kind of backtracking, saying, but you're an ally, you'll be fine. You're an  ally, you'll be fine.</p><p>VIRAJ PATEL, FX STRATEGIST, ING BANK: Yes. But it's a thorn in the side of  FX markets. So I think this is only in the mid placed (ph) until June the  1st. So you've always got this perennial uncertainty. But what it's done is  -- it's ambiguous. It's not some of the global as global animal spirits  started those pro-cyclical currencies, like the euro, that have been  benefitting on sort of cycles. Now, that's -- the idea there is that can we  look through that? Will investors -- will activity, really activity look  through that and sort of the second quarter activity news (ph), so it  bounce back. We get on back on track with the normalization story that  fuelled the euro sort of upward swing, that's our base case, that's what  we're looking forward.</p><p>LACQUA: Jim, do you worry that global growth has peaked? And I don't  whether it's a trade question or whether it's just, in general, we kind of  reached the (inaudible).</p><p>O'NEILL: With the usual caveat, one among here that I don't look at this  stuff as much or as closely as they do, it is still in my veins, so I do.  And actually probably with Chatham House, I'll probably look at it more. It  looks that way. I mean, these five things I say every time I'm here, I look  at every month whenever I see those five things and I think I know exactly  what's going on with the world and both slowed. Some of it's actually  surprisingly in Europe, most of it. And I don't really understand that.  It's not from the lead leading indicators that I'm used to. It wasn't  predictable that Europe had just suddenly slowed, so it could weather  related. I think here in the U.K., a lot of it is almost definitely weather  related. So I wouldn't -- I think today, we get the PMI, don't we? It would  be very interesting to see if you've got any kind of bounce back in some  places, because I'm suspicious that the slowdown is temporary, but it  certainly looks like the world has slowed since (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. Viraj, I think last time you were on, we were talking about  the German economy overheating, and suddenly we're talking about a possible  slowdown. Do you think that economy has peaked and what does that mean for  euro?</p><p>PATEL: Yes, it's kind of with (ph) because I think we went 2018 with sort  of overexuberant expectations. So the economy has underperformed and  underperformed a bit more than we expected relative to high expectations.  What you now look at and what we look at as sort of the (inaudible) for the  Eurozone, that's at its sort of three, four-year low. So the only way that  we can see that sort of worsening is if this is a more structural sort of  slowdown in the Eurozone economy. But if it's cyclical, we would expect the  expectations to adjust (ph) lower and surge (ph) and in line with the data.  And that, in itself, should keep the euro supported. So I think the euro is  probably running on hot air at the start of the year but were back to sort  of more at normal levels, I would say, but not that -- nothing that should  take the euro any further though in our view.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. What does that mean for central banks? So the central banks  kind of -- we've been talking about the normalizing for quite some time. Do  you think, Jim, they need the arsenal to deal with the next crisis or  should they temperate down if we're seeing the slowdown kind of  (inaudible)?</p><p>O'NEILL: Well, I think it's a bit of a tag team battle, right? So as a  couple of them have indicated recently, they want to get rates up when they  can. So when the inevitable next problem comes, the (inaudible) will cut  them. But the residue of what's happened in the past decade and the first  signs of a slip, especially if it turns out to be more than just a couple  of months blip, then I think the panic thing for some will set in pretty  quickly. So I think it's going to be a tricky call about the (inaudible) of  how -- outside the U.S., how some of these guys move in the next month or  so?</p><p>LACQUA: What do you expect from the fed, Viraj, and what does it mean for  dollar overall?</p><p>PATEL: We think the fed story is probably priced in, right? The mutual  rate, when you look at the short end of the curve, it's there or thereabout  with the sort of terminal or the end of the fed tightening. So 25 basis  points here or there just doesn't set the dollar trend unless we start to  see inflation in the U.S. escape out of control such that markets -- the  consensus shifts above mutual pricing of the fed cycle, we don't think that  that's going to happen soon. It's really a story about the rest of the  world. That's where the FX markets will take the key from going forward.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Thank you both. Both will stick around. Jim O'Neill,  Former U.K. Commercial Secretary to the Treasury and incoming Chairman of  Chatham House, and Viraj Patel from ING Bank.</p><p>Still with us, Viraj Patel from ING and Jim O'Neill, former U.K. Commercial  Secretary to the Treasury and incoming Chairman of Chatham House. Once you  become Chairman, we're going to lose all the other titles and make it  hosrter.</p><p>O'NEILL: It sounds very grand, doesn't it?</p><p>LACQUA: It does sound very grand, and, of course, the House of Lords. Lord  Jim, when you look at Iran, is it geopolitics story or is it an old story?</p><p>O'NEILL: I don't know, obviously a bit of both. It seems to me there's all  sorts of tactical things going on as well as strategic things. Yes, you  imagine that the U.S. were eager for the Israelis to say what they just did  (ph) today. And obviously in hindsight, it looks like the French and German  visits to Washington were heavily designed to influence this. Very  interesting for Macron, right? How does he -- he's positioned himself as  this globally outward guy, at the same time, a big (inaudible) of Donald  Trump's, intriguing. So as he made a really smart (inaudible) that he can  rescue some kind of an Iranian deal. It's tough but --</p><p>LACQUA: But, Jim, when you saw headline cross, right, from the Israeli  Prime Minister, who was he speaking to? Was it --</p><p>O'NEILL: I think he was speaking to all of us. I think he was speaking to  the international media and trying to perhaps get the U.S. media more --</p><p>LACQUA: To pick up on it?</p><p>O'NEILL: Yes, I would guess. But underlying, one of -- I remember being at  some Middle Eastern -- a huge Middle Eastern oil event last autumn. And  because of the strength of the world economy, for some reason, I was asked  about oil in this panel. I said, I think it's more likely to be 80 than 40  in one year's time. And that was without any of these. So it seems to me  notwithstanding what we've said earlier about a bit of a slowing of the  world. The world has picked up so much in so many places. The oil market is  in a position that is right to price in some kind of risk of a new  disruption because it's probably that outside (ph), unless we see a lot  more slowing in the world economy, I would have thought.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. And, Viraj, we did see that the oil price basically spiked up.  Did we see similar moves for oil currencies?</p><p>PATEL: Well, you saw the Canadian dollar sort of have a bit of support. But  I think when you're at these elevated levels, the marginal follow-through  is quite limited especially for the FX markets which kind of takes its cue  right now from the equity and bond market. The oil market is kind of a  second or tertiary flatter (ph) for these currencies.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. How do you see it panning out? I mean, again, it's so  unpredictable, right? First, because you have President Trump having to  decide on the accord by May 12. But does -- how much? Is it difficult to  price in these big geopolitics moves in currency markets away from the  dollar (ph)?</p><p>O'NEILL: That's what all these guys get paid for.</p><p>LACQUA: (Inaudible) to do it?</p><p>O'NEILL: I used to do that in first (inaudible.)</p><p>LACQUA: But is it a nightmare?</p><p>O'NEILL: That's what it's all about.</p><p>LACQUA: It might have changed, right, in the last 30 years. Now, the world  is much more complicated or am I -- or is it not?</p><p>PATEL: It's interchanging, right? But there is, to some extent, the short- term risk premium priced into the dollar. That's why it's been disconnected  from rates differentials with pretty much six months, six to 12 months. I  think the idea now is just kind of how much can U.S. political uncertainty  elevate to another. And I think what we're seeing is sort of a  consolidation in that uncertainty, but it needs to move massively one way  or the other. All these short-term stories don't take us in either  direction.</p><p>LACQUA: But we used to have Kissinger. Now, you have President Trump that  you have to model. I mean, how do you --</p><p>O'NEILL: Clearly, we've not had a President quite like this. But this idea  that we're in some world of uncertainty, I mean, it's likely rubbish from  what I can see. It's always -- that's what makes markets potentially  interesting for somebody that's good at them. But you cannot try to  anticipate and make some kind of risk adjusted debt which way it's going to  go. I mean, remember if I go back -- my pre-Goldman days arriving in Q8,  the morning after the U.S. had just bombed Iraq. That's what's --</p><p>LACQUA: Good. No, you're right. But then we saw the Koreas, right, on  Friday, you saw the Peninsula. Then you see Russia and the role they're  trying to play in the Middle East. It just feels like we could be going  through a massive shift without really realizing the consequences five  years down the line.</p><p>O'NEILL: I mean, there is lots of media attention to unknown uncertainties.  But this big issue about known unknowns and unknown unknowns and it's a  fact of life. I'm reminded as you asked me of another book that I'd  reviewed actually recently. Remember Hans Rosling, a posthumous book called  Factfulness, which is fantastic. Because it points out just how well the  world has done the past 20-30 years despite all of these things we all  worry about and (inaudible), including Trump and Brexit. There're a lot of  good things that -- such as people living longer and people trying to give  attention to getting new antibiotics. And so, yes, they start to worry  about it. But for me, for the financial markets, that's why these guys get  paid a lot of money to kind of deal with that. Otherwise, what's the point  of the (inaudible)?</p><p>LACQUA: Well, let's see if they're making money in Brexit. Let's give it to  Brexit. Let's change the focus. The U.K. is proposing a new plan to kick  start stalled Brexit talks. It's hoping to make progress on the issue of  the Irish border when negotiations resume in Brussels tomorrow. Speaking at  the Milken Institute conference in California, the former Prime Minister  and remain campaigner, Tony Blair, told me Bloomberg, when it comes to the  customs union, there's no easy solution.</p><p>Okay. Let's get back to Jim and Viraj. Viraj, let me bring you over to a  chart that Hillary Clark, the queen of charts, have kind of made for me  this morning, and this is looking at fair value of sterling. We have a  Bloomberg economics pound fair value estimate. In white, we have IMF U.K.  real effective exchange rate. I mean, what do you look at? Do you just look  at trade weighted?</p><p>PATEL: Trade weighted in terms of -- for the sterling sort of appreciation  in the short-term. But I think when we look at sort of fair value, fair  value is the black box right now when the Brexit sort of end state is still  highly unknown. So I think for us, what we see is this is gravitational  pull, which is sterling is cheap. One of the reasons why we've kind of seen  it as like a long run sort of a move higher. And you're seeing is a  structural repricing of the Brexit tail risk, that the tail risk risk  premium of a cliff edge Brexit in 2019. That's been postponed thanks to  sort of the transition deal. But we're still caught between where it ends.  And I think it just wants to, especially against, say, a clearer  currencies, like the dollar, which is the sort of their trend. It wants to  gradually move higher. The Bank of England story is a short-term story. It  doesn't actually affect it from a long run perspective. That's not what is  keeping sort of the pound at these elevated depressed levels.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. I do want to ask you about Governor Carney and the label that  he's got, fairly or unfairly, but the unreliable boyfriend. But first of  all, do you think it will all play out in parliament? But actually we talk  about Brexit but the people.</p><p>O'NEILL: My colleagues goes a bit at first last night in the house.</p><p>LACQUA: They did. But will they decide yes or no, actually, Brexit goes  through in the end?</p><p>O'NEILL: It seems to me that there is a growing appetite, although the most  passionate Brexiteers are going to fight it, for some kind of extension of  the customs union going on. Last night though takes some of the attention  away from that in a way but it brings it more to the realities of what  (inaudible) tactics are and notwithstanding Amber Rudd's disappearance, so  the cabinet balance has shifted a bit. But I smell that some kind of  extension or underlying replication of the customs union is the way that  things are shifting.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. In 30 seconds, do you expect to hike from BOE in May?</p><p>PATEL: Not officially, but it's not dead and buried. I think it's just more  about sentiment just coming back on when -- it's moving in line with data.  Data will drive the pound, not political directions.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Thank you both for joining us. Viraj Patel, FX  Strategist at ING Bank. They're on some pretty bold pound moves in the  past. And Jim O'Neill, former U.K. Commercial Secretary to the Treasury,  incoming Chairman of Chatham, stays with us.</p><p>Jim O'Neill, as we look at these numbers and we're talking a little bit  about Brexit, does that actually have an impact? I mean, should Governor  Carney look through or are we going to see a slowdown because of Brexit?</p><p>O'NEILL: It's like days gone by for me. That should be on the trade floor  talking to the (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: Which you're going straightaway, right?</p><p>O'NEILL: I am slightly surprised and my immediate reaction to that is  slightly boring (ph). Because if it was weather related, we should be  getting some stabilization or bounce backs. So that is -- if I were an MPC  voting member and had been thinking about a hike, I might be backing off a  bit.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. And so just to put that into context, the U.K. manufacturing  slows more than forecast. It's now at a 17-month low and actually does seem  to be adding two signs that the poor first quarter performance of the U.K.  could actually persist. So we'll be back with Jim O'Neill and we also have  the former Chief Executive of Barclays with us to talk Fintech shortly. 437 LACQUA: We're now joined by Antony Jenkins. He's the former Chief Executive  of Barclays, the current Chief Executive of 10x Future Technology, a  Fintech firm that aims to use technology to redefine how banks operate. And  still with us, Jim O'Neill, former Commercial Secretary to the U.K.  Treasury and incoming Chairman for Chatham House. Antony, thank you so much  for joining us. What exactly are you working on? So we have you regularly  on the program every three to four months. What's fundamentally changed  from the last time you were on? You were kind of going deeper into  technologies that you really think will transform the way banks operate.</p><p>ANTONY JENKINS, CHAIRMAN, BITC: It's really fascinating. 2.5 years ago, I  gave a speech actually at Chatham House, which Jim is now Chair, and I  talked about uber moments and financial services, moments where there was  transformation. And since that speech 2.5 years ago, we've seen I think two  of them. So the first is in the growth of mobile banking, which has caused  a phenomenal drop in branch traffic, and that's a problem for the big banks  because they have that cost base to sustain even while customers are going  elsewhere. Secondarily, we've seen a huge rise in crypto. Now, crypto  itself is a huge topic, whether subcategories of that, like the ICO market,  which I think is very interesting. And I think the third uber moment that  we're going to see is about data, who controls data, how that's used, how  that's monetized to solve customer problems. In my business, we basically  rethought how to deliver banking services around the customer data. And  we've made a huge progress in proving that we can deliver the 10x benefit  that we've talked about.</p><p>LACQUA: What does that mean? Do you sell it to the big banks, because if  you look at Uber, Airbnb, it's things that directly impact me as a  consumer? But actually Fintech, will it change fundamentally my experience  with the bank, is it challenger banks or is it kind of the old way but it's  stuff that I don't realize is going?</p><p>JENKINS: So I think the trend is going to be that consumers are going to  embrace services that make their lives much better. How do you make your  life better in banking? Firstly, you make it just easier, all the paperwork  and forms you have to get at to get a mortgage take that away. Secondarily,  you make it instant because everybody wants their problems solved  instantly. Thirdly, you make it more cost effective by better pricing  decisions, eliminating things like fraud. And what our platform does is  deliver that but we do it through a third party. So we're a B2B2C business.  We can do it through banks and we're mostly talking to banks at the moment.  We can also do it through people who have digitally engaged customer base.</p><p>LACQUA: But, for me, to get a mortgage easier or to get a decision quicker,  does it not mean that I have to give up all of my data so the bank can make  an informed decision in 2.5 seconds?</p><p>JENKINS: Somebody has to take your data, collect it, curate it and put it  together in a way that works for you. Now, if you think about how it works  today, your data is fragmented and spread across hundreds of different  sources, probably thousands of different sources, employment, education,  healthcare, financial, all of those things. And those things are assembled  rather painfully and slowly today through things like credit bureaus. I  mean, credit bureaus have an imperfect snapshot of you as a credit risk.  The more you can collect that data and make better decisions, the better  they customer will be. At the moment, it's very difficult to do that  because the data is so fragmented. But the new technologies allow those  things to be collected and curated much more efficiently.</p><p>LACQUA: Do you look at Fintech, Jim?</p><p>O'NEILL: I think about it a lot. But because part of the many things about  the change in (inaudible), certainly my new life as Chairman at Chatham  House, it's something I think we should with many other things, be it the  forefront of the right thing to do, whatever that is globally. So, yes,  it's something I do think about. And before I had my investment trust, I  made some personal direct investments and some of the emerging players. So,  yes, I assume my trust is to all --</p><p>LACQUA: I'm sure they're watching. So I'm sure they are probably trying to  do the right thing. Are big banks thinking about this and are they thinking  about it in the right way?</p><p>JENKINS: Yes. So in the course of my business, I speak to be banks all  around the world. I would say, the big change between now and 2.5 years ago  is that the banks are now aware of this issue and they are worried about  it. And so they're all thinking about how can we transform. They've done a  job of innovation and mobile banking is a great example of innovation in  banking. But it's painful, it's slow and expensive. Transformation is  something completely different. You have to rebuild from scratch. And many  banks are thinking about that now.</p><p>O'NEILL: There's not the dilemma, right, we're talking (inaudible) big  banks, just a shift quickly. It's just really a hard thing to do that.</p><p>JENKINS: The only way you can do it is if you take a bunch of resources and  put them off to the side and just let them have their head. But as we know  from other industries, it's very unusual for incumbents to be able to  reinvent themselves.</p><p>LACQUA: What does it mean for the banks? Do they have to consolidate? And  we also have a story on the Bloomberg talking about transfer-wise now  joining the banks in the U.K. payment system. If a lot of these kind of  banking services are opened up, where does it leave the big banks?</p><p>JENKINS: Well, of course, what's happening is the barriers to entry are  massively falling. To support a big bank 10 or 15 years ago, you need to  run huge datacenters you don't need to do and you do it in the cloud now.  And as those barriers to entry fall, it exposes the flanks of the banks to  people who can create better more effective customer experience using  technologies. And so what is the response for a bank? I think there are  very few things the bank can do. They've got to keep elevating in their  core business. But recommendation would be take some resources, set them  outside the existing organization and let them build the future,  unconstrained by the cultural and other restrictions of the main  organization.</p><p>LACQUA: Jim, is it impossible to figure out the jobs of tomorrow? I'm  thinking of A.I. I'm thinking about the future of transport. I'm thinking  of Fintech. How do we train the workforce of today to have jobs in 15 to 20  year?</p><p>O'NEILL: I have contradictory views in my own head about this. The biggest  one is that I don't think it's right to worry so much about one of the jobs  tomorrow. Who would have dreamt 25 years ago that Apple and Google would  have been the kind of things that they are today or the kind of employers  that we have in areas that are employing a lot of people. (Inaudible) very  importantly, the big surprise the past decade in this country, not with all  the chaos that's going on, is just how strong employment is. And you could  have some of these arguments about job displacements a decade ago.</p><p>LACQUA: But certain people feel left out.</p><p>O'NEILL: So the flipside is, of course, and I see a lot with my northern  powerhouse hat on, when you've got a local community that has been  dominated by a big employer that is being arbitraged away in some areas  like this, the consequences are a bit like, what will happen when we lost  all the pit villages and steel mills in various parts of the country, and  dealing with that on a social perspective is tough. So the other part of  your life, we need some much more imaginative and more serious focus on  skills that don't equate to going to Oxford and Cambridge, in my view.</p><p>LACQUA: Which is apprenticeships?</p><p>JENKINS: Yes. And as Chair of the Institute for Apprenticeships, that's one  of the other things that I work on. I think, Francine, the key to this is  not to try and predict the future because you're always wrong. But we do  know the skills -- the sorts of skills that people need. People need to be  more entrepreneurial. They're living longer and the world of work is  changing faster. So they need to be able to re-skill themselves many times  in their lives. We know people need to be creative, they need to be able to  collaborate, to do things that humans are good at, right, to create new  things, new opportunities. And these are areas where we need to build into  our educational system. So we need to get our systems aware of that. But I  do think there's a huge demand in this country for engineering talent and  software. I mean, I've got a software business, I need engineers. They're  impossible to hire in London. We need to develop centers of excellence for  engineering in places like the north (ph) where we've got fantastic  universities, we've got great talent and people love living there. So I am  actually quite positive about this for the U.K. if we act now.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. But -- I mean, want to study it or they don't want to  study it? I guess it's getting people interested in this subject matter,  right?</p><p>JENKINS: Yes. People think it's just all bits and bytes, but it's not. It's  problem solving, right? Now, you do need a certain level of math attainment  to write code and do engineering, but it's a fascinating work. And you  could be on the forefront of changing huge aspects of our lives.</p><p>O'NEILL: Tangentially, getting back to my life in antibiotics, a couple of  months ago, I went to open a new antimicrobial resistance research center  in a place on the edge, just in Cheshire, South of Manchester. It's on the  old AstraZeneca site. But the end of the week, I was there. The number of  high paid people working on that site was actually bigger than  AstraZeneca's peak. So there's lots of things going on there that relates  to the north, so called four prime areas, life sciences. Using modern  technology, for example, is a probably enormous future employer of talent  would be my guess.</p><p>LACQUA: Blockchain, what will blockchain become? How many questions you get  about cryptocurrencies? And you always try and kind of bring you back to  blockchain.</p><p>JENKINS: No. I think crypto is fascinating use case for what is probably  going to be the most defining technology over the next hundred years, which  is distributed ledger technology. If you think about most of the systems in  our life, they rely on centralization. So if you want to make a payment in  this country, you go to a system like chats or faster payments, and there's  many, many parties in the middle. Using restricted ledger technology, you  don't need to do that at all. So it's faster, cheaper, more secure. Now,  crypto is just the first incarnation of that. We can debate whether it's  going to be a massive that's going to be in future (ph). Personally, I  think there is a market for cryptocurrencies. I think the ability to trade,  to support international trade with crypto, to take out the friction and  the cost that goes along with that is very important and could help global  GDP. I also believe that the connection of these technologies, and what Jim  referred to a moment ago about biotech, I mean, these technologies don't  exist in a vacuum. They come together and they stack on top of each other.  Why can we have driverless cars now? It's not just because of tech. it is  because you've got 5G coming in, it's because you've got LIDAR and all the  radar technologies improving. It's the same here, internet of things, which  allows you to track to physical and then finance them along the supply  chain combined with a distributed ledger for its huge economic  opportunities.</p><p>LACQUA: Can regulators keep up?</p><p>O'NEILL: Can they ever?</p><p>JENKINS: I think that's a genuine question. Because if you think about the  internet, nobody really regulates the internet. There's a set of protocols  that allow computers to talk to each other. But there isn't a sort of  department for the internet globally. And that some of these financial  transmission mechanism become global, regulation is going to become  increasingly difficult. And it will be a balance between the benefit that  these systems bring and the loss of control that nations face.</p><p>LACQUA: Antony, who do you think should regulate cryptocurrencies? The G20,  there was a push from the European Central Bank and G20 kind of shied away  from it. Does it have to be domestic? Do you think it should be regulated?</p><p>JENKINS: I think in a way, it's too soon to say. I do think that  (inaudible) to self-regulation is going to be incredibly important here,  particularly as you say, where regulators are increasingly racing to keep  up with the tech. So self-regulation becomes very important. And I think  it's a little early to say whether we're going to have an overarching  regulatory body for crypto, for example.</p><p>LACQUA: Do you think we're --</p><p>O'NEILL: Like Antony's answer, I don't, I think, have too strong a view  about the right way to do it is dangerous. In fact, part of the problem of  regulation, in general, for my adult life is they kind of don't and they  come like a battering ram and they end up overregulating yesterday's  problems. So obviously we need way -- but if you look at the Facebook, the  whole Facebook issue, I mean, clearly, something has got to change.  Listening to Antony early, maybe added to one of my beliefs that I have a  suspicion that individual might end up having to pay. Facebook's future  model might be -- people pay to have access, which would certainly  influence some of these issues. But it's very hard to be overly  prescriptive is exactly what's the right thing. But the scale of change  going on, it will be my guess.</p><p>JENKINS: I think they may -- I think you're right, Jim. They might pay but  they're going to get much more back in terms of value they don't get  because that value --</p><p>O'NEILL: By the price mechanism.</p><p>JENKINS: Exactly.</p><p>O'NEILL: So it is up.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. But where are these -- all of these technology companies,  where do you see them going? Does it impact your world? Actually, I know  it's kind of like at the margins. But do you see Facebook becoming a bang  or because of the concerns we've had about data protection. That's now  something that is more unlikely than it was six months ago.</p><p>JENKINS: I think it's -- my view is that it's quite unlikely that the big  tech companies would want to become banks as we know them because it's a  highly regulated space, and frankly, it's a low return space. I mean, when  you're at a high returns space, why would you deploy a high capital in a  low return space. It wouldn't make any economic sense. But I do think  what's interesting is if you accept that data is going to be what drives  the future, people who are good at data are going to be good at doing  financials. We all go into shopping sites, like Amazon, and these ten  recommendations of things you brought before. That's a very, very early  version of what could happen with your financial life. For most people,  their financial life is a tedious thing that they don't really want to  spend time on. If you could have an intelligent agent do that for you,  wouldn't we all love that? And if we see --</p><p>O'NEILL: I wouldn't be surprised in the wealth management space where it's  also not super returns but at least it's more stable and relatively easy to  get returns. So I have a suspicion that some of them might get into that  part of finance. But standard banking is too low returns.</p><p>JENKINS: The separation of the customer relationship from the balance  sheet, that's the key. And if you've seen that in other areas, like  shopping, like content, that you don't have to make all the content to sell  it to customers when you position it at exactly the right time for them.</p><p>LACQUA: Antony, thank you so much. Antony Jenkins there, former Chief  Executive of Barclays and Founder and Executive Chairman of 10x Futures  Technology. Jim O'Neill stays with us and we'll be talking a little bit  about microbiology.</p><p>Now, let's talk about Jim O'Neill's new book coming out, actually came out  on Thursday, Superbugs: An Arms Race Against Bacteria. Still with us Jim  O'Neill and Antony Jenkins. Jim, this is something that you've just  actually been working on for quite some time. And your premise is that  we're oversubscribing antibiotics, which means that we have then these  superbugs that we can't treat.</p><p>O'NEILL: So there're ten different areas and it's -- we don't have time to  go into them all. But at the core of it is we treat these things like  sweets. We have to learn, in my generation, that they are a miracle cure  but only if you use them when we have a bacterial infection, in the U.K.,  the U.S., where we have decent health systems, at least 30% over  prescription. And going back to what we've chatted about before and where  Antony is in the middle of, we need modern technology through diagnostics  to force and our doctors to not have an antibiotic unless there is clear  evidence that it's necessarily. As an aside (ph), it will dramatically  reduce the pressure on the health service.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. So is the U.S. the biggest defender? And actually, how much  do these technologies cost? It all boils down to NHS, how much money you  have.</p><p>O'NEILL: In food, the U.S. is a horrific offender. Europe is one of the few  areas where Europe is better than the U.S. in most things in life. In China  and India, they're bad on both.</p><p>LACQUA: And we have the technology.</p><p>JENKINS: Yes. And there's definitely tech sold (ph) for this. I mean, I've  got a colleague who works for me. He used to work in health centers. They  came up with an A.I. program that could save 40,000 stroke deaths a year.  So 40,000 lives saved, but also think of the save in resources against  those. So if we can use technology to be more predictive, then we don't  need to go down at (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: Antony and Jim, thank you so much for your time. We'll have plenty  more in this book and, of course, treasuries.

Now he's to attempt\u00a0the same for broadband, according to Benjamin Parkin in Mumbai.</p><p>Reliance's service, launched this month, promises\u00a0ultrafast speeds, lower prices and even free TVs for annual subscribers. India\u2019s fragmented broadband market seems ripe for the taking. Reliance Jio plans to compete with existing providers such as Bharti Airtel and sign up new users, with an initial target of 20m homes and 15m businesses.</p><p>This might appear small fry compared to the huge changes Jio brought to India\u2019s mobile market. Since launching in 2016, it has attracted 340m customers, forced some incumbents like Vodafone to consolidate and others, like his brother Anil\u2019s Reliance Communications, out of the sector altogether.

This year marked its 63rd Annual IP Conference. But this year the moon wasn't quite right, so instead some Kat friends appeared in Chicago. Having arrived in an unexpected Halloween snow storm,Amy Crouch (Simmons ...mmons[3], London) was ready to report and excited to be speaking on the afternoon patents panel session. </p><p>Over to Amy: \"After a rousing introduction from Daryl and Susan Posner (Provost UIC), the conference was opened by a keynote address from Hon. Diane Wood (U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit) on the topic of 'Antitrust ...: Does it Need to be Retooled?' Chief Judge Wood explained that, in her view, there are reforms that could be helpful to rejuvenate the intersection between IP and Antitrust law, particularly on the procedural side, but also in some substantive respects. The question to be asked is: has the right balance been struck to date between intervention and restraint? To date the approach taken, whilst not being completely hands off, has been fairly cautious which begs the question as to whether that has been a mistake for 21st century industries. Whilst there are things that can be done to preserve competition as it is in the market, once a tight oligopoly is established, the tools for fixing that are quite limited. This is true in relation to both conventional property and IP. IP is of course a type of property; it is simply harder to define, but for the purposes of antitrust the same analysis is applied: agencies do not presume that IP creates power in the antitrust context, rather it depends on the usual criteria. Importantly, IP is a whole and should be considered that way. However, that is not how it is considered procedurally; where instead patents are carved off into one corner and everything else is dealt with separately. A choppy system is created as patent appeals are dealt with by the Federal Circuit, whereas anything else goes to the state Appeal Courts. This means that all types of cases that deal with patents more generally don't go to the Federal Circuit, for example licensing disputes which end up in the regular Appeal Courts. Another lacuna is created by the fact that the statue dictates that 'compulsory' counter claims for patents fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit, whereas 'permissive' counter claims go to the regional courts. Chief Judge Wood was of the view that this should change so that only one Court has authority over any one patent and that choice should be optional to allow the parties to decide the Court. This would allow the development of different thinking in the Courts. Statistics show that the Supreme Court has suffered from a lack of diversity of thinking in this area. Since 2000, they have affirmed the Federal Circuit 28% of the time and reversed it 72% if the time - so it is clear that there are other views out there. As such, the key procedural reform supported by Chief Judge Wood is to allow IP to be viewed as a whole in the tribunals. In terms of substantive reform it is less clear. Much of the recent commentary in the US is calling for more aggressive intervention, in particularly in relation to big tech companies. Is SEP and FRAND licensing a good way to do this? Whilst this may work for IP, Chief Judge Wood was personally sceptical of how such an approach could be applied to other types of property. The session then continued with a panel session on the same issues, moderated by Daryl . Koren Wong-Ervin (Qualcomm) explained that the Department of Justice Guidelines do highlight that IP is a type of property and also that ease of appropriation will be kept in mind. Whilst ideally there is a desire to provide it to everyone, the incentive to innovate is important. In Koren's view there is a risk of equating the concentration issue with an effect on consumers. The concentration contention is not taking account of relevant antitrust markets but looking at hugely broad categories, not quite in the realm of 'all plastics' / 'all metals' but nearly this extreme in scope. A fundamental flaw in the court's reasoning on SEP compulsory licensing to date is the failure to appreciate that licensing at the device level is more valuable than licensing at the component level, which does not fully value the IP. Andrew Finch (Paul Weiss, previously U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division) explained that there is a sea change from the previous view at the DOJ. The DOJ intervened in the recent FTC v Qualcomm case (in which Judge Koh found in favour of the FTC) and now on appeal. The policy of the current administration and head of the Antitrust Division is in some senses a re-balancing of the risk of hold up versus hold out. All three briefs submitted by the DOJ reflect the view that the failure to licence on FRAND terms does not in itself equate to an antitrust violation. Instead that must depend on what happens in the market. The antitrust movement being seen today is on a scale that hasn't been seen for a hundred years - including presidential debate. The market concentration debate is an important one to be having right now and the DOJ have walked right into that debate; as shown with Qualcomm case, if they don't agree with the FTC in a market of significant importance then then will step in. Milan Kristof (Court of Justice for the EU) explained that interestingly a different approach has been taken in Europe. In the UK the Supreme Court has just heard the appeal on the extraterritoriality and global FRAND issues. From the CJEU's perspective, where a patent holder has given a commitment to license on FRAND terms, and there is a willing potential licensee, then an injunction based on the SEP may be an abuse of dominant position. Steven Geisler (Huawei) commented that it is difficult to even know what best practice is: as a matter of contract or as a matter of antitrust law? It is one thing looking at the appellate level but at the district court level it is clear that different judges have different views. As a result, every party has its own preferred Court and legislative framework that it wants to work through. Economically there is also a very important debate about licensing at the device level versus licensing at the component level. The current Qualcomm case clearly shows that the FTC are one side philosophically and the DOJ are on the other side. Anne Gron (Alix Partners) gave the economist viewpoint, being asked to what extent should we be concerned that the likes of Google, Amazon and Facebook have a huge proportion of data? Should they be under an obligation to share it with other companies who might need it? In Anne's view there is a concern that reduced competition in markets with strong digital platforms can harm consumers. 'Tippy' markets are often seen in areas of strong IP; such markets tend to tip to one platform. This results in periods of intense competition until the market tips and there is then a period of waiting for new platforms to come up. One particular concern is that companies with strong data platforms can use their position in the market and data collected to acquire competitors before they are large enough to come to the regulator's attention as a likely 'competitor'. These are sometimes called 'killer acquisitions' as the platform acquired is often then shelved and not developed any further. This can often be identified more easily in the pharma industry than the tech industry. Whilst there are of course arguments that start-ups want to be bought, the concerns of economists are that the power of the dominant companies is very strong. Asked about whether the US Courts should do something to disseminate technology and facilitate access to platforms, Chief Judge Wood stated that abuse of dominance assessments may be best carried out by an administrative agency as is the case with the European Commission. In the US, if a monopoly is found to exist then all the Courts can do is break it up. The European Commission, on the other hand, has a more flexible toolkit and can impose a civil fine, such as Google's \u20ac2.4 billion fine - which even they must feel in their balance sheet! Milan Kristof commented that the Google decision is being appealed and so we will see what the General Court thinks about that in due course. He also noted that the European Commission is investigating Amazon over the issue of owning the platform on which its own products sell well. Asked about the fact that the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over patents, but that the judges clearly have very different views and what can be done to reconcile this, Koren noted that she was surprised that in the FTC v Qualcomm case there was not more reference to other Federal Circuit cases. Steven commented that it should be kept in mind that SEPs are either owned by a larger innovator company or may have been sold to a NPE. In the German related case to the UK Unwired Planet case, the patents were sold with a view to extracting a high royalty rate but without passing on the FRAND commitment. The Appellate Court in Dusseldorf found this to be an antitrust violation - i.e. selling on the patents but not the FRAND commitment. In Steven's view that had to be the right decision. Milan commented that there is now European Commission guidelines on this point, namely that there be a requirement to ensure that the onward entity in any sale is bound by the same FRAND commitment. \" [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ipconference.jmls.uic.edu/2019\">https://ipconference.jmls.uic.edu/2019</url>/ [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daryl-lim-344a0a9/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/daryl-lim-344a0a9/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.simmons-simmons.com/en/people/contacts/a/amy-crouch\">http://www.simmons-simmons.com/en/people/contacts/a/amy-crouch</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IPKT11341615743451912787577610005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IPKT-113416</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJK-TFJ1-JCMN-Y3MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1679\"/><timeReceived>2:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>IPKat Weblog</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 21, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>IP conferences</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>#IPKat</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>antitrust</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>US IP law</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>AmeriKat</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>US IP legislation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>John Marshall Law School</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

The latest developments <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html\">can be found here</url>. </p><p>Hertz calls off its unusual $500 million stock offering.</p><p>It\u2019s official: Hertz, the bankrupt car-rental company, has canceled its plan to sell $500 million in new stock.</p><p>The offering seemed like a good idea only a week ago. Some investors seemed keen to pour money into Hertz\u2019s stock even after the company\u2019s bankruptcy filing last month, so why not offer them more shares to buy? Hertz submitted a plan to a bankruptcy judge, who approved it on Friday. On Monday morning, the company said it was moving forward. But then it hit a snag.</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission told Hertz that it was reviewing the plan. \u201cWhen you let a company know that the S.E.C. has comments on their disclosure, they do not go forward until those comments are resolved,\u201d the commission\u2019s chairman, Jay Clayton, told CNBC on Wednesday.</p><p>Trading in the company\u2019s shares was halted midday on Wednesday, and Hertz said in a filing that it had suspended the sale \u201cpending further understanding of the nature and timing\u201d of the S.E.C.\u2019s review. On Thursday afternoon, Hertz said its board had decided that it was \u201cin the best interests of the company\u201d to scrap the sale altogether.</p><p>That decision might end up protecting the very investors who would have bought the shares. After all, when Hertz announced the offering this week, it acknowledged that the new shares could become \u201cworthless\u201d \u2014 a common outcome in bankruptcies.</p><p>AMC offers more details on its plan to reopen its movie theaters.</p><p>AMC Theaters, the nation\u2019s largest theater operator, gave more details on its<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html\">previously announced plan</url> to reopen its chain in the coming weeks.</p><p>About 450 AMC cineplexes in the United States will relight their marquees on July 15, with auditorium capacity capped at 30 percent (or less, where mandated by local health officials). Another 150 locations will reopen by July 24 to coincide with the release of Disney\u2019s live-action \u201cMulan,\u201d the<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html\">first big-budget movie</url> scheduled to come out of Hollywood since March.</p><p>AMC said that it expected to increase auditorium capacity to 50 percent \u201caround Labor Day\u201d and that capacity limits was likely to be phased out on Thanksgiving or thereabouts.</p><p>The company emphasized that it would reopen with an array of safety protocols developed with input from Harvard University\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Clorox Company.</p><p>Big Tech is rushing out new work force health-vetting and tracking tools.</p><p>Verily Life Sciences, a sister company of Google, is introducing a health screening and analytics service for businesses trying to safely reopen during the pandemic.</p><p>The service, announced on Thursday, will offer Covid-19 diagnostic testing for employees and clear them to return to the workplace based on their test results and other health data. It will also make recommendations to employers on how often workers should be retested, based on the prevalence of the virus in their work force and the local community.</p><p>With its new service, Verily is joining numerous tech giants and start-ups rushing to help business across the United States as they grapple with how to safely reopen the workplace.</p><p>Microsoft and the large insurer UnitedHealth Group, for instance, recently collaborated on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html\">a free symptom-checking app</url> that helps pinpoint workers at obvious risk for the virus and direct them to testing resources. On Tuesday, Fitbit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html\">introduced a program</url> that includes a daily symptom-checking app for employees and a work force health-monitoring dashboard for employers.</p><p>There is such a glut of new coronavirus risk-reduction products that it\u2019s a challenge for many employers to assess them all.</p><p>\u201cA big market rose up overnight,\u201d said Jeff Becker, a senior analyst for digital business strategy at Forrester, a market research firm, who recently surveyed two dozen vendors offering coronavirus solutions for employers. \u201cBut it\u2019s a fractured ecosystem, much like traditional health care.\u201d</p><p>DoorDash, another pandemic winner, reaches $16 billion valuation in latest funding found.</p><p>DoorDash, the largest food delivery company in the United States, said on Thursday that it had raised another $400 million in a new round of funding, valuing the company at $16 billion.</p><p>The cash infusion comes after months of growing demand for DoorDash\u2019s services while restaurants are closed and people are staying home during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The company was expected to go public this year after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html\">filing</url> registration documents in February. But initial public offerings slowed as the markets became volatile, and DoorDash has focused on responding to the flood of demand.</p><p>The company faces challenges as it prepares to go public. It is not profitable and food delivery remains competitive. Its largest rivals, Grubhub and Uber Eats, held merger discussions, with Grubhub eventually agreeing to sell to Just Eat Takeaway, a European food delivery service, for $7.3 billion in June.</p><p>Restaurants are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html\">struggling</url> to make ends meet on delivery apps, which charge fees for their services and sometimes list restaurants that have not signed up. In April, DoorDash cut its primary fees for independent restaurants during the pandemic, which it said cost it around $120 million.</p><p>The company also faces pushback from regulators and workers. California has required \u201con-demand\u201d tech companies to classify their armies of gig workers as employees. This week, San Francisco\u2019s district attorney sued DoorDash for unfair business practices, seeking an injunction requiring the company to comply with California\u2019s worker classification law.</p><p>Fidelity and Durable Capital Partners led the $400 million round. DoorDash, based in San Francisco, has raised $2.3 billion since it was founded in 2013.</p><p>Unemployment claims top one million for the 13th straight week.</p><p>Businesses are reopening, but the layoffs won\u2019t quit.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html\">Another 1.5 million people</url> applied for state unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department said Thursday.</p><p>It was the 13th straight week that state filings topped one million. Until the coronavirus crisis, the most new claims in a single week had been 695,000, in 1982.</p><p>Claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a federal program for self-employed workers, independent contractors and others ineligible for standard benefits, added 760,000 to the total.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sustained hemorrhaging of jobs unlike anything we\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Heidi Shierholz, director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank.</p><p>Economists said recent layoffs, though smaller than the wave in March and early April, suggested that the crisis was reaching deeper into the economy.</p><p>Hilton Worldwide, the hotel operator, said this week that it was eliminating 2,100 corporate jobs globally and would extend previous furloughs and cuts in hours and wages for 90 days. AT&amp;amp;T disclosed plans to shed 3,400 technician and clerical jobs nationwide and permanently close more than 250 stores, according to one of its unions. The gym chain 24 Hour Fitness said it was filing for bankruptcy protection and would permanently close more than 100 locations.</p><p>Coronavirus is hitting black business owners the hardest.</p><p>More than 40 percent of black business owners reported <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html\">they were not working in April</url>, when businesses were feeling the worst of the pandemic\u2019s economic consequences. Only 17 percent of white small-business owners said the same, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html\">an analysis</url> of government data by Robert Fairlie of the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><p>Many small businesses are struggling during the pandemic because they lack easy access to loans and cannot easily move their businesses online. Black-owned businesses tend to have fewer employees than other small businesses. They are also more likely to be in industries like restaurants or retail that lockdowns have hit especially hard, said Ken Harris, president of the National Business League, an organization founded by Booker T. Washington in 1900.</p><p>\u201cMost lack the capacity, scale and technical assistance needed to survive a pandemic,\u201d Mr. Harris said.</p><p>Black-owned businesses also appear to be benefiting less from federal stimulus programs. Only 12 percent of black and Hispanic business owners polled from April 30 to May 12 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html\">received the funding they had requested</url>. About one quarter received some funding. By contrast, half of all small businesses reported receiving from a single part of the stimulus packages \u2014 the Paycheck Protection Program \u2014 according to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html\">census survey</url>.</p><p>\u201cBlack businesses often don\u2019t have a traditional banking partner,\u201d Mr. Harris said. Without such a partner, many had trouble applying for assistance.</p><p>As small businesses reopen, owners are figuring it out as they go.</p><p>With capacity limited and demand uncertain, small-business owners say it\u2019s hard to know whether <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html\">to spend the money to reopen now or to wait</url>.</p><p>With no revenue for months, small businesses must find ways to pay for the new sanitation regimens, thermometers, plexiglass, masks and other items necessary to open, without knowing whether customers will return.</p><p>\u201cNone of the relief packages have included specific funding for safety retrofitting, purchasing of safety equipment or even helping business getting a handle on uniform P.P.E. for employees and customers,\u201d said Amanda Ballantyne, executive director of the Main Street Alliance, an advocacy group for small business.</p><p>Some businesses are taking a slow approach. At first, Chris Lynch and Michael Samer weren\u2019t sure what to do about their ocean adventure tours business, Everyday California, when they got the go-ahead in late April.</p><p>Mr. Lynch and Mr. Samer decided to reopen with curbside kayak and surf rentals only, keeping their retail shop and tour business closed. Then, as they felt more comfortable, they reintroduced tours at a 50 percent capacity with everyone wearing a mask. They also invested in their neglected online shop.</p><p>The bet paid off: They increased what had been a small number of online merchandise sales by 750 percent in May, allowing them to bring back about 20 employees to help with shipping and marketing.</p><p>Wall Street wavers as global markets decline.</p><p>Wall Street faced another day of unsteady trading on Thursday, with stocks drifting between negative and positive territory as investors considered new data on unemployment claims and the latest reports on fresh coronavirus outbreaks.</p><p>In the end, the S&amp;amp;P 500 ended essentially unchanged.</p><p>Markets have become somewhat directionless as concerns about a rise in new coronavirus cases around the world have collided with expectations for a quick economic recovery in recent days. It\u2019s a consolidation that many Wall Street analysts have described as long overdue, after the S&amp;amp;P 500 ripped higher with a string of gains from late March to early June.</p><p>But it also reflects growing uncertainty about the economic picture going forward.</p><p>Another 1.5 million U.S. workers applied for state unemployment benefits last week, a report released Thursday by the Labor Department showed. Not all the unemployment claims necessarily reflect new layoffs. Some states are still working through backlogs of claims filed earlier in the crisis; in other cases, people filing under multiple programs may be counted twice.</p><p>But three months into the crisis, there is little doubt that layoffs remain elevated. Economists warn that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html\">job losses could worsen</url> if government support that has helped prop up the economy is allowed to lapse too soon.</p><p>Are you in need of pandemic relief?

Should be easy to figure out what education you'll need, right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just contact the recruitment experts and ask them what employers will be looking for down the road. In short, what will be hot in high tech?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, don't expect useful answers. No one's done the research to tackle the question. And, says one Ottawa-area expert, it might not even be answerable.</p><p>\"It's a very complex topic that's of great concern to a number of groups, but no one's been able to pull the trigger on it,\" says Keith Carter, vice-president of the recruitment firm Procom Consultants Group.</p><p>Mr. Carter said the task confounds tech giants, which find it hard to predict the future for their companies alone. \"To do it for the city, the province and the country, it just becomes more and more challenging. The Ottawa Talent Initiative talked about doing it for Ottawa, and I questioned if it was even possible.\"</p><p>And there's some truth to the fact that predicting the next big tech trend is like predicting the next toy craze. Hula Hoops? T.M.X. Elmos? Who would have guessed?</p><p>Other groups that would like to get a handle on the future of technology include the Ottawa Centre for Research and Innovation, the Information and Communications Technology Council and the Canadian Advanced Technology Alliance.</p><p>The ICTC estimates tech jobs across the country will increase by 2.3 per cent annually through 2010. That translates to 58,000 jobs over the next three to five years. Replacing those who leave the sector will require another 31,000 jobs.</p><p>The report notes about half of Canada's IT workers don't actually work for high-tech companies but rather in IT departments.</p><p>But determining the nature of future jobs is more difficult.</p><p>\"We have a huge people-supply problem in technology and now the unemployment rate is about two per cent so it's very thin,\" Mr. Carter says. \"Governmental organizations and associations want the answer so they can start to promote through education and immigration -- to bring in more people.\"</p><p>Adding to the confusion is the difference in job markets across Canada. Ottawa, for example, is focused on telecommunications, but Toronto has no time for telecom and Montreal is different again.</p><p>\"The problem is it's difficult to meet a demand when we don't know what that demand is and it varies so significantly from company to company,\" Mr. Carter said.</p><p>So what jobs were crossing his Ottawa desk this week? Mr. Carter cited requests for low-level C++ Linux developers and \"very experienced\" Java developers.</p><p>Others in the tech field ventured some opinions on what could be hot in information technology.</p><p>Kevin Dee, CEO of Eagle Professional Resources, deals largely with \"business solutions\" recruiting. He sees potential for those with experience in packaged business systems such as Siebel, SAP and PeopleSoft. The jobs for those with human-resource experience and functional knowledge will be in project management, but there will also be plenty of work for those in technical support.</p><p>\"The big demand is going to come in the implementation of packaged software,\" Mr. Dee says.</p><p>Across Ottawa at Ajilon Consulting, Michel Plouffe, vice-president of IT services, pin-points a handful of places he expects to see job growth. His list includes positions for technical architects, Java and .Net Web developers, usability design and testing experts, telecom specialists (Cisco-CCIE and IP), business analysts, security specialists (C4ISR) and database specialists (ERP, CRM). In most cases, Mr. Plouffe said, employers will want three years' experience.</p><p>Life sciences are also expected to grow. Ken Lawless, president and CEO of the Ottawa Life Sciences Council, sees promise in clean or environmental technology, a field that should have much potential as India and China increase their power consumption.</p><p>But the growth will come \"in twos and fours and 10s, not in hundreds,\" Mr. Lawless explains. Company requirements will be on the manufacturing side, where technical background will be essential. Such companies are also always looking for experts who combine business development talent with scientific background and expertise. Ottawa companies in this \"space\" include Iogen Corp. and Plasco Energy Group.</p><p>The biomedical field will grow at about the same pace as clean energy, Mr. Lawless said, describing it as gradual, as opposed to an \"all-of-a-sudden big boom.\" There will be institutional work as hospitals and research labs expand. In the private sector, biochemists, critical researchers and laboratory technologists should do well.</p><p>Private-sector companies will be looking for people with clinical trial and regulatory affairs backgrounds as well as those with business development skills.</p><p>What else will be hot? It's anyone's guess.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: Pat McGrath, The Ottawa Citizen; High-tech recruiter Keith Carter says nobody, not even employers, can forecast what skills will be in demand in the years to come.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OTTAWA-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OTTAWA2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4MV6-GYJ0-TWD3-V2Y2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"794\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 Ottawa Citizen, a division of CanWest MediaWorks Publication Inc.

It is expected to be a big one,  economist, expecting 190 thousand jobs to have been added to the economy.  Last month, the unemployment rate is expected to tick-down to 4.7 percent.  Of course, we got very strong ADP numbers earlier in the week. So, we're  expecting a good number.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What to watch for coming up? The Gorman debate over healthcare and America,  some senators say the current bill is dead on arrival but Vice President  Pence and House, Ways and Means committee Chairman Kevin Brady, they're  hopeful. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  What's different than  back in 2010 though, Brad, when Obamacare was literally forced through the  Congress with very little debate is what the American people are seeing,  it's really what they expect Congress to do.</p><p>KEVIN BRADY, CHAIRMAN, WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  At the end of the day  here, Lou, we're going to come together to back the president on this and  get it done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got the very latest this morning. Checking market action,  take a look, we're watching oil price. It's been a tough week for oil,  crude rebounding after closing at the lowest level since November,  yesterday. This morning, we're seeing a gain of about one half of 1  percent, still below $50 a barrel. That certainly helping stocks, though,  around the world as the oil price is stabilized. Futures indicating a  pretty good open for the (inaudible) averages today. </p><p>Dow Industrial seem to be up, that's 70 points at the opening of trading.  In Europe, similar story, take a look. Of course, you heard from the ECD  yesterday. The markets are higher across the boards to the tune of one half  of a percent higher on the FT100, two thirds of a percent higher on the CAC  (inaudible) in Paris and the DAX Index in Germany. </p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher. As you see, the Nikkei  average in Japan, best performer of one and a half percent. Political  unrest in South Korea, deadly protests overnight erupting after the  country's president was removed from office, impeachment. </p><p>Then a terrifying moment to report in Ohio, a four year old girl blown away  by extreme winds, amazing pictures here. Look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow. We'll bring you the latest there. Nissan, meanwhile,  making a car for man's best friend. Check this out. The automaker's showing  off a concept car designed with dogs in mind. We like that. All of those  stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about it, Fox  News Network's Dagen McDowell.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Barron's online editor, Jack Otter, is here and New York Times  best-selling author, Peter Kiernan, is with us as well. Good morning to  you. </p><p>PETER KIERNAN, AUTHOR, NEW YORK TIMES BEST-SELLING AUTHOR:  (inaudible)  with you. Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you, happy Friday.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Morning. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly, could be a big number. ADP number was what, 298.</p><p>JACK OTTER, BARRON'S ONLINE EDITOR:  I think it might be huge.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, huge.</p><p>OTTER:  Huge.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The first job report under President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Full report.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we know the expectations are out there but does the  market trade up on a huge number or does the market trade down because the  Fed starts raising interest rates next week.</p><p>OTTER:  Well, I think that the next -- the March interest rate hike is  baked in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>OTTER:  I mean, unless today is just terrible but everyone expects it's  going to be good especially after that ADP number. I think, frankly, I'm  already looking beyond the number. I'm looking the wages, and of course,  the participation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got a big show coming up. We have the jobs number at 8:00  AM Eastern and we will be looking at all of the above there. Joining our  program this morning, a whole line up of experts to tell you where the jobs  are right now. First, our top story republicans are moving forward with the  replacement of Obamacare. The GOP plan cleared hurdles through two house  committees yesterday. Those skepticism for the bill is still mounting.  House Speaker Paul Ryan even gave a PowerPoint presentation to promote the  merits of the bill. That was during his weekly press conference. Vice  President Mike Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senator Rand Paul, all  weighed in on the plane yesterday. Watch.</p><p>PENCE:  Because of President Trump's leadership and support here in the  congress, I'm very confident. We'll repeal and replace Obamacare and it'll  all be done by this spring.</p><p>PAUL RYAN, HOUSE SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is the closest we will  ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare. </p><p>RAND PAUL, SENATOR:  Conservatives hate their bill. I promise you.  Obamacare lied, dead on arrival. They might as well just start over.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, dead on arrival. Joining us right now, former Michigan  congressman and former Intelligence Committee Chairman, Pete Hoekstra.  Congressman, good to see. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>PETE HOEKSTRA, CONGRESSMAN:  Great to be here. Thank you. Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So much debate. I mean, do you think this current house bill  has a chance of passing in the senate? You heard what Rand Paul just said,  dead on arrival.</p><p>HOEKSTRA: Well, this current house bill is now what we will ultimately see  be put into law. This is the normal process of making sausage or some call  it making legislation. The house has its bill. There will be some changes  that will be made to this bill has they -- as the house goes through the  process, the senate will do its work. There'll be reconciliation, the work  with the president. I think the reason for optimism is how engaged the  White House is with the president and Mike Pence, both involve in this  process, making it work. You know, the dialogue will continue. Ultimately,  there will be a repeal and replace bill that makes it to the president's  desk.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So this is all to be expected. Then the back and  forth as we make the sausage or make this legislation. Can we talk about  what is so troubling though because the conservatives are so upset about  this? I mean, they are calling this an expansion of Medicaid. Dagen, let's  go through for our viewers, what is so bad about this plan?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The -- what the conservative don't like and there are a few  things, and the congressman can jump in here. There were 19 states that  resisted the Medicaid expansion. Many of the states and the representatives  who took money to expand Medicaid, they demanded, basically, $100 billion  subsidy fund to stabilize their transition away from -- as they go to block  grants on Medicaid, for lack of a better word. They're also angry that the  Cadillac tax is still in there, although, it's extended out to 2025 and a  lot of these conservatives seem to have gotten religion, if you will, on  these tax credits, they're mad that the tax credits are a subsidy, which  they are. The republicans and that their leadership, they're trying to  level the playing field in terms of the tax treatment of employer  insurance, it's an employer provided insurance and that the individuals  buy. They call it a subsidy but I'll point out the head of this freedom  caucus, Congressman Mark Meadows in North Carolina was a cosponsor of Tom  Price's healthcare bill before Tom Price became Health and Human Services  secretary. That has tax credits in it. So now, he's got religion on it.  That's what I don't understand. There is a lot of pushback. I do you think  -- there will be compromise though as Congressman Hoesktra.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think congressman? I mean, is it mostly this  thought that it's an expansion of Medicare -- Medicaid rather or the  Cadillac tax? Is that what's so troubling from the conservative's point of  view.</p><p>HOEKSTRA:  Well, I think all of the above is accurate. I think the  republicans will get over and they will unite on the tax credit. They'll  recognized that this is actually a leveling of the tax treatment for those  of who get an employer base healthcare plan versus those who have to go buy  it out on the market themselves. I think they will also - yes, they'll  reach a compromise on the Medicaid expansion because, you know, certain  states did it, other did not. So, they will get there. The other thing that  I think that they will want to do is they -- yes, they'll have to get rid  of the Cadillac tax. You know, republicans could not be seen as keeping a  tax that is part of Obamacare in place in moving forward and somewhere in  this thing not as phase three. They're going to have to move phase three  into phase one which is allowing the sale of insurance across state lines.</p><p>BARTIMOMO:  Peter Kiernan? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KIERNAN:  For just a second, I have a question for you because, on one  hand, you have Speaker Ryan saying this is a binary choice, either or and  the other hand, the president is saying let's go bowling and let's make a  deal and somewhere in between that, you have the house and look what  they're doing. They speed through Ways and Means. They speed through Energy  and Commerce. They're on their way to the budget committee. This is  lightning fast. What do you think is going to happen here? Where are these  compromises going to be made?</p><p>HOEKSTRA:  Well, the compromise, that I think are going to be made -- there  will be compromise throughout this process. There will be compromises made  to get to 218 votes in the house. The speaker doesn't have the votes right  now. He will get there. There will be compromises or there will be a senate  agenda that puts out, probably -- maybe, a very significant different bill  and then there'll be a reconciliation pack or there will be a conference  report that will come out as the house and the Senate work out their  differences. This will be all about compromise all the way through. It is  not unusual. Remember, back at '96, we did welfare. I think we passed it  three times before President Clinton actually signed. This is expected.  This should not be easy. It is healthcare. It's a huge change. It -- this  is the normal process.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will add this, that if you had republicans who step back and  cross their arms and essentially stand shoulder to shoulder with the likes  of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi on this, they will regret it. Whether  it's in the midterm elections whether it is four years from now, they will  regret it because if they -- if the republicans do nothing here. It will  speed up or if they just repeal it and then don't have anything to replace  it. It will speed up the already looming collapse of Obamacare and you're  talking about people getting kicked off their insurance, spiraling of --  premium spiraling high -- of the higher.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then they own it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, they will -- the republicans will own it. Particularly the  people who stood back and let it happen.</p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes, they'll be the ones who are dead on arrival. I think -- if  you pull that trick. I think (inaudible)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've got a window. This is the window.</p><p>OTTER:  You know guys, there's one thing. So, there are a lot of thing --  the things that people most hated about Obamacare tended to be the things  that were necessary in order to get more people on healthcare, the penalty  for instance. The idea that, you know, you couldn't charge older people,  frankly, as much as it cost to insure older people. That was a very anti- free market move but what it did was it got more people coverage. How you  do make those tough choices with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, what's the timeline on this? You said, there's  going to be a lot of debate. There's going to be a lot of choices to make  but what's your timeline on that? Do you think we're going to see this  before Eastern, which is I think that the date that they were talking  about, you want to have something done by Easter, which is in a couple of  weeks.</p><p>HOEKSTRA:  Yes, I think you'll see it out of the house clearly by Easter. I  think it's going to be sometime between Easter and the August Recess before  they get it passed into law and get something on the president's desk. I  think one of the really interesting things to watch is what's going to  happen to the August Recess. The senate -- the house and senate, they're  going to go out of session roughly the end of July and then they're not  going to come back into session until September. Are they really can take a  whole month off? I think they're going to have to pass healthcare. They're  going to have to pass tax reform. I believe before they go on their  traditional August Recess because I think Donald Trump is going to come  back and say, yes, hey, we got to get -- make America great again. We got  to get the economy going. We got to get more money in people's pockets.  These two things have to happen before you go home.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, they'll better be working on a tax reform package if  they're going to take a month off. Maybe, they're going to work on it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, Mitch McConnell said yesterday, the senate majority leader,  the tax reform is not getting done by August. He said I don't think that -- </p><p>HOEKSTRA:  I know he said that thing. The interesting thing he's going to - - </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's going to -- I don't think it will get done by August. </p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a big statement.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I saw that. I was like, what? Oh. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOEKSTRA:  And I think Donald Trump will ask Mitch McConnell to stay in  session in August until they get it done and guess what, with those jet  fumes always going in the end of July, they may actually find a way to get  it done by August. I think Donald Trump is going to stand firm and say  don't go home until these two things are done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you're right.</p><p>HOEKSTRA:  This is what I promised, what we all promised the American  people don't go home until your work is done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I think you're right and I think the American people are  going to shame them into having a tax plan after Obamacare ready to go  after that July Recess. So, we'll see about that. OK. Now, we're talking  about dates, and this is real impactful for markets. Congressman, good to  see you, sir. Thanks so much.</p><p>HOEKSTRA:  OK, great. Thank you. Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pete Hoekstra there and stay tuned, we'll be bringing you live  coverage and announcements of the February jobs report. It is Jobs Day.  Jobs in America begins at 8:00 A.M. Eastern. Q&amp;As for all the experts on  where exactly the jobs are and what are wages doing now. Coming up next,  the car designed for man's best friend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The latest concept from Nissan that dog owners are drooling  over and then serving up these. What restaurants are doing to make you put  the bill for rising minimum wage. Wait until you this. Have you checked  your check lately? Back in a minute.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back with that breaking news overnight. Out of South  Korea, violent clashes breaking out after the country's president was  officially ousted from office. Cheryl Casone with the story now, in  headline. Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  It's quite a scandal in South Korea, Maria. The  president, President Park, has become the country's first democratically  elected leader forced from office in that country after a panel of judges  unanimously upheld parliament's decision to impeach her over a corruption  scandal. She was also the first female leader of South Korea. Violent  clashes immediately breaking out between supporters of Park and police  after the (inaudible) that happened in Seoul. It left at least two people  dead. The country now has 60 days to hold a new presidential election.</p><p>(inaudible) that the same corruption scandal has enveloped the error of  Samsung and then bribery charges. </p><p>Meanwhile, let's turn our focus to Germany. Police have arrested a man who  wounded seven people with an axe at a train station in Dusseldorf  yesterday. Officials describe the suspect as a 36-year-old man, from the  former Yugoslavia, who obviously has mental health problems, they added.  Three of the victims suffered severe injuries. Police believed the suspect  acted alone. </p><p>Well, let's turn to some corporate news this morning. Staples says it's  looking to close another 70 stores in North America following sharp sales  decline. The news comes as the company reports disappointing returns for  the quarter. Earnings coming in at 25 cents a share, that was a penny less  than analyst expected. Store closings follow the elimination of 48  locations last year and as well affected about five percent of stores in  North America. They'll have about 1600 stores left after these closings. </p><p>And finally this headline, the restaurant industry is handling higher labor  costs by adding them to your bill. Rather than raise menu prices to cover  the higher cost of wages, some eateries are now attacking on labor  surcharges. The Wall Street Journal reports that change in states like  Arizona, California, Colorado, and right here in New York are adding the  surcharges of three to four percent to the bill. Maria, you will see them  on your bill, just ask your server for details.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, incredible. I mean, people just miss it but that's who's  paying for minimum wage increases.</p><p>CASONE:  We are, we are. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go. Who do you think was going to pay for it, anyway?  Coming up next, soda sales going flat -- thanks Cheryl. The beverage  Americans are reaching for instead of soda. Future is pointing to a higher  opening ahead of the February jobs report a little more than two hours  away. What to expect from the February jobs number coming out at 8:30 A.M.  Eastern. Market's rallying ahead of that. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. It's pretty good market day this morning. Take a  look. We're expecting a big rally at the opening of trading. Dow  Industrials, expected to be up about 80 points. This is, of course, ahead  of the February jobs report. It's going to hit the (inaudible) in about two  hours. We will bring you the latest numbers, obviously but we're expecting  an addition of 190 thousand jobs to the economy in the last month with the  unemployment rate falling back to 4.7 percent. Jack Otter is with us this  morning and, Jack, we know that we got a very strong ADP number. 298  thousand was reported on Thursday and the estimate was 190, do you think  it's going to be equivalent?</p><p>OTTER:  Yes, I think it's going to be closer to the ADP number than the 190  if you look at a chart of ADP versus the non-farm's payroll, especially, on  these blowout numbers. How often non-farm payroll has actually been above  ADP? So, it's not impossible. We could see a 350 thousand number today. On  the downside, I think it's 250, I don't think it's 190. So -- now, really,  and everyone else is weather, weather, weather. I am starting to wonder if  maybe they're not quite figuring out the seasonal adjustments correctly. 66  thousand construction jobs was a wonderful figure in the ADP number. I  don't believe it. We are not creating 66 thousand construction jobs every  month. I'm sure there was a bump because of the weather and then you add  the seasonal adjustment on top of that and you get this but still goodness.  We'll look - I'm looking through that. Look for wages.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's clear the things are beginning to unleash, Peter. Isn't  that right?</p><p>KIERNAN:  It really does feel. There's never been a damn just burst all at  once. There is a little bit here and a little bit there. What's happening  here is really exciting. Job creation is fantastic. There are some spots  like in retail and some spots like in oil but they have Amazon turning  around and say, we're going to create 100 thousand jobs this year. This is  an economy that's on the march and what I love about this is if we get the  spectacular number you're talking about, as far as Janet Yellen is down  said hike -- we hike raises. We hike rates. What happens when? I think the  financials are going to have a spectacular year particularly if there are  three more rate hikes to follow.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've already have a spectacular year since Election Day,  right, Dagen? The financials are on fire. The Fed meeting is next week, the  15th. A strong jobs number probably does lead to a rate hike, right? You  said it's a rate hike.</p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The rate hiked -- price in the market last week. At the  beginning of the week there was a little more than a third of a chance that  the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates next week and then it went to  about 90 percent.</p><p>KIERNAN:  It's over 90 percent. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right. It went to 90 percent by the end of the week. So, some  people will call it flat footed. The question will be looking down the  road. The Fed expecting three interest rate hikes this year. They're going  to hike most definitely next week. Do they even speed that up? If they  think that the jobs market is getting hot here. The job growth, it's only  running the three month average of 183 thousand jobs. So, they will wait at  least a couple months to see if you have three or four consecutive months  of strong job creation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about -- </p><p>KIERNAN:  People will be looking very closely at wage growth. It's actually  slowed. It was 0.1 percent wage growth last month. If it doesn't get up to  0.3, at least, I think people are going to say, well, this is great but not  good enough and frankly it puts the policymakers in a pickle because you're  creating jobs but not well enough paid jobs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, let's talk about the oil prices for a second. They're  higher this morning but they took a real hit this week over concerns of a  glut in oil. We have, David, showing stockpiles heading record levels. Does  the oil story once again impact the stock market story? And I'll point that  just a couple of stories in the Wall Street Journal this morning. S&amp;P 500  up 250 percent from its lowest crisis year close eight years ago. Household  net worth in the U.S. up to record $92.8 trillion in the fourth quarter  because of that year and surge in stocks.</p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes, I think oil is really exciting right now. It's going to tell  a lot of stories. Number one, no matter what OPEC tried to do to kind of  lift that price of oil. The United States is producing. We're producing 9  million barrels a day. Our record for us and these guys are doing it  because they have debts to pay. Remember, it was only a couple of years ago  that oil was $100 a barrel and interest rates from two percent and, so,  that's it. Let's borrow and pump. We're doing the same thing again and I  don't think that the Saudis and others are going to be, like, keep that  price up as long as United States is pumping, pumping, pumping.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because there's more oil, means lower prices.</p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes, and we're going to keep pumping. We have a great business,  we have an oil dividend for our nation and I think it's a great time for  us. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's a job creator. </p><p>KIERNAN:  Absolutely. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's that as well. We're going to stay tuned. We've got a  big show ahead. We're bringing you live coverage and announcements of the  February jobs report. Jobs in America begins 8:00 A.M. Eastern, 30 minutes  before The Numbers which will hit the tape at 8:30. (inaudible) break when  we come back. Pressure building on Capitol Hill. FBI director, Jim Comey  meeting with lawmakers over the president's wiretapping claims. What it  means for the future of those allegations and then a heart stopping moment  in Ohio.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A little girl, literally blown away literally blown away by  heavy winds, luckily unharmed. The dramatic moment. Watch. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Friday morning, welcome back, everybody. Thanks for being  with us. I'm Marie Bartiromo. Happy Friday and it's Friday, March 10th.  Your top service right now at 6:30 A.M. on the East Coast. </p><p>It's job's day, two hours away from the February jobs report. Economists  are expecting 190 thousand jobs to have been added to the economy in the  month of February. The unemployment rate is expected to tick down to 4.7  percent. What you need to know, coming up this morning. </p><p>FBI Director, James Comey, briefs lawmakers. Director Comey spoke with  congressional leaders over President Trump's wiretapping claims as well as  allegations that President Trump's associates have links to Russia. All of  this coming as WikiLeaks takes on the CIA. White House Press Secretary Sean  Spicer weighed in on the leak. </p><p>SEAN SPICER, PRESS SECRETARY:  There's grave concern that the president has  about to release of national security and classified information that  threatens and undermines our nation's security. Obviously he believes that  the systems at the CIA are outdated and need to be updated. </p><p>BARTIROMO: The video of WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, says he will  give technology companies access to the CIA's hacking tools.  He says he  wants to help technology companies, see where their vulnerabilities are.  </p><p>Refugees using Facebook to seek asylum -- the new online tool that's  helping them get legal advice -- the outrage ahead.  Markets this morning  in rally mode.  </p><p>We're watching oil prices today because crude is rebounding after closing  at the lowest level since November.  Equities once again focused on the oil  market.  </p><p>Oil prices up three quarters of one percent, still below $50 a barrel.  But  nonetheless, the gain is helping stocks across the world.  </p><p>Futures indicating a gain at the opening of trading this morning ahead of  the jobs report.  Market is expected to open up almost 80 points on the Dow  Jones Industrial Average.  </p><p>NASDAQ is up a third of a percent, 21 points higher.  Similar story in  Europe, take a look.  Markets there in the green, up about half a percent  to three quarters of one percent in the European indices this morning. </p><p>And in Asia overnight, stocks mostly higher, with the exception of the  Shanghai composite in China, down a fraction, Nikkei average in Japan up  one and a half percent.  Wild weather across the country -- storms moving  east after hitting the heartland.  </p><p>The wind is leaving a little girl scared but unscathed this morning -- that  unbelievable video of this little girl who gets blown away by the winds.  </p><p>Nissan is embracing man's best friend -- why the new car is pawfect (ph)  for dog lovers.  We'll tell you about it -- all those stories coming up  this morning.  </p><p>But first, growing (ph) pressure this morning on the Justice Department to  substantiate President Trump's claim that the previous administration  wiretapped his phones during the campaign.  FBI Director, James Comey,  briefed top congressional leaders on the situation yesterday as well as on  those allegations that President Trump's associates have some kind of link  to Russia.  Vice President Mike Pence spoke about the Russia allegations  last night with Bret Baier.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT:  When the former director of a -- of  national intelligence said just a week ago that in the report he prepared  by the end of the year, there was no evidence of collusion between Russian  officials and our campaign, I -- I think that -- that speaks with great  authority.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us this morning, London Center for Policy Research  Senior Fellow, Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer. </p><p>Colonel, good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>TONY SHAFFER, SENIOR FELLOW, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH:  Good  morning.  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .for joining us.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Thank you for having me.  Good to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do we know about the Comey briefing yesterday?  What do  you expect to come out of this investigation?  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, so far, I think it was simply an update.  I -- I don't  think anybody on either side wants to go through it because I don't think  either side has made a complete disclosure of what happened.  </p><p>And -- but Maria, let me point out the obvious here.  One of the things  that did come out of that meeting was an update, quote/unquote, on the --  the \"spurious (ph) links\", some sort of link, some connection between Trump  Tower computers and some Russian bank.  </p><p>Well, that tells me they're monitoring that -- that.  And that goes back to  Mr. Trump's point, that he's been monitored.  </p><p>So I think, you know, look closely at what comes out.  And you'll see the  evidence of what's being talked about.  </p><p>And -- and if I were a reporter, I would ask Mr. Comey that question  directly, why (ph) you're -- you're updating people on this computer link.   Gee, does that mean that you have authority to do it?  </p><p>And who gave you the authority?  So I think this is where we have to look  very closely what's been going on.  And this -- this completely verifies  what \"New York Times\" has been saying about the wiretapping.  </p><p>So I think Mr. Trump is (ph) a -- a very clear accounting on what the  authorities were, who issued the authorities and under what circumstance  relating to the so-called FBI, national security investigation of these  links.  It's very clear to me that -- that needs to be disclosed completely  to everybody.  </p><p>JACK OTTER, ONLINE EDITOR, BARRON'S:  So this is Jack Otter from Barron's.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Hey, Jack.  </p><p>OTTER:  My -- my question is it seems to me that obviously, we are  monitoring the -- the Russians at all time, just as.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Right. </p><p>OTTER:  .what (ph) National Security Agency does.  So when the Russians are  in contact with someone here, wouldn't that natural and normal monitoring  reveal that? </p><p>SHAFFER:  No.  </p><p>OTTER:  No? </p><p>SHAFFER:  You have to understand there's a process call minimization.  So  if you decide that you're going to pick up the phone and call someone in  Russia, they can monitor whatever they want on the Russian side of the  call.  </p><p>They cannot monitor you.  If you are not (ph) presumed to have committed a  crime, they can't look at you.  That's just the way it is.  </p><p>OTTER:  But don't they know.</p><p>SHAFFER:  This is me?  Yes, they -- they can -- they, by regulation, have  to pretend they don't know who you are.  There's a process in place called  minimization.  </p><p>I think Andrew Napolitano talks about this.  And he's correct.  You've got  to basically -- if you have not committed a crime and you're not presumed  to have (ph) committed a crime, they can't look at who you are.  </p><p>That's just the way it is.  Now, if there's things in the conversation with  the Russians which may stimulate people to think there's something -- that  you're doing something wrong, then that could be probable cause.  </p><p>And that would stimulate a whole separate thing of -- of authorities (ph).   But you have to have that probable cause tripwire. </p><p>Something has to happen in the conversation that says, there's something  potentially illegal here.  And everything I've heard, everything I've been  told about does not indicate there was any collusion or wrong-doing in any  of the conversations either way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>PETER KIERNAN, FORMER PARTNER, GOLDMAN SACHS:  You know, one of the things  that troubles me and you hear Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Senator  Lindsey Graham say, all we need to do is call the FBI and we'll quickly get  this worked out, isn't it a little bit more complicated than just asking  one or two questions of the FBI? </p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, yes, for a couple of reasons.  First, the FBI is not the  only organization that could actually do this level of collection.  </p><p>We have to look at the DHS, Department of Homeland Security.  They have  their own internal capabilities to do these sorts of things.  </p><p>And then you have also the -- the military services.  And let me be very,  very clear on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  .some of you all remember George Bush's warrantless wiretaps.  We  -- DOD could be used in what we call Title 10.  </p><p>Title 10 is -- is the -- the body of laws called traditional military  activities.  The simple rule of thumb on that is anything George Washington  did with the continental army, that include spying, you can do under Title  10.  </p><p>So that's how you have another option available to you as the president to  do this collection.  So you cannot simply look down one venue and try to  ascertain what happened here.  </p><p>You have to look at multiple and try to figure out within those multiple  venues what law was used, what technology was used, what days was it used.   That's -- it's a very complicated situation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know, it's interesting, I mean, I think everybody  knows how I feel about this whole Russian narrative at this point.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.  We all feel (ph) -- yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I mean.</p><p>SHAFFER:  I don't (ph) -- yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .you know, watching -- watching the media this morning, I was  watching different channels and the -- and the way that they were reporting  it, it's amazing, they keep having to say, no evidence yet of -- of any  interaction between the Trump team and the Russians.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .as if like, well, we're waiting.  No evidence yet.  Even James  Clapper said it.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .no evidence yet.  And -- and we know that Clapper has been on  the other side of this story and has been really not.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .a friend to the Trump administration.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We turn to the CIA hacking claims.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .Lieutenant Colonel, because WikiLeaks found -- Julian Assange  spoke out about the alleged CIA document yesterday.  Listen to what he had  to say.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JULIAN ASSANGE, FOUDNER, WIKILEAKS:  The CIA developed a giant arsenal, the  -- what appears to be the largest arsenal of Trojans and viruses in the  world that attacks most of the systems that journalists, people in  government, politicians, CEOs and average people use, didn't secure it,  lost control of it and then appears to have covered up that fact.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Assange is offering top technology companies those alleged  hacking tools.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he says they can patch security flaws.  Is he making fun of  them?  I mean, is he -- is he really thinking that they want to work with a  fugitive? </p><p>I mean, what -- what do you think about this? </p><p>SHAFFER:  I think he's having fun with both sides.  I mean, he's in a  position to poke people in the eyes, poking people in the eye.  </p><p>To the tech industry point, they have built by -- for any number of  reasons, huge vulnerabilities within their own systems.  I mean, if I were  at (ph) North Korea, I wouldn't be buying any Panasonic TVs anytime soon if  I didn't want them to -- to know what I'm doing in my living room.  </p><p>So I think these are -- and by the way, these are -- these were known  before the CIA hack came out.  I mean, you cannot -- technology is  ambivalent to the user.  </p><p>So it doesn't matter if you're the government.  It doesn't matter if you're  a private industry.  </p><p>These vulnerabilities exist.  So what I think what he's doing is saying,  hey, you, industry folks, have been pretty (ph) stupid.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  .by leaving these back doors open.  With that said, the  disclosure the CIA has tools to deal with those in my judgment is -- is a  very severe breech.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  And -- and I think CIA needs to look at their -- what I would  call internet hygiene or trade craft.  Again, Maria, I ran a unit doing  this sort of thing back in the late '90s and early 2000s.  </p><p>And let me tell you, none of the stuff we did, it's not been -- it's not  been disclosed because we actually I think practiced very effective trade  craft.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  So I think you have to look at the situation for what it is.  And  so Assange is -- is not a good guy.  He's -- he's kind of poking both sides  of the obvious (ph) point.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Now, he's esteeming (ph) giant bag of  garbage who wants.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  .to destroy the United States and never leaked.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Precisely.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  .anything about Russia or China by the way.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to point Apple has said that any security flaws that were  disclosed in this leak, they have -- they have closed those loopholes,  closed those gaps in the most recent software update, the operating system  update.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we didn't.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, remember the -- with this, these are  impenetrable.  Nobody can get into this phone.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what we thought after San Bernardino.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, no, but that -- that was an older phone.  The newer phone.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I see what you're saying.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  .there's no backdoor, period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The newer phones.  Let me -- let me get your take on this.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .because a Facebook Messenger chat bot is helping.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .refugees seek asylum.  This is amazing.  This is a computer  program.  And it's offering legal advice through texts or vocal commands.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are your thoughts on this new technology?  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Maria, I -- I couldn't get it out of my head this morning.  I was  preparing for the story of \"Max Headroom\" back in the -- you know, in the  '80s, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes, yes.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  .of Max coming on and telling you legal advice.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get smart, right.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, it's -- it's kind of interesting because it is an  application of technology for purposes of helping refugees do a number of  things, some -- some good, some bad.  Now, the idea here is that, you know,  maybe you could figure out which country you can go to and say, I want  asylum and -- and you go there.  </p><p>And -- and you go there.  It's (ph) going to catalyze (ph) people to  certain countries as (ph) they can get there.  At the same time, you know,  it -- it may be something that actually helps people understand what their  legal rights are and are not.  </p><p>And I think for the purposes of -- of what I've read, I think someone tried  to create it to actually help the refugees without having to spend a lot of  money because the other thing about -- hope -- don't take any lawyers there  onset the wrong way, lawyers are expensive.  So I think maybe this is a way  of trying to -- to prevent lawyers from, you know, milking these folks who  are looking for -- for -- for asylum.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, there you go.  All right, great to see you, Colonel.   Thanks so much.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Great (ph).  Thank you.  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Colonel Tony Shaffer, joining us there.  </p><p>Coming up next, a car worth drooling over -- the latest concept from Nissan  designed with man's best friend in mind.  And then it is a jungle out there  -- big names battling at the box office.  </p><p>Will \"Kong Skull Island\" climb to the top this weekend?  We've got your  weekend preview of movies, back in a minute.              </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It's big Friday for the markets this morning.   Take a look.  </p><p>We are looking at a rally underway this morning -- Dow Industrials expected  to open up 70 points, NASDAQ up about 20 points.  Of course, we're waiting  on the jobs number out in less than two hours.  </p><p>A couple of names we're watching -- keep an eye on Snap -- the social media  company officially has one week of trading in the books.  Snap ended the  first week of trading below its opening price.  </p><p>Now, it opened at $24 a share.  It's down nearly seven percent from there.   We're watching Facebook this morning, the company reaching a deal with  major league soccer and Univision to stream the games.  </p><p>The deal includes at least 22 regular-season games, the first of which will  be March 18.  Facebook shares up nearly 20 percent in '17 -- 2017.  </p><p>Well, a little girl blown away in heavy winds -- we've been showing you the  pictures.  Cheryl Casone has this amazing story.  </p><p>Cheryl?  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  It is amazing, Maria.  And the  surveillance video does show this little four-year-old girl in Ohio being  blown away during a wind storm.  </p><p>When the front -- she walked up the front stairs of her house, she opens  the door and the wind caught both.  Here is the thing -- she wasn't  injured.  </p><p>In fact, her mom said she was laughing after it was all over.  But mom did  say she had to pry (ph) her daughter's hands from the door at first because  she was just gripping on so hard.  </p><p>Oh, man.  In other headlines this morning, guys, I love the affair over  (ph) soda seems to be over.  According to an industry tracker, bottled  water overtook soda as the top drink in the U.S. by sales volume last year.  </p><p>Americans drink an average of just over 39 gallons of bottled water in  2016, nearly a gallon more than carbonated soft drinks.  This news  shouldn't come, though, as a surprise.  </p><p>Sales of bottled water have been growing for years as demand for soda has  fallen.  Well, Starbucks is gearing up for spring, the coffee company  unveiling three new cups styled for the spring season.  </p><p>And they're kind of different for Starbucks -- pastel blue, green and  yellow.  They've got some spring-themed drawings on them -- first time that  Starbucks has ever offered spring cups.  </p><p>They will be in stores on March 16.  And finally, favorite story of the day  -- it is a car for the dogs literally.  </p><p>Nissan is getting ready to start production on a new Nissan X-trail.  It's  a vehicle that's got multiple features to make your dog's life and your  life a little bit easier.  </p><p>There's an easy access ramp, a pull-out water shower, a treat storage  compartment, integrated dryer, no-spill water bowl and a clip-on harness  hook.  And then it gets better.  </p><p>It's got dual dog cam technology so the dog and the owner can see and hear  each other simultaneously while they're driving.  It's going to be produced  in Europe first, guys, before it goes to market here in the U.S. </p><p>And no, Dagen and, Maria, I don't know what it costs.  But I'm going to  find out.  It looks awesome.  </p><p>Somebody has to buy one.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, Ramon (ph) and Charlie (ph) I know would love it.   Ella Bella (ph) would like it, too.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But can I just point out it's critically important to secure  your dogs properly when they're riding in -- in the automobile.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If (ph) it does that, it -- it will save many pets' lives.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this is a good thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we had a great week this week here on MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  Take a look at some of the moments from the big show this week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on the GOP plan in terms of health care for  America?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, we applaud Speaker Ryan and Secretary Price for  getting out and putting a proposal on the table that seems like a -- a  reasonable and concrete plan.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You can call me happy Herman this morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy Herman?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Happy -- happy with this tax plan.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And here is why.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is Obamacare gone.  Mandates are gone.  Taxes are  gone.  Penalties are gone.  </p><p>And it's going to reestablish the healthcare marketplace and the health  insurance marketplace.  </p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR, HARVARD LAW:  The president doesn't get to  order wiretaps in the United States of America.  That's not the job of the  president.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  It (ph) has to come through the Justice Department, the FBI.   There were wiretaps that did capture conversations between officials and  Russians.  </p><p>Probably, it was wiretaps on the Russians.  We do that routinely.  We  wiretap everybody, every other country.  </p><p>But we're not allowed to wiretap the Trump Tower.  </p><p>JOHN NEGROPONTE, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO IRAQ:  We're hemorrhaging  classified information.  There are no secrets left anymore.  It's a big  problem.  </p><p>And I think mainly, it's a problem of information control.  </p><p>MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, ALLIANZ:  Battle lines are  forming both within the Republican Party and more broadly.  And the  question is the political judgment.  </p><p>To what extent will President Trump use his political capital here as  opposed to tax reform, infrastructure, which contributes directly and  quickly to economic growth?  </p><p>PAUL BROWNING, CEO, MITSUBISHI HITACHI POWER SYSTEMS AMERICAS:  As you put  in new tax policy, let's make sure that we don't put in tax policy that  creates a disincentive to do the kinds of things that our country has done  -- or our.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.  </p><p>BROWNING:  .our company has done.  </p><p>STEPHEN SCHORK, FOUNDER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  U.S. producers are now putting  500,000 barrels a day -- more oil onto the market to-date than they were  prior to the OPEC announcement.  </p><p>TONY ROBBINS, AUTHOR OF \"UNSHAKEABLE\":  I didn't want to write another book  as long as I lived, haven't had one (ph) for 20 years.  But then I just saw  so much fear.  </p><p>When does a bear show up?  About every five years, we're due for one.  It's  been eight.  They last a year.  </p><p>They cost about 33 percent but they don't cost anything if you don't sell  (ph).  And every single bear market in the history of the United States for  two centuries is stalled (ph) by a bull market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the priorities of this administration -- growth.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just realized (ph).  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get on it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get on it, that's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Colonel West, all -- all those Republicans who you still talk  to, and tell them to get on the tax reform.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're watching.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're warning them.  </p><p>FORMER REP. ALLEN WEST (R), FLORIDA:  I will -- I will be up -- I will be  in Washington, D.C. in two weeks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  </p><p>WEST:  I will make sure I tell them, Dagen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you have marching orders from Dagen McDowell.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>We will be watching.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll send you a.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>WEST:  Yes, ma'am.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you use these things as a doctor? </p><p>TIFFANY SIZEMORE, CARDIOLOGIST:  I do.  I use a smart scale every day.   This is a Withings (ph) and a Philips smart scale.  </p><p>They both do body mass index, fat percentage.  They track your -- your  weight on an app.  Each of them have apps.  </p><p>And you can see a graph, a poll (ph) kind of representation.  You can set  goals for yourself.  It tells you when you meet your goal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, how did you come up with this idea, first of all,  before we talk about all the treats that you brought, in terms of eating  cookie dough raw?  </p><p>KRISTEN TOMIHAN (ph):  Yes, so I have been lifelong baker.  Half the time I  would make cookies that -- it wouldn't even make it to the oven.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they (ph) ate all the dough.  </p><p>TOMIHAN (ph):  .because they're eating (ph) the cookie dough right from the  bowl.  So I had this moment when I was with a bunch of girlfriends and  thought, why is this not a thing?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  To celebrate March madness, Pizza Hut is introducing a limited  edition sneaker that has an ordering button built right in.  They are  called Pie Tops -- yes, Pie Tops.  </p><p>Just press the button on your sneaker and a fresh pizza will be delivered  to your exact location.  I just pressed the button several times.  </p><p>I'm hoping that they know we want a pizza and the pizza is delivered.  We  got the pizza.  This is incredible.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  An unchartered island.  Let me list all the ways you're  going to die.  Rain, heat, disease-carrying flies and we haven't started on  the things that want to eat you alive.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We'll double that.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Plus a bonus if we make it back. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes (ph).  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, that was a clip from the new film, \"Kong: Skull Island,\"  hitting theaters today.  Joining me now, \"In the FOXlight\" host and senior  vice president of marketing here at Fox News, Michael Tammero.  </p><p>Michael, good to see you.  </p><p>MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF MARKETING:  Hey, good  morning. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I wasn't sure if I would like that but it's starring John  Goodman, Tom Hiddleston, and Brie Larson -- hundred $90 million budget.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Hundred $90 million budget -- it's because it's (ph) part of the  \"Kong\" -- \"King\" for a reason.  He probably will top it off at the box  office this weekend -- tough competition against \"Logan\" which over- performed last weekend and earned about $80 million.  </p><p>This is an important movie for Warner Bros.  It's the second movie in a  (ph) big monster franchise.  Twenty-fourteen, they had \"Godzilla,\" a  hundred and $60 million budget, pulled in half a billion dollars globally.  </p><p>This is the second installment, they're going with \"King Kong.\"  They're  (ph) -- another \"Godzilla\" coming out next year.  </p><p>And then in 2020, there's a \"Godzilla\" \"King Kong\" mash-up.  So this -- but  first is we (ph) have to work, and it probably will.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"Godzilla\" \"King Kong\" mash-up, I love it.  All right, well,  we'll see if it does well.  </p><p>I guess I'm into it.  We'll see about that. </p><p>TAMMERO:  It's gotten pretty good reviews and the special effects are  supposed to be really good.  So we'll (ph) see it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, well, that'll do it, special effects.  All right, I want to  get your take on this -- a Mexico-based movie theater chain launching two  new in-theater playgrounds in Southern California.</p><p>TAMMERO:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .to draw audiences in.  So tickets cost $3 more.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Wow (ph).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .will be geared toward children ages three to 12.  But do you  want to go to the movies and have your kids play in a playground? </p><p>TAMMERO:  Popcorn and pink eye (ph), Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  That's all I'm saying.  Look, this is what theaters have to do.   You know, box office may be up on a dollar basis but attendance is flat or  down in most cases.  </p><p>There's a lot of competition out there with Netflix and other streaming  services.  People would rather stay home.  </p><p>So you've got to provide a reason for them to get out of the house and  actually go to the theaters.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree with that.  I'm in that category actually.  Give me a  reason, otherwise I'm watching in my.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Just give me a glass of wine and I am there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly, exactly.  All right, we've got to talk about \"Star.\" </p><p>TAMMERO:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .Fox new series featuring Queen Latifah and Lenny Kravitz,  along with model, Naomi Campbell.  Tell us about it. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Naomi Campbell, she came into Fox.  I sat down with her.  Let's  take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>TAMMERO:  Naomi Campbell, thanks for stepping \"Into the FOXlight.\"  You  look amazing as always.  </p><p>NAOMI CAMPBELL, MODEL:  Never been here before.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  \"Star,\" big episode tonight.  </p><p>CAMPBELL:  Right.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Tell us a little bit about your character and what's going on  right now.  </p><p>CAMPBELL:  Basically, I'm the mother of Alexandra Crane.  And Alexandra has  gotten herself caught up with this lovely guy next door in Atlanta which  I'm against all of it.  </p><p>My daughter is rebelling big time for how her rock star father, who's  played by Lenny Kravitz and her fashionable (ph) -- tried to be rock star  mother, kind of abandoned her as a child.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ROSE SPENCER-CRANE:  Why do you tell those people I was dead?  </p><p>ALEXANDRA CRANE:  I think you might as well be.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TAMMERO:  That area you came up then (ph) in the '90s, the whole supermodel  -- it was such an era (ph) -- I don't think it's ever going to be  duplicated again.  </p><p>CAMPBELL:  I love the ladies I came up with.  And we also interacted with  each other and supportive of each other.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  What has it like been for you to sort of come up as a woman, sort  of like blaze a trail with modeling and then. </p><p>CAMPBELL:  My whole -- just period -- my whole existence, I feel, has been  a challenge.  And so I don't get -- I -- kind of when a challenge comes up,  I don't get like all that nervous and scared (ph).  </p><p>It feels normal to me.  I am a fighter.  I am a survivor.  And that's how I  -- you know, I don't take anything for granted.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Yes.  </p><p>CAMPBELL:  I commit to what I get and stand and want to be pushing for  (ph), whatever it is say yes to these days -- these days. </p><p>TAMMERO:  Well, thank you for saying yes to coming here tonight.  </p><p>CAMPBELL:  Oh, no, thank you for having me.  Nice (ph) to meet you.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  So great to meet you.  </p><p>CAMPBELL:  You, too.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  And we can catch you Wednesday night.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was awesome.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  That was great (ph).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michael, great stuff.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Such a legend.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  See you later.  Michael Tammero.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.

Good Friday morning.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thanks so much for joining us.  It is Friday, March  10th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Next hour we will get the February jobs report.  Economists are looking job  creation of 190,000 jobs as the economy last month with the unemployment  ticking down to 4.7 percent.  What you need to see and know about jobs,  coming up this morning.</p><p>On to our nation's infrastructure getting a nearly failing grade in a new  report -- it's an issue President Trump is watching closely.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Our infrastructure is in  serious trouble.  We will build new roads and highways and tunnels and  airports and railways across the nation.  We will fix our existing product  before we build anything brand-new, however.  We have to fix what we have.   It's a mess.  So we are going to fix it first.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The very latest on infrastructure plans on top of all the other  plans coming out this morning.</p><p>Checking market action, we are watching oil prices today.  We are seeing a  bit of a rally after a tough week -- crude rebounding after closing at the  lowest level since November yesterday.  Oil below $50 a barrel still but up  this morning, two-thirds of 1 percent.</p><p>That's helping equities.  Stocks are higher across the world; futures  indicating a gain of about 70 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average.   Of course, the jobs number will certainly dictate what happens with the  stock market.  So we will be watching that.  But the market right now  rallying ahead of the jobs number.</p><p>In Europe, similar story.  Stocks are up between half of a percent and two- thirds of a percent across the Eurozone indices.</p><p>And in Asia overnight, markets are mostly higher, take a look, with the  exception of China.  Shanghai composite down a fraction.  Japan was strong,  up one and a half percent on the Nikkei average.</p><p>Plus \"The Terminator\" eyeing a move to Capitol Hill?  Arnold Schwarzenegger  not ruling out a Senate run, apparently.  We've got the details on what  he's saying this morning.</p><p>And Honey Nut Cheerios loses its iconic bee.  Take a look.  Why General  Mills is making the move, coming up this morning.</p><p>And one toddler not impressed by Queen Elizabeth -- why he threw a tantrum,  coming up this morning.</p><p>All those stories ahead and joining me to talk all about it Fox Business  Network's Dagen McDowell; Barron's online editor, interim editor of  \"Barron's Magazine\", congratulations Jack Otter.  </p><p>JACK OTTER, BARRON'S MAGAZINE:  Thanks very much -- Maria.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And \"New York Times\" bestselling author Peter Kiernan is here.   Good to see you.</p><p>PETER KIERNAN, AUTHOR:  Nice to see you again.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  Great show so far -- guys.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  Make sense of it -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it is Friday, after all.</p><p>But first this hour, President Trump set to face an uphill battle to follow  through on his promise to improve the country's infrastructure.  A new  report by the American Society of Civil Engineers giving the state of the  American infrastructure a near failing grade of D+.  The report is  estimating that restoring the country's facilities will cost more than $4.5  trillion outpacing President Trump's plan to spend $1 trillion.</p><p>Joining us right now is former Nebraska senator and 9/11 commission member  Bob Kerrey.  Senator -- good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BOB KERREY, FORMER NEBRASKA SENATOR:  You're welcome.  Nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, anybody who's traveled these roads in our airports, I  guess has seen that.  But what do you make of this study.  It's bad.  </p><p>KERREY:  Well, it would be $4.5 trillion well spent.  I mean even a bridge  to nowhere employs people.  And there's no question it would add to  productivity and add to (inaudible) the economy.  It'll be money well spent  if we can somehow figure out how to do it.  That's for sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do we do it, though?  I mean we keep facing this question,  whether it's Obamacare and, you know, subsidies, or the tax plan, and a  border adjustment tax to come up with ways to for all of that.  </p><p>KERREY:  I think -- look, I think governance matters. I think you have to  set it up so people have confidence that their money is going to be well  spent and it's not going to get sort of wrapped up into pork barrel  spending.  I think you could do that.</p><p>I think you're probably going to need a safe harbor for these things so you  can build faster because often times you find yourself up with 404  permitting -- that's a Corps of Engineers permitting process.</p><p>You have to figure out some way to give the American people confidence it's  going to be money well-spent.  And it is going to create jobs.  It is going  to strengthen the economy and that it can built rapidly.</p><p>I mean it's a problem.  I'm not sure we could build the interstate highway  system.  We darn sure couldn't build the Erie Canal.  So you've got to get  this thing set up so it can actually go as quickly as possible to really  creating excess jobs but confidence in the American people that it will  stimulate and grow the economy.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Some of the idea at least to pay for the $1  trillion because President Trump doesn't want to -- for the government to  spend taxpayer money of a trillion dollars but is for revenue sharing in  some projects.  Say toll roads, the private contractors.  </p><p>KERREY:  Look, money is money.  You only separate government money and  private money for ideological reasons.  So you're going to have to pull it  out of the economy one way or the other.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a fair point.  But the reason that infrastructure is  crumbling -- and I don't know if you agree with this or not -- is because  individuals want their roads and bridges fixed but they don't want to pay  for it.  They don't want to pay higher gas taxes.  That's why the gas tax  hasn't gone up in more than 20 years.  </p><p>KERREY:  That's true.  That's true although most taxpayers when they  understand that they are paying a gas tax for the road, at least it's a  user fee.  They feel like they're getting something for it.</p><p>I think the larger question is can I get confident that the money is not  going to get spent on boondoggle projects and that sort of thing.  Do I  have a governing board of people who are really smart, who are evaluating  what needs to be done?  What are the highest priorities?  And then to make  sure that they can be done quickly.</p><p>You need some -- I said some sign of safe harbor environmental expediting  process so these things can be done quickly.  There's no question that it  will strengthen the economy done correctly.  </p><p>OTTER:  Senator -- would there be some way to create -- to get a group of  civil engineers or whoever it would be together and just have them make the  decision and then put it to Congress for an up or down vote rather than  letting, you know, a hundred senators all will get their own pork barrel  spending in there and suddenly, as you say, you've got a boondoggle -- </p><p>KERREY:  I'm not sure that's going to work because I don't think it's an up  or down vote issue.  I think it's a ten-year process; it's a 20-year  process.  It's not like it's a one-year deal.</p><p>One of the problems we had with the stimulus bill in 2009, was do I have  shovel-ready projects.  Well, what you needed was multiyear funding  confidence.  And that's a 10-year, 20-year process.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the money was in many instances was allocated to states and  regions that didn't need infrastructure spending.  There were areas in  Connecticut where the roads got repaved that didn't need, where there were  stop lights put in that they didn't need them.  And that means that  somebody -- another area wasn't getting necessary money.  </p><p>KERREY:  Right.  There'll always be a little of that.  But I mean whether  civil engineers -- I mean just a governing board of people that are really  looking at where is the need, what would produce the greatest economic  benefit, what's best of our communities.</p><p>I mean this is not a difficult planning process and the $4 trillion doesn't  get spent in one year.  It's probably a ten-year, 20-year effort.  But I'm  just saying again, there's no question, done correctly, this would  strengthen the American economy.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  What about having something like a national infrastructure  development bank.  Some orchestrating body that would come together and  say, we are going to take the best ideas and the civil engineers.  We're  going to take the best ideas.  This is something both Democrats and  Republicans agree on.  What do you think of that idea?  </p><p>KERREY:  I think it's a good idea.  I think the selling point has to be are  you glad that your father's generation built the interstate highway?  Do  you think that the Erie Canal did something good?  The Erie Canal was  controversial.  Not a single member of the New York City delegation in  Albany voted for the Erie Canal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>KERREY:  So these things get controversial in the moment.  I think it's a  good idea to create some kind of banking process just so you can get some  leveraging activity, to finance in a smart way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not a priority for the administration over the near term.   That's just -- I mean they have this failing grade but Steven Mnuchin and  company have been very clear -- Obamacare, tax reform in 2017, and then  they will consider infrastructure. </p><p>I mean it's there, it's on the agenda but I want to switch gears, Senator.</p><p>KERREY:  Ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I've got to get your take over this Russia story because the  fall-out over Michael Flynn's communications with Russia taking a new turn  this morning.  So the former national security adviser admitting to being a  foreign agent after getting paid for lobbying work that may have benefited  the Turkish government.</p><p>The Trump administration distancing itself from the controversy.  Watch  this.  We want your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Hearing that story today  was the first I heard of it.  And I fully support the decision that  President Trump made to ask for General Flynn's resignation.  I think it is  an affirmation of the President's decision to ask General Flynn to resign.  </p><p>SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  This is what he did for a  living.  He was a private citizen at the time.  There's nothing nefarious  about doing anything that's legal as long as the proper paperwork is filed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you make of this?  How should we see this?  </p><p>KERREY:  It's not the question of is it legal or not; clearly it's legal.   The question is can you be the national security adviser if you have been  representing a foreign government, in this case Turkey, and I think the  answer is no.  And he should have told the President.</p><p>You know, it's not -- you want to do something.  I know what I have been  doing, I know whether or not that disqualifies me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's got to be up front.  </p><p>KERREY:  He should have known it was a disqualifying thing that he's done.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If he hadn't been kicked to the curve, so to speak, for lying to  Vice President Pence, he would be out the door because of this.</p><p>KERREY:  Well, he should -- he shouldn't -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If he all wasn't already gone, this would send him packing.  </p><p>KERREY:  Yes.  Look, all of us have a little bit of self-delusion going on  in our lives.  And I think this guy had a little bit more than most of us.   And he should have been able to recognize that he's representing Turkey, if  he's actually registered -- that's another question, did he register?   Regardless, if he's representing Turkey, he can't be the national security  adviser.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on these wiretapping allegations from the  President?  </p><p>KERREY:  I don't know -- it's kind of bizarre.  That and a tweet on Arnold  Schwarzenegger in the same ten-minute walk around the second floor in your  jammies.  I was a little bit taken aback by the whole thing.  I think that  unfortunately for him, what it does is it strengths the case that we need  to -- a general investigation of this thing, one that gets confidence.</p><p>And I hope the Senate Intel Committee can to pull it off.  It's not easy to  do.  </p><p>OTTER:  What is it -- could we have a boy who cried \"wolf\" situation here.   I mean there's so many crazy things coming out of that Twitter account.  At  some point do people start to take the President with less authority than  they really should?</p><p>KERREY:  Well, I'm not sure he cares more about -- I think he cares more  about his ratings than he does his approval ratings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he's got that interaction going with the people.</p><p>KERREY:  Right now -- he's the highest rating show in the country.  You  have to get him credit for that.  Schwarzenegger got kicked off because his  ratings are down and Trump's ratings are up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about Schwarzenegger because former California  governor Arnold Schwarzenegger could be considering a run for the Senate  according to Politico.  So Politico is reporting that on the heels of  President Trump and Schwarzenegger's feud over the ratings of \"The  Celebrity Apprentice\" and President Trump's leadership, do think  Schwarzenegger's dispute with the President has anything to do with his  possible -- </p><p>KERREY:  I would say if he gets elected, he's not going to be a reliable  vote for the President.  (inaudible) but I will bet my top bet of a dollar  that Arnold Schwarzenegger is not going to run for Senate.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How he would change the Senate?  </p><p>KERREY:  I don't think it changes much at all.  One more guy hitting the  camera.  So I don't think -- we will see what he does.  But I don't think  it's a fundamental change in the Senate politics.  As I said, I think it's  highly unlikely that he does it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean he won the governorship.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KIERNAN:  They both share -- they share a passion for the limelight.  And  they both milk it pretty well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they do.  </p><p>KERREY:  Yes.  Well, you know, the limelight's pretty dim for a junior  senator, one out of 100 so we will see whether or not he pursues that.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  So he won't be back?  </p><p>KERREY:  No, I don't know.  We'll see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I was going to say.</p><p>OTTER:  Senator -- last night we had a big dinner for Barron's sponsors and  obviously Trump is the talk of every dinner table.</p><p>KERREY:  Yes.</p><p>OTTER:  And one financial guy I was talking to said if Trump is successful  as a president it could really hurt the concept of the career politician.   And Schwarzenegger would seem the obvious sort of person to start to fill  in if American people are looking for something other than a politician.</p><p>Do you think that's a -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KERREY:  He could also elevate the idea that somebody really ought to be  competent before he be put in the job, so.  </p><p>OTTER:  Very good point.  </p><p>KERREY:  Yes. </p><p>I don't think it does that.  I mean, there is something odd going on.  I  don't want a career politician and they want a career doctor, they want a  career lawyer, they want a professional in all of their ways and you do  acquire skills and knowledge the longer you are on the job.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I am going to push back because just because -- </p><p>KERREY:  Please do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- he communicates with people differently.  Just because he's a  very different person doesn't mean that he's incompetent.</p><p>KERREY:  Well, I don't -- I'm not saying that he's incompetent.  That's not  the case I'm making.  But if you're going to go into politics there's a  certain (inaudible) that's required.  I mean I'm a fan of Governor Raimondo  and Governor Kasich of Ohio.</p><p>And you watch what they did, what watch Raimondo did to get the pensions  under control and saying as a Democrat, we've got to deal with pensions;  and took heat from the left, took heat from the right, Kasich did as well.   But they handled it in my view in a very professional fashion.  As a  consequence they get things done.</p><p>I'm not saying that Trump is, by any means, incompetent.  I'm just saying  if you're trying to actually move the ball down -- take health care, for  example.  This is not difficult to figure out what to do.  You're going to  lose the guys on the right, you're going to lose the guys on the left, you  put a bill together and you get it done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But look at his first one hundred days.  Have you ever seen as  active a period for an incoming president?  What are we now?  Day 48, ok,  day 48 and how many executive orders has he done.  Look at the agenda --  Obamacare, tax reform.  </p><p>KERREY:  But Maria he has made no appeal to try to bring the country  together.  You have -- the demonstrations that are going on are not sort  organized by some malicious force.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the Dems have been obstructing.</p><p>KERREY:  This isn't the Dems.  This isn't the Dem that are on the streets.   This is Americans who are upset by many of the things that he said and many  of the things that he is doing.  He has made no appeal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How can he do that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He made an appeal in that speech, in that speech in front of  Congress.  He made an appeal.</p><p>KERREY:  But the people he's bringing into the government are substantially  on the right -- in many cases extreme right.  Take Pruitt of EPA.  If  you're concerned about the environment, you spend your time concerned about  the environment, this guy is not going to bring you on board.  He's not  going to do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  All right, we're going to leave it there.  We'll  be watching.  Senator Kerrey -- thank you.</p><p>We will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Massive protests underway in South Korea this morning after the country's  constitutional court formally removed the impeached president from office.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  The scandal has been going on, we should  say, for months here -- Maria.  At least two people have now died and about  30 others have been injured when supporters of President Park Geun-Hye  clashed with police in massive protest in that country.</p><p>The court's decision came months after a major corruption scandal plunged  that country into political turmoil.  She's the first South Korean  president to be thrown out of office by the court.</p><p>Meanwhile tens of thousands of people holding a peaceful rally celebrating  the court's ruling.  South Korea's Kospi index, we should say, did close  higher today.</p><p>Well, it is a day of reckoning for Volkswagen.  The German automaker  expected to plead guilty this morning to three criminal counts in the  Justice Department's diesel omissions investigation.  VW could also be  sentenced by the judge in the case. That company agreed in January to plead  guilty and pay $4.3 billion in fines for programming more than half a  million diesel cars to cheat on U.S. emissions test.</p><p>VW also admitted to lying to investigators to cover up that scheme.   Criminal charges have also been filed against seven VW employees.</p><p>Well, you may have noticed something missing on your Honey Nut Cheerios  box.  Look at it this morning if it's in your kitchen.  The maker of the  cereal, General Mills, has removed the mascot bee to raise awareness of the  vanishing bee colonies around the world.  The boxes now feature a white boy  where the bee used to be.  Bees are a big part of the world's food supply  we should say.  General Mills says 30 percent of the ingredients that are  used in its products rely on bee pollination.  Big move by a big company.</p><p>And finally, we all know kids can be kind of unpredictable but do you want  it to happen in front of the queen of England?  Well, two-year-old Alfie  threw a major tantrum.  As flowers were being handed to Her Majesty at an  official ceremony the meltdown happened at the unveiling of a war memorial  in London yesterday.</p><p>The kid is freaking out.  The queen met with young Alfie's father who was  awarded, by the way, a bravery medal and his wife.  Prince Philip and the  Queen pretty patient as Alfie continued to freak out the entire time.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He is not having it.</p><p>CASONE:  He was like, whatever lady, get away from me, queen person.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  He deserves that bravery medal.  He decided to think about him,  give it to her.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So cute.</p><p>Cheryl -- thank you.</p><p>Coming up, cyber security risks in focus -- what the most recent WikiLeaks  dump means for the technology companies and the privacy of your  information.</p><p>Plus Michael Jordan scores a slam dunk, how he's cashing in on his own  mistake -- next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR:  It's something that I don't mean to freak you  out with, but I think it's true.  Even our memories are not absolutely  private in America.  Even our communications with our spouses, with our  clergy members, with our attorneys are not absolutely private in America.   The general principle is one we've always accepted in this country.  There  is no such thing as absolute privacy in America.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And of course, we are learning that more and more every day.   That was FBI director James Comey speaking candidly about privacy at a  cyber security conference earlier this week.</p><p>Of course, fresh concerns over personal privacy as well raised this week  after WikiLeaks published details about what it says are CIA tools capable  of hacking consumer electronics for espionage.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about cyber security is Tech Data CEO Bob  Dutkowsky.  Good to see you -- Bob.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>ROBERT DUTKOWSKY, TECH DATA CEO:  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First of all, your reaction to him saying even our memories are  not private -- what?  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  Well, if you think about we transpose everything that we think  about today into technology.  Social media causes us to think and publish  things freely and so as soon as information gets into a computer whether  it's a pc or a phone or a sensor on the end of IOT, there's a security risk  and it's exposed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How nervous should we be though that like the smart TVs and the  smart phones that we all have are just not listening devices, that we are  being watched at all times?  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  I think it comes back to the integrity of the companies that  build the products and do they try to tighten them up as much as they can.   But it's technology and technology is exposed.  And so the whole cyber  security industry now is a massive industry.  And it's a place where Tech  Data is committed and invested heavily to be able to support our customers  and their users to make their environments more secure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you do?  Tell us about your cyber security business.  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  We partner with the companies in the IT industry that are  really the titans of the security industry -- companies like Cisco and IBM  and HP, Microsoft, Oracle and we take their security products and we sell  them into the small and medium-sized business all the way up to large  governmental agencies.</p><p>We are one of those routes to market that very few people understand exist.   We're a middle person between the developers of the industry and then that  community that needs cyber security.  </p><p>OTTER:  I would be interested to know on a personal level because you know  so much about this -- do you take any steps that viewers can learn from in  terms of your own life and security?  I mean I have an Amazon Echo in our  family kitchen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're dead.  You're dead.  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  So does everyone.  To Maria's question, is Alexa listening to  us?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The device is spying on us.</p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  You know, so how else could Alexa wake up when you say Alexa  find Tim McGraw music unless Alexa is listening?  Clearly there's a threat  there.  But, you know, I think -- I think you have to be acutely aware at  all times about security today.</p><p>I've had my identity stolen and it's a really painful process.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even you, the CEO of Tech Data had his identity stolen.  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  Back in the old IRS, remember when there was the IRS hack back  a couple of years ago.  My family and I were one of those ones that got  hacked and it's been an endless process now to try to protect ourselves.</p><p>But you know, there are the services that you sign up for that protect if  there's -- if somebody tries to open a credit card account or whatever.  I  would just encourage everybody to really think aggressively about security  all the way up to my company, Tech Data -- we have a cyber security  committee on our board of directors, one of the few Fortune 100 companies  that do that because half of our business comes to us over technology  electronically.</p><p>So you know, if you talk about enterprise risks, the whole idea of cyber  security for a company like Tech Data is really important and we govern it  from the top of the company to try to be secure.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bob -- can I just ask you though because everybody was so upset  about the WikiLeaks release of whatever you want to call -- hacked CIA  tools.  But as more people go online, as our lives are increasingly  digitized and online on the Internet and the Cloud, isn't there the  expectation that the government keeps up with that technology development  in order to protect us and to hunt down terrorists which is what the CIA  was essentially doing with these tools?  There's no evidence that they were  spying on the American people.  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  You know, if you think about it one of the government's  responsibilities is try to keep us and the country safe and we built a  government over all these years that thought about wars, battles.  And now  there is a war in cyber security and the bad guys are just as smart and  just as talented as the good guys.</p><p>And so, you know, I think we are just in the very early innings of how the  cyber security war is going to play out.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Bob, I have seen your company over the years.  In 1983 you guys  went into PCs and personal computers grew from there.  A few years ago you  went into data center and you just doubled down with a major acquisition  that takes in the data centers all throughout Asia.  What is your view on  the data center and where can we see your company going from there?  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  Yes, the data center, we do the data center as kind of the off- ramp to the next great technology area and that's commonly referred to as  the third platform.  And that's areas like security, mobility, big data  analytics, hyper-converged and converged infrastructure.  It's a whole new  arena of computing.</p><p>And all of it points to the data center as the place where the intellectual  property exists to make the next generation work.  And so Tech Data made a  decision to double down in the data center.</p><p>Our organic data center business was about $8 billion a year and now we  acquired the data center business from AVNET, another $8 billion.  And so  we'd be the largest data center player in the IT channel in the world.  And  we think it takes skills and commitment and capabilities and scale to be  able to really add value in that space and we made that move this week.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are major technology companies, do they have holes?  Because  Julian Assange is saying, look I'm going to help the major technology  companies fix their vulnerabilities.  And we haven't heard from tech  companies yet in response to that.  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  No one is perfect.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So there are vulnerabilities.</p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  Yes, I think every system in the world has a vulnerability.  If  it has technology, there's a space where a smart person can get at that.   And so the engineering efforts that take place in the world's leading  technology companies are all focused on trying to close up those gaps but  they are always moving.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you reported earnings this week.  You want to characterize  real quick where the growth was?  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  The growth was in security, all around our geographies, a  rebirth of the laptops because PC companies are innovating again and new  products are really attractive.  Mobility and software around the world --  a very, very good market for Tech Data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll leave it. </p><p>Bob -- great to have you on the show today.  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Bob Dutkowsky joining us -- CEO at Tech  Data.</p><p>Coming up drones are not welcome in Oklahoma, apparently.  The State  lawmaker who's proposing to allowing property owners to destroy any  trespassing drones.  That's next.</p><p>And then healthy living gets even smarter.  The gadgets you need in your  home to upgrade your daily routine.  We've got that coming up back in a  moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  Welcome back.  It's Friday morning, everybody.   I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thank you so much for being with us.  It is Friday,  March 10th on a snowy morning.  Take a look behind me.  It is official.  It  has started snowing in New York.  Yesterday it was 50 degrees.  Today we've  got a storm in front of us.  Here are your top stories 7:30 am on the East  Coast.  </p><p>We are waiting the February Jobs Report due out one hour from right now.   Economists are looking for Job Creation of 190,000 jobs to be added to the  economy last month, but the unemployment rate ticking down to 4.7 percent.   We'll get you those numbers as they get to take.  They are certainly  anticipating a good number.  After the number hitch Stuart Varney breaking  it all down with the president's top Economic Advisor, the Director of  Natural Economic Council, Gary Cohn will join Stuart and company at 10:00  am Eastern.  </p><p>So stay right here to hear from Gary Cohn on those jobs numbers.  First  off, take a look at market action, watching the price of oil this morning.   Crude is rebounding after closing it the lowest level since November.   Yesterday, it's up two-thirds of one percent this morning at 49.61.  Let's  (inaudible) the stocks across the world.  Futures pointing to gain at the  opening of trading this morning up 70 points on the Dow Jones Industrial  Average.  </p><p>We'll see what the numbers bring and if these changes.  In Europe, markets  are in the green as well.  Take a look, higher across the board in the  Eurozone industries.  Up about two-thirds of one percent across the board.   And in Asia overnight stocks mostly higher.  Shanghai composite, the one  exception, down a fraction.  Japan was strong up one and a half percent in  the Nikkei Average.  </p><p>The debate over drones why one lawmakers trying to make it legal for you to  take out a drone that flies out onto your property.  And better way to  track your families' health, the high-tech accessory that turn your  smartphone into a private physician.  We've got it all coming up with Dr.  Sizemore who's here.  Plus a slip of the tongue is leading to big bucks for  one basketball great.  </p><p>How Michael Jordan is cashing in on a (inaudible) that he made.  We'll tell  you about it.  First our top story this half hour.  One lawmaker wants to  protect homeowners from drones that fly onto their property.  A bill headed  to the OklahomaSenate floor would exempt people from civil liability if  they damage trespassing drones not regulated by the Federal Aviation  Administration.  </p><p>Joining us is Oklahoma State Senator Ralph Shortey.  State Senator Shortey,  good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>STATE SEN. RALPH SHORTEY (R), OKLAHOMA:  Good morning.  Thank you for  having me.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you authored this bill.  What is your reason behind it?   Let's talk first where you see the trouble.  </p><p>SHORTEY:  Oh, well, you know, first off, I support the industry  tremendously.  In fact, few years ago I was looking at starting a drone  service company that would do this kind of work.  So, the industry is a  thriving industry.  And I think of something that we really need to look  forward to the future.  How are you also got a balance of that private  property.  The expectation of privacy of landowners.  </p><p>And this is a bill, but I think is very balance in doing that.  There are - - there are still some changes that need to occur with it.  But for the  most part what it's going to do is where civil liability to landowners who  that damage the drone in any way that where there is a reasonable  expectation and privacy.  And right now there are two Supreme Court cases  that kind of control what airspace is and whose it is.  </p><p>That would be the Causby case from 1946 and then the Riley case from 1986.   That pretty much establishes that under the 400-foot threshold property  owners have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  The bill is written with  those wordings because as this evolves then the laws need to evolve as well  to grant enough liberty for the industry, but also protect the privacy  rights of citizens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, I don't know how (inaudible) feels about this.  But I  agree with you.  I mean, things have gotten out of hand.  You've got drones  flying.  You don't know if they have a camera on them and if they are  spying on you and they are on your property.  Having said that, the  companies like Amazon and UPS they've started testing drone deliveries.  </p><p>So, how you address that if you've got a delivery coming -- or delivery  coming next door and the drone has to fly over your house to get to the  delivery that it has to make and it has a camera.  What you do you then?</p><p>SHORTEY:  Yes.  Well, that's -- and that's where, you know, we really need  some guidance from congress on where you're going to allow this.  I mean,  the Causby case is very clear.  It's at all the way up from 326 feet and  for sure 83-foot.  The FAA has no regulatory authority up to 83-foot on any  land and 326-foot from most properties.  And so, you know, I love it.  </p><p>I do Amazon Prime all the time.  I hope and I cannot wait for the first day  that a drone delivers a package to my door.  But it's got to be done  properly.  And, you know, if you invite that drone to your property you  don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy at that point.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Right.  Well...</p><p>SHORTEY:  But for those people that would.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You've done...</p><p>SHORTEY:  And that's why (inaudible) it's become -- it's become a public  safety issue.  We've got cattle rustlers that are using this to spy on  people's land so they can steal cattle.  We've got people using drones to  smuggle drugs into prisons.  And so, it's becoming a serious issue and it's  -- and it's widespread.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, drug smuggling is -- into a prison it's clearly not legal  but what about the use of drones to survey another man's property?  There's  no -- there's no law on the books right now that would say that you can't  do that.  That, to your point?</p><p>SHORTEY:  Well, I think -- I think the Supreme Court (inaudible) are -- I  mean, they are controlling law right now.  And the Supreme Court really  specifically state that the public has no access.  The public has no right  underneath 400-foot.  That's what the FAA regulates.  And so, when you're  talking about invading somebody's private property, we know the threshold  is at least 83-foot.  If you're flying a drone over somebody's property and  it's 10-foot, 83-foot, whatever.  </p><p>Then that property owner has a right to recourse.  And this is established.   Now again, this is not given any criminal liability protection.  Simply  civil liability protections.  So that way, if a drone operator is 10-foot  in your property and you bat that thing down with a bat or a net or an RF  interrupter or some kind of technology that can bring it down because  they're spying on you then the property -- the drone operator cannot sue  you for that.  </p><p>The perfect example is Senator Inhofe.  Every year he does a pigeon hunt.   Well, last year during this pigeon hunt (inaudible) just flew a drone right  overhead of these guys that were hunting these birds and one of them shot  it down.  Well, they sent Senator Inhofe a bill for that drone.  And that  could even sue him for the -- for the damage to that drone.  And that is  ridiculous.  That is a kind of stuff I'm trying to stop.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And so -- wait.  Let me just ask you.  Is that the way you  propose homeowners take that drone down by shooting it down?  Is that what  we should do?</p><p>SHORTEY:  Well, it's going to be -- it's going to be entirely different  depending where you are.  In the rural areas I think that would be -- if  it's -- if it's -- I mean, you got to understand the shotguns, the range is  30 to 50-foot (inaudible) you are not going to be able to shoot this thing  with a rifle.  They're just too small to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You'd shot down...</p><p>SHORTEY:  But I would -- I would -- I would suggest -- I would suggest some  kind of RF interrupter or even a net.  I mean, you know, it just -- it just  depends on the situation.  But if you fail... </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What if you don't have a gun?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  This is a feel-good bill of the decade.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What if you don't have a shotgun?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's from Oklahoma.  Everybody's got a gun in Oklahoma.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But I'm in New York and there are drones flying all over  near my house.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, nobody -- yes, nobody owns.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think this is the feel-good bill of the decade.  I  think it's fantastic.  And I think -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- Orkin and say, \"Here's a new kind of pest control.\"   Bring in Orkin, get the Orkin man, he'll take it out.  That's the way to  get rid of them.  I think there are a lot of frequency things you can do  without using a shotgun.  Although that might be fun.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, senator, one quick question.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SHORTEY:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It sounds as if we -- in addition to what you're trying  to do.  We really need a broader guideline on how drones appropriate, how  they're not appropriate and to try to regulate this because it can get a  little scary.  Do you have a big picture view of what we're going to be  doing, you know, over the next 10 years to make sure these things they'll  get out of control?</p><p>SHORTEY:  Yes, absolutely.  Congress has to act.  And, you know, right now  they gave the FAA the authority to regulate these things.  The regulations  came out this summer and they were not good enough.  They do not -- they do  not protect private property well enough.  And (inaudible) the job of FAA  too to protect private -- I mean, that's not -- their job is to regulate.  </p><p>Their job is not to create law.  Congress really needs to step in.  We're  going to have to set up some kind of a -- some kind of a commerce system  where, you know, you're going to protect private property interest to a  certain height and then there's going to have to be an area where these  things can fly that is regulated or that is authorized by congress so that  way they are not interfering with commercial traffic and they're also  protecting the private interest in the privacy interest of folks.  </p><p>We've got to do this.  This bill is simply right now (inaudible) call the  Aeronautics Commission a few weeks ago.  And there was a drone in her  backyard with flashing light, so she had no idea what to do with it.  Had  she taken some kind of action against that thing?  Then the drone operator  could have sued her.  This is simply a placeholder until congress fixes  this issue and figures out what to do with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the bottom line, State Senator, you think drones should be  regulated?</p><p>SHORTEY:  Absolutely.  And I think they're necessary.  I mean, I think it's  -- I think it's a great industry and I -- and I will support it.  But  absolutely got to be regulated.  And, you know, the interest the -- you  know, the government's interest is to protect the citizen first.  To  advance then the industry is second and then when there is conflict their  job is to come in and balance that conflict out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SHORTEY:  And that's what we need -- that's what we need the government to  do right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Senator, good to have you  on the program today.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>SHORTEY:  Thank you very much.  You have a good day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  State Senator Ralph Shortey joining us there from Oklahoma.  I  want to see what the Trump administration has to say about regulating the  drone industry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This got to have to happen.  And by the way, there's a  lot of (inaudible) in cellular and other kinds of businesses where you have  to regulate.  Otherwise, people are going to be crossing over your line.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What are conservatives going to say about that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to point one thing out.  Amazon if they start drone  delivery.  They'll just make you sign a waiver.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No question about it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When you order.  If that's how they get around it. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, I'm on the board of the (inaudible) and one  of the things they're trying to do is defense plays a role here too.  And  this has to be orchestrated in some way because you have (inaudible)  flying, there are drones right near the airport.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That makes no sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you got to have to have your shotgun ready that's for sure.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  (inaudible)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  A doctor at your fingertips.  The devices that you  need to have to upgrade your lifestyle straight ahead.  And then markets  eyeing the February Jobs Report, we'll bring you the numbers and the  analysis in the next hour.  Stay with us.  Big day ahead with markets and  the jobs number coming out.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  From what you eat to what you breed it is  important to put good things into your body and with modern technology it's  easier than ever to track your health between doctor visits.  Oh, not only  for you but your children as well.  You can monitor results straight from  your phone.  </p><p>It's amazing what you can do today.  Joining me once again for part two of  our special series.  (inaudible) certified Cardiologist Preventive Health  Expert, Dr. Tiffany Sizemore.  Good to see you.  Thank you so much for  joining us.</p><p>DR. TIFFANY SIZEMORE, CARDIOLOGIST PREVENTIVE HEALTH EXPERT:  Hi.  Thanks  for having me again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dr. Tiffany.  All right.  So we have some things.  I know  you're not associated with any of these companies.  </p><p>SIZEMORE:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That make these products.  But let first begin with the  thermometer.  This is a different thermometer then you showed us yesterday.   You also got the ear thermometer.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  So, yesterday was the temporal kind of scan (inaudible) through  the forehead.  This is a typical what a lot of parents are used to.  Just a  regular ear thermometer.  What's nice about it, it's just a one button push  and it also links to an app as well.  This is a Philips as well.  So, when  you take your child to the pediatrician then the pediatrician has a record  of all of the different temperatures.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  So, it's very straightforward.  It is a lot more expensive than  the one -- excuse me, inexpensive than the one we have on yesterday.  It's  a very good option.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Now, a lot of adults are interested in monitoring  their blood pressure.  There's a smart option for that as well so far.  </p><p>SIZEMORE:  Yes.  And as a cardiologist, these are very important to me.   So, again, we have a Withings blood pressure cuff and a Philips blood  pressure cuff.  Again, as with the other products that we had yesterday  they all link to an app.  So, the Withings are all link to the Withings  app, and the Philips all link to the Philips' app.  What's nice about this  is how small they are.  So, you can actually to put this in a tote if  you're a female and you could take it with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's easy to do.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Super easy to do.  I mean, I'll do it if you want me to.  But  you basically just put it on and hit a button.  And then with the Withings,  automatically launches the app and the app spits out your blood pressure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let me -- let me ask you about improving sleep.  We  all need that here.  This is something that improves your sleep?  </p><p>SIZEMORE:  Well, this actually monitors.  Basically everything that's going  on -- well, not just everything, in your bedroom.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SIZEMORE:  So -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Almost everything.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Yes.  Almost everything.  I mean, mostly your activity but --  so, basically what's cool about this, it sleeps -- it sleeps underneath the  sheet.  So, you can imagine if it just goes underneath the tablecloth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Underneath the sheet and it's got a very long extension cord  where it plugs -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Under the sheet?</p><p>SIZEMORE:  -- into the wall.  Yes.  So, you don't have to touch anything.   As soon as you lay on the bed it starts monitoring.  It goes directly to an  app.  It tells the temperature, the humidity in the room, what your  respirations were at night, what your heart rate was at night.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it'll tell you when you're having real Z's like a good  night -- </p><p>SIZEMORE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- sleep versus getting up a lot?</p><p>SIZEMORE:  And it also links to an app.  And so, it can tell what kind of  level of sleep you're in and when is most appropriate for you to wake up so  you're not alarmed.  So, it has the smart alarm set to it as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very interesting.  All right.  That's about $140 there.  Tell  us about the air monitoring devices.  Why do we need air monitoring?</p><p>SIZEMORE:  You know, I think this is great for people with children maybe  if they have animals or people that have allergies that are concerned about  the allergens in the air.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, for school.  Yes, yes, that's right.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  So, this is -- basically it's the same exact product but one is  made out of wood and one has a silicon rubber.  So, this is great for  nurseries because it's -- it has rounded corners.  It's not very hard.  And  I'm not sure if it'll show up here.  But basically it analyzes the air and  spits out the number in the app from zero to one hundred.  </p><p>One hundred being wonderful air quality, zero being not so great.  That app  then then tells you why your air quality is not good and then gives you  advice as to what to do to improve the air quality.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because there could be particles in the air and that will  -- </p><p>SIZEMORE:  Right.  And then carbon dioxide -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  -- dust, chemicals.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, that's really important.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  It's great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Then you've got a smart kitchen scale here.  We saw  the scales that we had yesterday.  That's an -- </p><p>SIZEMORE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- an actual scale.  This is the kitchen scale.  </p><p>SIZEMORE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's that all about?</p><p>SIZEMORE:  This is actually it's great because it's very lightweight.  It  weighs basically nothing.  So, it's easy to get around in your kitchen.  It  weighs solids and liquids.  And if you can see.  I'm not sure if -- I'll do  it here.  But -- I don't know if they hit the zero.  But anyway -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how much it weighs?</p><p>SIZEMORE:  It shows you how much it weighs.  It's very accurate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, why do I need that?</p><p>SIZEMORE:  This is also great too.  It's also has an app and you can -- it  tells you based upon what you're putting on the scale it tells you calorie.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes (inaudible) </p><p>SIZEMORE:  It tells you carbohydrate, it tells you if you're trying to  watch your sodium intake.  So, it's really -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  -- good for people who do have some cardiovascular issues that  have to watch certain sodium intake.  It's also good for people who are  really trying to watch what they're eating in terms of carbohydrate to lose  weight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredibly informant.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Yes, it's awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we do need that.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  I don't cook so I'll never use it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tracking workout.  There's a lot of things to track your  workout today, right?  But this is -- it can record distance traveled and  how many push-ups you did?</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Yes.  So, this is really great for people who don't really want  to wear a smart watch.  They're not into being, you know, having every  single step they take monitor.  This is actually a chest trap and you use  it only when you're actually exercising.  </p><p>And it is probably the most accurate because it is right by the heart and  it's excellent at measuring exactly what your pulses, how many push-ups  you're doing.  So, in terms of accuracy it's probably the best.  But it's  not something you're going to wear every day.  It's only something that you  wear when you exercise.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it just really monitoring your heart rate?</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  OK, good stuff.  Dr. Tiffany great to see you.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for going through all of this.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Absolutely.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, this is great.  Tiffany Sizemore joining us there.   Take a short break.  When we come back, Michael Jordan's slip of the tongue  is now paying off big time.  How he's cashing in on the mistake he made.   And then catch my interview with Tony Robbins on Wall Street Week this  weekend.  We talk everything from his business empire to his investing  tips.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A wild first day of free agency in the NFL.   Jared Max joins us now with the whole story.  Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FBN SPORTSCASTER:  Happy Friday, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And to you.</p><p>MAX:  When players have the power to break their own new stories on social  media it can lead to confusion.  Like we have at this very moment.  Around  4:00 am Eastern Time less than four hours ago.  The verified Instagram  account of Patriots backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo posted this, \"So  grateful for my time in New England.  Peace out Boston.\"  </p><p>What's worse is that the top NFL insiders believe this was a prank or a  hoax that Garoppolo's account was hacked.  NFL.com's Ian Rapoport tweeted  this morning, \"Spoke to someone in the grandma point --dash mike the  verified instagram report.  They believe it was a prank or hoax.  They  tweeted this morning.  </p><p>Spoke to someone close to Garoppolo who had no knowledge of any trade and  believes it's a hack.  And WBZ in Boston says, \"The Patriots spokesman  saying the team is not aware of Garoppolo leaving.  Stay tuned.\"  One  Instagram post from an NFL quarterback we can verify as genuine.  This  video posted yesterday by soon-to-be ex-Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony  Romo.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TONY ROOM, QUARTERBACK, DALLAS COWBOYS:  Me and my family felt the  outpouring support and love from all of you.  It's been overwhelming.  And,  you know, it doesn't go unnoticed.  So, I want to say thank you and we have  a lot to think about going forward but we'll see what happens.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  For the times they aren't changing.  You catch that plane at the  background?  Romo was not released by the Cowboys as wildly reported  yesterday.  He could get traded now.  Perhaps to the Houston Texans.  One  year since they snagged quarterback Brock Osweiler from Denver Broncos for  the $72 million dollar contract.  Texans traded Brock Osweiler yesterday to  the Cleveland Browns.  </p><p>Houston frees up to $10 million and salary cap space perhaps for Tony Romo.   And they get a fourth round draft pick this year.  Second and six rounders  in next year.  But Osweiler reportedly could be traded baked to be flipped  in another deal.  Browns have said to be interested in Jimmy Garoppolo.  A  federal lawsuit was filed yesterday against the NFL.  Over 1,800 former  players are suing the league they claim that medical staffs on team's  pumped up players with powerful pain medications an anti-inflammatories to  keep the players on the field.  </p><p>The sue claims that teams pressure the medical staffs to inject the players  with the pain killers to keep them in playing condition.  And anybody  turned on the TV yesterday and wondered why Michigan basketball players  were wearing their practice jerseys against Illinois?  Well, because the  FAA and the NTSB are investigating why the Wolverines' charter flight had  skidded 400 yards approximately off the runway, Wednesday.  </p><p>Well, the team does not have access to its luggage.  It's under  investigation part of it.  So, this contains the Wolverines' uniforms home  in a way along with shoes and warm-ups.  So, they had to wear the jerseys,  the practice jerseys yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Huh?</p><p>MAX:  And they'll continue to do it because the stuff is -- they can't get  to it.  It's under investigation.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, what about this thing in the NFL with the pumping  them up with pain killers?  I mean, anybody who read North Dallas Forty,  you know, this has been going on for 50 years, 40 years, forever and ever.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.  And, you know, and this is -- there's another argument against  this which is been going on and tied with other stuff with medical  marijuana where they are trying to -- players, ex-players, current players  saying this is what they want for treatment.  And the NFL not going in that  direction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I tell you, this is a big cost to pay.  To -- and that's what  Jason Herston told us yesterday.  And when I said to him, \"Would you go  into the NFL today?\"  He was like, \"It's a big cost to pay.\"  But I want to  ask you about this rebound.  NBA legend Michael Jordan turning a simple  slip up into big money.  During the Duke-North Carolina basketball game on  Saturday, the Tar Heel alum accidentally said the ceiling is the roof  instead of the sky's the limit.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ceiling is the roof.  And so now he's embracing the phrase  reportedly (inaudible) to sell the shirt that says \"Ceiling.  Roof.  Goat.\"   Which it stands for greatest of all time.  Oh, that's funny.</p><p>MAX:  Imagine it was a brilliant marketing plug by Michael Jordan for his  brand.  Screw up really badly.  Make itself deprecating and then sell the  shirt.  It's like the baseball cards, the misprints for the most popular  ones always.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he's going to make good money on it, huh?</p><p>MAX:  Yes, good money.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Note to the kiddies, when you screw up just own it. </p><p>MAX:  Own it.  Own it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he is.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's owning it all right.  And he's owning it all the way to  the bank.  Jared, thank you.  We'll be right back.

Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thank you so much for joining us.  It is  Friday, March 10th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 on the East Coast.  It is Jobs Day, we are 30 minutes  away from February Jobs report.  Economists are looking for 190,000 jobs that have added to the  economy.  Peter Kiernan says it's going to be --</p><p>PETER KIERNAN, FORMER GOLDMAN SACHS PARTNER:  A blowout.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A blowout.  The unemployment rate expected to take down to 4.7 percent.  If we get a big  number, it's going to impact the markets and obviously we're expecting interest rate hike next week on the  15th.  The numbers as soon as they hit the tape on to you.  The growing debate over healthcare in  America meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan trying is to explain why the current plan should be passed  but not all republicans are onboard yet.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL RYAN, SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  This is the  closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare.  The time is here, the time is now, it really  comes down to a binary choice, we now have the ability through the budget rules that we have in the  senate with our three-pronged approach to actually make good on our word.  </p><p>JIM JORDAN, UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE FOR OHIO:  God bless the speaker but that's not  how the legislative process works, right?  If you -- if you got an idea that you can get to the floor, bringing  the member to the floor.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The very latest straight ahead this morning.  Meanwhile, markets rallying today ahead of  jobs report.  Check out this market, we're off of the highs of the morning, nonetheless double-digit move.   Dow Industrial is expected to be up about 60 points, NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500, also higher.  NASDAQ up  about 14 points, anticipating a very strong jobs number for the month of February.  We're checking wages,  we are checking the participation rate as well in 30 minutes' time.</p><p>In Europe, the markets are looking like this, also gains across the board, you got the major averages there  up between half and two-thirds of one percent.  In Asia overnight, markets are mostly higher with the  exception of China, take a look, Nikkei average in japan up 1 1/2 percent.  Hang Seng, up a quarter of a  percent.</p><p>In Hong Kong, watching the price of oil, all of a sudden markets once again focused on the oil market.   Crude prices are recovering a bit this morning.  A little stabilization here after closing at lowest level  since November yesterday, oil $49.64 a barrel.  Pope Francis signalling another possibly change to the  church.  Why he said he may allow married men to join clergy.  </p><p>Plus, remembering the rapper Notorious B.I.G., one congressman using the house floor for a tribute to  Big.  We will show you the results coming up.  And Game of Thrones are dealing the premier of its next  season but the announcement had fans going crazier than the mad king.  All those stories coming up this  morning.  And joining to talk all about it, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, Barron's Interim  Editor Jack Otter, and the editor online, New York Times best-selling author Peter Kiernan.  Great to see  you.</p><p>KIERNAN:  Great to see you too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations.  Got a promotion.</p><p>JACK OTTER, BARRON'S INTERIM EDITOR:  I appreciate.  Thanks very much, Maria.  We have to  make Barron's even better.  </p><p>MARQUEZ:  Yes.  We're going to keep watching that and we will show you the cover of Barron's coming  up in the hour.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  But first, jobs -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jobs, jobs, jobs.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's our number one priority and we are looking at it, we got the numbers coming  out in 30 minutes, so stay with us on that.  Meanwhile, Capitol Hill this morning is buzzing as well.   Republicans are moving forward with the replacement of Obamacare, despite mounting skepticism for the  bill.  Blake Burman live at White House right now with very latest.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Maria.  Good morning to you.  And a senior administration official is telling Fox this morning that this is  President Trump in his element at the moment.  We are told that the president is currently in deal making  mode as it relates to the American healthcare act, that senior administration official saying the president  is listening to the numbers, all of the numbers here weighing all of his options.</p><p>They remain very confident here at the White House that this thing will eventually get passed.  Take a  listen to the Vice President Mike Pence.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are very confident because of  President Trump's leadership and support here in the congress.  I'm very confident we'll repeal and  replace Obamacare and that will all be done by this spring.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  The sales pitch though is very much under way, for example, Paul Ryan yesterday, the house  speaker was up on the Hill, literally with his jacket off, his shirt rolled up as he gave a PowerPoint  presentation, trying to pitch this plan one in which he describes a binary choice essentially take it or leave  it repeal and replace Obamacare going forward.  However, there are many conservative skeptics here, one  of them being Rand Paul who rejected that binary choice label and said last night that the bill as it stands  is currently dead on arrival.  </p><p>RAND PAUL, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY:  The speaker needs to like  bring people into the room, conservatives and hear what we want, we are withholding our vote.  This is a  message for the speaker, we are withholding our vote, we want a seat at the table and it's not a binary  choice.</p><p>BURMAN:  Back in what that senior administration official is telling Fox this morning, Maria, we are  told Mick Mulvaney, the head of OMB is working 20-hour days at this point listening to the opposition,  taking in ideas trying to make that work and -- this work and as a senior administration official says,  nothing is locked in stone at this morning, that person tells us that everyone will get either something they  love, but there will be things that they love and things that they love less.  That is how it was phrased to  us, Maria.  Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The got to get onboard together with the things that they love and hopefully come out  with a bill that they're all behind and the budget of course going to be release next week, Mick Mulvaney  working on that and that's on Wednesday.  Blake, good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>BURMAN:  Bye. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great reporting as always from Blake Burman at the White House.  Well, first  Obamacare, then tax reform, senator majority leader Mitch McConnell now suggesting that the White  House is August decline for reform may be unrealistic.  The Trump administration still sticking to the  timeline.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MITCH MCCONNELL, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY:  I think finishing  on tax reform will take longer.</p><p>SPICER:  The president's uniquely qualified as a businessman, a successful businessman to understand  the -- what a good business climate does to job creation.  For him this is deeply personal and I think that  you're going to see Secretary Mnuchin and others work on the contours of that in the next several weeks  but we intend to maintain to the schedule that he laid out.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, Senior Strategist BGC Partners, Fox News About Contributor Steve  Cortes.  I don't know, Steve.  Good morning to you.  I don't -- </p><p>STEVE CORTES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm feeling like the administration and now Mitch McConnell are trying to manage  expectations.  Take the expectations down in terms of tax reform, this market up 14 percent since Election  Day, if we don't see tax reform by august, what happens? </p><p>CORTES:  If we don't see it by august, I think we're going to see a serious correction not just in the  market but in the real economy and that's why it just simply can't happen and I don't want to hear  naysaying from somebody like Mitch McConnell, you know, you were just talking about NFL free agency,  well, the American voter, gave the republicans the ball on the one-yard line first and goal by giving us  both houses of congress and the Oval Office and they are demanding as they should, they're demanding  outcomes that they voted for, including a repeal and replace and including tax reform.</p><p>So I believe the president is going to be successful, our deal maker in chief, he is really on a charm  offensive, he's having lunches and dinners and bowling, he's the charmer in chief lately too, he's going to  twist arms, he's going to persuade people, we're going to get this done on the White House this timeline  and we have to for the people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we'll see it, Dagen, I mean, he's going to through to sell that Obamacare plan  this weekend, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Or whatever you want to call it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In Kentucky.  You're going to Kentucky.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Exactly.  Where -- by the way, you won six more counties than Rand Paul who's  opposed to GOP plan coming out of the house.  But Steve, I want to bring this, it's not a complete repeal  which is what some conservatives have a problem with.  That it still requires government handouts for  people to buy insurance whether you -- so they're not called subsidies, they're called tax credits but  refundable tax credits, that it's still -- you've got all the senators and governors who accepted this giant  Medicaid expansion, fussing about that going away in 2020 and the conservatives want it gone even  sooner than that.  So how do you bring those two sides together? </p><p>CORTES:  Right.  No.  And Dagen, look, you make great points, I tend to lean pretty libertarian, so this is  an imperfect bill to be sure but I don't think we should make the perfect the enemy of the good.  And what  we are trying do -- what the administration is trying to do here I think is satisfy both house conservatives  among republicans and then senate liberals among republicans, and so to thread that needle is incredibly  difficult but I think this bill does and by the way, one thing I will push back at, a tax credit is not a  subsidy.  When you pay money to the government and get some it back, that is not a subsidy.  It is for  people who don't pay taxes.  But it is --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If it's refundable and in this bill, it's refundable, now a small percentage of people will get  it but when you don't pay taxes and you get money back through a tax credit, that's a handout, that's a  subsidy.</p><p>CORTES:  Right.  For those people but for most of us who pay taxes, it's not a subsidy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to leave there but I know you're sticking with us for our Jobs in  America Special this hour, Steve.  Thank you.  Stay right there.  </p><p>CORTES:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still ahead.  Could we see soon see a seismic shift for Catholics, why Pope Francis says  the church may no longer be married to one longstanding tradition.  </p><p>Then we are less than 20 minutes away from the first full jobs report for the month of Trump's presidency.   We're breaking down what you need to know about jobs, markets off of the highs right now going into the  number.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Pope Francis signaling that he is open to married men becoming priests.   Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  So this big news in the catholic  community, Maria.  In an interview with German newspaper, Pope Francis says the church must study  whether it's possible ordain married men to become catholic priests as the church is facing a shortage of  them in remote communities.  The pope says the option would allow men who are already married to be  ordained but single men who already are priests would not be allowed to marry after the fact.  We will  keep you posted.</p><p>And other headlines this morning.  Hip hop has made it to the house of representatives.  Brooklyn  Congressman Hakeem Jeffries paid tribute to the late rapper Biggie Smalls also known, I was just told as  Notorious B.I.G.  because the whole crew has been on me about this.  He was killed 20 years ago  yesterday, well, Jeffries recited the lyrics to the 1994 song Juicy, listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAKEEM JEFFRIES, UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE FOR NEW YORK:  It was all a dream, I  used to read Word Up! Magazine, salt-n-pepa and heavy D up in the limousine, hanging pictures on my  wall, every Saturday rap attack, Mr.  Magic, Marley Marl.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, Biggie Smalls rose in streets of New York to be one of the successful rap  artist in history.  He was killed in drive-by shooting in Los Angeles back in 1997.  And finally, for your  Game of Thrones fans, we now know that season seven of the hit series is going to start on July 16.  Mark  your calendars, HBO making the announcement during a 15-minute long segment on Facebook live.  And  a very cool twist of marketing guys, the news was hidden in a giant block of ice and then viewers had to  comment fire to melt the ice.  Games of Thrones also releasing an official teaser that included \"from past  seasons.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>EMILIA CLARKE, DAENERYS TARGARYEN IN THE HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES:  I know  what my father was, what he did.  I know the Mad King earned his name</p><p>DAVID RINTOUL, KING AERYS II TARGARYEN IN THE HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES:   Burn them all.  </p><p>MARK ADDY, ROBERT BARATHEON IN THE HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES:  Kill ever  Targaryen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  And for all the drama, the video actually had a few stops and starts of the ice gimmick by the  way, it lasted longer than an average episode of Game of Thrones which we hear, Maria.  Pretty long.   Anyway, people are obsessed with the show.  I'm very excited about this whole thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everybody really is, you're right.  Cheryl, thank you.  Up next, the February Jobs report  moments away.  What you need to know ahead of the release.  What it will mean for markets and your  opportunities.  Stay with us.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are just under 10 minutes away from February Jobs report.  Here is  what we're expecting.  Economists are looking for 190,000 jobs added to economy in the last month in  February with the unemployment rate ticking down to 4.7 percent.  We want to bring in our all-stars right  now, the founder of capitalistpig.com, Jonathan Hoenig is with us, the host of Making Money With  Charles Payne, Charles Payne with us, and, of course, Steve Cortes is also with us along with our great  panel here, Charles good to see you.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, MAKING MONEY WITH CHARLES PAYNE HOST:  You too.  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good job, Charles.  You want to do any rapping before we start?</p><p>PAYNE:  I think I get it out of my system.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He was rapping, he just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give us one.  </p><p>PAYNE:  We got to do it?  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Go.</p><p>PAYNE:  It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! Magazine, salt-n-pepa and heavy D up in the  limousine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Thank you for that.  Now --</p><p>PAYNE:  No, really.  That was -- that was a very uplifting song.  The guy was really happy that he made  it out of the hood and he took his friends with him.  That's a beautiful thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Awesome.  Tell us about jobs now, Charles.  </p><p>PAYNE:  I think a lot of people going to make it out of the hood in February according to jobs report -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think it's going to be a blowout?</p><p>PAYNE:  Let me tell you guys.  I think we under reported that ADP report and I know that ADP is not  BLS, Bureau of Labor Statistics but the goods producing part of that, the headline hogged everything,  298,000, that wasn't the story.  106 goods producing jobs is the highest number ever for ADP report going  back to 2002.  That's the highest they've ever seen.  66,000 constructing jobs, over 8,000 money jobs,  money jobs pay $28 an hour, these are good paying jobs and by the way, this is the epicenter of the  financial crisis, the great recession, hit these people harder than anything else.  How did Donald Trump  win Pennsylvania, how did he win Wisconsin?  Was these folks didn't have a job, it felt like everyone  ignored their pleas and now a lot of them are getting jobs now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  So money is finally breaking out.</p><p>PAYNE:  Money had a good number.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's one area we're going to watch with this -- with this jobs report.  Let me quickly get  your take on snap because it went public over a week ago, it was obviously a rocky debut although going  into it, it was priced 17, Peter, it opened to 24.  You said sell it when?  </p><p>KIERNAN:  I sold it 25 on air on Fox Business News.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nice.  Sweet.</p><p>KIERNAN:  The reason was if you look at 8 of the last 10 big tech IPOs, they all in one year traded below  the IPO price.  So people are watching, do not chase these deals, do not, they will always --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can I sell it here if I own it at 22.71?</p><p>KIERNAN:  You know, I'm not in love with this company right now, I think it is priced at about 35  billion market cap, something like that, 30 billion.</p><p>PAYNE:  Just to piggyback on that, the top 20 if you go back in the last several years, peak at 38 days on  average and then go down for four months straight.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>PAYNE:  That's the stat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So that was the trend?</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jack Otter, Barron's called it, you said to sell it, you told leaders.  </p><p>OTTER:  Barron's was negative on it, I mean, it was 93 times sales.  Even if this year optimistic sales  reach a billion dollars, that's still 34 times sales, it's just you the too expensive.  And I always hate to bet  against the technology company that's young, that's exciting, 158 million excited users including my 13- year-old daughter who loves it, but you got to wonder if Snap can really go in direction of Facebook which  has such huge broad base, Twitter might be a better comparison, you know, we all use Twitter but didn't  catch on the way that some other social media companies do and we're coming out with a story tomorrow  where we say maybe GoPro is actually the better example and that is not been a good stock.  I actually left  my GoPro.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're comparing -- you're comparing Snap to GoPro.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's check out cover of Barron's.  Let's reveal.  Give us big reveal for the cover this  weekend because you got a story in the ETFs.</p><p>OTTER:  Yes.  We got some of the smartest people in ETFland.  In fact, three of those people control 80  percent of the assets on the management in the ETFland, so we're asking them what's next?  It's a very  interesting financial device.  I mean, it gets kind of geek, so, Dagen will love it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was the first financial reporter to cover ETF 20 years ago.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  It's been 20 years, huh?  </p><p>OTTER:  Nearly 20 years old.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Exactly.  </p><p>OTTER:  But for instance -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was our first words.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>OTTER:  In a big day in the market, people are buying ETFs all day.  Well, toward the end -- towards  4:00 then the market needs to start adjusting for all those buys, so people start loading, they have to -- they  have to rebalance, so they start loading up on stocks on a bad day it goes the other way.  So it really  changes the dynamics of the market and that's going to be a story going forward.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jump in here.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes.  I think ETFs are going to be worth watching because in market interruptions, they do  not perform -- excuse me, anywhere like stocks because there isn't sort of dynamic market making  underneath.  And I think this is one is the -- I think Achilles heels of the ETF.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The big story Barron's this weekend that we'll be watching.  We got the February Jobs  report right after break.  We're not going to miss it, we got all details next.  Back in a moment.  Stay with  us, markets rallying going into that jobs report.</p><p>JONATHAN NOVACK , TENNIS CHANNEL'S COURT REPORT HOST:  Hey guys.  Tennis Channel  Jonathan Novack with another special court report for Fox Business.  The temperatures hit the 80s in  Coachella Valley on day two of the 2017 BNP Paribas Open.  And Thursday I saw one young American  move on to second round for th3e biggest win of his career so far.  </p><p>Bjorn Fratangelo is a former junior champion at Roland Garros, and he's 23-year-old showed his class as  he dispatched Bernard Tomic in straight sets.

I'm Jonathan  Novack.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday everybody.  Thank you so much joining us.  It is Friday,  March 10th.  Breaking news, we are moments away from February Jobs report, here is what we are  looking for.  Economists looking for 190,000 jobs to have been added to the economy in the month of  February.  The unemployment rate expected to tick down to 4.7 percent.  Markets are rallying going into  the report, it's just two minutes away.  Take a look where markets are, now at highs of the morning, up 76  points on the Dow Jones Industrial average.  Jonathan Hoenig is with us this morning.  Give us your  thoughts ahead of this number.  We all spoke with the panel already and people are looking for a very  strong number.  What about you? </p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOUNDER OF CAPITALISTPIG.COM:  Yes.  I think you'll see a beat, Maria,  you saw in the ADP number yesterday but ironically a beat for jobs will be a bad thing for the economy,  you know, jobs come less, we talked for eight years about where are jobs, the jobs are finally here, I think  you see --- buy rumor, sell the fact and a good jobs number actually precipitates a decline and a correction  for stocks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know about that, Dagen.  Yesterday you made such an important point because  you said, look if we get a good jobs number, that's a vote of confidence, things are getting better.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  And watch the government jobs because remember Donald Trump when he  became president froze federal hiring in late January, this is the first time that's going to show up in this  report.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  They'll be down.  They've been down but I always still disagree with Jonathan in the sense  that, you know, let's get it going, you know, 300, 400, 500,000 jobs, you know, I think good is a relative  term these days and a stronger than expected number is still not kind of good jobs number I think that will  be counterintuitive to the market or the economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I used to do this a minute before number but you put a three handle on it.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KIERNAN:  I think we're going to have a good show and I don't it's going to take the market down.  I  really think that what we're beginning to see is a second leg, we have the Trump rally and now we have  the proof in the pudding part of the rally and if we get good jobs, I think we're going to see the market  continue to grow here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Guys, we're all talking about jobs, what about wages, OK?  Steve Cortes, do you think  we're going to see any movement up 2.8 percent?  It's what people are looking for year over year wages.  </p><p>CORTES:  I do.  Maria, wages are finally moving.  I gave up pessimism for lent, so I'm going to tell you  that we're going to have a blowout number.  I think 300 is possible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You do, so you are with Peter as well -- as well say that.  And then there's the  participation rate guys, real quick.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was up 2/10 of a percent, in January at 52.9, let's hope it goes up.  </p><p>CORTES:  Indeed.  I want to see wages go up because if we get enough -- people hired eventually they're  going to have to start paying them more unless participation -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  The number is on top.  It's going to be out in a moment.  Let's get to Peter  Barnes, he's at the Labor Department right now with the news.  Peter Barnes, over to you.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:   235,000 new non-foreign payroll jobs in February, Maria.  235,000 new payroll jobs last month.  The first  full month of the Trump administration and above analysts' expectations.  The unemployment rate ticking  down to 4.7 percent from 4.8, as more than 300,000 people returned to the labor force last month.  And  that sent the labor force participation rate, up to 63 percent, the highest level in a year.  Hourly wages rose  by 0.2 percent last month, to $26.09 an hour.  Year over year, wages are up 2.8 percent.</p><p>Construction had a great month last month, up 58,000 jobs, the biggest monthly increase since March  2007.  But likely due in part to the warm weather we've been having around the country, manufacturing  jumped 28,000 jobs.  But retail down, 26,000, likely post-holiday cuts.  Education and health, up 62,000.   Business and professional services, plus 27.  Leisure and hospitality, plus 26.  And government, added  8,000 jobs mostly at the local level.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Peter, thank you.  We're seeing the markets react positively.  It is better than  expected, but we - is it fair to say it was better than expected but that was expected?  Peter, what do you  think?  </p><p>PETER KIERNAN, GOLDMAN SACHS FORMER PARTNER:  I think it was one of those in line, I  think where you're going to see nice fallout is.  This really clears any underbrush away from a rate hike  next week, that's going to happen.  And when that happens, I think you're going to see a very nice move  in the financials.  They've moved very nicely so far, but this - if particularly, if the fed wants to do four  rate hikes this year, which they could potentially do.  That could put billions of dollars of earnings into  banks.  </p><p>JACK OTTER, BARRONS.COM EDITOR:  We all groan when the number came out because we were  really expecting them to over deliver -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I didn't.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I did not groan. </p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  You said 2:30?  You won the bed,  by the way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you did. </p><p>OTTER:  Good solid number, it's only bad if you are judging by ADP.  And you think, oh my gosh!  We're  going to have some incredible - but this is a solid number and, you know, I know Charles wants to see as  4, 500.  But we are albeit a very slow, this point of recovery, we are eight years into recovery.  So -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE:  That's the number that I think would - that will prove Jonathan's theory.  In other words, 235  beats the estimates but this is not the kind of counterintuitive number that would point to some kind of,  end of the - you know, the business cycle, traditionally has been blown out of whack.  This is, you know,  from all of different things that have done it's not what it used to be.  You can go ahead, Jonathan.  </p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALIST PIG HEDGE FUND FOUNDING MEMBER:  Well, in terms of  number, it's outstanding.  I'm happy to see that as you said, it's been a long time coming upwards of eight  years.  And the fact that this has gone under Donald Trump's first month in office, is also a bull shine.   But look at the underpinnings of the market, more new lows, than new highs yesterday.  And bonds just  across the board, you can then take it out to woodshed.  I think despite the fact the numbers are good,  some of the dynamic underpinnings of the stocks themselves give reason - one reason for some worry at  this point.  </p><p>OTTER:  Yes, I would add to that, Jonathan, the - I mean, excuse me, the small-cap stocks rise into  thousand and is down about 3.8 percent, copper is down.  So, not everything is bullish out there.  I mean,  as we all look at the recent performance of the S&amp;P 500 which has been great.  But there are a few signs,  that maybe we're getting a little too blurb.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about mining, Charles?  Do we know, in terms of - </p><p>PAYNE:  I didn't see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I didn't hear Peter discussed mining.  </p><p>PAYNE:  We've got construction and manufacturing but, those are two numbers though that were almost  identical to ADP, right.  66,000 ADP, 58,000 construction.  Yes, I know it was warmer, but we've had  warm patches over the last several years that haven't created this kind of construction.  And we need them  for a couple reasons, think about dearth of homes - the man is out there.  Month supply is at so - it's such  a low point.  If we get that going again - they're all connected.  I think this is a phenomenal number.  I  love the idea that 300,000 people came back to the workforce.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He thanked you.  Thank you.  Can get a halleluiah?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Participation is the most important thing.  The unemployment rate fell, despite the fact  that 300,000 people started looking for work.  That means that they found work.  That they came back.  A  highest labor participation rate in a year.</p><p>PAYNE:  And we need people to believe.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because that's, that's the optimistic sign.  Can go out there and get a job?  Yes, you can.   Amen.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Well, one of the things that's also happening is we're a long away from the peak labor  participation rate of 67 percent.  But were trending upward, and that is a very important number.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  63 percent participation rate.  Steve Cortes, go ahead.  </p><p>STEVE CORTES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  And Maria, listen, I think that is by far the most  important news this morning - this participation rate.  And I'm so glad that they're also connected to  construction and mining.  Those are businesses which tends to be dominating - the workers are mostly  male.  If you look at workforce participation, it's been trending down for everybody which is a terrible  thing for men, under the Obama administration it hit a recorded low.  </p><p>So, that is great news, that construction and mining are coming back, to life.  It's huge for men, it's huge  for our economy.  So, to get the participation rate up, and still keep jobless rate down, that is just a  massive win for the economy.  So, I know we have some naysayers on the panel, I think the stock market's  going to go manically higher.  I think growth going to accelerate in a really material way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Charles, look at these wages numbers, the brisk clip of hiring was accompanied by  steady wage growth.  Hourly earnings rising six cents, that's 2/10th of a percent.  You want more,  obviously, but it's in the right direction.  2.8 percent, year over year.</p><p>PAYNE:  It's in the right direction.  And also, the skills aspect of this, you know, earlier in the week  LinkedIn did their workforce report.  And they talked about the skills gap, and we talk about it always  associated with technology.  But oil-well drillers and people who can, you know, work on construction  projects.  When we started to get all of those things filled in, but what do you need?  I think these numbers  will even take off even more than they have already.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  I like to pick up on that point, because there are a lot of people who are focused on the retail  piece of equation, and there are a lot of jobs that are being lost in retail.  JC Penney, alone says they're  going to lay off 5500 people, but there's a balance to that.  And that is, that people like Amazon are  saying, this year we're going to create 100,000 new jobs.  So, what happens is, yes, so as retail jobs are  disappearing, but they're showing up somewhere else in the economic pile.  And that's good news.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, how about construction?  Jonathan Hoenig, go ahead.  Jump in, Jonathan. </p><p>HOENIG:  It's - it's buy the rumor, and sell fact.  You know, for eight years, people say, well the stock  market's going up but I don't know, we don't have jobs yet.  We don't have jobs yet.  Look, now we've got  jobs job.  The job numbers great.  I'm applauding that.  I'm just wondering if perhaps now the market has  gotten a little bit ahead of itself in that sense.  Our guest mentioned the - some of the retailers are getting  just absolutely taken to woodshed.  Real estate, that's related to the retailers are getting killed right now,  leverage loans, convertible bonds.  So, I'm not saying don't be enthusiastic about this great number,  remember to moment take a moment and think.  Is the good news now already out?  Is this a good  number, with the markets were anticipating 4.3 percent ago, on the Dow?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  See, I think it's all about - I think it's all about policy out of Washington.  Dagen, there's a  bit under this market come on, until they blow it on tax reform.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely, and I'll point out with wages - with wages growing at 2.8 percent.  That's  solid.  But it's not enough to really start worrying about inflation picking up.  That keeps the fed at bay  potentially - when you talk about four interest rate hikes?  Maybe, it is two.  But again, that is the kind of  not too hot, not to cold.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Goldilocks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just right wage number.</p><p>OTTER:  One important point that you're - you have to use the word inflation, but as what you're referring  to.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I said it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you just said it. </p><p>OTTER:  So, I think that's very important.  We used to think that inflation is bad thing, but you're right,  inflation is a good thing.  And around the world, you're actually seeing a little bit of less concern about  deflation.  So, we're talking about draggy earlier, getting a teeny bit hawkish.  I mean, it's still very loose  over there, but he's saying, OK, maybe the deflation is not as big a worry as we thought.  And globally,  that's what we need.  </p><p>PAYNE:  It's so funny now, because for a long-time inflation was a four-letter word, right?  I also tell  people, well, are you happy when your paycheck is inflated?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, maybe.</p><p>PAYNE:  If the value of the house inflated?  You know, we want some inflation, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out, because we're watching the Futures.  The Dow would need to  gains 147 1/2 points today, to be in positive territory.  Because right now, it's going to snap a four-week  winning streak.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, you were talking about the sell-off and face small cap stocks in the last week? </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  The rest is down six sessions in a row, the last time it was up was the day after President  Trump's speech, which kind of tells, you know.  I think that group, though, is much more sensitive to  President Trump, and the nuances of President Trump because it's a lot of American centric businesses,  that will do very we'll.  And it's almost a barometer actually, of the presidency to a degree.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  And one of the things you and I debated and discussed over the years is, what happens to the  high dividend paying risk free or risk less stocks in this market?  They've - initially, we're not doing very  well, now people are starting to drift back in the utilities.  To me, that follows like the bottom mark of it,  people are a little unsure where're the market's going now.  I feel like this is a pause - </p><p>PAYNE:  Some of that comes back to what Maria just said with the - with respect to taxes.  And I think  also - let's face it, a lot of people frustrated on investment world that Obamacare had to come before  anything else, thinking that some of these other things could have been done pretty easily.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're pulling it back in reforming it, repealing it, whatever you want to call it.  It is a tax  cut.  It's a tax cut on investors.  </p><p>PAYNE:  It's a $600 billion tax cut.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a big tax cut.</p><p>PAYNE:  But it's not the kind of tax cut though, that's going to get a company to invest in a new building  project or get the average person watching this show to go out and spend more money, or even start to  leverage credit.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the whole border adjustment tax was like a buzz kill.  I mean, we didn't hear  anything about the border adjustment tax during the campaign.  And all of the sudden, now we're talking  about raising revenue while cutting taxes.  Just cut the taxes.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  I hope that fades away.  </p><p>HOENIG:  There's going to be tremendous surprises, Maria.  Just look at something like oil, which is  expected to be a major beneficiary, of course, of the Trump administration.  Oil stocks are almost at 52- week lows across the board.  Ironically, it's the green energy stocks that are starting to outperform.  This is  going to be - is this going to end up not as otherwise would imagine?  The market's going to surprise us, I  think even in the face of these excellent job numbers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you mean?  So, you think - you're expecting a sell-off in stocks?  You'd be  selling into this rally, today? </p><p>HOENIG:  I think you have to be very hesitant buying, Maria, once the good news is out.  Again, buy the  rumor, sell the fact - the time to buy stocks I think is when job numbers weren't terrible.  And people  saying, I'm not going to buy until the - we're starting to get these numbers now.  And the fact that stocks  are now starting to do poorly, again, more new 52-week lows and highs, just tells me that the internals are  weak.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, Steve Cortes, you on the other side of that trade?  </p><p>CORTES:  I sure am, Maria.  And you know, listen, I think you're right that the biggest risk is  Washington, D.C., out there, if Washington doesn't deliver.  But I guess I would say this, you know, as  somebody who campaigned very hard for then candidate Trump, and now President Trump, I believe  staking his presidency on this legislative agenda on repeal the replace, and more importantly, on tax  reform.  And because of that, I think he's going to press members of Congress like you can't believe, and  they do not want to go back to their districts - in Republican districts and Republican leaning states, where  President Trump is incredibly popular.  They don't want to go back and face voters and explain, why they  were the obstacle to this agenda that they voted for?  So, it's not going to happen -  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, why did Mitch McConnell say what he said?  I mean, Mitch McConnell, you  know.  </p><p>CORTES:  You know, both of these Kentucky Senators are really annoying me lately, they're both  naysayers.  By the way, Mitch McConnell, has often been, I would say, unhelpful at times to the President.   But even he, I think will have to toe the line eventually - again, he and Rand Paul, I don't think want to go  back to Kentucky whenever they're up for reelection, and explain why they impeded President Trump and  the will of the American people, by the way.  So, we're going to get - it's going to be ugly the headlines,  there's a lot of consternation back-and-forth.  I think it is why the market's pausing, right now, I really do.   It's unrest, and uncertainty about Washington, but once we do get these - </p><p>PAYNE:  Let me just say one thing of that, Steve.  What if they go back to these voters a few years from  now?  And they say, why did you guys pass Obamacare 2.0?  Nothing changed for me, from what you  guys promised.  I don't know if they want to face that as well, that's the other side of their political risk  here, for them.  </p><p>CORTES:  Sure, but plenty is changing is changing this bill.  I mean, it's not fair, I think, to call it 2.0.   But I also think more importantly, this is the step to the even bigger reform, which is tax reform.  And  once we get tax reform and this economy starts really growing again.  Then they won't have to explain  anything to their voters, they'll just be high fiving them and accepting their support. </p><p>KIERNAN:  One of the areas where Mitch McConnell was right though, is that tax reform is hard.  It's  easy to underestimate the complexity of the task, and I do think an August deadline is ambitious.  I  thought it was ambitious when Trump said it as President, I thought it was ambitious when the Treasury  Secretary said it.  And what we don't see a lot of on Senate, particularly, is multitasking.  And we're  asking to do two things, simultaneously, that are big complicated, vexing, and have to be sold back home  as well.  </p><p>OTTER:  You know, a lot of people were critical of Obama, not just for Obamacare, but for the fact that  he put that first.  And they said, we got a serious - we're coming out of a pretty big recession here, let's  worry about that and then do health care.  And we could see that same criticism of Republicans now.  I  know they say, in order to do the tax bill, we need fix Obamacare first.  But, you know, I kind of wish  they've gone straight to Obamacare, because you're right, it is incredibly complicated.  How long did it  take Reagan?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's mean taxes.</p><p>OTTER:  It's mean taxes.  How long did take to get the Reagan - </p><p>PAYNE:  But you could get lower rates quicker than you could get a full-fledged - </p><p>OTTER:  And I'd love to see growth.  That's the good Trump, and market wants that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you're going to spend your political capital?  Give the American people their capital  back.  Let them keep more if their income.  Do it immediately, and make it retroactive to January 1.  Do  you know how much - people would have backed off, and be like, OK, now you can deal with reforming  Obamacare.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm perfectly happy.  I'm going to go buy a new ATV.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  And you to prove to people that you're a good guy, that you can get things done, that you can  make your deals - and by the way, everyone is going home saying, I brought you home tax reform.  And  with that, winning can take on the tough stuff.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But instead they work GOP, and the House.</p><p>CORTES:  Let's do it then!  It's all talk, let's do it!</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Guys, does anybody -</p><p>CORTES:  They keep talking about tax cut, let's do it Donald Trump.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've been saying that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have been.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've been saying that, instead we got the border adjustment tax shoved in there. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some tax to raise a trillion dollars over 10 years.  Does anybody want to touch on retail  here, Charles?  Down 26,000 jobs in retail.  That's one of the few areas where we actually showed job cuts.   We got strength in construction up 50,000, strength leisure hospitality, strength in manufacturing,  strength in government.</p><p>PAYNE:  It's the long - everyone just talked about the death of brick and mortar, you know.  And as I  already mentioned here, it's been off-set to a degree by Amazon.  But even these retailers doing well,  children's place this week, one of the biggest winners in the market - two days ago, was up 20 percent in  one day.  They're doing well because of last two years, they've closed 142 non-performing stores.  So, even  if these stores that are doing well, relatively speaking, are closing stores, are firing people, so, you know,  that's just something that's not going to exist. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Some of this could be seasonal adjustment from the Labor Department, though. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In retail?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  In the post-holiday months.  That, it could be some of that.  You could see some  give back in the next month's jobs' report. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a pretty steep decline.</p><p>KIERNAN:  And Texas had a very tough month last month on their oil patch.  And so, there are punch on  these things that I think are little moments in the sun, where I we can see them come back.  And I think  jobs are going to continue to grow throughout the rest of the year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Hot morning here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, we're going to talk a short  break.  More on the February jobs report, after this short break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, the February jobs report just out.  As we've been reporting, the economy  created 235,000 jobs, in the month of February, beating economists' expectations.  The unemployment rate  ticked down slightly to 4.7 percent.  Also expected, the labor force participation rate; this was highlight  came in at 63 percent.  That was better than expected.  I want to bring in the host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\", Stuart Varney now, joining us with his thoughts.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK VARNEY &amp; COMPANY HOST:  Good morning,  Maria.  I will say this.  I think it was a solid report; not spectacular, not a blowout, but I think it marks  what I'm going to call the beginning of the Trump expansion.  Call me crazy but I think that's where it's  at.  Now, you're going to get folks on the left who say this was a solid jobs' report result of President  Obama's policy or Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve.  That's nonsense.  </p><p>The change in the mood of the country towards more optimism, towards more growth, towards more  confidence, that started November the 8th with the election.  So, I'm calling this the beginnings of the  Trump expansion.  58,000 new construction jobs, what was it?  28,000 manufacturing, those are good  well paid-jobs.  And I think they're' going to expand that front in the future.  That's where I'm coming  from. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  Wait till we get an infrastructure program, right?  I mean, those construction jobs are  going to benefit even more. </p><p>VARNEY:  Absolutely.  And that infrastructure program will come. I think it's got bi-partisan support,  not sure how you pay for it.  But it's got bipartisan support.  Something on that front is going to get done  this year.  That is very good news for those high paid construction jobs and manufacturing, too, positive.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Sir, what do you think about your  buddy though, Elon Musk?  He might get a bit chunk of that infrastructure for the hyper loop.</p><p>VARNEY:  My buddy, Elon Musk.  Well, said with tongue-in-cheek there, Charles?  I do declare.  I'm not  wild about companies that live on government subsidies especially green subsidies.  But look, if this guy  can come up with a way of making a battery that stores enormous amounts of electricity, then you are on  to a winner.  That's my story. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me just point something out.  All the people who drive Teslas don't pay for our  infrastructure now because they don't pay any gas taxes.  They're plugging in and refuelling that way, and  so they're basically getting a free ride on the back of all the other taxpayers in this country.  So that -- it  shocks me a little bit too. </p><p>VARNEY:  It's -- you are pointing the finger towards real outrage here.  I think Tesla should be banned.   OK, I'm joking.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>VARNEY:  Just warming it up. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  Well, you know, what do you think about retail?  Retail was down 26,000.  Does that  matter or do you think that's just a fluke because of the holidays. </p><p>VARNEY:  Oh no.  I think that, that really reinforces our story.  We keep talking about the retail ice age.   They're having a very hard time.  The bricks-and-mortar people meeting the challenge of online selling  and this down , 26,000 -- 26,000 retail jobs, that's a big deal. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  That tells the story.  I wouldn't want to be a mall operator right now.  I wouldn't want to be  buying real estate in a shopping mall in this day and age.  I think they got a real problem here. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  Yes, that's a good point.  It's really online that's winning here.  Hey Stu, are you tired of  winning it?</p><p>VARNEY:  You mean in the ratings?  I'll never get tired of winning.</p><p>BARTIMORO:  You'll never get tired of that.  Now that we have Donald Trump, you're going to get so  sick of winning.  We're winning, right.  OK.  Stu, we'll see you in about -- </p><p>VARNEY:  We'll you give an opportunity, Maria.  I thought I'd grab it with both hands.</p><p>BARTIMORO:  Yes, I love it.  That was a lob.  That's what they call a lob, Stu.  Congratulations to you  and Fox Business Network.  We got the All-Stars right here.  </p><p>PAYNE:  There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations everybody .</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes, thank you, you too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For beating the competition.  Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  Join \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" top of the hour.  Steve, final thoughts from you and Jonathan.  Your take on today's number,  final word. </p><p>CORTES:  You know, final thoughts, Maria.  Between Fox Business and the ratings and Trump and the  White House, and the stock market, I'm not tired of winning yet but we might get there soon.  I think this  is a fantastic report.  I really do, particularly the participation.  Too many people had given up on  America, had given up on life really, in a lot of ways.  Not to be too philosophical but we need them back  in the workforce and they're coming back and that's great news. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  Jonathan Hoenig.</p><p>HOENIG:  There's an unlimited amount of wealth and jobs that can be created, Maria.  It's freedom that's  needed to make that happen.  So long as the government and you're right, Washington, is very much at  the center of Wall Street these days.  As so long as the government can keep this trend going, lower taxes,  lower regulation, more individual and economic freedom, I think 200,000 new jobs is just the start.</p><p>BARTIMORO:  All right we will leave it there.  Steve Cortes, Jonathan Hoenig, good to see you both.   Gentlemen, have a good weekend.  We got the best team in business.  After this short break, right here at  the panel.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIMORO:  Welcome back, final thoughts from our All-Star Panel.  We got markets on fire this  morning on the hills.  It has been better than expected jobs report.  Financials leading the rally at Peter  Kiernan, you called it.</p><p>PETER KIERNAN, ENTREPENEUR:  I have to say financers are incredibly well positioned and what's  going to be exciting to see is whether small businesses really take this opportunity to hire, to expand and  whether the big company starts parting some of that cash and the best thing in the long term.  Property  plan equipment and expanding. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  Yes, I want to get Charles' take on this though.  Because Charles, you know how to make  money in this market.  Would you think it's overvalued at this point? </p><p>PAYNE:  I think there are a lot of individual names that are overvalued.  When you see companies miss,  they're taken out to the woodshed pretty good so that's where your risk is.  And this is by no means a dart  throwing kind of rally.  I think that people need to understand too, a handful of names have been  overwhelmingly responsible for the move, right?  Because of the way the Dow forensics is weighted.  But  you know, we've got to think longer term.  And this motion of occasional dips, you know yesterday, we  talked about the eight-year anniversary of the market.  </p><p>Think about the longest streak ever, right.  It went from '87 to 2000.  Well, guess what?  From '82 to '87,  there was also a rally.  So you can almost argue from '82 to 2000, with a three month blip, could you live  with that?  Hell yes, if you were in the market.  So, it's going to happen.  I think we don't want to get too  fixated on the market occasionally pulling back.  Think longer term. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  Yes.</p><p>JACK OTTER, AMERICAN JOURNALIST:  It's important for investors to understand the good news  does not always mean good start.  The good news was baked in a long time ago, Jonathan Hoenig was  making that point.  And so we have to be careful of buy the rumor and sell the news, and especially if  maybe the market is too optimistic about tax breaks, about deregulation and we get bogged down in  Obamacare or bore taxes. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  What do you mean by good news was baked in?  I mean, you - how many people we're  like Trump's going to win and the markets are going to sell off?  Well, what is baked in?</p><p>OTTER:  Well, because as soon as he was elected, suddenly the market took off.  And we've been - I  watch the market.</p><p>PAYNE:  The $3 trillion in additional market evaluation. </p><p>OTTER:  Yes, yes. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  The anticipation about policy.</p><p>OTTER:  That's what I'm saying. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE:  Materializing so far into reality.  We're seeing sentiment materialize into reality as long as you  have that, that's the ultimate support.</p><p>OTTER:  How long to keep up?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to point out in terms of optimism.  300,000 people re-entered the work force.  The  unemployment rate falls which means that people found work.  The labor participation rate continues to  go up, that is your Trump optimism right there. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  How about wages, Dagen?  I mean, you got wages up 2.8 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, and not hot enough to make people worry about the Federal Reserve. </p><p>KIERNAN:  And I think the central point, in addition, there's room to grow.  We still have a lot of room  to grow to get where we've been before and I think that's great news for this economy. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  And then there's trade this Sunday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES,\" I'm going to  be speaking with Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross.  He is my special guest to talk about trade and how  that fits into all of this.  That's one of the worries out there.  We'll talk with the Wilbur Ross, joining me  on the Fox News Channel.  Thanks, everybody.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have a great weekend.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" right now.  Stuart, take it away</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

It is expected to be a big one,  economist, expecting 190 thousand jobs to have been added to the economy.  Last month, the unemployment rate is expected to tick-down to 4.7 percent.  Of course, we got very strong ADP numbers earlier in the week. So, we're  expecting a good number.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What to watch for coming up? The Gorman debate over healthcare and America,  some senators say the current bill is dead on arrival but Vice President  Pence and House, Ways and Means committee Chairman Kevin Brady, they're  hopeful. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  What's different than  back in 2010 though, Brad, when Obamacare was literally forced through the  Congress with very little debate is what the American people are seeing,  it's really what they expect Congress to do.</p><p>KEVIN BRADY, CHAIRMAN, WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  At the end of the day  here, Lou, we're going to come together to back the president on this and  get it done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got the very latest this morning. Checking market action,  take a look, we're watching oil price. It's been a tough week for oil,  crude rebounding after closing at the lowest level since November,  yesterday. This morning, we're seeing a gain of about one half of 1  percent, still below $50 a barrel. That certainly helping stocks, though,  around the world as the oil price is stabilized. Futures indicating a  pretty good open for the (inaudible) averages today. </p><p>Dow Industrial seem to be up, that's 70 points at the opening of trading.  In Europe, similar story, take a look. Of course, you heard from the ECD  yesterday. The markets are higher across the boards to the tune of one half  of a percent higher on the FT100, two thirds of a percent higher on the CAC  (inaudible) in Paris and the DAX Index in Germany. </p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher. As you see, the Nikkei  average in Japan, best performer of one and a half percent. Political  unrest in South Korea, deadly protests overnight erupting after the  country's president was removed from office, impeachment. </p><p>Then a terrifying moment to report in Ohio, a four year old girl blown away  by extreme winds, amazing pictures here. Look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow. We'll bring you the latest there. Nissan, meanwhile,  making a car for man's best friend. Check this out. The automaker's showing  off a concept car designed with dogs in mind. We like that. All of those  stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about it, Fox  News Network's Dagen McDowell.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Barron's online editor, Jack Otter, is here and New York Times  best-selling author, Peter Kiernan, is with us as well. Good morning to  you. </p><p>PETER KIERNAN, AUTHOR, NEW YORK TIMES BEST-SELLING AUTHOR:  (inaudible)  with you. Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you, happy Friday.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Morning. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly, could be a big number. ADP number was what, 298.</p><p>JACK OTTER, BARRON'S ONLINE EDITOR:  I think it might be huge.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, huge.</p><p>OTTER:  Huge.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The first job report under President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Full report.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we know the expectations are out there but does the  market trade up on a huge number or does the market trade down because the  Fed starts raising interest rates next week.</p><p>OTTER:  Well, I think that the next -- the March interest rate hike is  baked in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>OTTER:  I mean, unless today is just terrible but everyone expects it's  going to be good especially after that ADP number. I think, frankly, I'm  already looking beyond the number. I'm looking the wages, and of course,  the participation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got a big show coming up. We have the jobs number at 8:00  AM Eastern and we will be looking at all of the above there. Joining our  program this morning, a whole line up of experts to tell you where the jobs  are right now. First, our top story republicans are moving forward with the  replacement of Obamacare. The GOP plan cleared hurdles through two house  committees yesterday. Those skepticism for the bill is still mounting.  House Speaker Paul Ryan even gave a PowerPoint presentation to promote the  merits of the bill. That was during his weekly press conference. Vice  President Mike Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senator Rand Paul, all  weighed in on the plane yesterday. Watch.</p><p>PENCE:  Because of President Trump's leadership and support here in the  congress, I'm very confident. We'll repeal and replace Obamacare and it'll  all be done by this spring.</p><p>PAUL RYAN, HOUSE SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is the closest we will  ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare. </p><p>RAND PAUL, SENATOR:  Conservatives hate their bill. I promise you.  Obamacare lied, dead on arrival. They might as well just start over.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, dead on arrival. Joining us right now, former Michigan  congressman and former Intelligence Committee Chairman, Pete Hoekstra.  Congressman, good to see. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>PETE HOEKSTRA, CONGRESSMAN:  Great to be here. Thank you. Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So much debate. I mean, do you think this current house bill  has a chance of passing in the senate? You heard what Rand Paul just said,  dead on arrival.</p><p>HOEKSTRA: Well, this current house bill is now what we will ultimately see  be put into law. This is the normal process of making sausage or some call  it making legislation. The house has its bill. There will be some changes  that will be made to this bill has they -- as the house goes through the  process, the senate will do its work. There'll be reconciliation, the work  with the president. I think the reason for optimism is how engaged the  White House is with the president and Mike Pence, both involve in this  process, making it work. You know, the dialogue will continue. Ultimately,  there will be a repeal and replace bill that makes it to the president's  desk.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So this is all to be expected. Then the back and  forth as we make the sausage or make this legislation. Can we talk about  what is so troubling though because the conservatives are so upset about  this? I mean, they are calling this an expansion of Medicaid. Dagen, let's  go through for our viewers, what is so bad about this plan?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The -- what the conservative don't like and there are a few  things, and the congressman can jump in here. There were 19 states that  resisted the Medicaid expansion. Many of the states and the representatives  who took money to expand Medicaid, they demanded, basically, $100 billion  subsidy fund to stabilize their transition away from -- as they go to block  grants on Medicaid, for lack of a better word. They're also angry that the  Cadillac tax is still in there, although, it's extended out to 2025 and a  lot of these conservatives seem to have gotten religion, if you will, on  these tax credits, they're mad that the tax credits are a subsidy, which  they are. The republicans and that their leadership, they're trying to  level the playing field in terms of the tax treatment of employer  insurance, it's an employer provided insurance and that the individuals  buy. They call it a subsidy but I'll point out the head of this freedom  caucus, Congressman Mark Meadows in North Carolina was a cosponsor of Tom  Price's healthcare bill before Tom Price became Health and Human Services  secretary. That has tax credits in it. So now, he's got religion on it.  That's what I don't understand. There is a lot of pushback. I do you think  -- there will be compromise though as Congressman Hoesktra.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think congressman? I mean, is it mostly this  thought that it's an expansion of Medicare -- Medicaid rather or the  Cadillac tax? Is that what's so troubling from the conservative's point of  view.</p><p>HOEKSTRA:  Well, I think all of the above is accurate. I think the  republicans will get over and they will unite on the tax credit. They'll  recognized that this is actually a leveling of the tax treatment for those  of who get an employer base healthcare plan versus those who have to go buy  it out on the market themselves. I think they will also - yes, they'll  reach a compromise on the Medicaid expansion because, you know, certain  states did it, other did not. So, they will get there. The other thing that  I think that they will want to do is they -- yes, they'll have to get rid  of the Cadillac tax. You know, republicans could not be seen as keeping a  tax that is part of Obamacare in place in moving forward and somewhere in  this thing not as phase three. They're going to have to move phase three  into phase one which is allowing the sale of insurance across state lines.</p><p>BARTIMOMO:  Peter Kiernan? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KIERNAN:  For just a second, I have a question for you because, on one  hand, you have Speaker Ryan saying this is a binary choice, either or and  the other hand, the president is saying let's go bowling and let's make a  deal and somewhere in between that, you have the house and look what  they're doing. They speed through Ways and Means. They speed through Energy  and Commerce. They're on their way to the budget committee. This is  lightning fast. What do you think is going to happen here? Where are these  compromises going to be made?</p><p>HOEKSTRA:  Well, the compromise, that I think are going to be made -- there  will be compromise throughout this process. There will be compromises made  to get to 218 votes in the house. The speaker doesn't have the votes right  now. He will get there. There will be compromises or there will be a senate  agenda that puts out, probably -- maybe, a very significant different bill  and then there'll be a reconciliation pack or there will be a conference  report that will come out as the house and the Senate work out their  differences. This will be all about compromise all the way through. It is  not unusual. Remember, back at '96, we did welfare. I think we passed it  three times before President Clinton actually signed. This is expected.  This should not be easy. It is healthcare. It's a huge change. It -- this  is the normal process.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will add this, that if you had republicans who step back and  cross their arms and essentially stand shoulder to shoulder with the likes  of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi on this, they will regret it. Whether  it's in the midterm elections whether it is four years from now, they will  regret it because if they -- if the republicans do nothing here. It will  speed up or if they just repeal it and then don't have anything to replace  it. It will speed up the already looming collapse of Obamacare and you're  talking about people getting kicked off their insurance, spiraling of --  premium spiraling high -- of the higher.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then they own it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, they will -- the republicans will own it. Particularly the  people who stood back and let it happen.</p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes, they'll be the ones who are dead on arrival. I think -- if  you pull that trick. I think (inaudible)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've got a window. This is the window.</p><p>OTTER:  You know guys, there's one thing. So, there are a lot of thing --  the things that people most hated about Obamacare tended to be the things  that were necessary in order to get more people on healthcare, the penalty  for instance. The idea that, you know, you couldn't charge older people,  frankly, as much as it cost to insure older people. That was a very anti- free market move but what it did was it got more people coverage. How you  do make those tough choices with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, what's the timeline on this? You said, there's  going to be a lot of debate. There's going to be a lot of choices to make  but what's your timeline on that? Do you think we're going to see this  before Eastern, which is I think that the date that they were talking  about, you want to have something done by Easter, which is in a couple of  weeks.</p><p>HOEKSTRA:  Yes, I think you'll see it out of the house clearly by Easter. I  think it's going to be sometime between Easter and the August Recess before  they get it passed into law and get something on the president's desk. I  think one of the really interesting things to watch is what's going to  happen to the August Recess. The senate -- the house and senate, they're  going to go out of session roughly the end of July and then they're not  going to come back into session until September. Are they really can take a  whole month off? I think they're going to have to pass healthcare. They're  going to have to pass tax reform. I believe before they go on their  traditional August Recess because I think Donald Trump is going to come  back and say, yes, hey, we got to get -- make America great again. We got  to get the economy going. We got to get more money in people's pockets.  These two things have to happen before you go home.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, they'll better be working on a tax reform package if  they're going to take a month off. Maybe, they're going to work on it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, Mitch McConnell said yesterday, the senate majority leader,  the tax reform is not getting done by August. He said I don't think that -- </p><p>HOEKSTRA:  I know he said that thing. The interesting thing he's going to - - </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's going to -- I don't think it will get done by August. </p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a big statement.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I saw that. I was like, what? Oh. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOEKSTRA:  And I think Donald Trump will ask Mitch McConnell to stay in  session in August until they get it done and guess what, with those jet  fumes always going in the end of July, they may actually find a way to get  it done by August. I think Donald Trump is going to stand firm and say  don't go home until these two things are done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you're right.</p><p>HOEKSTRA:  This is what I promised, what we all promised the American  people don't go home until your work is done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I think you're right and I think the American people are  going to shame them into having a tax plan after Obamacare ready to go  after that July Recess. So, we'll see about that. OK. Now, we're talking  about dates, and this is real impactful for markets. Congressman, good to  see you, sir. Thanks so much.</p><p>HOEKSTRA:  OK, great. Thank you. Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pete Hoekstra there and stay tuned, we'll be bringing you live  coverage and announcements of the February jobs report. It is Jobs Day.  Jobs in America begins at 8:00 A.M. Eastern. Q&amp;As for all the experts on  where exactly the jobs are and what are wages doing now. Coming up next,  the car designed for man's best friend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The latest concept from Nissan that dog owners are drooling  over and then serving up these. What restaurants are doing to make you put  the bill for rising minimum wage. Wait until you this. Have you checked  your check lately? Back in a minute.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back with that breaking news overnight. Out of South  Korea, violent clashes breaking out after the country's president was  officially ousted from office. Cheryl Casone with the story now, in  headline. Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  It's quite a scandal in South Korea, Maria. The  president, President Park, has become the country's first democratically  elected leader forced from office in that country after a panel of judges  unanimously upheld parliament's decision to impeach her over a corruption  scandal. She was also the first female leader of South Korea. Violent  clashes immediately breaking out between supporters of Park and police  after the (inaudible) that happened in Seoul. It left at least two people  dead. The country now has 60 days to hold a new presidential election.</p><p>(inaudible) that the same corruption scandal has enveloped the error of  Samsung and then bribery charges. </p><p>Meanwhile, let's turn our focus to Germany. Police have arrested a man who  wounded seven people with an axe at a train station in Dusseldorf  yesterday. Officials describe the suspect as a 36-year-old man, from the  former Yugoslavia, who obviously has mental health problems, they added.  Three of the victims suffered severe injuries. Police believed the suspect  acted alone. </p><p>Well, let's turn to some corporate news this morning. Staples says it's  looking to close another 70 stores in North America following sharp sales  decline. The news comes as the company reports disappointing returns for  the quarter. Earnings coming in at 25 cents a share, that was a penny less  than analyst expected. Store closings follow the elimination of 48  locations last year and as well affected about five percent of stores in  North America. They'll have about 1600 stores left after these closings. </p><p>And finally this headline, the restaurant industry is handling higher labor  costs by adding them to your bill. Rather than raise menu prices to cover  the higher cost of wages, some eateries are now attacking on labor  surcharges. The Wall Street Journal reports that change in states like  Arizona, California, Colorado, and right here in New York are adding the  surcharges of three to four percent to the bill. Maria, you will see them  on your bill, just ask your server for details.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, incredible. I mean, people just miss it but that's who's  paying for minimum wage increases.</p><p>CASONE:  We are, we are. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go. Who do you think was going to pay for it, anyway?  Coming up next, soda sales going flat -- thanks Cheryl. The beverage  Americans are reaching for instead of soda. Future is pointing to a higher  opening ahead of the February jobs report a little more than two hours  away. What to expect from the February jobs number coming out at 8:30 A.M.  Eastern. Market's rallying ahead of that. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. It's pretty good market day this morning. Take a  look. We're expecting a big rally at the opening of trading. Dow  Industrials, expected to be up about 80 points. This is, of course, ahead  of the February jobs report. It's going to hit the (inaudible) in about two  hours. We will bring you the latest numbers, obviously but we're expecting  an addition of 190 thousand jobs to the economy in the last month with the  unemployment rate falling back to 4.7 percent. Jack Otter is with us this  morning and, Jack, we know that we got a very strong ADP number. 298  thousand was reported on Thursday and the estimate was 190, do you think  it's going to be equivalent?</p><p>OTTER:  Yes, I think it's going to be closer to the ADP number than the 190  if you look at a chart of ADP versus the non-farm's payroll, especially, on  these blowout numbers. How often non-farm payroll has actually been above  ADP? So, it's not impossible. We could see a 350 thousand number today. On  the downside, I think it's 250, I don't think it's 190. So -- now, really,  and everyone else is weather, weather, weather. I am starting to wonder if  maybe they're not quite figuring out the seasonal adjustments correctly. 66  thousand construction jobs was a wonderful figure in the ADP number. I  don't believe it. We are not creating 66 thousand construction jobs every  month. I'm sure there was a bump because of the weather and then you add  the seasonal adjustment on top of that and you get this but still goodness.  We'll look - I'm looking through that. Look for wages.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's clear the things are beginning to unleash, Peter. Isn't  that right?</p><p>KIERNAN:  It really does feel. There's never been a damn just burst all at  once. There is a little bit here and a little bit there. What's happening  here is really exciting. Job creation is fantastic. There are some spots  like in retail and some spots like in oil but they have Amazon turning  around and say, we're going to create 100 thousand jobs this year. This is  an economy that's on the march and what I love about this is if we get the  spectacular number you're talking about, as far as Janet Yellen is down  said hike -- we hike raises. We hike rates. What happens when? I think the  financials are going to have a spectacular year particularly if there are  three more rate hikes to follow.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've already have a spectacular year since Election Day,  right, Dagen? The financials are on fire. The Fed meeting is next week, the  15th. A strong jobs number probably does lead to a rate hike, right? You  said it's a rate hike.</p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The rate hiked -- price in the market last week. At the  beginning of the week there was a little more than a third of a chance that  the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates next week and then it went to  about 90 percent.</p><p>KIERNAN:  It's over 90 percent. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right. It went to 90 percent by the end of the week. So, some  people will call it flat footed. The question will be looking down the  road. The Fed expecting three interest rate hikes this year. They're going  to hike most definitely next week. Do they even speed that up? If they  think that the jobs market is getting hot here. The job growth, it's only  running the three month average of 183 thousand jobs. So, they will wait at  least a couple months to see if you have three or four consecutive months  of strong job creation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about -- </p><p>KIERNAN:  People will be looking very closely at wage growth. It's actually  slowed. It was 0.1 percent wage growth last month. If it doesn't get up to  0.3, at least, I think people are going to say, well, this is great but not  good enough and frankly it puts the policymakers in a pickle because you're  creating jobs but not well enough paid jobs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, let's talk about the oil prices for a second. They're  higher this morning but they took a real hit this week over concerns of a  glut in oil. We have, David, showing stockpiles heading record levels. Does  the oil story once again impact the stock market story? And I'll point that  just a couple of stories in the Wall Street Journal this morning. S&amp;P 500  up 250 percent from its lowest crisis year close eight years ago. Household  net worth in the U.S. up to record $92.8 trillion in the fourth quarter  because of that year and surge in stocks.</p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes, I think oil is really exciting right now. It's going to tell  a lot of stories. Number one, no matter what OPEC tried to do to kind of  lift that price of oil. The United States is producing. We're producing 9  million barrels a day. Our record for us and these guys are doing it  because they have debts to pay. Remember, it was only a couple of years ago  that oil was $100 a barrel and interest rates from two percent and, so,  that's it. Let's borrow and pump. We're doing the same thing again and I  don't think that the Saudis and others are going to be, like, keep that  price up as long as United States is pumping, pumping, pumping.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because there's more oil, means lower prices.</p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes, and we're going to keep pumping. We have a great business,  we have an oil dividend for our nation and I think it's a great time for  us. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's a job creator. </p><p>KIERNAN:  Absolutely. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's that as well. We're going to stay tuned. We've got a  big show ahead. We're bringing you live coverage and announcements of the  February jobs report. Jobs in America begins 8:00 A.M. Eastern, 30 minutes  before The Numbers which will hit the tape at 8:30. (inaudible) break when  we come back. Pressure building on Capitol Hill. FBI director, Jim Comey  meeting with lawmakers over the president's wiretapping claims. What it  means for the future of those allegations and then a heart stopping moment  in Ohio.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A little girl, literally blown away literally blown away by  heavy winds, luckily unharmed. The dramatic moment. Watch. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Friday morning, welcome back, everybody. Thanks for being  with us. I'm Marie Bartiromo. Happy Friday and it's Friday, March 10th.  Your top service right now at 6:30 A.M. on the East Coast. </p><p>It's job's day, two hours away from the February jobs report. Economists  are expecting 190 thousand jobs to have been added to the economy in the  month of February. The unemployment rate is expected to tick down to 4.7  percent. What you need to know, coming up this morning. </p><p>FBI Director, James Comey, briefs lawmakers. Director Comey spoke with  congressional leaders over President Trump's wiretapping claims as well as  allegations that President Trump's associates have links to Russia. All of  this coming as WikiLeaks takes on the CIA. White House Press Secretary Sean  Spicer weighed in on the leak. </p><p>SEAN SPICER, PRESS SECRETARY:  There's grave concern that the president has  about to release of national security and classified information that  threatens and undermines our nation's security. Obviously he believes that  the systems at the CIA are outdated and need to be updated. </p><p>BARTIROMO: The video of WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, says he will  give technology companies access to the CIA's hacking tools.  He says he  wants to help technology companies, see where their vulnerabilities are.  </p><p>Refugees using Facebook to seek asylum -- the new online tool that's  helping them get legal advice -- the outrage ahead.  Markets this morning  in rally mode.  </p><p>We're watching oil prices today because crude is rebounding after closing  at the lowest level since November.  Equities once again focused on the oil  market.  </p><p>Oil prices up three quarters of one percent, still below $50 a barrel.  But  nonetheless, the gain is helping stocks across the world.  </p><p>Futures indicating a gain at the opening of trading this morning ahead of  the jobs report.  Market is expected to open up almost 80 points on the Dow  Jones Industrial Average.  </p><p>NASDAQ is up a third of a percent, 21 points higher.  Similar story in  Europe, take a look.  Markets there in the green, up about half a percent  to three quarters of one percent in the European indices this morning. </p><p>And in Asia overnight, stocks mostly higher, with the exception of the  Shanghai composite in China, down a fraction, Nikkei average in Japan up  one and a half percent.  Wild weather across the country -- storms moving  east after hitting the heartland.  </p><p>The wind is leaving a little girl scared but unscathed this morning -- that  unbelievable video of this little girl who gets blown away by the winds.  </p><p>Nissan is embracing man's best friend -- why the new car is pawfect (ph)  for dog lovers.  We'll tell you about it -- all those stories coming up  this morning.  </p><p>But first, growing (ph) pressure this morning on the Justice Department to  substantiate President Trump's claim that the previous administration  wiretapped his phones during the campaign.  FBI Director, James Comey,  briefed top congressional leaders on the situation yesterday as well as on  those allegations that President Trump's associates have some kind of link  to Russia.  Vice President Mike Pence spoke about the Russia allegations  last night with Bret Baier.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT:  When the former director of a -- of  national intelligence said just a week ago that in the report he prepared  by the end of the year, there was no evidence of collusion between Russian  officials and our campaign, I -- I think that -- that speaks with great  authority.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us this morning, London Center for Policy Research  Senior Fellow, Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer. </p><p>Colonel, good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>TONY SHAFFER, SENIOR FELLOW, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH:  Good  morning.  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .for joining us.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Thank you for having me.  Good to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do we know about the Comey briefing yesterday?  What do  you expect to come out of this investigation?  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, so far, I think it was simply an update.  I -- I don't  think anybody on either side wants to go through it because I don't think  either side has made a complete disclosure of what happened.  </p><p>And -- but Maria, let me point out the obvious here.  One of the things  that did come out of that meeting was an update, quote/unquote, on the --  the \"spurious (ph) links\", some sort of link, some connection between Trump  Tower computers and some Russian bank.  </p><p>Well, that tells me they're monitoring that -- that.  And that goes back to  Mr. Trump's point, that he's been monitored.  </p><p>So I think, you know, look closely at what comes out.  And you'll see the  evidence of what's being talked about.  </p><p>And -- and if I were a reporter, I would ask Mr. Comey that question  directly, why (ph) you're -- you're updating people on this computer link.   Gee, does that mean that you have authority to do it?  </p><p>And who gave you the authority?  So I think this is where we have to look  very closely what's been going on.  And this -- this completely verifies  what \"New York Times\" has been saying about the wiretapping.  </p><p>So I think Mr. Trump is (ph) a -- a very clear accounting on what the  authorities were, who issued the authorities and under what circumstance  relating to the so-called FBI, national security investigation of these  links.  It's very clear to me that -- that needs to be disclosed completely  to everybody.  </p><p>JACK OTTER, ONLINE EDITOR, BARRON'S:  So this is Jack Otter from Barron's.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Hey, Jack.  </p><p>OTTER:  My -- my question is it seems to me that obviously, we are  monitoring the -- the Russians at all time, just as.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Right. </p><p>OTTER:  .what (ph) National Security Agency does.  So when the Russians are  in contact with someone here, wouldn't that natural and normal monitoring  reveal that? </p><p>SHAFFER:  No.  </p><p>OTTER:  No? </p><p>SHAFFER:  You have to understand there's a process call minimization.  So  if you decide that you're going to pick up the phone and call someone in  Russia, they can monitor whatever they want on the Russian side of the  call.  </p><p>They cannot monitor you.  If you are not (ph) presumed to have committed a  crime, they can't look at you.  That's just the way it is.  </p><p>OTTER:  But don't they know.</p><p>SHAFFER:  This is me?  Yes, they -- they can -- they, by regulation, have  to pretend they don't know who you are.  There's a process in place called  minimization.  </p><p>I think Andrew Napolitano talks about this.  And he's correct.  You've got  to basically -- if you have not committed a crime and you're not presumed  to have (ph) committed a crime, they can't look at who you are.  </p><p>That's just the way it is.  Now, if there's things in the conversation with  the Russians which may stimulate people to think there's something -- that  you're doing something wrong, then that could be probable cause.  </p><p>And that would stimulate a whole separate thing of -- of authorities (ph).   But you have to have that probable cause tripwire. </p><p>Something has to happen in the conversation that says, there's something  potentially illegal here.  And everything I've heard, everything I've been  told about does not indicate there was any collusion or wrong-doing in any  of the conversations either way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>PETER KIERNAN, FORMER PARTNER, GOLDMAN SACHS:  You know, one of the things  that troubles me and you hear Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Senator  Lindsey Graham say, all we need to do is call the FBI and we'll quickly get  this worked out, isn't it a little bit more complicated than just asking  one or two questions of the FBI? </p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, yes, for a couple of reasons.  First, the FBI is not the  only organization that could actually do this level of collection.  </p><p>We have to look at the DHS, Department of Homeland Security.  They have  their own internal capabilities to do these sorts of things.  </p><p>And then you have also the -- the military services.  And let me be very,  very clear on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  .some of you all remember George Bush's warrantless wiretaps.  We  -- DOD could be used in what we call Title 10.  </p><p>Title 10 is -- is the -- the body of laws called traditional military  activities.  The simple rule of thumb on that is anything George Washington  did with the continental army, that include spying, you can do under Title  10.  </p><p>So that's how you have another option available to you as the president to  do this collection.  So you cannot simply look down one venue and try to  ascertain what happened here.  </p><p>You have to look at multiple and try to figure out within those multiple  venues what law was used, what technology was used, what days was it used.   That's -- it's a very complicated situation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know, it's interesting, I mean, I think everybody  knows how I feel about this whole Russian narrative at this point.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.  We all feel (ph) -- yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I mean.</p><p>SHAFFER:  I don't (ph) -- yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .you know, watching -- watching the media this morning, I was  watching different channels and the -- and the way that they were reporting  it, it's amazing, they keep having to say, no evidence yet of -- of any  interaction between the Trump team and the Russians.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .as if like, well, we're waiting.  No evidence yet.  Even James  Clapper said it.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .no evidence yet.  And -- and we know that Clapper has been on  the other side of this story and has been really not.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .a friend to the Trump administration.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We turn to the CIA hacking claims.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .Lieutenant Colonel, because WikiLeaks found -- Julian Assange  spoke out about the alleged CIA document yesterday.  Listen to what he had  to say.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JULIAN ASSANGE, FOUDNER, WIKILEAKS:  The CIA developed a giant arsenal, the  -- what appears to be the largest arsenal of Trojans and viruses in the  world that attacks most of the systems that journalists, people in  government, politicians, CEOs and average people use, didn't secure it,  lost control of it and then appears to have covered up that fact.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Assange is offering top technology companies those alleged  hacking tools.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he says they can patch security flaws.  Is he making fun of  them?  I mean, is he -- is he really thinking that they want to work with a  fugitive? </p><p>I mean, what -- what do you think about this? </p><p>SHAFFER:  I think he's having fun with both sides.  I mean, he's in a  position to poke people in the eyes, poking people in the eye.  </p><p>To the tech industry point, they have built by -- for any number of  reasons, huge vulnerabilities within their own systems.  I mean, if I were  at (ph) North Korea, I wouldn't be buying any Panasonic TVs anytime soon if  I didn't want them to -- to know what I'm doing in my living room.  </p><p>So I think these are -- and by the way, these are -- these were known  before the CIA hack came out.  I mean, you cannot -- technology is  ambivalent to the user.  </p><p>So it doesn't matter if you're the government.  It doesn't matter if you're  a private industry.  </p><p>These vulnerabilities exist.  So what I think what he's doing is saying,  hey, you, industry folks, have been pretty (ph) stupid.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  .by leaving these back doors open.  With that said, the  disclosure the CIA has tools to deal with those in my judgment is -- is a  very severe breech.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  And -- and I think CIA needs to look at their -- what I would  call internet hygiene or trade craft.  Again, Maria, I ran a unit doing  this sort of thing back in the late '90s and early 2000s.  </p><p>And let me tell you, none of the stuff we did, it's not been -- it's not  been disclosed because we actually I think practiced very effective trade  craft.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  So I think you have to look at the situation for what it is.  And  so Assange is -- is not a good guy.  He's -- he's kind of poking both sides  of the obvious (ph) point.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Now, he's esteeming (ph) giant bag of  garbage who wants.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  .to destroy the United States and never leaked.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Precisely.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  .anything about Russia or China by the way.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to point Apple has said that any security flaws that were  disclosed in this leak, they have -- they have closed those loopholes,  closed those gaps in the most recent software update, the operating system  update.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we didn't.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, remember the -- with this, these are  impenetrable.  Nobody can get into this phone.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what we thought after San Bernardino.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, no, but that -- that was an older phone.  The newer phone.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I see what you're saying.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  .there's no backdoor, period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The newer phones.  Let me -- let me get your take on this.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .because a Facebook Messenger chat bot is helping.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .refugees seek asylum.  This is amazing.  This is a computer  program.  And it's offering legal advice through texts or vocal commands.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are your thoughts on this new technology?  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Maria, I -- I couldn't get it out of my head this morning.  I was  preparing for the story of \"Max Headroom\" back in the -- you know, in the  '80s, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes, yes.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  .of Max coming on and telling you legal advice.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get smart, right.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, it's -- it's kind of interesting because it is an  application of technology for purposes of helping refugees do a number of  things, some -- some good, some bad.  Now, the idea here is that, you know,  maybe you could figure out which country you can go to and say, I want  asylum and -- and you go there.  </p><p>And -- and you go there.  It's (ph) going to catalyze (ph) people to  certain countries as (ph) they can get there.  At the same time, you know,  it -- it may be something that actually helps people understand what their  legal rights are and are not.  </p><p>And I think for the purposes of -- of what I've read, I think someone tried  to create it to actually help the refugees without having to spend a lot of  money because the other thing about -- hope -- don't take any lawyers there  onset the wrong way, lawyers are expensive.  So I think maybe this is a way  of trying to -- to prevent lawyers from, you know, milking these folks who  are looking for -- for -- for asylum.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, there you go.  All right, great to see you, Colonel.   Thanks so much.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Great (ph).  Thank you.  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Colonel Tony Shaffer, joining us there.  </p><p>Coming up next, a car worth drooling over -- the latest concept from Nissan  designed with man's best friend in mind.  And then it is a jungle out there  -- big names battling at the box office.  </p><p>Will \"Kong Skull Island\" climb to the top this weekend?  We've got your  weekend preview of movies, back in a minute.              </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It's big Friday for the markets this morning.   Take a look.  </p><p>We are looking at a rally underway this morning -- Dow Industrials expected  to open up 70 points, NASDAQ up about 20 points.  Of course, we're waiting  on the jobs number out in less than two hours.  </p><p>A couple of names we're watching -- keep an eye on Snap -- the social media  company officially has one week of trading in the books.  Snap ended the  first week of trading below its opening price.  </p><p>Now, it opened at $24 a share.  It's down nearly seven percent from there.   We're watching Facebook this morning, the company reaching a deal with  major league soccer and Univision to stream the games.  </p><p>The deal includes at least 22 regular-season games, the first of which will  be March 18.  Facebook shares up nearly 20 percent in '17 -- 2017.  </p><p>Well, a little girl blown away in heavy winds -- we've been showing you the  pictures.  Cheryl Casone has this amazing story.  </p><p>Cheryl?  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  It is amazing, Maria.  And the  surveillance video does show this little four-year-old girl in Ohio being  blown away during a wind storm.  </p><p>When the front -- she walked up the front stairs of her house, she opens  the door and the wind caught both.  Here is the thing -- she wasn't  injured.  </p><p>In fact, her mom said she was laughing after it was all over.  But mom did  say she had to pry (ph) her daughter's hands from the door at first because  she was just gripping on so hard.  </p><p>Oh, man.  In other headlines this morning, guys, I love the affair over  (ph) soda seems to be over.  According to an industry tracker, bottled  water overtook soda as the top drink in the U.S. by sales volume last year.  </p><p>Americans drink an average of just over 39 gallons of bottled water in  2016, nearly a gallon more than carbonated soft drinks.  This news  shouldn't come, though, as a surprise.  </p><p>Sales of bottled water have been growing for years as demand for soda has  fallen.  Well, Starbucks is gearing up for spring, the coffee company  unveiling three new cups styled for the spring season.  </p><p>And they're kind of different for Starbucks -- pastel blue, green and  yellow.  They've got some spring-themed drawings on them -- first time that  Starbucks has ever offered spring cups.  </p><p>They will be in stores on March 16.  And finally, favorite story of the day  -- it is a car for the dogs literally.  </p><p>Nissan is getting ready to start production on a new Nissan X-trail.  It's  a vehicle that's got multiple features to make your dog's life and your  life a little bit easier.  </p><p>There's an easy access ramp, a pull-out water shower, a treat storage  compartment, integrated dryer, no-spill water bowl and a clip-on harness  hook.  And then it gets better.  </p><p>It's got dual dog cam technology so the dog and the owner can see and hear  each other simultaneously while they're driving.  It's going to be produced  in Europe first, guys, before it goes to market here in the U.S. </p><p>And no, Dagen and, Maria, I don't know what it costs.  But I'm going to  find out.  It looks awesome.  </p><p>Somebody has to buy one.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, Ramon (ph) and Charlie (ph) I know would love it.   Ella Bella (ph) would like it, too.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But can I just point out it's critically important to secure  your dogs properly when they're riding in -- in the automobile.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If (ph) it does that, it -- it will save many pets' lives.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this is a good thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we had a great week this week here on MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  Take a look at some of the moments from the big show this week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on the GOP plan in terms of health care for  America?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, we applaud Speaker Ryan and Secretary Price for  getting out and putting a proposal on the table that seems like a -- a  reasonable and concrete plan.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You can call me happy Herman this morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy Herman?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Happy -- happy with this tax plan.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And here is why.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is Obamacare gone.  Mandates are gone.  Taxes are  gone.  Penalties are gone.  </p><p>And it's going to reestablish the healthcare marketplace and the health  insurance marketplace.  </p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR, HARVARD LAW:  The president doesn't get to  order wiretaps in the United States of America.  That's not the job of the  president.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  It (ph) has to come through the Justice Department, the FBI.   There were wiretaps that did capture conversations between officials and  Russians.  </p><p>Probably, it was wiretaps on the Russians.  We do that routinely.  We  wiretap everybody, every other country.  </p><p>But we're not allowed to wiretap the Trump Tower.  </p><p>JOHN NEGROPONTE, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO IRAQ:  We're hemorrhaging  classified information.  There are no secrets left anymore.  It's a big  problem.  </p><p>And I think mainly, it's a problem of information control.  </p><p>MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, ALLIANZ:  Battle lines are  forming both within the Republican Party and more broadly.  And the  question is the political judgment.  </p><p>To what extent will President Trump use his political capital here as  opposed to tax reform, infrastructure, which contributes directly and  quickly to economic growth?  </p><p>PAUL BROWNING, CEO, MITSUBISHI HITACHI POWER SYSTEMS AMERICAS:  As you put  in new tax policy, let's make sure that we don't put in tax policy that  creates a disincentive to do the kinds of things that our country has done  -- or our.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.  </p><p>BROWNING:  .our company has done.  </p><p>STEPHEN SCHORK, FOUNDER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  U.S. producers are now putting  500,000 barrels a day -- more oil onto the market to-date than they were  prior to the OPEC announcement.  </p><p>TONY ROBBINS, AUTHOR OF \"UNSHAKEABLE\":  I didn't want to write another book  as long as I lived, haven't had one (ph) for 20 years.  But then I just saw  so much fear.  </p><p>When does a bear show up?  About every five years, we're due for one.  It's  been eight.  They last a year.  </p><p>They cost about 33 percent but they don't cost anything if you don't sell  (ph).  And every single bear market in the history of the United States for  two centuries is stalled (ph) by a bull market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the priorities of this administration -- growth.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just realized (ph).  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get on it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get on it, that's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Colonel West, all -- all those Republicans who you still talk  to, and tell them to get on the tax reform.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're watching.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're warning them.  </p><p>FORMER REP. ALLEN WEST (R), FLORIDA:  I will -- I will be up -- I will be  in Washington, D.C. in two weeks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  </p><p>WEST:  I will make sure I tell them, Dagen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you have marching orders from Dagen McDowell.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>We will be watching.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll send you a.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>WEST:  Yes, ma'am.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you use these things as a doctor? </p><p>TIFFANY SIZEMORE, CARDIOLOGIST:  I do.  I use a smart scale every day.   This is a Withings (ph) and a Philips smart scale.  </p><p>They both do body mass index, fat percentage.  They track your -- your  weight on an app.  Each of them have apps.  </p><p>And you can see a graph, a poll (ph) kind of representation.  You can set  goals for yourself.  It tells you when you meet your goal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, how did you come up with this idea, first of all,  before we talk about all the treats that you brought, in terms of eating  cookie dough raw?  </p><p>KRISTEN TOMIHAN (ph):  Yes, so I have been lifelong baker.  Half the time I  would make cookies that -- it wouldn't even make it to the oven.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they (ph) ate all the dough.  </p><p>TOMIHAN (ph):  .because they're eating (ph) the cookie dough right from the  bowl.  So I had this moment when I was with a bunch of girlfriends and  thought, why is this not a thing?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  To celebrate March madness, Pizza Hut is introducing a limited  edition sneaker that has an ordering button built right in.  They are  called Pie Tops -- yes, Pie Tops.  </p><p>Just press the button on your sneaker and a fresh pizza will be delivered  to your exact location.  I just pressed the button several times.  </p><p>I'm hoping that they know we want a pizza and the pizza is delivered.  We  got the pizza.  This is incredible.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  An unchartered island.  Let me list all the ways you're  going to die.  Rain, heat, disease-carrying flies and we haven't started on  the things that want to eat you alive.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We'll double that.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Plus a bonus if we make it back. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes (ph).  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, that was a clip from the new film, \"Kong: Skull Island,\"  hitting theaters today.  Joining me now, \"In the FOXlight\" host and senior  vice president of marketing here at Fox News, Michael Tammero.  </p><p>Michael, good to see you.  </p><p>MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF MARKETING:  Hey, good  morning. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I wasn't sure if I would like that but it's starring John  Goodman, Tom Hiddleston, and Brie Larson -- hundred $90 million budget.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Hundred $90 million budget -- it's because it's (ph) part of the  \"Kong\" -- \"King\" for a reason.  He probably will top it off at the box  office this weekend -- tough competition against \"Logan\" which over- performed last weekend and earned about $80 million.  </p><p>This is an important movie for Warner Bros.  It's the second movie in a  (ph) big monster franchise.  Twenty-fourteen, they had \"Godzilla,\" a  hundred and $60 million budget, pulled in half a billion dollars globally.  </p><p>This is the second installment, they're going with \"King Kong.\"  They're  (ph) -- another \"Godzilla\" coming out next year.  </p><p>And then in 2020, there's a \"Godzilla\" \"King Kong\" mash-up.  So this -- but  first is we (ph) have to work, and it probably will.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"Godzilla\" \"King Kong\" mash-up, I love it.  All right, well,  we'll see if it does well.  </p><p>I guess I'm into it.  We'll see about that. </p><p>TAMMERO:  It's gotten pretty good reviews and the special effects are  supposed to be really good.  So we'll (ph) see it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, well, that'll do it, special effects.  All right, I want to  get your take on this -- a Mexico-based movie theater chain launching two  new in-theater playgrounds in Southern California.</p><p>TAMMERO:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .to draw audiences in.  So tickets cost $3 more.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Wow (ph).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .will be geared toward children ages three to 12.  But do you  want to go to the movies and have your kids play in a playground? </p><p>TAMMERO:  Popcorn and pink eye (ph), Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  That's all I'm saying.  Look, this is what theaters have to do.   You know, box office may be up on a dollar basis but attendance is flat or  down in most cases.  </p><p>There's a lot of competition out there with Netflix and other streaming  services.  People would rather stay home.  </p><p>So you've got to provide a reason for them to get out of the house and  actually go to the theaters.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree with that.  I'm in that category actually.  Give me a  reason, otherwise I'm watching in my.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Just give me a glass of wine and I am there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly, exactly.  All right, we've got to talk about \"Star.\" </p><p>TAMMERO:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .Fox new series featuring Queen Latifah and Lenny Kravitz,  along with model, Naomi Campbell.  Tell us about it. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Naomi Campbell, she came into Fox.  I sat down with her.  Let's  take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>TAMMERO:  Naomi Campbell, thanks for stepping \"Into the FOXlight.\"  You  look amazing as always.  </p><p>NAOMI CAMPBELL, MODEL:  Never been here before.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  \"Star,\" big episode tonight.  </p><p>CAMPBELL:  Right.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Tell us a little bit about your character and what's going on  right now.  </p><p>CAMPBELL:  Basically, I'm the mother of Alexandra Crane.  And Alexandra has  gotten herself caught up with this lovely guy next door in Atlanta which  I'm against all of it.  </p><p>My daughter is rebelling big time for how her rock star father, who's  played by Lenny Kravitz and her fashionable (ph) -- tried to be rock star  mother, kind of abandoned her as a child.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ROSE SPENCER-CRANE:  Why do you tell those people I was dead?  </p><p>ALEXANDRA CRANE:  I think you might as well be.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TAMMERO:  That area you came up then (ph) in the '90s, the whole supermodel  -- it was such an era (ph) -- I don't think it's ever going to be  duplicated again.  </p><p>CAMPBELL:  I love the ladies I came up with.  And we also interacted with  each other and supportive of each other.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  What has it like been for you to sort of come up as a woman, sort  of like blaze a trail with modeling and then. </p><p>CAMPBELL:  My whole -- just period -- my whole existence, I feel, has been  a challenge.  And so I don't get -- I -- kind of when a challenge comes up,  I don't get like all that nervous and scared (ph).  </p><p>It feels normal to me.  I am a fighter.  I am a survivor.  And that's how I  -- you know, I don't take anything for granted.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Yes.  </p><p>CAMPBELL:  I commit to what I get and stand and want to be pushing for  (ph), whatever it is say yes to these days -- these days. </p><p>TAMMERO:  Well, thank you for saying yes to coming here tonight.  </p><p>CAMPBELL:  Oh, no, thank you for having me.  Nice (ph) to meet you.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  So great to meet you.  </p><p>CAMPBELL:  You, too.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  And we can catch you Wednesday night.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was awesome.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  That was great (ph).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michael, great stuff.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Such a legend.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  See you later.  Michael Tammero.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.

Good Friday morning.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thanks so much for joining us.  It is Friday, March  10th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Next hour we will get the February jobs report.  Economists are looking job  creation of 190,000 jobs as the economy last month with the unemployment  ticking down to 4.7 percent.  What you need to see and know about jobs,  coming up this morning.</p><p>On to our nation's infrastructure getting a nearly failing grade in a new  report -- it's an issue President Trump is watching closely.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Our infrastructure is in  serious trouble.  We will build new roads and highways and tunnels and  airports and railways across the nation.  We will fix our existing product  before we build anything brand-new, however.  We have to fix what we have.   It's a mess.  So we are going to fix it first.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The very latest on infrastructure plans on top of all the other  plans coming out this morning.</p><p>Checking market action, we are watching oil prices today.  We are seeing a  bit of a rally after a tough week -- crude rebounding after closing at the  lowest level since November yesterday.  Oil below $50 a barrel still but up  this morning, two-thirds of 1 percent.</p><p>That's helping equities.  Stocks are higher across the world; futures  indicating a gain of about 70 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average.   Of course, the jobs number will certainly dictate what happens with the  stock market.  So we will be watching that.  But the market right now  rallying ahead of the jobs number.</p><p>In Europe, similar story.  Stocks are up between half of a percent and two- thirds of a percent across the Eurozone indices.</p><p>And in Asia overnight, markets are mostly higher, take a look, with the  exception of China.  Shanghai composite down a fraction.  Japan was strong,  up one and a half percent on the Nikkei average.</p><p>Plus \"The Terminator\" eyeing a move to Capitol Hill?  Arnold Schwarzenegger  not ruling out a Senate run, apparently.  We've got the details on what  he's saying this morning.</p><p>And Honey Nut Cheerios loses its iconic bee.  Take a look.  Why General  Mills is making the move, coming up this morning.</p><p>And one toddler not impressed by Queen Elizabeth -- why he threw a tantrum,  coming up this morning.</p><p>All those stories ahead and joining me to talk all about it Fox Business  Network's Dagen McDowell; Barron's online editor, interim editor of  \"Barron's Magazine\", congratulations Jack Otter.  </p><p>JACK OTTER, BARRON'S MAGAZINE:  Thanks very much -- Maria.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And \"New York Times\" bestselling author Peter Kiernan is here.   Good to see you.</p><p>PETER KIERNAN, AUTHOR:  Nice to see you again.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  Great show so far -- guys.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  Make sense of it -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it is Friday, after all.</p><p>But first this hour, President Trump set to face an uphill battle to follow  through on his promise to improve the country's infrastructure.  A new  report by the American Society of Civil Engineers giving the state of the  American infrastructure a near failing grade of D+.  The report is  estimating that restoring the country's facilities will cost more than $4.5  trillion outpacing President Trump's plan to spend $1 trillion.</p><p>Joining us right now is former Nebraska senator and 9/11 commission member  Bob Kerrey.  Senator -- good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BOB KERREY, FORMER NEBRASKA SENATOR:  You're welcome.  Nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, anybody who's traveled these roads in our airports, I  guess has seen that.  But what do you make of this study.  It's bad.  </p><p>KERREY:  Well, it would be $4.5 trillion well spent.  I mean even a bridge  to nowhere employs people.  And there's no question it would add to  productivity and add to (inaudible) the economy.  It'll be money well spent  if we can somehow figure out how to do it.  That's for sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do we do it, though?  I mean we keep facing this question,  whether it's Obamacare and, you know, subsidies, or the tax plan, and a  border adjustment tax to come up with ways to for all of that.  </p><p>KERREY:  I think -- look, I think governance matters. I think you have to  set it up so people have confidence that their money is going to be well  spent and it's not going to get sort of wrapped up into pork barrel  spending.  I think you could do that.</p><p>I think you're probably going to need a safe harbor for these things so you  can build faster because often times you find yourself up with 404  permitting -- that's a Corps of Engineers permitting process.</p><p>You have to figure out some way to give the American people confidence it's  going to be money well-spent.  And it is going to create jobs.  It is going  to strengthen the economy and that it can built rapidly.</p><p>I mean it's a problem.  I'm not sure we could build the interstate highway  system.  We darn sure couldn't build the Erie Canal.  So you've got to get  this thing set up so it can actually go as quickly as possible to really  creating excess jobs but confidence in the American people that it will  stimulate and grow the economy.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Some of the idea at least to pay for the $1  trillion because President Trump doesn't want to -- for the government to  spend taxpayer money of a trillion dollars but is for revenue sharing in  some projects.  Say toll roads, the private contractors.  </p><p>KERREY:  Look, money is money.  You only separate government money and  private money for ideological reasons.  So you're going to have to pull it  out of the economy one way or the other.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a fair point.  But the reason that infrastructure is  crumbling -- and I don't know if you agree with this or not -- is because  individuals want their roads and bridges fixed but they don't want to pay  for it.  They don't want to pay higher gas taxes.  That's why the gas tax  hasn't gone up in more than 20 years.  </p><p>KERREY:  That's true.  That's true although most taxpayers when they  understand that they are paying a gas tax for the road, at least it's a  user fee.  They feel like they're getting something for it.</p><p>I think the larger question is can I get confident that the money is not  going to get spent on boondoggle projects and that sort of thing.  Do I  have a governing board of people who are really smart, who are evaluating  what needs to be done?  What are the highest priorities?  And then to make  sure that they can be done quickly.</p><p>You need some -- I said some sign of safe harbor environmental expediting  process so these things can be done quickly.  There's no question that it  will strengthen the economy done correctly.  </p><p>OTTER:  Senator -- would there be some way to create -- to get a group of  civil engineers or whoever it would be together and just have them make the  decision and then put it to Congress for an up or down vote rather than  letting, you know, a hundred senators all will get their own pork barrel  spending in there and suddenly, as you say, you've got a boondoggle -- </p><p>KERREY:  I'm not sure that's going to work because I don't think it's an up  or down vote issue.  I think it's a ten-year process; it's a 20-year  process.  It's not like it's a one-year deal.</p><p>One of the problems we had with the stimulus bill in 2009, was do I have  shovel-ready projects.  Well, what you needed was multiyear funding  confidence.  And that's a 10-year, 20-year process.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the money was in many instances was allocated to states and  regions that didn't need infrastructure spending.  There were areas in  Connecticut where the roads got repaved that didn't need, where there were  stop lights put in that they didn't need them.  And that means that  somebody -- another area wasn't getting necessary money.  </p><p>KERREY:  Right.  There'll always be a little of that.  But I mean whether  civil engineers -- I mean just a governing board of people that are really  looking at where is the need, what would produce the greatest economic  benefit, what's best of our communities.</p><p>I mean this is not a difficult planning process and the $4 trillion doesn't  get spent in one year.  It's probably a ten-year, 20-year effort.  But I'm  just saying again, there's no question, done correctly, this would  strengthen the American economy.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  What about having something like a national infrastructure  development bank.  Some orchestrating body that would come together and  say, we are going to take the best ideas and the civil engineers.  We're  going to take the best ideas.  This is something both Democrats and  Republicans agree on.  What do you think of that idea?  </p><p>KERREY:  I think it's a good idea.  I think the selling point has to be are  you glad that your father's generation built the interstate highway?  Do  you think that the Erie Canal did something good?  The Erie Canal was  controversial.  Not a single member of the New York City delegation in  Albany voted for the Erie Canal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>KERREY:  So these things get controversial in the moment.  I think it's a  good idea to create some kind of banking process just so you can get some  leveraging activity, to finance in a smart way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not a priority for the administration over the near term.   That's just -- I mean they have this failing grade but Steven Mnuchin and  company have been very clear -- Obamacare, tax reform in 2017, and then  they will consider infrastructure. </p><p>I mean it's there, it's on the agenda but I want to switch gears, Senator.</p><p>KERREY:  Ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I've got to get your take over this Russia story because the  fall-out over Michael Flynn's communications with Russia taking a new turn  this morning.  So the former national security adviser admitting to being a  foreign agent after getting paid for lobbying work that may have benefited  the Turkish government.</p><p>The Trump administration distancing itself from the controversy.  Watch  this.  We want your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Hearing that story today  was the first I heard of it.  And I fully support the decision that  President Trump made to ask for General Flynn's resignation.  I think it is  an affirmation of the President's decision to ask General Flynn to resign.  </p><p>SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  This is what he did for a  living.  He was a private citizen at the time.  There's nothing nefarious  about doing anything that's legal as long as the proper paperwork is filed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you make of this?  How should we see this?  </p><p>KERREY:  It's not the question of is it legal or not; clearly it's legal.   The question is can you be the national security adviser if you have been  representing a foreign government, in this case Turkey, and I think the  answer is no.  And he should have told the President.</p><p>You know, it's not -- you want to do something.  I know what I have been  doing, I know whether or not that disqualifies me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's got to be up front.  </p><p>KERREY:  He should have known it was a disqualifying thing that he's done.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If he hadn't been kicked to the curve, so to speak, for lying to  Vice President Pence, he would be out the door because of this.</p><p>KERREY:  Well, he should -- he shouldn't -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If he all wasn't already gone, this would send him packing.  </p><p>KERREY:  Yes.  Look, all of us have a little bit of self-delusion going on  in our lives.  And I think this guy had a little bit more than most of us.   And he should have been able to recognize that he's representing Turkey, if  he's actually registered -- that's another question, did he register?   Regardless, if he's representing Turkey, he can't be the national security  adviser.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on these wiretapping allegations from the  President?  </p><p>KERREY:  I don't know -- it's kind of bizarre.  That and a tweet on Arnold  Schwarzenegger in the same ten-minute walk around the second floor in your  jammies.  I was a little bit taken aback by the whole thing.  I think that  unfortunately for him, what it does is it strengths the case that we need  to -- a general investigation of this thing, one that gets confidence.</p><p>And I hope the Senate Intel Committee can to pull it off.  It's not easy to  do.  </p><p>OTTER:  What is it -- could we have a boy who cried \"wolf\" situation here.   I mean there's so many crazy things coming out of that Twitter account.  At  some point do people start to take the President with less authority than  they really should?</p><p>KERREY:  Well, I'm not sure he cares more about -- I think he cares more  about his ratings than he does his approval ratings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he's got that interaction going with the people.</p><p>KERREY:  Right now -- he's the highest rating show in the country.  You  have to get him credit for that.  Schwarzenegger got kicked off because his  ratings are down and Trump's ratings are up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about Schwarzenegger because former California  governor Arnold Schwarzenegger could be considering a run for the Senate  according to Politico.  So Politico is reporting that on the heels of  President Trump and Schwarzenegger's feud over the ratings of \"The  Celebrity Apprentice\" and President Trump's leadership, do think  Schwarzenegger's dispute with the President has anything to do with his  possible -- </p><p>KERREY:  I would say if he gets elected, he's not going to be a reliable  vote for the President.  (inaudible) but I will bet my top bet of a dollar  that Arnold Schwarzenegger is not going to run for Senate.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How he would change the Senate?  </p><p>KERREY:  I don't think it changes much at all.  One more guy hitting the  camera.  So I don't think -- we will see what he does.  But I don't think  it's a fundamental change in the Senate politics.  As I said, I think it's  highly unlikely that he does it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean he won the governorship.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KIERNAN:  They both share -- they share a passion for the limelight.  And  they both milk it pretty well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they do.  </p><p>KERREY:  Yes.  Well, you know, the limelight's pretty dim for a junior  senator, one out of 100 so we will see whether or not he pursues that.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  So he won't be back?  </p><p>KERREY:  No, I don't know.  We'll see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I was going to say.</p><p>OTTER:  Senator -- last night we had a big dinner for Barron's sponsors and  obviously Trump is the talk of every dinner table.</p><p>KERREY:  Yes.</p><p>OTTER:  And one financial guy I was talking to said if Trump is successful  as a president it could really hurt the concept of the career politician.   And Schwarzenegger would seem the obvious sort of person to start to fill  in if American people are looking for something other than a politician.</p><p>Do you think that's a -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KERREY:  He could also elevate the idea that somebody really ought to be  competent before he be put in the job, so.  </p><p>OTTER:  Very good point.  </p><p>KERREY:  Yes. </p><p>I don't think it does that.  I mean, there is something odd going on.  I  don't want a career politician and they want a career doctor, they want a  career lawyer, they want a professional in all of their ways and you do  acquire skills and knowledge the longer you are on the job.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I am going to push back because just because -- </p><p>KERREY:  Please do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- he communicates with people differently.  Just because he's a  very different person doesn't mean that he's incompetent.</p><p>KERREY:  Well, I don't -- I'm not saying that he's incompetent.  That's not  the case I'm making.  But if you're going to go into politics there's a  certain (inaudible) that's required.  I mean I'm a fan of Governor Raimondo  and Governor Kasich of Ohio.</p><p>And you watch what they did, what watch Raimondo did to get the pensions  under control and saying as a Democrat, we've got to deal with pensions;  and took heat from the left, took heat from the right, Kasich did as well.   But they handled it in my view in a very professional fashion.  As a  consequence they get things done.</p><p>I'm not saying that Trump is, by any means, incompetent.  I'm just saying  if you're trying to actually move the ball down -- take health care, for  example.  This is not difficult to figure out what to do.  You're going to  lose the guys on the right, you're going to lose the guys on the left, you  put a bill together and you get it done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But look at his first one hundred days.  Have you ever seen as  active a period for an incoming president?  What are we now?  Day 48, ok,  day 48 and how many executive orders has he done.  Look at the agenda --  Obamacare, tax reform.  </p><p>KERREY:  But Maria he has made no appeal to try to bring the country  together.  You have -- the demonstrations that are going on are not sort  organized by some malicious force.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the Dems have been obstructing.</p><p>KERREY:  This isn't the Dems.  This isn't the Dem that are on the streets.   This is Americans who are upset by many of the things that he said and many  of the things that he is doing.  He has made no appeal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How can he do that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He made an appeal in that speech, in that speech in front of  Congress.  He made an appeal.</p><p>KERREY:  But the people he's bringing into the government are substantially  on the right -- in many cases extreme right.  Take Pruitt of EPA.  If  you're concerned about the environment, you spend your time concerned about  the environment, this guy is not going to bring you on board.  He's not  going to do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  All right, we're going to leave it there.  We'll  be watching.  Senator Kerrey -- thank you.</p><p>We will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Massive protests underway in South Korea this morning after the country's  constitutional court formally removed the impeached president from office.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  The scandal has been going on, we should  say, for months here -- Maria.  At least two people have now died and about  30 others have been injured when supporters of President Park Geun-Hye  clashed with police in massive protest in that country.</p><p>The court's decision came months after a major corruption scandal plunged  that country into political turmoil.  She's the first South Korean  president to be thrown out of office by the court.</p><p>Meanwhile tens of thousands of people holding a peaceful rally celebrating  the court's ruling.  South Korea's Kospi index, we should say, did close  higher today.</p><p>Well, it is a day of reckoning for Volkswagen.  The German automaker  expected to plead guilty this morning to three criminal counts in the  Justice Department's diesel omissions investigation.  VW could also be  sentenced by the judge in the case. That company agreed in January to plead  guilty and pay $4.3 billion in fines for programming more than half a  million diesel cars to cheat on U.S. emissions test.</p><p>VW also admitted to lying to investigators to cover up that scheme.   Criminal charges have also been filed against seven VW employees.</p><p>Well, you may have noticed something missing on your Honey Nut Cheerios  box.  Look at it this morning if it's in your kitchen.  The maker of the  cereal, General Mills, has removed the mascot bee to raise awareness of the  vanishing bee colonies around the world.  The boxes now feature a white boy  where the bee used to be.  Bees are a big part of the world's food supply  we should say.  General Mills says 30 percent of the ingredients that are  used in its products rely on bee pollination.  Big move by a big company.</p><p>And finally, we all know kids can be kind of unpredictable but do you want  it to happen in front of the queen of England?  Well, two-year-old Alfie  threw a major tantrum.  As flowers were being handed to Her Majesty at an  official ceremony the meltdown happened at the unveiling of a war memorial  in London yesterday.</p><p>The kid is freaking out.  The queen met with young Alfie's father who was  awarded, by the way, a bravery medal and his wife.  Prince Philip and the  Queen pretty patient as Alfie continued to freak out the entire time.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He is not having it.</p><p>CASONE:  He was like, whatever lady, get away from me, queen person.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  He deserves that bravery medal.  He decided to think about him,  give it to her.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So cute.</p><p>Cheryl -- thank you.</p><p>Coming up, cyber security risks in focus -- what the most recent WikiLeaks  dump means for the technology companies and the privacy of your  information.</p><p>Plus Michael Jordan scores a slam dunk, how he's cashing in on his own  mistake -- next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR:  It's something that I don't mean to freak you  out with, but I think it's true.  Even our memories are not absolutely  private in America.  Even our communications with our spouses, with our  clergy members, with our attorneys are not absolutely private in America.   The general principle is one we've always accepted in this country.  There  is no such thing as absolute privacy in America.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And of course, we are learning that more and more every day.   That was FBI director James Comey speaking candidly about privacy at a  cyber security conference earlier this week.</p><p>Of course, fresh concerns over personal privacy as well raised this week  after WikiLeaks published details about what it says are CIA tools capable  of hacking consumer electronics for espionage.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about cyber security is Tech Data CEO Bob  Dutkowsky.  Good to see you -- Bob.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>ROBERT DUTKOWSKY, TECH DATA CEO:  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First of all, your reaction to him saying even our memories are  not private -- what?  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  Well, if you think about we transpose everything that we think  about today into technology.  Social media causes us to think and publish  things freely and so as soon as information gets into a computer whether  it's a pc or a phone or a sensor on the end of IOT, there's a security risk  and it's exposed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How nervous should we be though that like the smart TVs and the  smart phones that we all have are just not listening devices, that we are  being watched at all times?  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  I think it comes back to the integrity of the companies that  build the products and do they try to tighten them up as much as they can.   But it's technology and technology is exposed.  And so the whole cyber  security industry now is a massive industry.  And it's a place where Tech  Data is committed and invested heavily to be able to support our customers  and their users to make their environments more secure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you do?  Tell us about your cyber security business.  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  We partner with the companies in the IT industry that are  really the titans of the security industry -- companies like Cisco and IBM  and HP, Microsoft, Oracle and we take their security products and we sell  them into the small and medium-sized business all the way up to large  governmental agencies.</p><p>We are one of those routes to market that very few people understand exist.   We're a middle person between the developers of the industry and then that  community that needs cyber security.  </p><p>OTTER:  I would be interested to know on a personal level because you know  so much about this -- do you take any steps that viewers can learn from in  terms of your own life and security?  I mean I have an Amazon Echo in our  family kitchen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're dead.  You're dead.  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  So does everyone.  To Maria's question, is Alexa listening to  us?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The device is spying on us.</p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  You know, so how else could Alexa wake up when you say Alexa  find Tim McGraw music unless Alexa is listening?  Clearly there's a threat  there.  But, you know, I think -- I think you have to be acutely aware at  all times about security today.</p><p>I've had my identity stolen and it's a really painful process.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even you, the CEO of Tech Data had his identity stolen.  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  Back in the old IRS, remember when there was the IRS hack back  a couple of years ago.  My family and I were one of those ones that got  hacked and it's been an endless process now to try to protect ourselves.</p><p>But you know, there are the services that you sign up for that protect if  there's -- if somebody tries to open a credit card account or whatever.  I  would just encourage everybody to really think aggressively about security  all the way up to my company, Tech Data -- we have a cyber security  committee on our board of directors, one of the few Fortune 100 companies  that do that because half of our business comes to us over technology  electronically.</p><p>So you know, if you talk about enterprise risks, the whole idea of cyber  security for a company like Tech Data is really important and we govern it  from the top of the company to try to be secure.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bob -- can I just ask you though because everybody was so upset  about the WikiLeaks release of whatever you want to call -- hacked CIA  tools.  But as more people go online, as our lives are increasingly  digitized and online on the Internet and the Cloud, isn't there the  expectation that the government keeps up with that technology development  in order to protect us and to hunt down terrorists which is what the CIA  was essentially doing with these tools?  There's no evidence that they were  spying on the American people.  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  You know, if you think about it one of the government's  responsibilities is try to keep us and the country safe and we built a  government over all these years that thought about wars, battles.  And now  there is a war in cyber security and the bad guys are just as smart and  just as talented as the good guys.</p><p>And so, you know, I think we are just in the very early innings of how the  cyber security war is going to play out.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Bob, I have seen your company over the years.  In 1983 you guys  went into PCs and personal computers grew from there.  A few years ago you  went into data center and you just doubled down with a major acquisition  that takes in the data centers all throughout Asia.  What is your view on  the data center and where can we see your company going from there?  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  Yes, the data center, we do the data center as kind of the off- ramp to the next great technology area and that's commonly referred to as  the third platform.  And that's areas like security, mobility, big data  analytics, hyper-converged and converged infrastructure.  It's a whole new  arena of computing.</p><p>And all of it points to the data center as the place where the intellectual  property exists to make the next generation work.  And so Tech Data made a  decision to double down in the data center.</p><p>Our organic data center business was about $8 billion a year and now we  acquired the data center business from AVNET, another $8 billion.  And so  we'd be the largest data center player in the IT channel in the world.  And  we think it takes skills and commitment and capabilities and scale to be  able to really add value in that space and we made that move this week.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are major technology companies, do they have holes?  Because  Julian Assange is saying, look I'm going to help the major technology  companies fix their vulnerabilities.  And we haven't heard from tech  companies yet in response to that.  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  No one is perfect.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So there are vulnerabilities.</p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  Yes, I think every system in the world has a vulnerability.  If  it has technology, there's a space where a smart person can get at that.   And so the engineering efforts that take place in the world's leading  technology companies are all focused on trying to close up those gaps but  they are always moving.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you reported earnings this week.  You want to characterize  real quick where the growth was?  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  The growth was in security, all around our geographies, a  rebirth of the laptops because PC companies are innovating again and new  products are really attractive.  Mobility and software around the world --  a very, very good market for Tech Data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll leave it. </p><p>Bob -- great to have you on the show today.  </p><p>DUTKOWSKY:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Bob Dutkowsky joining us -- CEO at Tech  Data.</p><p>Coming up drones are not welcome in Oklahoma, apparently.  The State  lawmaker who's proposing to allowing property owners to destroy any  trespassing drones.  That's next.</p><p>And then healthy living gets even smarter.  The gadgets you need in your  home to upgrade your daily routine.  We've got that coming up back in a  moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  Welcome back.  It's Friday morning, everybody.   I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thank you so much for being with us.  It is Friday,  March 10th on a snowy morning.  Take a look behind me.  It is official.  It  has started snowing in New York.  Yesterday it was 50 degrees.  Today we've  got a storm in front of us.  Here are your top stories 7:30 am on the East  Coast.  </p><p>We are waiting the February Jobs Report due out one hour from right now.   Economists are looking for Job Creation of 190,000 jobs to be added to the  economy last month, but the unemployment rate ticking down to 4.7 percent.   We'll get you those numbers as they get to take.  They are certainly  anticipating a good number.  After the number hitch Stuart Varney breaking  it all down with the president's top Economic Advisor, the Director of  Natural Economic Council, Gary Cohn will join Stuart and company at 10:00  am Eastern.  </p><p>So stay right here to hear from Gary Cohn on those jobs numbers.  First  off, take a look at market action, watching the price of oil this morning.   Crude is rebounding after closing it the lowest level since November.   Yesterday, it's up two-thirds of one percent this morning at 49.61.  Let's  (inaudible) the stocks across the world.  Futures pointing to gain at the  opening of trading this morning up 70 points on the Dow Jones Industrial  Average.  </p><p>We'll see what the numbers bring and if these changes.  In Europe, markets  are in the green as well.  Take a look, higher across the board in the  Eurozone industries.  Up about two-thirds of one percent across the board.   And in Asia overnight stocks mostly higher.  Shanghai composite, the one  exception, down a fraction.  Japan was strong up one and a half percent in  the Nikkei Average.  </p><p>The debate over drones why one lawmakers trying to make it legal for you to  take out a drone that flies out onto your property.  And better way to  track your families' health, the high-tech accessory that turn your  smartphone into a private physician.  We've got it all coming up with Dr.  Sizemore who's here.  Plus a slip of the tongue is leading to big bucks for  one basketball great.  </p><p>How Michael Jordan is cashing in on a (inaudible) that he made.  We'll tell  you about it.  First our top story this half hour.  One lawmaker wants to  protect homeowners from drones that fly onto their property.  A bill headed  to the OklahomaSenate floor would exempt people from civil liability if  they damage trespassing drones not regulated by the Federal Aviation  Administration.  </p><p>Joining us is Oklahoma State Senator Ralph Shortey.  State Senator Shortey,  good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>STATE SEN. RALPH SHORTEY (R), OKLAHOMA:  Good morning.  Thank you for  having me.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you authored this bill.  What is your reason behind it?   Let's talk first where you see the trouble.  </p><p>SHORTEY:  Oh, well, you know, first off, I support the industry  tremendously.  In fact, few years ago I was looking at starting a drone  service company that would do this kind of work.  So, the industry is a  thriving industry.  And I think of something that we really need to look  forward to the future.  How are you also got a balance of that private  property.  The expectation of privacy of landowners.  </p><p>And this is a bill, but I think is very balance in doing that.  There are - - there are still some changes that need to occur with it.  But for the  most part what it's going to do is where civil liability to landowners who  that damage the drone in any way that where there is a reasonable  expectation and privacy.  And right now there are two Supreme Court cases  that kind of control what airspace is and whose it is.  </p><p>That would be the Causby case from 1946 and then the Riley case from 1986.   That pretty much establishes that under the 400-foot threshold property  owners have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  The bill is written with  those wordings because as this evolves then the laws need to evolve as well  to grant enough liberty for the industry, but also protect the privacy  rights of citizens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, I don't know how (inaudible) feels about this.  But I  agree with you.  I mean, things have gotten out of hand.  You've got drones  flying.  You don't know if they have a camera on them and if they are  spying on you and they are on your property.  Having said that, the  companies like Amazon and UPS they've started testing drone deliveries.  </p><p>So, how you address that if you've got a delivery coming -- or delivery  coming next door and the drone has to fly over your house to get to the  delivery that it has to make and it has a camera.  What you do you then?</p><p>SHORTEY:  Yes.  Well, that's -- and that's where, you know, we really need  some guidance from congress on where you're going to allow this.  I mean,  the Causby case is very clear.  It's at all the way up from 326 feet and  for sure 83-foot.  The FAA has no regulatory authority up to 83-foot on any  land and 326-foot from most properties.  And so, you know, I love it.  </p><p>I do Amazon Prime all the time.  I hope and I cannot wait for the first day  that a drone delivers a package to my door.  But it's got to be done  properly.  And, you know, if you invite that drone to your property you  don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy at that point.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Right.  Well...</p><p>SHORTEY:  But for those people that would.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You've done...</p><p>SHORTEY:  And that's why (inaudible) it's become -- it's become a public  safety issue.  We've got cattle rustlers that are using this to spy on  people's land so they can steal cattle.  We've got people using drones to  smuggle drugs into prisons.  And so, it's becoming a serious issue and it's  -- and it's widespread.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, drug smuggling is -- into a prison it's clearly not legal  but what about the use of drones to survey another man's property?  There's  no -- there's no law on the books right now that would say that you can't  do that.  That, to your point?</p><p>SHORTEY:  Well, I think -- I think the Supreme Court (inaudible) are -- I  mean, they are controlling law right now.  And the Supreme Court really  specifically state that the public has no access.  The public has no right  underneath 400-foot.  That's what the FAA regulates.  And so, when you're  talking about invading somebody's private property, we know the threshold  is at least 83-foot.  If you're flying a drone over somebody's property and  it's 10-foot, 83-foot, whatever.  </p><p>Then that property owner has a right to recourse.  And this is established.   Now again, this is not given any criminal liability protection.  Simply  civil liability protections.  So that way, if a drone operator is 10-foot  in your property and you bat that thing down with a bat or a net or an RF  interrupter or some kind of technology that can bring it down because  they're spying on you then the property -- the drone operator cannot sue  you for that.  </p><p>The perfect example is Senator Inhofe.  Every year he does a pigeon hunt.   Well, last year during this pigeon hunt (inaudible) just flew a drone right  overhead of these guys that were hunting these birds and one of them shot  it down.  Well, they sent Senator Inhofe a bill for that drone.  And that  could even sue him for the -- for the damage to that drone.  And that is  ridiculous.  That is a kind of stuff I'm trying to stop.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And so -- wait.  Let me just ask you.  Is that the way you  propose homeowners take that drone down by shooting it down?  Is that what  we should do?</p><p>SHORTEY:  Well, it's going to be -- it's going to be entirely different  depending where you are.  In the rural areas I think that would be -- if  it's -- if it's -- I mean, you got to understand the shotguns, the range is  30 to 50-foot (inaudible) you are not going to be able to shoot this thing  with a rifle.  They're just too small to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You'd shot down...</p><p>SHORTEY:  But I would -- I would -- I would suggest -- I would suggest some  kind of RF interrupter or even a net.  I mean, you know, it just -- it just  depends on the situation.  But if you fail... </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What if you don't have a gun?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  This is a feel-good bill of the decade.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What if you don't have a shotgun?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's from Oklahoma.  Everybody's got a gun in Oklahoma.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But I'm in New York and there are drones flying all over  near my house.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, nobody -- yes, nobody owns.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think this is the feel-good bill of the decade.  I  think it's fantastic.  And I think -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- Orkin and say, \"Here's a new kind of pest control.\"   Bring in Orkin, get the Orkin man, he'll take it out.  That's the way to  get rid of them.  I think there are a lot of frequency things you can do  without using a shotgun.  Although that might be fun.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, senator, one quick question.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SHORTEY:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It sounds as if we -- in addition to what you're trying  to do.  We really need a broader guideline on how drones appropriate, how  they're not appropriate and to try to regulate this because it can get a  little scary.  Do you have a big picture view of what we're going to be  doing, you know, over the next 10 years to make sure these things they'll  get out of control?</p><p>SHORTEY:  Yes, absolutely.  Congress has to act.  And, you know, right now  they gave the FAA the authority to regulate these things.  The regulations  came out this summer and they were not good enough.  They do not -- they do  not protect private property well enough.  And (inaudible) the job of FAA  too to protect private -- I mean, that's not -- their job is to regulate.  </p><p>Their job is not to create law.  Congress really needs to step in.  We're  going to have to set up some kind of a -- some kind of a commerce system  where, you know, you're going to protect private property interest to a  certain height and then there's going to have to be an area where these  things can fly that is regulated or that is authorized by congress so that  way they are not interfering with commercial traffic and they're also  protecting the private interest in the privacy interest of folks.  </p><p>We've got to do this.  This bill is simply right now (inaudible) call the  Aeronautics Commission a few weeks ago.  And there was a drone in her  backyard with flashing light, so she had no idea what to do with it.  Had  she taken some kind of action against that thing?  Then the drone operator  could have sued her.  This is simply a placeholder until congress fixes  this issue and figures out what to do with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the bottom line, State Senator, you think drones should be  regulated?</p><p>SHORTEY:  Absolutely.  And I think they're necessary.  I mean, I think it's  -- I think it's a great industry and I -- and I will support it.  But  absolutely got to be regulated.  And, you know, the interest the -- you  know, the government's interest is to protect the citizen first.  To  advance then the industry is second and then when there is conflict their  job is to come in and balance that conflict out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SHORTEY:  And that's what we need -- that's what we need the government to  do right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Senator, good to have you  on the program today.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>SHORTEY:  Thank you very much.  You have a good day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  State Senator Ralph Shortey joining us there from Oklahoma.  I  want to see what the Trump administration has to say about regulating the  drone industry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This got to have to happen.  And by the way, there's a  lot of (inaudible) in cellular and other kinds of businesses where you have  to regulate.  Otherwise, people are going to be crossing over your line.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What are conservatives going to say about that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to point one thing out.  Amazon if they start drone  delivery.  They'll just make you sign a waiver.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No question about it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When you order.  If that's how they get around it. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, I'm on the board of the (inaudible) and one  of the things they're trying to do is defense plays a role here too.  And  this has to be orchestrated in some way because you have (inaudible)  flying, there are drones right near the airport.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That makes no sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you got to have to have your shotgun ready that's for sure.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  (inaudible)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  A doctor at your fingertips.  The devices that you  need to have to upgrade your lifestyle straight ahead.  And then markets  eyeing the February Jobs Report, we'll bring you the numbers and the  analysis in the next hour.  Stay with us.  Big day ahead with markets and  the jobs number coming out.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  From what you eat to what you breed it is  important to put good things into your body and with modern technology it's  easier than ever to track your health between doctor visits.  Oh, not only  for you but your children as well.  You can monitor results straight from  your phone.  </p><p>It's amazing what you can do today.  Joining me once again for part two of  our special series.  (inaudible) certified Cardiologist Preventive Health  Expert, Dr. Tiffany Sizemore.  Good to see you.  Thank you so much for  joining us.</p><p>DR. TIFFANY SIZEMORE, CARDIOLOGIST PREVENTIVE HEALTH EXPERT:  Hi.  Thanks  for having me again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dr. Tiffany.  All right.  So we have some things.  I know  you're not associated with any of these companies.  </p><p>SIZEMORE:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That make these products.  But let first begin with the  thermometer.  This is a different thermometer then you showed us yesterday.   You also got the ear thermometer.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  So, yesterday was the temporal kind of scan (inaudible) through  the forehead.  This is a typical what a lot of parents are used to.  Just a  regular ear thermometer.  What's nice about it, it's just a one button push  and it also links to an app as well.  This is a Philips as well.  So, when  you take your child to the pediatrician then the pediatrician has a record  of all of the different temperatures.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  So, it's very straightforward.  It is a lot more expensive than  the one -- excuse me, inexpensive than the one we have on yesterday.  It's  a very good option.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Now, a lot of adults are interested in monitoring  their blood pressure.  There's a smart option for that as well so far.  </p><p>SIZEMORE:  Yes.  And as a cardiologist, these are very important to me.   So, again, we have a Withings blood pressure cuff and a Philips blood  pressure cuff.  Again, as with the other products that we had yesterday  they all link to an app.  So, the Withings are all link to the Withings  app, and the Philips all link to the Philips' app.  What's nice about this  is how small they are.  So, you can actually to put this in a tote if  you're a female and you could take it with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's easy to do.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Super easy to do.  I mean, I'll do it if you want me to.  But  you basically just put it on and hit a button.  And then with the Withings,  automatically launches the app and the app spits out your blood pressure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let me -- let me ask you about improving sleep.  We  all need that here.  This is something that improves your sleep?  </p><p>SIZEMORE:  Well, this actually monitors.  Basically everything that's going  on -- well, not just everything, in your bedroom.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SIZEMORE:  So -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Almost everything.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Yes.  Almost everything.  I mean, mostly your activity but --  so, basically what's cool about this, it sleeps -- it sleeps underneath the  sheet.  So, you can imagine if it just goes underneath the tablecloth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Underneath the sheet and it's got a very long extension cord  where it plugs -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Under the sheet?</p><p>SIZEMORE:  -- into the wall.  Yes.  So, you don't have to touch anything.   As soon as you lay on the bed it starts monitoring.  It goes directly to an  app.  It tells the temperature, the humidity in the room, what your  respirations were at night, what your heart rate was at night.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it'll tell you when you're having real Z's like a good  night -- </p><p>SIZEMORE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- sleep versus getting up a lot?</p><p>SIZEMORE:  And it also links to an app.  And so, it can tell what kind of  level of sleep you're in and when is most appropriate for you to wake up so  you're not alarmed.  So, it has the smart alarm set to it as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very interesting.  All right.  That's about $140 there.  Tell  us about the air monitoring devices.  Why do we need air monitoring?</p><p>SIZEMORE:  You know, I think this is great for people with children maybe  if they have animals or people that have allergies that are concerned about  the allergens in the air.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, for school.  Yes, yes, that's right.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  So, this is -- basically it's the same exact product but one is  made out of wood and one has a silicon rubber.  So, this is great for  nurseries because it's -- it has rounded corners.  It's not very hard.  And  I'm not sure if it'll show up here.  But basically it analyzes the air and  spits out the number in the app from zero to one hundred.  </p><p>One hundred being wonderful air quality, zero being not so great.  That app  then then tells you why your air quality is not good and then gives you  advice as to what to do to improve the air quality.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because there could be particles in the air and that will  -- </p><p>SIZEMORE:  Right.  And then carbon dioxide -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  -- dust, chemicals.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, that's really important.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  It's great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Then you've got a smart kitchen scale here.  We saw  the scales that we had yesterday.  That's an -- </p><p>SIZEMORE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- an actual scale.  This is the kitchen scale.  </p><p>SIZEMORE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's that all about?</p><p>SIZEMORE:  This is actually it's great because it's very lightweight.  It  weighs basically nothing.  So, it's easy to get around in your kitchen.  It  weighs solids and liquids.  And if you can see.  I'm not sure if -- I'll do  it here.  But -- I don't know if they hit the zero.  But anyway -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how much it weighs?</p><p>SIZEMORE:  It shows you how much it weighs.  It's very accurate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, why do I need that?</p><p>SIZEMORE:  This is also great too.  It's also has an app and you can -- it  tells you based upon what you're putting on the scale it tells you calorie.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes (inaudible) </p><p>SIZEMORE:  It tells you carbohydrate, it tells you if you're trying to  watch your sodium intake.  So, it's really -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  -- good for people who do have some cardiovascular issues that  have to watch certain sodium intake.  It's also good for people who are  really trying to watch what they're eating in terms of carbohydrate to lose  weight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredibly informant.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Yes, it's awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we do need that.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  I don't cook so I'll never use it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tracking workout.  There's a lot of things to track your  workout today, right?  But this is -- it can record distance traveled and  how many push-ups you did?</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Yes.  So, this is really great for people who don't really want  to wear a smart watch.  They're not into being, you know, having every  single step they take monitor.  This is actually a chest trap and you use  it only when you're actually exercising.  </p><p>And it is probably the most accurate because it is right by the heart and  it's excellent at measuring exactly what your pulses, how many push-ups  you're doing.  So, in terms of accuracy it's probably the best.  But it's  not something you're going to wear every day.  It's only something that you  wear when you exercise.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it just really monitoring your heart rate?</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  OK, good stuff.  Dr. Tiffany great to see you.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for going through all of this.</p><p>SIZEMORE:  Absolutely.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, this is great.  Tiffany Sizemore joining us there.   Take a short break.  When we come back, Michael Jordan's slip of the tongue  is now paying off big time.  How he's cashing in on the mistake he made.   And then catch my interview with Tony Robbins on Wall Street Week this  weekend.  We talk everything from his business empire to his investing  tips.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A wild first day of free agency in the NFL.   Jared Max joins us now with the whole story.  Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FBN SPORTSCASTER:  Happy Friday, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And to you.</p><p>MAX:  When players have the power to break their own new stories on social  media it can lead to confusion.  Like we have at this very moment.  Around  4:00 am Eastern Time less than four hours ago.  The verified Instagram  account of Patriots backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo posted this, \"So  grateful for my time in New England.  Peace out Boston.\"  </p><p>What's worse is that the top NFL insiders believe this was a prank or a  hoax that Garoppolo's account was hacked.  NFL.com's Ian Rapoport tweeted  this morning, \"Spoke to someone in the grandma point --dash mike the  verified instagram report.  They believe it was a prank or hoax.  They  tweeted this morning.  </p><p>Spoke to someone close to Garoppolo who had no knowledge of any trade and  believes it's a hack.  And WBZ in Boston says, \"The Patriots spokesman  saying the team is not aware of Garoppolo leaving.  Stay tuned.\"  One  Instagram post from an NFL quarterback we can verify as genuine.  This  video posted yesterday by soon-to-be ex-Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony  Romo.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TONY ROOM, QUARTERBACK, DALLAS COWBOYS:  Me and my family felt the  outpouring support and love from all of you.  It's been overwhelming.  And,  you know, it doesn't go unnoticed.  So, I want to say thank you and we have  a lot to think about going forward but we'll see what happens.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  For the times they aren't changing.  You catch that plane at the  background?  Romo was not released by the Cowboys as wildly reported  yesterday.  He could get traded now.  Perhaps to the Houston Texans.  One  year since they snagged quarterback Brock Osweiler from Denver Broncos for  the $72 million dollar contract.  Texans traded Brock Osweiler yesterday to  the Cleveland Browns.  </p><p>Houston frees up to $10 million and salary cap space perhaps for Tony Romo.   And they get a fourth round draft pick this year.  Second and six rounders  in next year.  But Osweiler reportedly could be traded baked to be flipped  in another deal.  Browns have said to be interested in Jimmy Garoppolo.  A  federal lawsuit was filed yesterday against the NFL.  Over 1,800 former  players are suing the league they claim that medical staffs on team's  pumped up players with powerful pain medications an anti-inflammatories to  keep the players on the field.  </p><p>The sue claims that teams pressure the medical staffs to inject the players  with the pain killers to keep them in playing condition.  And anybody  turned on the TV yesterday and wondered why Michigan basketball players  were wearing their practice jerseys against Illinois?  Well, because the  FAA and the NTSB are investigating why the Wolverines' charter flight had  skidded 400 yards approximately off the runway, Wednesday.  </p><p>Well, the team does not have access to its luggage.  It's under  investigation part of it.  So, this contains the Wolverines' uniforms home  in a way along with shoes and warm-ups.  So, they had to wear the jerseys,  the practice jerseys yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Huh?</p><p>MAX:  And they'll continue to do it because the stuff is -- they can't get  to it.  It's under investigation.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, what about this thing in the NFL with the pumping  them up with pain killers?  I mean, anybody who read North Dallas Forty,  you know, this has been going on for 50 years, 40 years, forever and ever.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.  And, you know, and this is -- there's another argument against  this which is been going on and tied with other stuff with medical  marijuana where they are trying to -- players, ex-players, current players  saying this is what they want for treatment.  And the NFL not going in that  direction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I tell you, this is a big cost to pay.  To -- and that's what  Jason Herston told us yesterday.  And when I said to him, \"Would you go  into the NFL today?\"  He was like, \"It's a big cost to pay.\"  But I want to  ask you about this rebound.  NBA legend Michael Jordan turning a simple  slip up into big money.  During the Duke-North Carolina basketball game on  Saturday, the Tar Heel alum accidentally said the ceiling is the roof  instead of the sky's the limit.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ceiling is the roof.  And so now he's embracing the phrase  reportedly (inaudible) to sell the shirt that says \"Ceiling.  Roof.  Goat.\"   Which it stands for greatest of all time.  Oh, that's funny.</p><p>MAX:  Imagine it was a brilliant marketing plug by Michael Jordan for his  brand.  Screw up really badly.  Make itself deprecating and then sell the  shirt.  It's like the baseball cards, the misprints for the most popular  ones always.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he's going to make good money on it, huh?</p><p>MAX:  Yes, good money.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Note to the kiddies, when you screw up just own it. </p><p>MAX:  Own it.  Own it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he is.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's owning it all right.  And he's owning it all the way to  the bank.  Jared, thank you.  We'll be right back.

Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thank you so much for joining us.  It is  Friday, March 10th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 on the East Coast.  It is Jobs Day, we are 30 minutes  away from February Jobs report.  Economists are looking for 190,000 jobs that have added to the  economy.  Peter Kiernan says it's going to be --</p><p>PETER KIERNAN, FORMER GOLDMAN SACHS PARTNER:  A blowout.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A blowout.  The unemployment rate expected to take down to 4.7 percent.  If we get a big  number, it's going to impact the markets and obviously we're expecting interest rate hike next week on the  15th.  The numbers as soon as they hit the tape on to you.  The growing debate over healthcare in  America meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan trying is to explain why the current plan should be passed  but not all republicans are onboard yet.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL RYAN, SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  This is the  closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare.  The time is here, the time is now, it really  comes down to a binary choice, we now have the ability through the budget rules that we have in the  senate with our three-pronged approach to actually make good on our word.  </p><p>JIM JORDAN, UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE FOR OHIO:  God bless the speaker but that's not  how the legislative process works, right?

All those stories coming up this  morning.  And joining to talk all about it, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, Barron's Interim  Editor Jack Otter, and the editor online, New York Times best-selling author Peter Kiernan.  Great to see  you.</p><p>KIERNAN:  Great to see you too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations.  Got a promotion.</p><p>JACK OTTER, BARRON'S INTERIM EDITOR:  I appreciate.  Thanks very much, Maria.  We have to  make Barron's even better.  </p><p>MARQUEZ:  Yes.  We're going to keep watching that and we will show you the cover of Barron's coming  up in the hour.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  But first, jobs -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jobs, jobs, jobs.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's our number one priority and we are looking at it, we got the numbers coming  out in 30 minutes, so stay with us on that.  Meanwhile, Capitol Hill this morning is buzzing as well.   Republicans are moving forward with the replacement of Obamacare, despite mounting skepticism for the  bill.  Blake Burman live at White House right now with very latest.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Maria.  Good morning to you.  And a senior administration official is telling Fox this morning that this is  President Trump in his element at the moment.  We are told that the president is currently in deal making  mode as it relates to the American healthcare act, that senior administration official saying the president  is listening to the numbers, all of the numbers here weighing all of his options.</p><p>They remain very confident here at the White House that this thing will eventually get passed.  Take a  listen to the Vice President Mike Pence.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are very confident because of  President Trump's leadership and support here in the congress.  I'm very confident we'll repeal and  replace Obamacare and that will all be done by this spring.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  The sales pitch though is very much under way, for example, Paul Ryan yesterday, the house  speaker was up on the Hill, literally with his jacket off, his shirt rolled up as he gave a PowerPoint  presentation, trying to pitch this plan one in which he describes a binary choice essentially take it or leave  it repeal and replace Obamacare going forward.  However, there are many conservative skeptics here, one  of them being Rand Paul who rejected that binary choice label and said last night that the bill as it stands  is currently dead on arrival.  </p><p>RAND PAUL, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY:  The speaker needs to like  bring people into the room, conservatives and hear what we want, we are withholding our vote.  This is a  message for the speaker, we are withholding our vote, we want a seat at the table and it's not a binary  choice.</p><p>BURMAN:  Back in what that senior administration official is telling Fox this morning, Maria, we are  told Mick Mulvaney, the head of OMB is working 20-hour days at this point listening to the opposition,  taking in ideas trying to make that work and -- this work and as a senior administration official says,  nothing is locked in stone at this morning, that person tells us that everyone will get either something they  love, but there will be things that they love and things that they love less.  That is how it was phrased to  us, Maria.  Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The got to get onboard together with the things that they love and hopefully come out  with a bill that they're all behind and the budget of course going to be release next week, Mick Mulvaney  working on that and that's on Wednesday.  Blake, good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>BURMAN:  Bye. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great reporting as always from Blake Burman at the White House.  Well, first  Obamacare, then tax reform, senator majority leader Mitch McConnell now suggesting that the White  House is August decline for reform may be unrealistic.  The Trump administration still sticking to the  timeline.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MITCH MCCONNELL, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY:  I think finishing  on tax reform will take longer.</p><p>SPICER:  The president's uniquely qualified as a businessman, a successful businessman to understand  the -- what a good business climate does to job creation.  For him this is deeply personal and I think that  you're going to see Secretary Mnuchin and others work on the contours of that in the next several weeks  but we intend to maintain to the schedule that he laid out.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, Senior Strategist BGC Partners, Fox News About Contributor Steve  Cortes.  I don't know, Steve.  Good morning to you.  I don't -- </p><p>STEVE CORTES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm feeling like the administration and now Mitch McConnell are trying to manage  expectations.  Take the expectations down in terms of tax reform, this market up 14 percent since Election  Day, if we don't see tax reform by august, what happens? </p><p>CORTES:  If we don't see it by august, I think we're going to see a serious correction not just in the  market but in the real economy and that's why it just simply can't happen and I don't want to hear  naysaying from somebody like Mitch McConnell, you know, you were just talking about NFL free agency,  well, the American voter, gave the republicans the ball on the one-yard line first and goal by giving us  both houses of congress and the Oval Office and they are demanding as they should, they're demanding  outcomes that they voted for, including a repeal and replace and including tax reform.</p><p>So I believe the president is going to be successful, our deal maker in chief, he is really on a charm  offensive, he's having lunches and dinners and bowling, he's the charmer in chief lately too, he's going to  twist arms, he's going to persuade people, we're going to get this done on the White House this timeline  and we have to for the people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we'll see it, Dagen, I mean, he's going to through to sell that Obamacare plan  this weekend, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Or whatever you want to call it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In Kentucky.  You're going to Kentucky.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Exactly.  Where -- by the way, you won six more counties than Rand Paul who's  opposed to GOP plan coming out of the house.  But Steve, I want to bring this, it's not a complete repeal  which is what some conservatives have a problem with.  That it still requires government handouts for  people to buy insurance whether you -- so they're not called subsidies, they're called tax credits but  refundable tax credits, that it's still -- you've got all the senators and governors who accepted this giant  Medicaid expansion, fussing about that going away in 2020 and the conservatives want it gone even  sooner than that.  So how do you bring those two sides together? </p><p>CORTES:  Right.  No.  And Dagen, look, you make great points, I tend to lean pretty libertarian, so this is  an imperfect bill to be sure but I don't think we should make the perfect the enemy of the good.  And what  we are trying do -- what the administration is trying to do here I think is satisfy both house conservatives  among republicans and then senate liberals among republicans, and so to thread that needle is incredibly  difficult but I think this bill does and by the way, one thing I will push back at, a tax credit is not a  subsidy.  When you pay money to the government and get some it back, that is not a subsidy.  It is for  people who don't pay taxes.  But it is --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If it's refundable and in this bill, it's refundable, now a small percentage of people will get  it but when you don't pay taxes and you get money back through a tax credit, that's a handout, that's a  subsidy.</p><p>CORTES:  Right.  For those people but for most of us who pay taxes, it's not a subsidy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to leave there but I know you're sticking with us for our Jobs in  America Special this hour, Steve.  Thank you.  Stay right there.  </p><p>CORTES:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still ahead.  Could we see soon see a seismic shift for Catholics, why Pope Francis says  the church may no longer be married to one longstanding tradition.  </p><p>Then we are less than 20 minutes away from the first full jobs report for the month of Trump's presidency.   We're breaking down what you need to know about jobs, markets off of the highs right now going into the  number.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Pope Francis signaling that he is open to married men becoming priests.   Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  So this big news in the catholic  community, Maria.  In an interview with German newspaper, Pope Francis says the church must study  whether it's possible ordain married men to become catholic priests as the church is facing a shortage of  them in remote communities.  The pope says the option would allow men who are already married to be  ordained but single men who already are priests would not be allowed to marry after the fact.  We will  keep you posted.</p><p>And other headlines this morning.  Hip hop has made it to the house of representatives.  Brooklyn  Congressman Hakeem Jeffries paid tribute to the late rapper Biggie Smalls also known, I was just told as  Notorious B.I.G.  because the whole crew has been on me about this.  He was killed 20 years ago  yesterday, well, Jeffries recited the lyrics to the 1994 song Juicy, listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAKEEM JEFFRIES, UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE FOR NEW YORK:  It was all a dream, I  used to read Word Up! Magazine, salt-n-pepa and heavy D up in the limousine, hanging pictures on my  wall, every Saturday rap attack, Mr.  Magic, Marley Marl.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, Biggie Smalls rose in streets of New York to be one of the successful rap  artist in history.  He was killed in drive-by shooting in Los Angeles back in 1997.  And finally, for your  Game of Thrones fans, we now know that season seven of the hit series is going to start on July 16.  Mark  your calendars, HBO making the announcement during a 15-minute long segment on Facebook live.  And  a very cool twist of marketing guys, the news was hidden in a giant block of ice and then viewers had to  comment fire to melt the ice.  Games of Thrones also releasing an official teaser that included \"from past  seasons.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>EMILIA CLARKE, DAENERYS TARGARYEN IN THE HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES:  I know  what my father was, what he did.  I know the Mad King earned his name</p><p>DAVID RINTOUL, KING AERYS II TARGARYEN IN THE HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES:   Burn them all.  </p><p>MARK ADDY, ROBERT BARATHEON IN THE HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES:  Kill ever  Targaryen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  And for all the drama, the video actually had a few stops and starts of the ice gimmick by the  way, it lasted longer than an average episode of Game of Thrones which we hear, Maria.  Pretty long.   Anyway, people are obsessed with the show.  I'm very excited about this whole thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everybody really is, you're right.  Cheryl, thank you.  Up next, the February Jobs report  moments away.  What you need to know ahead of the release.  What it will mean for markets and your  opportunities.  Stay with us.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are just under 10 minutes away from February Jobs report.  Here is  what we're expecting.  Economists are looking for 190,000 jobs added to economy in the last month in  February with the unemployment rate ticking down to 4.7 percent.  We want to bring in our all-stars right  now, the founder of capitalistpig.com, Jonathan Hoenig is with us, the host of Making Money With  Charles Payne, Charles Payne with us, and, of course, Steve Cortes is also with us along with our great  panel here, Charles good to see you.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, MAKING MONEY WITH CHARLES PAYNE HOST:  You too.  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good job, Charles.  You want to do any rapping before we start?</p><p>PAYNE:  I think I get it out of my system.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He was rapping, he just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give us one.  </p><p>PAYNE:  We got to do it?  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Go.</p><p>PAYNE:  It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! Magazine, salt-n-pepa and heavy D up in the  limousine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Thank you for that.  Now --</p><p>PAYNE:  No, really.  That was -- that was a very uplifting song.  The guy was really happy that he made  it out of the hood and he took his friends with him.  That's a beautiful thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Awesome.  Tell us about jobs now, Charles.  </p><p>PAYNE:  I think a lot of people going to make it out of the hood in February according to jobs report -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think it's going to be a blowout?</p><p>PAYNE:  Let me tell you guys.  I think we under reported that ADP report and I know that ADP is not  BLS, Bureau of Labor Statistics but the goods producing part of that, the headline hogged everything,  298,000, that wasn't the story.  106 goods producing jobs is the highest number ever for ADP report going  back to 2002.  That's the highest they've ever seen.  66,000 constructing jobs, over 8,000 money jobs,  money jobs pay $28 an hour, these are good paying jobs and by the way, this is the epicenter of the  financial crisis, the great recession, hit these people harder than anything else.  How did Donald Trump  win Pennsylvania, how did he win Wisconsin?  Was these folks didn't have a job, it felt like everyone  ignored their pleas and now a lot of them are getting jobs now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  So money is finally breaking out.</p><p>PAYNE:  Money had a good number.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's one area we're going to watch with this -- with this jobs report.  Let me quickly get  your take on snap because it went public over a week ago, it was obviously a rocky debut although going  into it, it was priced 17, Peter, it opened to 24.  You said sell it when?  </p><p>KIERNAN:  I sold it 25 on air on Fox Business News.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nice.  Sweet.</p><p>KIERNAN:  The reason was if you look at 8 of the last 10 big tech IPOs, they all in one year traded below  the IPO price.  So people are watching, do not chase these deals, do not, they will always --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can I sell it here if I own it at 22.71?</p><p>KIERNAN:  You know, I'm not in love with this company right now, I think it is priced at about 35  billion market cap, something like that, 30 billion.</p><p>PAYNE:  Just to piggyback on that, the top 20 if you go back in the last several years, peak at 38 days on  average and then go down for four months straight.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>PAYNE:  That's the stat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So that was the trend?</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jack Otter, Barron's called it, you said to sell it, you told leaders.  </p><p>OTTER:  Barron's was negative on it, I mean, it was 93 times sales.  Even if this year optimistic sales  reach a billion dollars, that's still 34 times sales, it's just you the too expensive.  And I always hate to bet  against the technology company that's young, that's exciting, 158 million excited users including my 13- year-old daughter who loves it, but you got to wonder if Snap can really go in direction of Facebook which  has such huge broad base, Twitter might be a better comparison, you know, we all use Twitter but didn't  catch on the way that some other social media companies do and we're coming out with a story tomorrow  where we say maybe GoPro is actually the better example and that is not been a good stock.  I actually left  my GoPro.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're comparing -- you're comparing Snap to GoPro.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's check out cover of Barron's.  Let's reveal.  Give us big reveal for the cover this  weekend because you got a story in the ETFs.</p><p>OTTER:  Yes.  We got some of the smartest people in ETFland.  In fact, three of those people control 80  percent of the assets on the management in the ETFland, so we're asking them what's next?  It's a very  interesting financial device.  I mean, it gets kind of geek, so, Dagen will love it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was the first financial reporter to cover ETF 20 years ago.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  It's been 20 years, huh?  </p><p>OTTER:  Nearly 20 years old.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Exactly.  </p><p>OTTER:  But for instance -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was our first words.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>OTTER:  In a big day in the market, people are buying ETFs all day.  Well, toward the end -- towards  4:00 then the market needs to start adjusting for all those buys, so people start loading, they have to -- they  have to rebalance, so they start loading up on stocks on a bad day it goes the other way.  So it really  changes the dynamics of the market and that's going to be a story going forward.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jump in here.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Yes.  I think ETFs are going to be worth watching because in market interruptions, they do  not perform -- excuse me, anywhere like stocks because there isn't sort of dynamic market making  underneath.  And I think this is one is the -- I think Achilles heels of the ETF.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The big story Barron's this weekend that we'll be watching.  We got the February Jobs  report right after break.  We're not going to miss it, we got all details next.  Back in a moment.  Stay with  us, markets rallying going into that jobs report.</p><p>JONATHAN NOVACK , TENNIS CHANNEL'S COURT REPORT HOST:  Hey guys.  Tennis Channel  Jonathan Novack with another special court report for Fox Business.  The temperatures hit the 80s in  Coachella Valley on day two of the 2017 BNP Paribas Open.  And Thursday I saw one young American  move on to second round for th3e biggest win of his career so far.  </p><p>Bjorn Fratangelo is a former junior champion at Roland Garros, and he's 23-year-old showed his class as  he dispatched Bernard Tomic in straight sets.  Fratangelo closing out the victory just over an hour,  Bernard Tomic's fourth opening round loss since the Aussie Open.  </p><p>Lauren Davis started the year by lifting the trophy in Auckland and she continued that kind of form with  an excellent comeback against Victoria Golubic.  Up next, Anastasija Sevastova.  And don't forget, PC  Plus in tennis channel live coverage from Indian Wells, continues Friday 1:00 pm Eastern.  I'm Jonathan  Novack.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday everybody.  Thank you so much joining us.  It is Friday,  March 10th.  Breaking news, we are moments away from February Jobs report, here is what we are  looking for.  Economists looking for 190,000 jobs to have been added to the economy in the month of  February.  The unemployment rate expected to tick down to 4.7 percent.  Markets are rallying going into  the report, it's just two minutes away.  Take a look where markets are, now at highs of the morning, up 76  points on the Dow Jones Industrial average.  Jonathan Hoenig is with us this morning.  Give us your  thoughts ahead of this number.  We all spoke with the panel already and people are looking for a very  strong number.  What about you? </p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOUNDER OF CAPITALISTPIG.COM:  Yes.  I think you'll see a beat, Maria,  you saw in the ADP number yesterday but ironically a beat for jobs will be a bad thing for the economy,  you know, jobs come less, we talked for eight years about where are jobs, the jobs are finally here, I think  you see --- buy rumor, sell the fact and a good jobs number actually precipitates a decline and a correction  for stocks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know about that, Dagen.  Yesterday you made such an important point because  you said, look if we get a good jobs number, that's a vote of confidence, things are getting better.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  And watch the government jobs because remember Donald Trump when he  became president froze federal hiring in late January, this is the first time that's going to show up in this  report.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  They'll be down.  They've been down but I always still disagree with Jonathan in the sense  that, you know, let's get it going, you know, 300, 400, 500,000 jobs, you know, I think good is a relative  term these days and a stronger than expected number is still not kind of good jobs number I think that will  be counterintuitive to the market or the economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I used to do this a minute before number but you put a three handle on it.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KIERNAN:  I think we're going to have a good show and I don't it's going to take the market down.  I  really think that what we're beginning to see is a second leg, we have the Trump rally and now we have  the proof in the pudding part of the rally and if we get good jobs, I think we're going to see the market  continue to grow here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Guys, we're all talking about jobs, what about wages, OK?  Steve Cortes, do you think  we're going to see any movement up 2.8 percent?  It's what people are looking for year over year wages.  </p><p>CORTES:  I do.  Maria, wages are finally moving.  I gave up pessimism for lent, so I'm going to tell you  that we're going to have a blowout number.  I think 300 is possible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You do, so you are with Peter as well -- as well say that.  And then there's the  participation rate guys, real quick.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was up 2/10 of a percent, in January at 52.9, let's hope it goes up.  </p><p>CORTES:  Indeed.  I want to see wages go up because if we get enough -- people hired eventually they're  going to have to start paying them more unless participation -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  The number is on top.  It's going to be out in a moment.  Let's get to Peter  Barnes, he's at the Labor Department right now with the news.  Peter Barnes, over to you.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:   235,000 new non-foreign payroll jobs in February, Maria.  235,000 new payroll jobs last month.  The first  full month of the Trump administration and above analysts' expectations.  The unemployment rate ticking  down to 4.7 percent from 4.8, as more than 300,000 people returned to the labor force last month.  And  that sent the labor force participation rate, up to 63 percent, the highest level in a year.  Hourly wages rose  by 0.2 percent last month, to $26.09 an hour.  Year over year, wages are up 2.8 percent.</p><p>Construction had a great month last month, up 58,000 jobs, the biggest monthly increase since March  2007.  But likely due in part to the warm weather we've been having around the country, manufacturing  jumped 28,000 jobs.  But retail down, 26,000, likely post-holiday cuts.  Education and health, up 62,000.   Business and professional services, plus 27.  Leisure and hospitality, plus 26.  And government, added  8,000 jobs mostly at the local level.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Peter, thank you.  We're seeing the markets react positively.  It is better than  expected, but we - is it fair to say it was better than expected but that was expected?  Peter, what do you  think?  </p><p>PETER KIERNAN, GOLDMAN SACHS FORMER PARTNER:  I think it was one of those in line, I  think where you're going to see nice fallout is.  This really clears any underbrush away from a rate hike  next week, that's going to happen.  And when that happens, I think you're going to see a very nice move  in the financials.  They've moved very nicely so far, but this - if particularly, if the fed wants to do four  rate hikes this year, which they could potentially do.  That could put billions of dollars of earnings into  banks.  </p><p>JACK OTTER, BARRONS.COM EDITOR:  We all groan when the number came out because we were  really expecting them to over deliver -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I didn't.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I did not groan. </p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  You said 2:30?  You won the bed,  by the way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you did. </p><p>OTTER:  Good solid number, it's only bad if you are judging by ADP.  And you think, oh my gosh!  We're  going to have some incredible - but this is a solid number and, you know, I know Charles wants to see as  4, 500.  But we are albeit a very slow, this point of recovery, we are eight years into recovery.  So -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE:  That's the number that I think would - that will prove Jonathan's theory.  In other words, 235  beats the estimates but this is not the kind of counterintuitive number that would point to some kind of,  end of the - you know, the business cycle, traditionally has been blown out of whack.  This is, you know,  from all of different things that have done it's not what it used to be.  You can go ahead, Jonathan.  </p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALIST PIG HEDGE FUND FOUNDING MEMBER:  Well, in terms of  number, it's outstanding.  I'm happy to see that as you said, it's been a long time coming upwards of eight  years.  And the fact that this has gone under Donald Trump's first month in office, is also a bull shine.   But look at the underpinnings of the market, more new lows, than new highs yesterday.  And bonds just  across the board, you can then take it out to woodshed.  I think despite the fact the numbers are good,  some of the dynamic underpinnings of the stocks themselves give reason - one reason for some worry at  this point.  </p><p>OTTER:  Yes, I would add to that, Jonathan, the - I mean, excuse me, the small-cap stocks rise into  thousand and is down about 3.8 percent, copper is down.  So, not everything is bullish out there.  I mean,  as we all look at the recent performance of the S&amp;P 500 which has been great.  But there are a few signs,  that maybe we're getting a little too blurb.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about mining, Charles?  Do we know, in terms of - </p><p>PAYNE:  I didn't see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I didn't hear Peter discussed mining.  </p><p>PAYNE:  We've got construction and manufacturing but, those are two numbers though that were almost  identical to ADP, right.  66,000 ADP, 58,000 construction.  Yes, I know it was warmer, but we've had  warm patches over the last several years that haven't created this kind of construction.  And we need them  for a couple reasons, think about dearth of homes - the man is out there.  Month supply is at so - it's such  a low point.  If we get that going again - they're all connected.  I think this is a phenomenal number.  I  love the idea that 300,000 people came back to the workforce.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He thanked you.  Thank you.  Can get a halleluiah?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Participation is the most important thing.  The unemployment rate fell, despite the fact  that 300,000 people started looking for work.  That means that they found work.  That they came back.  A  highest labor participation rate in a year.</p><p>PAYNE:  And we need people to believe.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because that's, that's the optimistic sign.  Can go out there and get a job?  Yes, you can.   Amen.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Well, one of the things that's also happening is we're a long away from the peak labor  participation rate of 67 percent.  But were trending upward, and that is a very important number.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  63 percent participation rate.  Steve Cortes, go ahead.  </p><p>STEVE CORTES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  And Maria, listen, I think that is by far the most  important news this morning - this participation rate.  And I'm so glad that they're also connected to  construction and mining.  Those are businesses which tends to be dominating - the workers are mostly  male.  If you look at workforce participation, it's been trending down for everybody which is a terrible  thing for men, under the Obama administration it hit a recorded low.  </p><p>So, that is great news, that construction and mining are coming back, to life.  It's huge for men, it's huge  for our economy.  So, to get the participation rate up, and still keep jobless rate down, that is just a  massive win for the economy.  So, I know we have some naysayers on the panel, I think the stock market's  going to go manically higher.  I think growth going to accelerate in a really material way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Charles, look at these wages numbers, the brisk clip of hiring was accompanied by  steady wage growth.  Hourly earnings rising six cents, that's 2/10th of a percent.  You want more,  obviously, but it's in the right direction.  2.8 percent, year over year.</p><p>PAYNE:  It's in the right direction.  And also, the skills aspect of this, you know, earlier in the week  LinkedIn did their workforce report.  And they talked about the skills gap, and we talk about it always  associated with technology.  But oil-well drillers and people who can, you know, work on construction  projects.  When we started to get all of those things filled in, but what do you need?  I think these numbers  will even take off even more than they have already.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  I like to pick up on that point, because there are a lot of people who are focused on the retail  piece of equation, and there are a lot of jobs that are being lost in retail.  JC Penney, alone says they're  going to lay off 5500 people, but there's a balance to that.  And that is, that people like Amazon are  saying, this year we're going to create 100,000 new jobs.  So, what happens is, yes, so as retail jobs are  disappearing, but they're showing up somewhere else in the economic pile.  And that's good news.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, how about construction?  Jonathan Hoenig, go ahead.  Jump in, Jonathan. </p><p>HOENIG:  It's - it's buy the rumor, and sell fact.  You know, for eight years, people say, well the stock  market's going up but I don't know, we don't have jobs yet.  We don't have jobs yet.  Look, now we've got  jobs job.  The job numbers great.  I'm applauding that.  I'm just wondering if perhaps now the market has  gotten a little bit ahead of itself in that sense.  Our guest mentioned the - some of the retailers are getting  just absolutely taken to woodshed.  Real estate, that's related to the retailers are getting killed right now,  leverage loans, convertible bonds.  So, I'm not saying don't be enthusiastic about this great number,  remember to moment take a moment and think.  Is the good news now already out?  Is this a good  number, with the markets were anticipating 4.3 percent ago, on the Dow?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  See, I think it's all about - I think it's all about policy out of Washington.  Dagen, there's a  bit under this market come on, until they blow it on tax reform.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely, and I'll point out with wages - with wages growing at 2.8 percent.  That's  solid.  But it's not enough to really start worrying about inflation picking up.  That keeps the fed at bay  potentially - when you talk about four interest rate hikes?  Maybe, it is two.  But again, that is the kind of  not too hot, not to cold.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Goldilocks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just right wage number.</p><p>OTTER:  One important point that you're - you have to use the word inflation, but as what you're referring  to.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I said it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you just said it. </p><p>OTTER:  So, I think that's very important.  We used to think that inflation is bad thing, but you're right,  inflation is a good thing.  And around the world, you're actually seeing a little bit of less concern about  deflation.  So, we're talking about draggy earlier, getting a teeny bit hawkish.  I mean, it's still very loose  over there, but he's saying, OK, maybe the deflation is not as big a worry as we thought.  And globally,  that's what we need.  </p><p>PAYNE:  It's so funny now, because for a long-time inflation was a four-letter word, right?  I also tell  people, well, are you happy when your paycheck is inflated?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, maybe.</p><p>PAYNE:  If the value of the house inflated?  You know, we want some inflation, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out, because we're watching the Futures.  The Dow would need to  gains 147 1/2 points today, to be in positive territory.  Because right now, it's going to snap a four-week  winning streak.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, you were talking about the sell-off and face small cap stocks in the last week? </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  The rest is down six sessions in a row, the last time it was up was the day after President  Trump's speech, which kind of tells, you know.  I think that group, though, is much more sensitive to  President Trump, and the nuances of President Trump because it's a lot of American centric businesses,  that will do very we'll.  And it's almost a barometer actually, of the presidency to a degree.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  And one of the things you and I debated and discussed over the years is, what happens to the  high dividend paying risk free or risk less stocks in this market?  They've - initially, we're not doing very  well, now people are starting to drift back in the utilities.  To me, that follows like the bottom mark of it,  people are a little unsure where're the market's going now.  I feel like this is a pause - </p><p>PAYNE:  Some of that comes back to what Maria just said with the - with respect to taxes.  And I think  also - let's face it, a lot of people frustrated on investment world that Obamacare had to come before  anything else, thinking that some of these other things could have been done pretty easily.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're pulling it back in reforming it, repealing it, whatever you want to call it.  It is a tax  cut.  It's a tax cut on investors.  </p><p>PAYNE:  It's a $600 billion tax cut.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a big tax cut.</p><p>PAYNE:  But it's not the kind of tax cut though, that's going to get a company to invest in a new building  project or get the average person watching this show to go out and spend more money, or even start to  leverage credit.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the whole border adjustment tax was like a buzz kill.  I mean, we didn't hear  anything about the border adjustment tax during the campaign.  And all of the sudden, now we're talking  about raising revenue while cutting taxes.  Just cut the taxes.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  I hope that fades away.  </p><p>HOENIG:  There's going to be tremendous surprises, Maria.  Just look at something like oil, which is  expected to be a major beneficiary, of course, of the Trump administration.  Oil stocks are almost at 52- week lows across the board.  Ironically, it's the green energy stocks that are starting to outperform.  This is  going to be - is this going to end up not as otherwise would imagine?  The market's going to surprise us, I  think even in the face of these excellent job numbers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you mean?  So, you think - you're expecting a sell-off in stocks?  You'd be  selling into this rally, today? </p><p>HOENIG:  I think you have to be very hesitant buying, Maria, once the good news is out.  Again, buy the  rumor, sell the fact - the time to buy stocks I think is when job numbers weren't terrible.  And people  saying, I'm not going to buy until the - we're starting to get these numbers now.  And the fact that stocks  are now starting to do poorly, again, more new 52-week lows and highs, just tells me that the internals are  weak.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, Steve Cortes, you on the other side of that trade?  </p><p>CORTES:  I sure am, Maria.  And you know, listen, I think you're right that the biggest risk is  Washington, D.C., out there, if Washington doesn't deliver.  But I guess I would say this, you know, as  somebody who campaigned very hard for then candidate Trump, and now President Trump, I believe  staking his presidency on this legislative agenda on repeal the replace, and more importantly, on tax  reform.  And because of that, I think he's going to press members of Congress like you can't believe, and  they do not want to go back to their districts - in Republican districts and Republican leaning states, where  President Trump is incredibly popular.  They don't want to go back and face voters and explain, why they  were the obstacle to this agenda that they voted for?  So, it's not going to happen -  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, why did Mitch McConnell say what he said?  I mean, Mitch McConnell, you  know.  </p><p>CORTES:  You know, both of these Kentucky Senators are really annoying me lately, they're both  naysayers.  By the way, Mitch McConnell, has often been, I would say, unhelpful at times to the President.   But even he, I think will have to toe the line eventually - again, he and Rand Paul, I don't think want to go  back to Kentucky whenever they're up for reelection, and explain why they impeded President Trump and  the will of the American people, by the way.  So, we're going to get - it's going to be ugly the headlines,  there's a lot of consternation back-and-forth.  I think it is why the market's pausing, right now, I really do.   It's unrest, and uncertainty about Washington, but once we do get these - </p><p>PAYNE:  Let me just say one thing of that, Steve.  What if they go back to these voters a few years from  now?  And they say, why did you guys pass Obamacare 2.0?  Nothing changed for me, from what you  guys promised.  I don't know if they want to face that as well, that's the other side of their political risk  here, for them.  </p><p>CORTES:  Sure, but plenty is changing is changing this bill.  I mean, it's not fair, I think, to call it 2.0.   But I also think more importantly, this is the step to the even bigger reform, which is tax reform.  And  once we get tax reform and this economy starts really growing again.  Then they won't have to explain  anything to their voters, they'll just be high fiving them and accepting their support. </p><p>KIERNAN:  One of the areas where Mitch McConnell was right though, is that tax reform is hard.  It's  easy to underestimate the complexity of the task, and I do think an August deadline is ambitious.  I  thought it was ambitious when Trump said it as President, I thought it was ambitious when the Treasury  Secretary said it.  And what we don't see a lot of on Senate, particularly, is multitasking.  And we're  asking to do two things, simultaneously, that are big complicated, vexing, and have to be sold back home  as well.  </p><p>OTTER:  You know, a lot of people were critical of Obama, not just for Obamacare, but for the fact that  he put that first.  And they said, we got a serious - we're coming out of a pretty big recession here, let's  worry about that and then do health care.  And we could see that same criticism of Republicans now.  I  know they say, in order to do the tax bill, we need fix Obamacare first.  But, you know, I kind of wish  they've gone straight to Obamacare, because you're right, it is incredibly complicated.  How long did it  take Reagan?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's mean taxes.</p><p>OTTER:  It's mean taxes.  How long did take to get the Reagan - </p><p>PAYNE:  But you could get lower rates quicker than you could get a full-fledged - </p><p>OTTER:  And I'd love to see growth.  That's the good Trump, and market wants that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you're going to spend your political capital?  Give the American people their capital  back.  Let them keep more if their income.  Do it immediately, and make it retroactive to January 1.  Do  you know how much - people would have backed off, and be like, OK, now you can deal with reforming  Obamacare.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm perfectly happy.  I'm going to go buy a new ATV.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  And you to prove to people that you're a good guy, that you can get things done, that you can  make your deals - and by the way, everyone is going home saying, I brought you home tax reform.  And  with that, winning can take on the tough stuff.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But instead they work GOP, and the House.</p><p>CORTES:  Let's do it then!  It's all talk, let's do it!</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Guys, does anybody -</p><p>CORTES:  They keep talking about tax cut, let's do it Donald Trump.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've been saying that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have been.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've been saying that, instead we got the border adjustment tax shoved in there. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some tax to raise a trillion dollars over 10 years.  Does anybody want to touch on retail  here, Charles?  Down 26,000 jobs in retail.  That's one of the few areas where we actually showed job cuts.   We got strength in construction up 50,000, strength leisure hospitality, strength in manufacturing,  strength in government.</p><p>PAYNE:  It's the long - everyone just talked about the death of brick and mortar, you know.  And as I  already mentioned here, it's been off-set to a degree by Amazon.  But even these retailers doing well,  children's place this week, one of the biggest winners in the market - two days ago, was up 20 percent in  one day.  They're doing well because of last two years, they've closed 142 non-performing stores.  So, even  if these stores that are doing well, relatively speaking, are closing stores, are firing people, so, you know,  that's just something that's not going to exist. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Some of this could be seasonal adjustment from the Labor Department, though. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In retail?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  In the post-holiday months.  That, it could be some of that.  You could see some  give back in the next month's jobs' report. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a pretty steep decline.</p><p>KIERNAN:  And Texas had a very tough month last month on their oil patch.  And so, there are punch on  these things that I think are little moments in the sun, where I we can see them come back.  And I think  jobs are going to continue to grow throughout the rest of the year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Hot morning here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, we're going to talk a short  break.  More on the February jobs report, after this short break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, the February jobs report just out.  As we've been reporting, the economy  created 235,000 jobs, in the month of February, beating economists' expectations.  The unemployment rate  ticked down slightly to 4.7 percent.  Also expected, the labor force participation rate; this was highlight  came in at 63 percent.  That was better than expected.  I want to bring in the host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\", Stuart Varney now, joining us with his thoughts.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK VARNEY &amp; COMPANY HOST:  Good morning,  Maria.  I will say this.  I think it was a solid report; not spectacular, not a blowout, but I think it marks  what I'm going to call the beginning of the Trump expansion.  Call me crazy but I think that's where it's  at.  Now, you're going to get folks on the left who say this was a solid jobs' report result of President  Obama's policy or Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve.  That's nonsense.  </p><p>The change in the mood of the country towards more optimism, towards more growth, towards more  confidence, that started November the 8th with the election.  So, I'm calling this the beginnings of the  Trump expansion.  58,000 new construction jobs, what was it?  28,000 manufacturing, those are good  well paid-jobs.  And I think they're' going to expand that front in the future.  That's where I'm coming  from. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  Wait till we get an infrastructure program, right?  I mean, those construction jobs are  going to benefit even more. </p><p>VARNEY:  Absolutely.  And that infrastructure program will come. I think it's got bi-partisan support,  not sure how you pay for it.  But it's got bipartisan support.  Something on that front is going to get done  this year.  That is very good news for those high paid construction jobs and manufacturing, too, positive.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Sir, what do you think about your  buddy though, Elon Musk?  He might get a bit chunk of that infrastructure for the hyper loop.</p><p>VARNEY:  My buddy, Elon Musk.  Well, said with tongue-in-cheek there, Charles?  I do declare.  I'm not  wild about companies that live on government subsidies especially green subsidies.  But look, if this guy  can come up with a way of making a battery that stores enormous amounts of electricity, then you are on  to a winner.  That's my story. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me just point something out.  All the people who drive Teslas don't pay for our  infrastructure now because they don't pay any gas taxes.  They're plugging in and refuelling that way, and  so they're basically getting a free ride on the back of all the other taxpayers in this country.  So that -- it  shocks me a little bit too. </p><p>VARNEY:  It's -- you are pointing the finger towards real outrage here.  I think Tesla should be banned.   OK, I'm joking.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>VARNEY:  Just warming it up. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  Well, you know, what do you think about retail?  Retail was down 26,000.  Does that  matter or do you think that's just a fluke because of the holidays. </p><p>VARNEY:  Oh no.  I think that, that really reinforces our story.  We keep talking about the retail ice age.   They're having a very hard time.  The bricks-and-mortar people meeting the challenge of online selling  and this down , 26,000 -- 26,000 retail jobs, that's a big deal. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  That tells the story.  I wouldn't want to be a mall operator right now.  I wouldn't want to be  buying real estate in a shopping mall in this day and age.  I think they got a real problem here. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  Yes, that's a good point.  It's really online that's winning here.  Hey Stu, are you tired of  winning it?</p><p>VARNEY:  You mean in the ratings?  I'll never get tired of winning.</p><p>BARTIMORO:  You'll never get tired of that.  Now that we have Donald Trump, you're going to get so  sick of winning.  We're winning, right.  OK.  Stu, we'll see you in about -- </p><p>VARNEY:  We'll you give an opportunity, Maria.  I thought I'd grab it with both hands.</p><p>BARTIMORO:  Yes, I love it.  That was a lob.  That's what they call a lob, Stu.  Congratulations to you  and Fox Business Network.  We got the All-Stars right here.  </p><p>PAYNE:  There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations everybody .</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes, thank you, you too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For beating the competition.  Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  Join \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" top of the hour.  Steve, final thoughts from you and Jonathan.  Your take on today's number,  final word. </p><p>CORTES:  You know, final thoughts, Maria.  Between Fox Business and the ratings and Trump and the  White House, and the stock market, I'm not tired of winning yet but we might get there soon.  I think this  is a fantastic report.  I really do, particularly the participation.  Too many people had given up on  America, had given up on life really, in a lot of ways.  Not to be too philosophical but we need them back  in the workforce and they're coming back and that's great news. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  Jonathan Hoenig.</p><p>HOENIG:  There's an unlimited amount of wealth and jobs that can be created, Maria.  It's freedom that's  needed to make that happen.  So long as the government and you're right, Washington, is very much at  the center of Wall Street these days.  As so long as the government can keep this trend going, lower taxes,  lower regulation, more individual and economic freedom, I think 200,000 new jobs is just the start.</p><p>BARTIMORO:  All right we will leave it there.  Steve Cortes, Jonathan Hoenig, good to see you both.   Gentlemen, have a good weekend.  We got the best team in business.  After this short break, right here at  the panel.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIMORO:  Welcome back, final thoughts from our All-Star Panel.  We got markets on fire this  morning on the hills.  It has been better than expected jobs report.  Financials leading the rally at Peter  Kiernan, you called it.</p><p>PETER KIERNAN, ENTREPENEUR:  I have to say financers are incredibly well positioned and what's  going to be exciting to see is whether small businesses really take this opportunity to hire, to expand and  whether the big company starts parting some of that cash and the best thing in the long term.  Property  plan equipment and expanding. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  Yes, I want to get Charles' take on this though.  Because Charles, you know how to make  money in this market.  Would you think it's overvalued at this point? </p><p>PAYNE:  I think there are a lot of individual names that are overvalued.  When you see companies miss,  they're taken out to the woodshed pretty good so that's where your risk is.  And this is by no means a dart  throwing kind of rally.  I think that people need to understand too, a handful of names have been  overwhelmingly responsible for the move, right?  Because of the way the Dow forensics is weighted.  But  you know, we've got to think longer term.  And this motion of occasional dips, you know yesterday, we  talked about the eight-year anniversary of the market.  </p><p>Think about the longest streak ever, right.  It went from '87 to 2000.  Well, guess what?  From '82 to '87,  there was also a rally.  So you can almost argue from '82 to 2000, with a three month blip, could you live  with that?  Hell yes, if you were in the market.  So, it's going to happen.  I think we don't want to get too  fixated on the market occasionally pulling back.  Think longer term. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  Yes.</p><p>JACK OTTER, AMERICAN JOURNALIST:  It's important for investors to understand the good news  does not always mean good start.  The good news was baked in a long time ago, Jonathan Hoenig was  making that point.  And so we have to be careful of buy the rumor and sell the news, and especially if  maybe the market is too optimistic about tax breaks, about deregulation and we get bogged down in  Obamacare or bore taxes. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  What do you mean by good news was baked in?  I mean, you - how many people we're  like Trump's going to win and the markets are going to sell off?  Well, what is baked in?</p><p>OTTER:  Well, because as soon as he was elected, suddenly the market took off.  And we've been - I  watch the market.</p><p>PAYNE:  The $3 trillion in additional market evaluation. </p><p>OTTER:  Yes, yes. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  The anticipation about policy.</p><p>OTTER:  That's what I'm saying. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE:  Materializing so far into reality.  We're seeing sentiment materialize into reality as long as you  have that, that's the ultimate support.</p><p>OTTER:  How long to keep up?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to point out in terms of optimism.  300,000 people re-entered the work force.  The  unemployment rate falls which means that people found work.  The labor participation rate continues to  go up, that is your Trump optimism right there. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  How about wages, Dagen?  I mean, you got wages up 2.8 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, and not hot enough to make people worry about the Federal Reserve. </p><p>KIERNAN:  And I think the central point, in addition, there's room to grow.  We still have a lot of room  to grow to get where we've been before and I think that's great news for this economy. </p><p>BARTIMORO:  And then there's trade this Sunday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES,\" I'm going to  be speaking with Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross.  He is my special guest to talk about trade and how  that fits into all of this.  That's one of the worries out there.  We'll talk with the Wilbur Ross, joining me  on the Fox News Channel.  Thanks, everybody.  </p><p>KIERNAN:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have a great weekend.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" right now.

It is expected to be a big one,  economist, expecting 190 thousand jobs to have been added to the economy.  Last month, the unemployment rate is expected to tick-down to 4.7 percent.  Of course, we got very strong ADP numbers earlier in the week. So, we're  expecting a good number.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> What to watch for coming up? The Gorman debate over healthcare and America,  some senators say the current bill is dead on arrival but Vice President  Pence and House, Ways and Means committee Chairman Kevin Brady, they're  hopeful. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  What's different than  back in 2010 though, Brad, when Obamacare was literally forced through the  Congress with very little debate is what the American people are seeing,  it's really what they expect Congress to do.</p><p> KEVIN BRADY, CHAIRMAN, WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  At the end of the day  here, Lou, we're going to come together to back the president on this and  get it done.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've got the very latest this morning. Checking market action,  take a look, we're watching oil price. It's been a tough week for oil,  crude rebounding after closing at the lowest level since November,  yesterday. This morning, we're seeing a gain of about one half of 1  percent, still below $50 a barrel. That certainly helping stocks, though,  around the world as the oil price is stabilized. Futures indicating a  pretty good open for the (inaudible) averages today. </p><p>Dow Industrial seem to be up, that's 70 points at the opening of trading.  In Europe, similar story, take a look. Of course, you heard from the ECD  yesterday. The markets are higher across the boards to the tune of one half  of a percent higher on the FT100, two thirds of a percent higher on the CAC  (inaudible) in Paris and the DAX Index in Germany. </p><p> In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher. As you see, the Nikkei  average in Japan, best performer of one and a half percent. Political  unrest in South Korea, deadly protests overnight erupting after the  country's president was removed from office, impeachment. </p><p> Then a terrifying moment to report in Ohio, a four year old girl blown away  by extreme winds, amazing pictures here. Look at this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow. We'll bring you the latest there. Nissan, meanwhile,  making a car for man's best friend. Check this out. The automaker's showing  off a concept car designed with dogs in mind. We like that. All of those  stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about it, Fox  News Network's Dagen McDowell.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Barron's online editor, Jack Otter, is here and New York Times  best-selling author, Peter Kiernan, is with us as well. Good morning to  you. </p><p> PETER KIERNAN, AUTHOR, NEW YORK TIMES BEST-SELLING AUTHOR:  (inaudible)  with you. Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great to see you, happy Friday.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Morning. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly, could be a big number. ADP number was what, 298.</p><p> JACK OTTER, BARRON'S ONLINE EDITOR:  I think it might be huge.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, huge.</p><p> OTTER:  Huge.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The first job report under President Trump.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Full report.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we know the expectations are out there but does the  market trade up on a huge number or does the market trade down because the  Fed starts raising interest rates next week.</p><p> OTTER:  Well, I think that the next -- the March interest rate hike is  baked in.</p><p> BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p> OTTER:  I mean, unless today is just terrible but everyone expects it's  going to be good especially after that ADP number. I think, frankly, I'm  already looking beyond the number. I'm looking the wages, and of course,  the participation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've got a big show coming up. We have the jobs number at 8:00  AM Eastern and we will be looking at all of the above there. Joining our  program this morning, a whole line up of experts to tell you where the jobs  are right now. First, our top story republicans are moving forward with the  replacement of Obamacare. The GOP plan cleared hurdles through two house  committees yesterday. Those skepticism for the bill is still mounting.  House Speaker Paul Ryan even gave a PowerPoint presentation to promote the  merits of the bill. That was during his weekly press conference. Vice  President Mike Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senator Rand Paul, all  weighed in on the plane yesterday. Watch.</p><p> PENCE:  Because of President Trump's leadership and support here in the  congress, I'm very confident. We'll repeal and replace Obamacare and it'll  all be done by this spring.</p><p> PAUL RYAN, HOUSE SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is the closest we will  ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare. </p><p> RAND PAUL, SENATOR:  Conservatives hate their bill. I promise you.  Obamacare lied, dead on arrival. They might as well just start over.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow, dead on arrival. Joining us right now, former Michigan  congressman and former Intelligence Committee Chairman, Pete Hoekstra.  Congressman, good to see. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> PETE HOEKSTRA, CONGRESSMAN:  Great to be here. Thank you. Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So much debate. I mean, do you think this current house bill  has a chance of passing in the senate? You heard what Rand Paul just said,  dead on arrival.</p><p> HOEKSTRA: Well, this current house bill is now what we will ultimately see  be put into law. This is the normal process of making sausage or some call  it making legislation. The house has its bill. There will be some changes  that will be made to this bill has they -- as the house goes through the  process, the senate will do its work. There'll be reconciliation, the work  with the president. I think the reason for optimism is how engaged the  White House is with the president and Mike Pence, both involve in this  process, making it work. You know, the dialogue will continue. Ultimately,  there will be a repeal and replace bill that makes it to the president's  desk.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  So this is all to be expected. Then the back and  forth as we make the sausage or make this legislation. Can we talk about  what is so troubling though because the conservatives are so upset about  this? I mean, they are calling this an expansion of Medicaid. Dagen, let's  go through for our viewers, what is so bad about this plan?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The -- what the conservative don't like and there are a few  things, and the congressman can jump in here. There were 19 states that  resisted the Medicaid expansion. Many of the states and the representatives  who took money to expand Medicaid, they demanded, basically, $100 billion  subsidy fund to stabilize their transition away from -- as they go to block  grants on Medicaid, for lack of a better word. They're also angry that the  Cadillac tax is still in there, although, it's extended out to 2025 and a  lot of these conservatives seem to have gotten religion, if you will, on  these tax credits, they're mad that the tax credits are a subsidy, which  they are. The republicans and that their leadership, they're trying to  level the playing field in terms of the tax treatment of employer  insurance, it's an employer provided insurance and that the individuals  buy. They call it a subsidy but I'll point out the head of this freedom  caucus, Congressman Mark Meadows in North Carolina was a cosponsor of Tom  Price's healthcare bill before Tom Price became Health and Human Services  secretary. That has tax credits in it. So now, he's got religion on it.  That's what I don't understand. There is a lot of pushback. I do you think  -- there will be compromise though as Congressman Hoesktra.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think congressman? I mean, is it mostly this  thought that it's an expansion of Medicare -- Medicaid rather or the  Cadillac tax? Is that what's so troubling from the conservative's point of  view.</p><p> HOEKSTRA:  Well, I think all of the above is accurate. I think the  republicans will get over and they will unite on the tax credit. They'll  recognized that this is actually a leveling of the tax treatment for those  of who get an employer base healthcare plan versus those who have to go buy  it out on the market themselves. I think they will also - yes, they'll  reach a compromise on the Medicaid expansion because, you know, certain  states did it, other did not. So, they will get there. The other thing that  I think that they will want to do is they -- yes, they'll have to get rid  of the Cadillac tax. You know, republicans could not be seen as keeping a  tax that is part of Obamacare in place in moving forward and somewhere in  this thing not as phase three. They're going to have to move phase three  into phase one which is allowing the sale of insurance across state lines.</p><p> BARTIMOMO:  Peter Kiernan? </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KIERNAN:  For just a second, I have a question for you because, on one  hand, you have Speaker Ryan saying this is a binary choice, either or and  the other hand, the president is saying let's go bowling and let's make a  deal and somewhere in between that, you have the house and look what  they're doing. They speed through Ways and Means. They speed through Energy  and Commerce. They're on their way to the budget committee. This is  lightning fast. What do you think is going to happen here? Where are these  compromises going to be made?</p><p> HOEKSTRA:  Well, the compromise, that I think are going to be made -- there  will be compromise throughout this process. There will be compromises made  to get to 218 votes in the house. The speaker doesn't have the votes right  now. He will get there. There will be compromises or there will be a senate  agenda that puts out, probably -- maybe, a very significant different bill  and then there'll be a reconciliation pack or there will be a conference  report that will come out as the house and the Senate work out their  differences. This will be all about compromise all the way through. It is  not unusual. Remember, back at '96, we did welfare. I think we passed it  three times before President Clinton actually signed. This is expected.  This should not be easy. It is healthcare. It's a huge change. It -- this  is the normal process.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I will add this, that if you had republicans who step back and  cross their arms and essentially stand shoulder to shoulder with the likes  of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi on this, they will regret it. Whether  it's in the midterm elections whether it is four years from now, they will  regret it because if they -- if the republicans do nothing here. It will  speed up or if they just repeal it and then don't have anything to replace  it. It will speed up the already looming collapse of Obamacare and you're  talking about people getting kicked off their insurance, spiraling of --  premium spiraling high -- of the higher.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then they own it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, they will -- the republicans will own it. Particularly the  people who stood back and let it happen.</p><p> KIERNAN:  Yes, they'll be the ones who are dead on arrival. I think -- if  you pull that trick. I think (inaudible)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They've got a window. This is the window.</p><p> OTTER:  You know guys, there's one thing. So, there are a lot of thing --  the things that people most hated about Obamacare tended to be the things  that were necessary in order to get more people on healthcare, the penalty  for instance. The idea that, you know, you couldn't charge older people,  frankly, as much as it cost to insure older people. That was a very anti- free market move but what it did was it got more people coverage. How you  do make those tough choices with this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman, what's the timeline on this? You said, there's  going to be a lot of debate. There's going to be a lot of choices to make  but what's your timeline on that? Do you think we're going to see this  before Eastern, which is I think that the date that they were talking  about, you want to have something done by Easter, which is in a couple of  weeks.</p><p> HOEKSTRA:  Yes, I think you'll see it out of the house clearly by Easter. I  think it's going to be sometime between Easter and the August Recess before  they get it passed into law and get something on the president's desk. I  think one of the really interesting things to watch is what's going to  happen to the August Recess. The senate -- the house and senate, they're  going to go out of session roughly the end of July and then they're not  going to come back into session until September. Are they really can take a  whole month off? I think they're going to have to pass healthcare. They're  going to have to pass tax reform. I believe before they go on their  traditional August Recess because I think Donald Trump is going to come  back and say, yes, hey, we got to get -- make America great again. We got  to get the economy going. We got to get more money in people's pockets.  These two things have to happen before you go home.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, they'll better be working on a tax reform package if  they're going to take a month off. Maybe, they're going to work on it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Oh, Mitch McConnell said yesterday, the senate majority leader,  the tax reform is not getting done by August. He said I don't think that -- </p><p> HOEKSTRA:  I know he said that thing. The interesting thing he's going to - - </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He's going to -- I don't think it will get done by August. </p><p> BARTIROMO: That's a big statement.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I saw that. I was like, what? Oh. </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> HOEKSTRA:  And I think Donald Trump will ask Mitch McConnell to stay in  session in August until they get it done and guess what, with those jet  fumes always going in the end of July, they may actually find a way to get  it done by August. I think Donald Trump is going to stand firm and say  don't go home until these two things are done.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think you're right.</p><p> HOEKSTRA:  This is what I promised, what we all promised the American  people don't go home until your work is done.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I think you're right and I think the American people are  going to shame them into having a tax plan after Obamacare ready to go  after that July Recess. So, we'll see about that. OK. Now, we're talking  about dates, and this is real impactful for markets. Congressman, good to  see you, sir. Thanks so much.</p><p> HOEKSTRA:  OK, great. Thank you. Good to be with you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Pete Hoekstra there and stay tuned, we'll be bringing you live  coverage and announcements of the February jobs report. It is Jobs Day.  Jobs in America begins at 8:00 A.M. Eastern. Q&amp;As for all the experts on  where exactly the jobs are and what are wages doing now. Coming up next,  the car designed for man's best friend.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The latest concept from Nissan that dog owners are drooling  over and then serving up these. What restaurants are doing to make you put  the bill for rising minimum wage. Wait until you this. Have you checked  your check lately? Back in a minute.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back with that breaking news overnight. Out of South  Korea, violent clashes breaking out after the country's president was  officially ousted from office. Cheryl Casone with the story now, in  headline. Cheryl. </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  It's quite a scandal in South Korea, Maria. The  president, President Park, has become the country's first democratically  elected leader forced from office in that country after a panel of judges  unanimously upheld parliament's decision to impeach her over a corruption  scandal. She was also the first female leader of South Korea. Violent  clashes immediately breaking out between supporters of Park and police  after the (inaudible) that happened in Seoul. It left at least two people  dead. The country now has 60 days to hold a new presidential election.</p><p> (inaudible) that the same corruption scandal has enveloped the error of  Samsung and then bribery charges. </p><p> Meanwhile, let's turn our focus to Germany. Police have arrested a man who  wounded seven people with an axe at a train station in Dusseldorf  yesterday. Officials describe the suspect as a 36-year-old man, from the  former Yugoslavia, who obviously has mental health problems, they added.  Three of the victims suffered severe injuries. Police believed the suspect  acted alone. </p><p> Well, let's turn to some corporate news this morning. Staples says it's  looking to close another 70 stores in North America following sharp sales  decline. The news comes as the company reports disappointing returns for  the quarter. Earnings coming in at 25 cents a share, that was a penny less  than analyst expected. Store closings follow the elimination of 48  locations last year and as well affected about five percent of stores in  North America. They'll have about 1600 stores left after these closings. </p><p> And finally this headline, the restaurant industry is handling higher labor  costs by adding them to your bill. Rather than raise menu prices to cover  the higher cost of wages, some eateries are now attacking on labor  surcharges. The Wall Street Journal reports that change in states like  Arizona, California, Colorado, and right here in New York are adding the  surcharges of three to four percent to the bill. Maria, you will see them  on your bill, just ask your server for details.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, incredible. I mean, people just miss it but that's who's  paying for minimum wage increases.</p><p> CASONE:  We are, we are. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go. Who do you think was going to pay for it, anyway?  Coming up next, soda sales going flat -- thanks Cheryl. The beverage  Americans are reaching for instead of soda. Future is pointing to a higher  opening ahead of the February jobs report a little more than two hours  away. What to expect from the February jobs number coming out at 8:30 A.M.  Eastern. Market's rallying ahead of that. Back in a moment.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. It's pretty good market day this morning. Take a  look. We're expecting a big rally at the opening of trading. Dow  Industrials, expected to be up about 80 points. This is, of course, ahead  of the February jobs report. It's going to hit the (inaudible) in about two  hours. We will bring you the latest numbers, obviously but we're expecting  an addition of 190 thousand jobs to the economy in the last month with the  unemployment rate falling back to 4.7 percent. Jack Otter is with us this  morning and, Jack, we know that we got a very strong ADP number. 298  thousand was reported on Thursday and the estimate was 190, do you think  it's going to be equivalent?</p><p> OTTER:  Yes, I think it's going to be closer to the ADP number than the 190  if you look at a chart of ADP versus the non-farm's payroll, especially, on  these blowout numbers. How often non-farm payroll has actually been above  ADP? So, it's not impossible. We could see a 350 thousand number today. On  the downside, I think it's 250, I don't think it's 190. So -- now, really,  and everyone else is weather, weather, weather. I am starting to wonder if  maybe they're not quite figuring out the seasonal adjustments correctly. 66  thousand construction jobs was a wonderful figure in the ADP number. I  don't believe it. We are not creating 66 thousand construction jobs every  month. I'm sure there was a bump because of the weather and then you add  the seasonal adjustment on top of that and you get this but still goodness.  We'll look - I'm looking through that. Look for wages.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's clear the things are beginning to unleash, Peter. Isn't  that right?</p><p> KIERNAN:  It really does feel. There's never been a damn just burst all at  once. There is a little bit here and a little bit there. What's happening  here is really exciting. Job creation is fantastic. There are some spots  like in retail and some spots like in oil but they have Amazon turning  around and say, we're going to create 100 thousand jobs this year. This is  an economy that's on the march and what I love about this is if we get the  spectacular number you're talking about, as far as Janet Yellen is down  said hike -- we hike raises. We hike rates. What happens when? I think the  financials are going to have a spectacular year particularly if there are  three more rate hikes to follow.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They've already have a spectacular year since Election Day,  right, Dagen? The financials are on fire. The Fed meeting is next week, the  15th. A strong jobs number probably does lead to a rate hike, right? You  said it's a rate hike.</p><p> KIERNAN:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The rate hiked -- price in the market last week. At the  beginning of the week there was a little more than a third of a chance that  the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates next week and then it went to  about 90 percent.</p><p> KIERNAN:  It's over 90 percent. Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right. It went to 90 percent by the end of the week. So, some  people will call it flat footed. The question will be looking down the  road. The Fed expecting three interest rate hikes this year. They're going  to hike most definitely next week. Do they even speed that up? If they  think that the jobs market is getting hot here. The job growth, it's only  running the three month average of 183 thousand jobs. So, they will wait at  least a couple months to see if you have three or four consecutive months  of strong job creation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How about -- </p><p> KIERNAN:  People will be looking very closely at wage growth. It's actually  slowed. It was 0.1 percent wage growth last month. If it doesn't get up to  0.3, at least, I think people are going to say, well, this is great but not  good enough and frankly it puts the policymakers in a pickle because you're  creating jobs but not well enough paid jobs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, let's talk about the oil prices for a second. They're  higher this morning but they took a real hit this week over concerns of a  glut in oil. We have, David, showing stockpiles heading record levels. Does  the oil story once again impact the stock market story? And I'll point that  just a couple of stories in the Wall Street Journal this morning. S&amp;P 500  up 250 percent from its lowest crisis year close eight years ago. Household  net worth in the U.S. up to record $92.8 trillion in the fourth quarter  because of that year and surge in stocks.</p><p> KIERNAN:  Yes, I think oil is really exciting right now. It's going to tell  a lot of stories. Number one, no matter what OPEC tried to do to kind of  lift that price of oil. The United States is producing. We're producing 9  million barrels a day. Our record for us and these guys are doing it  because they have debts to pay. Remember, it was only a couple of years ago  that oil was $100 a barrel and interest rates from two percent and, so,  that's it. Let's borrow and pump. We're doing the same thing again and I  don't think that the Saudis and others are going to be, like, keep that  price up as long as United States is pumping, pumping, pumping.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because there's more oil, means lower prices.</p><p> KIERNAN:  Yes, and we're going to keep pumping. We have a great business,  we have an oil dividend for our nation and I think it's a great time for  us. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's a job creator. </p><p> KIERNAN:  Absolutely. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There's that as well. We're going to stay tuned. We've got a  big show ahead. We're bringing you live coverage and announcements of the  February jobs report. Jobs in America begins 8:00 A.M. Eastern, 30 minutes  before The Numbers which will hit the tape at 8:30. (inaudible) break when  we come back. Pressure building on Capitol Hill. FBI director, Jim Comey  meeting with lawmakers over the president's wiretapping claims. What it  means for the future of those allegations and then a heart stopping moment  in Ohio.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A little girl, literally blown away literally blown away by  heavy winds, luckily unharmed. The dramatic moment. Watch. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Friday morning, welcome back, everybody. Thanks for being  with us. I'm Marie Bartiromo. Happy Friday and it's Friday, March 10th.  Your top service right now at 6:30 A.M. on the East Coast. </p><p> It's job's day, two hours away from the February jobs report. Economists  are expecting 190 thousand jobs to have been added to the economy in the  month of February. The unemployment rate is expected to tick down to 4.7  percent. What you need to know, coming up this morning. </p><p> FBI Director, James Comey, briefs lawmakers. Director Comey spoke with  congressional leaders over President Trump's wiretapping claims as well as  allegations that President Trump's associates have links to Russia. All of  this coming as WikiLeaks takes on the CIA. White House Press Secretary Sean  Spicer weighed in on the leak. </p><p> SEAN SPICER, PRESS SECRETARY:  There's grave concern that the president has  about to release of national security and classified information that  threatens and undermines our nation's security. Obviously he believes that  the systems at the CIA are outdated and need to be updated. </p><p> BARTIROMO: The video of WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, says he will  give technology companies access to the CIA's hacking tools.  He says he  wants to help technology companies, see where their vulnerabilities are.  </p><p> Refugees using Facebook to seek asylum -- the new online tool that's  helping them get legal advice -- the outrage ahead.  Markets this morning  in rally mode.  </p><p> We're watching oil prices today because crude is rebounding after closing  at the lowest level since November.  Equities once again focused on the oil  market.  </p><p> Oil prices up three quarters of one percent, still below $50 a barrel.  But  nonetheless, the gain is helping stocks across the world.  </p><p> Futures indicating a gain at the opening of trading this morning ahead of  the jobs report.  Market is expected to open up almost 80 points on the Dow  Jones Industrial Average.  </p><p>NASDAQ is up a third of a percent, 21 points higher.  Similar story in  Europe, take a look.  Markets there in the green, up about half a percent  to three quarters of one percent in the European indices this morning. </p><p> And in Asia overnight, stocks mostly higher, with the exception of the  Shanghai composite in China, down a fraction, Nikkei average in Japan up  one and a half percent.  Wild weather across the country -- storms moving  east after hitting the heartland.  </p><p> The wind is leaving a little girl scared but unscathed this morning -- that  unbelievable video of this little girl who gets blown away by the winds.  </p><p>Nissan is embracing man's best friend -- why the new car is pawfect (ph)  for dog lovers.  We'll tell you about it -- all those stories coming up  this morning.  </p><p> But first, growing (ph) pressure this morning on the Justice Department to  substantiate President Trump's claim that the previous administration  wiretapped his phones during the campaign.  FBI Director, James Comey,  briefed top congressional leaders on the situation yesterday as well as on  those allegations that President Trump's associates have some kind of link  to Russia.  Vice President Mike Pence spoke about the Russia allegations  last night with Bret Baier.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MIKE PENCE, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT:  When the former director of a -- of  national intelligence said just a week ago that in the report he prepared  by the end of the year, there was no evidence of collusion between Russian  officials and our campaign, I -- I think that -- that speaks with great  authority.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining us this morning, London Center for Policy Research  Senior Fellow, Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer. </p><p> Colonel, good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> TONY SHAFFER, SENIOR FELLOW, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH:  Good  morning.  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  .for joining us.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  Thank you for having me.  Good to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do we know about the Comey briefing yesterday?  What do  you expect to come out of this investigation?  </p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, so far, I think it was simply an update.  I -- I don't  think anybody on either side wants to go through it because I don't think  either side has made a complete disclosure of what happened.  </p><p> And -- but Maria, let me point out the obvious here.  One of the things  that did come out of that meeting was an update, quote/unquote, on the --  the \"spurious (ph) links\", some sort of link, some connection between Trump  Tower computers and some Russian bank.  </p><p> Well, that tells me they're monitoring that -- that.  And that goes back to  Mr. Trump's point, that he's been monitored.  </p><p> So I think, you know, look closely at what comes out.  And you'll see the  evidence of what's being talked about.  </p><p> And -- and if I were a reporter, I would ask Mr. Comey that question  directly, why (ph) you're -- you're updating people on this computer link.   Gee, does that mean that you have authority to do it?  </p><p> And who gave you the authority?  So I think this is where we have to look  very closely what's been going on.  And this -- this completely verifies  what \"New York Times\" has been saying about the wiretapping.  </p><p> So I think Mr. Trump is (ph) a -- a very clear accounting on what the  authorities were, who issued the authorities and under what circumstance  relating to the so-called FBI, national security investigation of these  links.  It's very clear to me that -- that needs to be disclosed completely  to everybody.  </p><p> JACK OTTER, ONLINE EDITOR, BARRON'S:  So this is Jack Otter from Barron's.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  Hey, Jack.  </p><p> OTTER:  My -- my question is it seems to me that obviously, we are  monitoring the -- the Russians at all time, just as.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Right. </p><p> OTTER:  .what (ph) National Security Agency does.  So when the Russians are  in contact with someone here, wouldn't that natural and normal monitoring  reveal that? </p><p> SHAFFER:  No.  </p><p> OTTER:  No? </p><p> SHAFFER:  You have to understand there's a process call minimization.  So  if you decide that you're going to pick up the phone and call someone in  Russia, they can monitor whatever they want on the Russian side of the  call.  </p><p> They cannot monitor you.  If you are not (ph) presumed to have committed a  crime, they can't look at you.  That's just the way it is.  </p><p> OTTER:  But don't they know.</p><p> SHAFFER:  This is me?  Yes, they -- they can -- they, by regulation, have  to pretend they don't know who you are.  There's a process in place called  minimization.  </p><p> I think Andrew Napolitano talks about this.  And he's correct.  You've got  to basically -- if you have not committed a crime and you're not presumed  to have (ph) committed a crime, they can't look at who you are.  </p><p> That's just the way it is.  Now, if there's things in the conversation with  the Russians which may stimulate people to think there's something -- that  you're doing something wrong, then that could be probable cause.  </p><p> And that would stimulate a whole separate thing of -- of authorities (ph).   But you have to have that probable cause tripwire. </p><p> Something has to happen in the conversation that says, there's something  potentially illegal here.  And everything I've heard, everything I've been  told about does not indicate there was any collusion or wrong-doing in any  of the conversations either way.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> PETER KIERNAN, FORMER PARTNER, GOLDMAN SACHS:  You know, one of the things  that troubles me and you hear Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Senator  Lindsey Graham say, all we need to do is call the FBI and we'll quickly get  this worked out, isn't it a little bit more complicated than just asking  one or two questions of the FBI? </p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, yes, for a couple of reasons.  First, the FBI is not the  only organization that could actually do this level of collection.  </p><p> We have to look at the DHS, Department of Homeland Security.  They have  their own internal capabilities to do these sorts of things.  </p><p> And then you have also the -- the military services.  And let me be very,  very clear on this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  .some of you all remember George Bush's warrantless wiretaps.  We  -- DOD could be used in what we call Title 10.  </p><p> Title 10 is -- is the -- the body of laws called traditional military  activities.  The simple rule of thumb on that is anything George Washington  did with the continental army, that include spying, you can do under Title  10.  </p><p> So that's how you have another option available to you as the president to  do this collection.  So you cannot simply look down one venue and try to  ascertain what happened here.  </p><p> You have to look at multiple and try to figure out within those multiple  venues what law was used, what technology was used, what days was it used.   That's -- it's a very complicated situation.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know, it's interesting, I mean, I think everybody  knows how I feel about this whole Russian narrative at this point.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  Right.  We all feel (ph) -- yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But I mean.</p><p> SHAFFER:  I don't (ph) -- yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  .you know, watching -- watching the media this morning, I was  watching different channels and the -- and the way that they were reporting  it, it's amazing, they keep having to say, no evidence yet of -- of any  interaction between the Trump team and the Russians.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  .as if like, well, we're waiting.  No evidence yet.  Even James  Clapper said it.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  .no evidence yet.  And -- and we know that Clapper has been on  the other side of this story and has been really not.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  .a friend to the Trump administration.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We turn to the CIA hacking claims.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Sure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  .Lieutenant Colonel, because WikiLeaks found -- Julian Assange  spoke out about the alleged CIA document yesterday.  Listen to what he had  to say.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JULIAN ASSANGE, FOUDNER, WIKILEAKS:  The CIA developed a giant arsenal, the  -- what appears to be the largest arsenal of Trojans and viruses in the  world that attacks most of the systems that journalists, people in  government, politicians, CEOs and average people use, didn't secure it,  lost control of it and then appears to have covered up that fact.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So Assange is offering top technology companies those alleged  hacking tools.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he says they can patch security flaws.  Is he making fun of  them?  I mean, is he -- is he really thinking that they want to work with a  fugitive? </p><p> I mean, what -- what do you think about this? </p><p> SHAFFER:  I think he's having fun with both sides.  I mean, he's in a  position to poke people in the eyes, poking people in the eye.  </p><p> To the tech industry point, they have built by -- for any number of  reasons, huge vulnerabilities within their own systems.  I mean, if I were  at (ph) North Korea, I wouldn't be buying any Panasonic TVs anytime soon if  I didn't want them to -- to know what I'm doing in my living room.  </p><p> So I think these are -- and by the way, these are -- these were known  before the CIA hack came out.  I mean, you cannot -- technology is  ambivalent to the user.  </p><p> So it doesn't matter if you're the government.  It doesn't matter if you're  a private industry.  </p><p> These vulnerabilities exist.  So what I think what he's doing is saying,  hey, you, industry folks, have been pretty (ph) stupid.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  .by leaving these back doors open.  With that said, the  disclosure the CIA has tools to deal with those in my judgment is -- is a  very severe breech.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  And -- and I think CIA needs to look at their -- what I would  call internet hygiene or trade craft.  Again, Maria, I ran a unit doing  this sort of thing back in the late '90s and early 2000s.  </p><p> And let me tell you, none of the stuff we did, it's not been -- it's not  been disclosed because we actually I think practiced very effective trade  craft.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  So I think you have to look at the situation for what it is.  And  so Assange is -- is not a good guy.  He's -- he's kind of poking both sides  of the obvious (ph) point.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Now, he's esteeming (ph) giant bag of  garbage who wants.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  .to destroy the United States and never leaked.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Precisely.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  .anything about Russia or China by the way.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  Right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to point Apple has said that any security flaws that were  disclosed in this leak, they have -- they have closed those loopholes,  closed those gaps in the most recent software update, the operating system  update.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So we didn't.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And by the way, remember the -- with this, these are  impenetrable.  Nobody can get into this phone.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what we thought after San Bernardino.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, no, but that -- that was an older phone.  The newer phone.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, I see what you're saying.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  .there's no backdoor, period.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The newer phones.  Let me -- let me get your take on this.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Sure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  .because a Facebook Messenger chat bot is helping.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  .refugees seek asylum.  This is amazing.  This is a computer  program.  And it's offering legal advice through texts or vocal commands.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What are your thoughts on this new technology?  </p><p> SHAFFER:  Maria, I -- I couldn't get it out of my head this morning.  I was  preparing for the story of \"Max Headroom\" back in the -- you know, in the  '80s, you know.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes, yes.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  .of Max coming on and telling you legal advice.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Get smart, right.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, it's -- it's kind of interesting because it is an  application of technology for purposes of helping refugees do a number of  things, some -- some good, some bad.  Now, the idea here is that, you know,  maybe you could figure out which country you can go to and say, I want  asylum and -- and you go there.  </p><p> And -- and you go there.  It's (ph) going to catalyze (ph) people to  certain countries as (ph) they can get there.  At the same time, you know,  it -- it may be something that actually helps people understand what their  legal rights are and are not.  </p><p> And I think for the purposes of -- of what I've read, I think someone tried  to create it to actually help the refugees without having to spend a lot of  money because the other thing about -- hope -- don't take any lawyers there  onset the wrong way, lawyers are expensive.  So I think maybe this is a way  of trying to -- to prevent lawyers from, you know, milking these folks who  are looking for -- for -- for asylum.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, there you go.  All right, great to see you, Colonel.   Thanks so much.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  Great (ph).  Thank you.  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Colonel Tony Shaffer, joining us there.  </p><p> Coming up next, a car worth drooling over -- the latest concept from Nissan  designed with man's best friend in mind.  And then it is a jungle out there  -- big names battling at the box office.  </p><p> Will \"Kong Skull Island\" climb to the top this weekend?  We've got your  weekend preview of movies, back in a minute.              </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It's big Friday for the markets this morning.   Take a look.  </p><p> We are looking at a rally underway this morning -- Dow Industrials expected  to open up 70 points, NASDAQ up about 20 points.  Of course, we're waiting  on the jobs number out in less than two hours.  </p><p> A couple of names we're watching -- keep an eye on Snap -- the social media  company officially has one week of trading in the books.  Snap ended the  first week of trading below its opening price.  </p><p> Now, it opened at $24 a share.  It's down nearly seven percent from there.   We're watching Facebook this morning, the company reaching a deal with  major league soccer and Univision to stream the games.  </p><p> The deal includes at least 22 regular-season games, the first of which will  be March 18.  Facebook shares up nearly 20 percent in '17 -- 2017.  </p><p> Well, a little girl blown away in heavy winds -- we've been showing you the  pictures.  Cheryl Casone has this amazing story.  </p><p> Cheryl?  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  It is amazing, Maria.  And the  surveillance video does show this little four-year-old girl in Ohio being  blown away during a wind storm.  </p><p> When the front -- she walked up the front stairs of her house, she opens  the door and the wind caught both.  Here is the thing -- she wasn't  injured.  </p><p> In fact, her mom said she was laughing after it was all over.  But mom did  say she had to pry (ph) her daughter's hands from the door at first because  she was just gripping on so hard.  </p><p> Oh, man.  In other headlines this morning, guys, I love the affair over  (ph) soda seems to be over.  According to an industry tracker, bottled  water overtook soda as the top drink in the U.S. by sales volume last year.  </p><p> Americans drink an average of just over 39 gallons of bottled water in  2016, nearly a gallon more than carbonated soft drinks.  This news  shouldn't come, though, as a surprise.  </p><p> Sales of bottled water have been growing for years as demand for soda has  fallen.  Well, Starbucks is gearing up for spring, the coffee company  unveiling three new cups styled for the spring season.  </p><p> And they're kind of different for Starbucks -- pastel blue, green and  yellow.  They've got some spring-themed drawings on them -- first time that  Starbucks has ever offered spring cups.  </p><p> They will be in stores on March 16.  And finally, favorite story of the day  -- it is a car for the dogs literally.  </p><p>Nissan is getting ready to start production on a new Nissan X-trail.  It's  a vehicle that's got multiple features to make your dog's life and your  life a little bit easier.  </p><p> There's an easy access ramp, a pull-out water shower, a treat storage  compartment, integrated dryer, no-spill water bowl and a clip-on harness  hook.  And then it gets better.  </p><p> It's got dual dog cam technology so the dog and the owner can see and hear  each other simultaneously while they're driving.  It's going to be produced  in Europe first, guys, before it goes to market here in the U.S.</p><p> And no, Dagen and, Maria, I don't know what it costs.  But I'm going to  find out.  It looks awesome.  </p><p> Somebody has to buy one.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, Ramon (ph) and Charlie (ph) I know would love it.   Ella Bella (ph) would like it, too.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But can I just point out it's critically important to secure  your dogs properly when they're riding in -- in the automobile.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If (ph) it does that, it -- it will save many pets' lives.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So this is a good thing.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we had a great week this week here on MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  Take a look at some of the moments from the big show this week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's your take on the GOP plan in terms of health care for  America?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, we applaud Speaker Ryan and Secretary Price for  getting out and putting a proposal on the table that seems like a -- a  reasonable and concrete plan.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You can call me happy Herman this morning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Happy Herman?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Happy -- happy with this tax plan.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And here is why.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is Obamacare gone.  Mandates are gone.  Taxes are  gone.  Penalties are gone.  </p><p> And it's going to reestablish the healthcare marketplace and the health  insurance marketplace.  </p><p> ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR, HARVARD LAW:  The president doesn't get to  order wiretaps in the United States of America.  That's not the job of the  president.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  It (ph) has to come through the Justice Department, the FBI.   There were wiretaps that did capture conversations between officials and  Russians.  </p><p> Probably, it was wiretaps on the Russians.  We do that routinely.  We  wiretap everybody, every other country.  </p><p> But we're not allowed to wiretap the Trump Tower.  </p><p> JOHN NEGROPONTE, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO IRAQ:  We're hemorrhaging  classified information.  There are no secrets left anymore.  It's a big  problem.  </p><p> And I think mainly, it's a problem of information control.  </p><p> MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, ALLIANZ:  Battle lines are  forming both within the Republican Party and more broadly.  And the  question is the political judgment.  </p><p> To what extent will President Trump use his political capital here as  opposed to tax reform, infrastructure, which contributes directly and  quickly to economic growth?  </p><p> PAUL BROWNING, CEO, MITSUBISHI HITACHI POWER SYSTEMS AMERICAS:  As you put  in new tax policy, let's make sure that we don't put in tax policy that  creates a disincentive to do the kinds of things that our country has done  -- or our.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sure.  </p><p> BROWNING:  .our company has done.  </p><p> STEPHEN SCHORK, FOUNDER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  U.S. producers are now putting  500,000 barrels a day -- more oil onto the market to-date than they were  prior to the OPEC announcement.  </p><p> TONY ROBBINS, AUTHOR OF \"UNSHAKEABLE\":  I didn't want to write another book  as long as I lived, haven't had one (ph) for 20 years.  But then I just saw  so much fear.  </p><p> When does a bear show up?  About every five years, we're due for one.  It's  been eight.  They last a year.  </p><p> They cost about 33 percent but they don't cost anything if you don't sell  (ph).  And every single bear market in the history of the United States for  two centuries is stalled (ph) by a bull market.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  One of the priorities of this administration -- growth.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Just realized (ph).  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Get on it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Get on it, that's right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Colonel West, all -- all those Republicans who you still talk  to, and tell them to get on the tax reform.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We're watching.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're warning them.  </p><p> FORMER REP. ALLEN WEST (R), FLORIDA:  I will -- I will be up -- I will be  in Washington, D.C. in two weeks.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  </p><p> WEST:  I will make sure I tell them, Dagen.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, you have marching orders from Dagen McDowell.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> We will be watching.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We'll send you a.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> WEST:  Yes, ma'am.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you use these things as a doctor? </p><p> TIFFANY SIZEMORE, CARDIOLOGIST:  I do.  I use a smart scale every day.   This is a Withings (ph) and a Philips smart scale.  </p><p> They both do body mass index, fat percentage.  They track your -- your  weight on an app.  Each of them have apps.  </p><p> And you can see a graph, a poll (ph) kind of representation.  You can set  goals for yourself.  It tells you when you meet your goal.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean, how did you come up with this idea, first of all,  before we talk about all the treats that you brought, in terms of eating  cookie dough raw?  </p><p> KRISTEN TOMIHAN (ph):  Yes, so I have been lifelong baker.  Half the time I  would make cookies that -- it wouldn't even make it to the oven.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because they (ph) ate all the dough.  </p><p> TOMIHAN (ph):  .because they're eating (ph) the cookie dough right from the  bowl.  So I had this moment when I was with a bunch of girlfriends and  thought, why is this not a thing?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  To celebrate March madness, Pizza Hut is introducing a limited  edition sneaker that has an ordering button built right in.  They are  called Pie Tops -- yes, Pie Tops.  </p><p> Just press the button on your sneaker and a fresh pizza will be delivered  to your exact location.  I just pressed the button several times.  </p><p> I'm hoping that they know we want a pizza and the pizza is delivered.  We  got the pizza.  This is incredible.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  An unchartered island.  Let me list all the ways you're  going to die.  Rain, heat, disease-carrying flies and we haven't started on  the things that want to eat you alive.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We'll double that.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Plus a bonus if we make it back. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes (ph).  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, that was a clip from the new film, \"Kong: Skull Island,\"  hitting theaters today.  Joining me now, \"In the FOXlight\" host and senior  vice president of marketing here at Fox News, Michael Tammero.  </p><p> Michael, good to see you.  </p><p> MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF MARKETING:  Hey, good  morning. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So I wasn't sure if I would like that but it's starring John  Goodman, Tom Hiddleston, and Brie Larson -- hundred $90 million budget.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Hundred $90 million budget -- it's because it's (ph) part of the  \"Kong\" -- \"King\" for a reason.  He probably will top it off at the box  office this weekend -- tough competition against \"Logan\" which over- performed last weekend and earned about $80 million.  </p><p> This is an important movie for Warner Bros.  It's the second movie in a  (ph) big monster franchise.  Twenty-fourteen, they had \"Godzilla,\" a  hundred and $60 million budget, pulled in half a billion dollars globally.  </p><p> This is the second installment, they're going with \"King Kong.\"  They're  (ph) -- another \"Godzilla\" coming out next year.  </p><p> And then in 2020, there's a \"Godzilla\" \"King Kong\" mash-up.  So this -- but  first is we (ph) have to work, and it probably will.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  \"Godzilla\" \"King Kong\" mash-up, I love it.  All right, well,  we'll see if it does well.  </p><p> I guess I'm into it.  We'll see about that. </p><p> TAMMERO:  It's gotten pretty good reviews and the special effects are  supposed to be really good.  So we'll (ph) see it. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, well, that'll do it, special effects.  All right, I want to  get your take on this -- a Mexico-based movie theater chain launching two  new in-theater playgrounds in Southern California.</p><p> TAMMERO:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  .to draw audiences in.  So tickets cost $3 more.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Wow (ph).  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  .will be geared toward children ages three to 12.  But do you  want to go to the movies and have your kids play in a playground? </p><p> TAMMERO:  Popcorn and pink eye (ph), Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  That's all I'm saying.  Look, this is what theaters have to do.   You know, box office may be up on a dollar basis but attendance is flat or  down in most cases.  </p><p> There's a lot of competition out there with Netflix and other streaming  services.  People would rather stay home.  </p><p> So you've got to provide a reason for them to get out of the house and  actually go to the theaters.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I agree with that.  I'm in that category actually.  Give me a  reason, otherwise I'm watching in my.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Just give me a glass of wine and I am there.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly, exactly.  All right, we've got to talk about \"Star.\" </p><p> TAMMERO:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  .Fox new series featuring Queen Latifah and Lenny Kravitz,  along with model, Naomi Campbell.  Tell us about it. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Naomi Campbell, she came into Fox.  I sat down with her.  Let's  take a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> TAMMERO:  Naomi Campbell, thanks for stepping \"Into the FOXlight.\"  You  look amazing as always.  </p><p> NAOMI CAMPBELL, MODEL:  Never been here before.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  \"Star,\" big episode tonight.  </p><p> CAMPBELL:  Right.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Tell us a little bit about your character and what's going on  right now.  </p><p> CAMPBELL:  Basically, I'm the mother of Alexandra Crane.  And Alexandra has  gotten herself caught up with this lovely guy next door in Atlanta which  I'm against all of it.  </p><p> My daughter is rebelling big time for how her rock star father, who's  played by Lenny Kravitz and her fashionable (ph) -- tried to be rock star  mother, kind of abandoned her as a child.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ROSE SPENCER-CRANE:  Why do you tell those people I was dead?  </p><p> ALEXANDRA CRANE:  I think you might as well be.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TAMMERO:  That area you came up then (ph) in the '90s, the whole supermodel  -- it was such an era (ph) -- I don't think it's ever going to be  duplicated again.  </p><p> CAMPBELL:  I love the ladies I came up with.  And we also interacted with  each other and supportive of each other.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  What has it like been for you to sort of come up as a woman, sort  of like blaze a trail with modeling and then. </p><p> CAMPBELL:  My whole -- just period -- my whole existence, I feel, has been  a challenge.  And so I don't get -- I -- kind of when a challenge comes up,  I don't get like all that nervous and scared (ph).  </p><p> It feels normal to me.  I am a fighter.  I am a survivor.  And that's how I  -- you know, I don't take anything for granted.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Yes.  </p><p> CAMPBELL:  I commit to what I get and stand and want to be pushing for  (ph), whatever it is say yes to these days -- these days. </p><p> TAMMERO:  Well, thank you for saying yes to coming here tonight.  </p><p> CAMPBELL:  Oh, no, thank you for having me.  Nice (ph) to meet you.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  So great to meet you.  </p><p> CAMPBELL:  You, too.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  And we can catch you Wednesday night.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was awesome.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  That was great (ph).  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Michael, great stuff.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Such a legend.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  See you later.  Michael Tammero.  We'll be right back.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.

Good Friday morning.</p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thanks so much for joining us.  It is Friday, March  10th.</p><p> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Next hour we will get the February jobs report.  Economists are looking job  creation of 190,000 jobs as the economy last month with the unemployment  ticking down to 4.7 percent.  What you need to see and know about jobs,  coming up this morning.</p><p> On to our nation's infrastructure getting a nearly failing grade in a new  report -- it's an issue President Trump is watching closely.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Our infrastructure is in  serious trouble.  We will build new roads and highways and tunnels and  airports and railways across the nation.  We will fix our existing product  before we build anything brand-new, however.  We have to fix what we have.   It's a mess.  So we are going to fix it first.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The very latest on infrastructure plans on top of all the other  plans coming out this morning.</p><p> Checking market action, we are watching oil prices today.  We are seeing a  bit of a rally after a tough week -- crude rebounding after closing at the  lowest level since November yesterday.  Oil below $50 a barrel still but up  this morning, two-thirds of 1 percent.</p><p> That's helping equities.  Stocks are higher across the world; futures  indicating a gain of about 70 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average.   Of course, the jobs number will certainly dictate what happens with the  stock market.  So we will be watching that.  But the market right now  rallying ahead of the jobs number.</p><p> In Europe, similar story.  Stocks are up between half of a percent and two- thirds of a percent across the Eurozone indices.</p><p> And in Asia overnight, markets are mostly higher, take a look, with the  exception of China.  Shanghai composite down a fraction.  Japan was strong,  up one and a half percent on the Nikkei average.</p><p> Plus \"The Terminator\" eyeing a move to Capitol Hill?  Arnold Schwarzenegger  not ruling out a Senate run, apparently.  We've got the details on what  he's saying this morning.</p><p> And Honey Nut Cheerios loses its iconic bee.  Take a look.  Why General  Mills is making the move, coming up this morning.</p><p> And one toddler not impressed by Queen Elizabeth -- why he threw a tantrum,  coming up this morning.</p><p> All those stories ahead and joining me to talk all about it Fox Business  Network's Dagen McDowell; Barron's online editor, interim editor of  \"Barron's Magazine\", congratulations Jack Otter.  </p><p> JACK OTTER, BARRON'S MAGAZINE:  Thanks very much -- Maria.  Appreciate it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And \"New York Times\" bestselling author Peter Kiernan is here.   Good to see you.</p><p> PETER KIERNAN, AUTHOR:  Nice to see you again.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  Great show so far -- guys.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  Make sense of it -- Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it is Friday, after all.</p><p> But first this hour, President Trump set to face an uphill battle to follow  through on his promise to improve the country's infrastructure.  A new  report by the American Society of Civil Engineers giving the state of the  American infrastructure a near failing grade of D+.  The report is  estimating that restoring the country's facilities will cost more than $4.5  trillion outpacing President Trump's plan to spend $1 trillion.</p><p> Joining us right now is former Nebraska senator and 9/11 commission member  Bob Kerrey.  Senator -- good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> BOB KERREY, FORMER NEBRASKA SENATOR:  You're welcome.  Nice to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, anybody who's traveled these roads in our airports, I  guess has seen that.  But what do you make of this study.  It's bad.  </p><p> KERREY:  Well, it would be $4.5 trillion well spent.  I mean even a bridge  to nowhere employs people.  And there's no question it would add to  productivity and add to (inaudible) the economy.  It'll be money well spent  if we can somehow figure out how to do it.  That's for sure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do we do it, though?  I mean we keep facing this question,  whether it's Obamacare and, you know, subsidies, or the tax plan, and a  border adjustment tax to come up with ways to for all of that.  </p><p> KERREY:  I think -- look, I think governance matters. I think you have to  set it up so people have confidence that their money is going to be well  spent and it's not going to get sort of wrapped up into pork barrel  spending.  I think you could do that.</p><p> I think you're probably going to need a safe harbor for these things so you  can build faster because often times you find yourself up with 404  permitting -- that's a Corps of Engineers permitting process.</p><p> You have to figure out some way to give the American people confidence it's  going to be money well-spent.  And it is going to create jobs.  It is going  to strengthen the economy and that it can built rapidly.</p><p> I mean it's a problem.  I'm not sure we could build the interstate highway  system.  We darn sure couldn't build the Erie Canal.  So you've got to get  this thing set up so it can actually go as quickly as possible to really  creating excess jobs but confidence in the American people that it will  stimulate and grow the economy.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Some of the idea at least to pay for the $1  trillion because President Trump doesn't want to -- for the government to  spend taxpayer money of a trillion dollars but is for revenue sharing in  some projects.  Say toll roads, the private contractors.  </p><p> KERREY:  Look, money is money.  You only separate government money and  private money for ideological reasons.  So you're going to have to pull it  out of the economy one way or the other.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's a fair point.  But the reason that infrastructure is  crumbling -- and I don't know if you agree with this or not -- is because  individuals want their roads and bridges fixed but they don't want to pay  for it.  They don't want to pay higher gas taxes.  That's why the gas tax  hasn't gone up in more than 20 years.  </p><p> KERREY:  That's true.  That's true although most taxpayers when they  understand that they are paying a gas tax for the road, at least it's a  user fee.  They feel like they're getting something for it.</p><p> I think the larger question is can I get confident that the money is not  going to get spent on boondoggle projects and that sort of thing.  Do I  have a governing board of people who are really smart, who are evaluating  what needs to be done?  What are the highest priorities?  And then to make  sure that they can be done quickly.</p><p> You need some -- I said some sign of safe harbor environmental expediting  process so these things can be done quickly.  There's no question that it  will strengthen the economy done correctly.  </p><p> OTTER:  Senator -- would there be some way to create -- to get a group of  civil engineers or whoever it would be together and just have them make the  decision and then put it to Congress for an up or down vote rather than  letting, you know, a hundred senators all will get their own pork barrel  spending in there and suddenly, as you say, you've got a boondoggle -- </p><p> KERREY:  I'm not sure that's going to work because I don't think it's an up  or down vote issue.  I think it's a ten-year process; it's a 20-year  process.  It's not like it's a one-year deal.</p><p> One of the problems we had with the stimulus bill in 2009, was do I have  shovel-ready projects.  Well, what you needed was multiyear funding  confidence.  And that's a 10-year, 20-year process.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And the money was in many instances was allocated to states and  regions that didn't need infrastructure spending.  There were areas in  Connecticut where the roads got repaved that didn't need, where there were  stop lights put in that they didn't need them.  And that means that  somebody -- another area wasn't getting necessary money.  </p><p> KERREY:  Right.  There'll always be a little of that.  But I mean whether  civil engineers -- I mean just a governing board of people that are really  looking at where is the need, what would produce the greatest economic  benefit, what's best of our communities.</p><p> I mean this is not a difficult planning process and the $4 trillion doesn't  get spent in one year.  It's probably a ten-year, 20-year effort.  But I'm  just saying again, there's no question, done correctly, this would  strengthen the American economy.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  What about having something like a national infrastructure  development bank.  Some orchestrating body that would come together and  say, we are going to take the best ideas and the civil engineers.  We're  going to take the best ideas.  This is something both Democrats and  Republicans agree on.  What do you think of that idea?  </p><p> KERREY:  I think it's a good idea.  I think the selling point has to be are  you glad that your father's generation built the interstate highway?  Do  you think that the Erie Canal did something good?  The Erie Canal was  controversial.  Not a single member of the New York City delegation in  Albany voted for the Erie Canal.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> KERREY:  So these things get controversial in the moment.  I think it's a  good idea to create some kind of banking process just so you can get some  leveraging activity, to finance in a smart way.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's not a priority for the administration over the near term.   That's just -- I mean they have this failing grade but Steven Mnuchin and  company have been very clear -- Obamacare, tax reform in 2017, and then  they will consider infrastructure. </p><p> I mean it's there, it's on the agenda but I want to switch gears, Senator.</p><p> KERREY:  Ok.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I've got to get your take over this Russia story because the  fall-out over Michael Flynn's communications with Russia taking a new turn  this morning.  So the former national security adviser admitting to being a  foreign agent after getting paid for lobbying work that may have benefited  the Turkish government.</p><p>The Trump administration distancing itself from the controversy.  Watch  this.  We want your reaction.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Hearing that story today  was the first I heard of it.  And I fully support the decision that  President Trump made to ask for General Flynn's resignation.  I think it is  an affirmation of the President's decision to ask General Flynn to resign.  </p><p> SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  This is what he did for a  living.  He was a private citizen at the time.  There's nothing nefarious  about doing anything that's legal as long as the proper paperwork is filed.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you make of this?  How should we see this?  </p><p> KERREY:  It's not the question of is it legal or not; clearly it's legal.   The question is can you be the national security adviser if you have been  representing a foreign government, in this case Turkey, and I think the  answer is no.  And he should have told the President.</p><p> You know, it's not -- you want to do something.  I know what I have been  doing, I know whether or not that disqualifies me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's got to be up front.  </p><p> KERREY:  He should have known it was a disqualifying thing that he's done.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If he hadn't been kicked to the curve, so to speak, for lying to  Vice President Pence, he would be out the door because of this.</p><p> KERREY:  Well, he should -- he shouldn't -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If he all wasn't already gone, this would send him packing.  </p><p> KERREY:  Yes.  Look, all of us have a little bit of self-delusion going on  in our lives.  And I think this guy had a little bit more than most of us.   And he should have been able to recognize that he's representing Turkey, if  he's actually registered -- that's another question, did he register?   Regardless, if he's representing Turkey, he can't be the national security  adviser.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's your take on these wiretapping allegations from the  President?  </p><p> KERREY:  I don't know -- it's kind of bizarre.  That and a tweet on Arnold  Schwarzenegger in the same ten-minute walk around the second floor in your  jammies.  I was a little bit taken aback by the whole thing.  I think that  unfortunately for him, what it does is it strengths the case that we need  to -- a general investigation of this thing, one that gets confidence.</p><p> And I hope the Senate Intel Committee can to pull it off.  It's not easy to  do.  </p><p> OTTER:  What is it -- could we have a boy who cried \"wolf\" situation here.   I mean there's so many crazy things coming out of that Twitter account.  At  some point do people start to take the President with less authority than  they really should?</p><p> KERREY:  Well, I'm not sure he cares more about -- I think he cares more  about his ratings than he does his approval ratings.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, he's got that interaction going with the people.</p><p> KERREY:  Right now -- he's the highest rating show in the country.  You  have to get him credit for that.  Schwarzenegger got kicked off because his  ratings are down and Trump's ratings are up.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about Schwarzenegger because former California  governor Arnold Schwarzenegger could be considering a run for the Senate  according to Politico.  So Politico is reporting that on the heels of  President Trump and Schwarzenegger's feud over the ratings of \"The  Celebrity Apprentice\" and President Trump's leadership, do think  Schwarzenegger's dispute with the President has anything to do with his  possible -- </p><p> KERREY:  I would say if he gets elected, he's not going to be a reliable  vote for the President.  (inaudible) but I will bet my top bet of a dollar  that Arnold Schwarzenegger is not going to run for Senate.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How he would change the Senate?  </p><p> KERREY:  I don't think it changes much at all.  One more guy hitting the  camera.  So I don't think -- we will see what he does.  But I don't think  it's a fundamental change in the Senate politics.  As I said, I think it's  highly unlikely that he does it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean he won the governorship.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KIERNAN:  They both share -- they share a passion for the limelight.  And  they both milk it pretty well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, they do.  </p><p> KERREY:  Yes.  Well, you know, the limelight's pretty dim for a junior  senator, one out of 100 so we will see whether or not he pursues that.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  So he won't be back?  </p><p> KERREY:  No, I don't know.  We'll see.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what I was going to say.</p><p> OTTER:  Senator -- last night we had a big dinner for Barron's sponsors and  obviously Trump is the talk of every dinner table.</p><p> KERREY:  Yes.</p><p> OTTER:  And one financial guy I was talking to said if Trump is successful  as a president it could really hurt the concept of the career politician.   And Schwarzenegger would seem the obvious sort of person to start to fill  in if American people are looking for something other than a politician.</p><p> Do you think that's a -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KERREY:  He could also elevate the idea that somebody really ought to be  competent before he be put in the job, so.  </p><p> OTTER:  Very good point.  </p><p> KERREY:  Yes. </p><p> I don't think it does that.  I mean, there is something odd going on.  I  don't want a career politician and they want a career doctor, they want a  career lawyer, they want a professional in all of their ways and you do  acquire skills and knowledge the longer you are on the job.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I am going to push back because just because -- </p><p> KERREY:  Please do.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- he communicates with people differently.  Just because he's a  very different person doesn't mean that he's incompetent.</p><p> KERREY:  Well, I don't -- I'm not saying that he's incompetent.  That's not  the case I'm making.  But if you're going to go into politics there's a  certain (inaudible) that's required.  I mean I'm a fan of Governor Raimondo  and Governor Kasich of Ohio.</p><p> And you watch what they did, what watch Raimondo did to get the pensions  under control and saying as a Democrat, we've got to deal with pensions;  and took heat from the left, took heat from the right, Kasich did as well.   But they handled it in my view in a very professional fashion.  As a  consequence they get things done.</p><p> I'm not saying that Trump is, by any means, incompetent.  I'm just saying  if you're trying to actually move the ball down -- take health care, for  example.  This is not difficult to figure out what to do.  You're going to  lose the guys on the right, you're going to lose the guys on the left, you  put a bill together and you get it done.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But look at his first one hundred days.  Have you ever seen as  active a period for an incoming president?  What are we now?  Day 48, ok,  day 48 and how many executive orders has he done.  Look at the agenda --  Obamacare, tax reform.  </p><p> KERREY:  But Maria he has made no appeal to try to bring the country  together.  You have -- the demonstrations that are going on are not sort  organized by some malicious force.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the Dems have been obstructing.</p><p> KERREY:  This isn't the Dems.  This isn't the Dem that are on the streets.   This is Americans who are upset by many of the things that he said and many  of the things that he is doing.  He has made no appeal.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How can he do that?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He made an appeal in that speech, in that speech in front of  Congress.  He made an appeal.</p><p> KERREY:  But the people he's bringing into the government are substantially  on the right -- in many cases extreme right.  Take Pruitt of EPA.  If  you're concerned about the environment, you spend your time concerned about  the environment, this guy is not going to bring you on board.  He's not  going to do it.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  All right, we're going to leave it there.  We'll  be watching.  Senator Kerrey -- thank you.</p><p> We will be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> Massive protests underway in South Korea this morning after the country's  constitutional court formally removed the impeached president from office.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  The scandal has been going on, we should  say, for months here -- Maria.  At least two people have now died and about  30 others have been injured when supporters of President Park Geun-Hye  clashed with police in massive protest in that country.</p><p> The court's decision came months after a major corruption scandal plunged  that country into political turmoil.  She's the first South Korean  president to be thrown out of office by the court.</p><p> Meanwhile tens of thousands of people holding a peaceful rally celebrating  the court's ruling.  South Korea's Kospi index, we should say, did close  higher today.</p><p> Well, it is a day of reckoning for Volkswagen.  The German automaker  expected to plead guilty this morning to three criminal counts in the  Justice Department's diesel omissions investigation.  VW could also be  sentenced by the judge in the case. That company agreed in January to plead  guilty and pay $4.3 billion in fines for programming more than half a  million diesel cars to cheat on U.S. emissions test.</p><p>VW also admitted to lying to investigators to cover up that scheme.   Criminal charges have also been filed against seven VW employees.</p><p> Well, you may have noticed something missing on your Honey Nut Cheerios  box.  Look at it this morning if it's in your kitchen.  The maker of the  cereal, General Mills, has removed the mascot bee to raise awareness of the  vanishing bee colonies around the world.  The boxes now feature a white boy  where the bee used to be.  Bees are a big part of the world's food supply  we should say.  General Mills says 30 percent of the ingredients that are  used in its products rely on bee pollination.  Big move by a big company.</p><p> And finally, we all know kids can be kind of unpredictable but do you want  it to happen in front of the queen of England?  Well, two-year-old Alfie  threw a major tantrum.  As flowers were being handed to Her Majesty at an  official ceremony the meltdown happened at the unveiling of a war memorial  in London yesterday.</p><p> The kid is freaking out.  The queen met with young Alfie's father who was  awarded, by the way, a bravery medal and his wife.  Prince Philip and the  Queen pretty patient as Alfie continued to freak out the entire time.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  He is not having it.</p><p> CASONE:  He was like, whatever lady, get away from me, queen person.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  He deserves that bravery medal.  He decided to think about him,  give it to her.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So cute.</p><p> Cheryl -- thank you.</p><p> Coming up, cyber security risks in focus -- what the most recent WikiLeaks  dump means for the technology companies and the privacy of your  information.</p><p> Plus Michael Jordan scores a slam dunk, how he's cashing in on his own  mistake -- next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR:  It's something that I don't mean to freak you  out with, but I think it's true.  Even our memories are not absolutely  private in America.  Even our communications with our spouses, with our  clergy members, with our attorneys are not absolutely private in America.   The general principle is one we've always accepted in this country.  There  is no such thing as absolute privacy in America.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And of course, we are learning that more and more every day.   That was FBI director James Comey speaking candidly about privacy at a  cyber security conference earlier this week.</p><p> Of course, fresh concerns over personal privacy as well raised this week  after WikiLeaks published details about what it says are CIA tools capable  of hacking consumer electronics for espionage.</p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about cyber security is Tech Data CEO Bob  Dutkowsky.  Good to see you -- Bob.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p> ROBERT DUTKOWSKY, TECH DATA CEO:  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  First of all, your reaction to him saying even our memories are  not private -- what?  </p><p> DUTKOWSKY:  Well, if you think about we transpose everything that we think  about today into technology.  Social media causes us to think and publish  things freely and so as soon as information gets into a computer whether  it's a pc or a phone or a sensor on the end of IOT, there's a security risk  and it's exposed.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How nervous should we be though that like the smart TVs and the  smart phones that we all have are just not listening devices, that we are  being watched at all times?  </p><p> DUTKOWSKY:  I think it comes back to the integrity of the companies that  build the products and do they try to tighten them up as much as they can.   But it's technology and technology is exposed.  And so the whole cyber  security industry now is a massive industry.  And it's a place where Tech  Data is committed and invested heavily to be able to support our customers  and their users to make their environments more secure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you do?  Tell us about your cyber security business.  </p><p> DUTKOWSKY:  We partner with the companies in the IT industry that are  really the titans of the security industry -- companies like Cisco and IBM  and HP, Microsoft, Oracle and we take their security products and we sell  them into the small and medium-sized business all the way up to large  governmental agencies.</p><p> We are one of those routes to market that very few people understand exist.   We're a middle person between the developers of the industry and then that  community that needs cyber security.  </p><p> OTTER:  I would be interested to know on a personal level because you know  so much about this -- do you take any steps that viewers can learn from in  terms of your own life and security?  I mean I have an Amazon Echo in our  family kitchen.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're dead.  You're dead.  </p><p> DUTKOWSKY:  So does everyone.  To Maria's question, is Alexa listening to  us?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The device is spying on us.</p><p> DUTKOWSKY:  You know, so how else could Alexa wake up when you say Alexa  find Tim McGraw music unless Alexa is listening?  Clearly there's a threat  there.  But, you know, I think -- I think you have to be acutely aware at  all times about security today.</p><p> I've had my identity stolen and it's a really painful process.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Even you, the CEO of Tech Data had his identity stolen.  </p><p> DUTKOWSKY:  Back in the old IRS, remember when there was the IRS hack back  a couple of years ago.  My family and I were one of those ones that got  hacked and it's been an endless process now to try to protect ourselves.</p><p> But you know, there are the services that you sign up for that protect if  there's -- if somebody tries to open a credit card account or whatever.  I  would just encourage everybody to really think aggressively about security  all the way up to my company, Tech Data -- we have a cyber security  committee on our board of directors, one of the few Fortune 100 companies  that do that because half of our business comes to us over technology  electronically.</p><p> So you know, if you talk about enterprise risks, the whole idea of cyber  security for a company like Tech Data is really important and we govern it  from the top of the company to try to be secure.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Bob -- can I just ask you though because everybody was so upset  about the WikiLeaks release of whatever you want to call -- hacked CIA  tools.  But as more people go online, as our lives are increasingly  digitized and online on the Internet and the Cloud, isn't there the  expectation that the government keeps up with that technology development  in order to protect us and to hunt down terrorists which is what the CIA  was essentially doing with these tools?  There's no evidence that they were  spying on the American people.  </p><p> DUTKOWSKY:  You know, if you think about it one of the government's  responsibilities is try to keep us and the country safe and we built a  government over all these years that thought about wars, battles.  And now  there is a war in cyber security and the bad guys are just as smart and  just as talented as the good guys.</p><p> And so, you know, I think we are just in the very early innings of how the  cyber security war is going to play out.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  Bob, I have seen your company over the years.  In 1983 you guys  went into PCs and personal computers grew from there.  A few years ago you  went into data center and you just doubled down with a major acquisition  that takes in the data centers all throughout Asia.  What is your view on  the data center and where can we see your company going from there?  </p><p> DUTKOWSKY:  Yes, the data center, we do the data center as kind of the off- ramp to the next great technology area and that's commonly referred to as  the third platform.  And that's areas like security, mobility, big data  analytics, hyper-converged and converged infrastructure.  It's a whole new  arena of computing.</p><p> And all of it points to the data center as the place where the intellectual  property exists to make the next generation work.  And so Tech Data made a  decision to double down in the data center.</p><p> Our organic data center business was about $8 billion a year and now we  acquired the data center business from AVNET, another $8 billion.  And so  we'd be the largest data center player in the IT channel in the world.  And  we think it takes skills and commitment and capabilities and scale to be  able to really add value in that space and we made that move this week.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are major technology companies, do they have holes?  Because  Julian Assange is saying, look I'm going to help the major technology  companies fix their vulnerabilities.  And we haven't heard from tech  companies yet in response to that.  </p><p> DUTKOWSKY:  No one is perfect.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So there are vulnerabilities.</p><p> DUTKOWSKY:  Yes, I think every system in the world has a vulnerability.  If  it has technology, there's a space where a smart person can get at that.   And so the engineering efforts that take place in the world's leading  technology companies are all focused on trying to close up those gaps but  they are always moving.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you reported earnings this week.  You want to characterize  real quick where the growth was?  </p><p> DUTKOWSKY:  The growth was in security, all around our geographies, a  rebirth of the laptops because PC companies are innovating again and new  products are really attractive.  Mobility and software around the world --  a very, very good market for Tech Data.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll leave it. </p><p> Bob -- great to have you on the show today.  </p><p> DUTKOWSKY:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Bob Dutkowsky joining us -- CEO at Tech  Data.</p><p> Coming up drones are not welcome in Oklahoma, apparently.  The State  lawmaker who's proposing to allowing property owners to destroy any  trespassing drones.  That's next.</p><p> And then healthy living gets even smarter.  The gadgets you need in your  home to upgrade your daily routine.  We've got that coming up back in a  moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  Welcome back.  It's Friday morning, everybody.   I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thank you so much for being with us.  It is Friday,  March 10th on a snowy morning.  Take a look behind me.  It is official.  It  has started snowing in New York.  Yesterday it was 50 degrees.  Today we've  got a storm in front of us.  Here are your top stories 7:30 am on the East  Coast.  </p><p> We are waiting the February Jobs Report due out one hour from right now.   Economists are looking for Job Creation of 190,000 jobs to be added to the  economy last month, but the unemployment rate ticking down to 4.7 percent.   We'll get you those numbers as they get to take.  They are certainly  anticipating a good number.  After the number hitch Stuart Varney breaking  it all down with the president's top Economic Advisor, the Director of  Natural Economic Council, Gary Cohn will join Stuart and company at 10:00  am Eastern.  </p><p> So stay right here to hear from Gary Cohn on those jobs numbers.  First  off, take a look at market action, watching the price of oil this morning.   Crude is rebounding after closing it the lowest level since November.   Yesterday, it's up two-thirds of one percent this morning at 49.61.  Let's  (inaudible) the stocks across the world.  Futures pointing to gain at the  opening of trading this morning up 70 points on the Dow Jones Industrial  Average.  </p><p> We'll see what the numbers bring and if these changes.  In Europe, markets  are in the green as well.  Take a look, higher across the board in the  Eurozone industries.  Up about two-thirds of one percent across the board.   And in Asia overnight stocks mostly higher.  Shanghai composite, the one  exception, down a fraction.  Japan was strong up one and a half percent in  the Nikkei Average.  </p><p> The debate over drones why one lawmakers trying to make it legal for you to  take out a drone that flies out onto your property.  And better way to  track your families' health, the high-tech accessory that turn your  smartphone into a private physician.  We've got it all coming up with Dr.  Sizemore who's here.  Plus a slip of the tongue is leading to big bucks for  one basketball great.  </p><p> How Michael Jordan is cashing in on a (inaudible) that he made.  We'll tell  you about it.  First our top story this half hour.  One lawmaker wants to  protect homeowners from drones that fly onto their property.  A bill headed  to the OklahomaSenate floor would exempt people from civil liability if  they damage trespassing drones not regulated by the Federal Aviation  Administration.  </p><p> Joining us is Oklahoma State Senator Ralph Shortey.  State Senator Shortey,  good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> STATE SEN. RALPH SHORTEY (R), OKLAHOMA:  Good morning.  Thank you for  having me.  I appreciate it.</p><p> BARTIROMO: So, you authored this bill.  What is your reason behind it?   Let's talk first where you see the trouble.  </p><p> SHORTEY:  Oh, well, you know, first off, I support the industry  tremendously.  In fact, few years ago I was looking at starting a drone  service company that would do this kind of work.  So, the industry is a  thriving industry.  And I think of something that we really need to look  forward to the future.  How are you also got a balance of that private  property.  The expectation of privacy of landowners.  </p><p> And this is a bill, but I think is very balance in doing that.  There are - - there are still some changes that need to occur with it.  But for the  most part what it's going to do is where civil liability to landowners who  that damage the drone in any way that where there is a reasonable  expectation and privacy.  And right now there are two Supreme Court cases  that kind of control what airspace is and whose it is.  </p><p> That would be the Causby case from 1946 and then the Riley case from 1986.   That pretty much establishes that under the 400-foot threshold property  owners have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  The bill is written with  those wordings because as this evolves then the laws need to evolve as well  to grant enough liberty for the industry, but also protect the privacy  rights of citizens.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, I don't know how (inaudible) feels about this.  But I  agree with you.  I mean, things have gotten out of hand.  You've got drones  flying.  You don't know if they have a camera on them and if they are  spying on you and they are on your property.  Having said that, the  companies like Amazon and UPS they've started testing drone deliveries.  </p><p> So, how you address that if you've got a delivery coming -- or delivery  coming next door and the drone has to fly over your house to get to the  delivery that it has to make and it has a camera.  What you do you then?</p><p> SHORTEY:  Yes.  Well, that's -- and that's where, you know, we really need  some guidance from congress on where you're going to allow this.  I mean,  the Causby case is very clear.  It's at all the way up from 326 feet and  for sure 83-foot.  The FAA has no regulatory authority up to 83-foot on any  land and 326-foot from most properties.  And so, you know, I love it.  </p><p> I do Amazon Prime all the time.  I hope and I cannot wait for the first day  that a drone delivers a package to my door.  But it's got to be done  properly.  And, you know, if you invite that drone to your property you  don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy at that point.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Right.  Well...</p><p> SHORTEY:  But for those people that would.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You've done...</p><p> SHORTEY:  And that's why (inaudible) it's become -- it's become a public  safety issue.  We've got cattle rustlers that are using this to spy on  people's land so they can steal cattle.  We've got people using drones to  smuggle drugs into prisons.  And so, it's becoming a serious issue and it's  -- and it's widespread.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, drug smuggling is -- into a prison it's clearly not legal  but what about the use of drones to survey another man's property?  There's  no -- there's no law on the books right now that would say that you can't  do that.  That, to your point?</p><p> SHORTEY:  Well, I think -- I think the Supreme Court (inaudible) are -- I  mean, they are controlling law right now.  And the Supreme Court really  specifically state that the public has no access.  The public has no right  underneath 400-foot.  That's what the FAA regulates.  And so, when you're  talking about invading somebody's private property, we know the threshold  is at least 83-foot.  If you're flying a drone over somebody's property and  it's 10-foot, 83-foot, whatever.  </p><p> Then that property owner has a right to recourse.  And this is established.   Now again, this is not given any criminal liability protection.  Simply  civil liability protections.  So that way, if a drone operator is 10-foot  in your property and you bat that thing down with a bat or a net or an RF  interrupter or some kind of technology that can bring it down because  they're spying on you then the property -- the drone operator cannot sue  you for that.  </p><p> The perfect example is Senator Inhofe.  Every year he does a pigeon hunt.   Well, last year during this pigeon hunt (inaudible) just flew a drone right  overhead of these guys that were hunting these birds and one of them shot  it down.  Well, they sent Senator Inhofe a bill for that drone.  And that  could even sue him for the -- for the damage to that drone.  And that is  ridiculous.  That is a kind of stuff I'm trying to stop.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And so -- wait.  Let me just ask you.  Is that the way you  propose homeowners take that drone down by shooting it down?  Is that what  we should do?</p><p> SHORTEY:  Well, it's going to be -- it's going to be entirely different  depending where you are.  In the rural areas I think that would be -- if  it's -- if it's -- I mean, you got to understand the shotguns, the range is  30 to 50-foot (inaudible) you are not going to be able to shoot this thing  with a rifle.  They're just too small to do that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You'd shot down...</p><p> SHORTEY:  But I would -- I would -- I would suggest -- I would suggest some  kind of RF interrupter or even a net.  I mean, you know, it just -- it just  depends on the situation.  But if you fail... </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What if you don't have a gun?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  This is a feel-good bill of the decade.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What if you don't have a shotgun?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He's from Oklahoma.  Everybody's got a gun in Oklahoma.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But I'm in New York and there are drones flying all over  near my house.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, nobody -- yes, nobody owns.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think this is the feel-good bill of the decade.  I  think it's fantastic.  And I think -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I love it.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- Orkin and say, \"Here's a new kind of pest control.\"   Bring in Orkin, get the Orkin man, he'll take it out.  That's the way to  get rid of them.  I think there are a lot of frequency things you can do  without using a shotgun.  Although that might be fun.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, senator, one quick question.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> SHORTEY:  Yes.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It sounds as if we -- in addition to what you're trying  to do.  We really need a broader guideline on how drones appropriate, how  they're not appropriate and to try to regulate this because it can get a  little scary.  Do you have a big picture view of what we're going to be  doing, you know, over the next 10 years to make sure these things they'll  get out of control?</p><p> SHORTEY:  Yes, absolutely.  Congress has to act.  And, you know, right now  they gave the FAA the authority to regulate these things.  The regulations  came out this summer and they were not good enough.  They do not -- they do  not protect private property well enough.  And (inaudible) the job of FAA  too to protect private -- I mean, that's not -- their job is to regulate.  </p><p> Their job is not to create law.  Congress really needs to step in.  We're  going to have to set up some kind of a -- some kind of a commerce system  where, you know, you're going to protect private property interest to a  certain height and then there's going to have to be an area where these  things can fly that is regulated or that is authorized by congress so that  way they are not interfering with commercial traffic and they're also  protecting the private interest in the privacy interest of folks.  </p><p> We've got to do this.  This bill is simply right now (inaudible) call the  Aeronautics Commission a few weeks ago.  And there was a drone in her  backyard with flashing light, so she had no idea what to do with it.  Had  she taken some kind of action against that thing?  Then the drone operator  could have sued her.  This is simply a placeholder until congress fixes  this issue and figures out what to do with it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, the bottom line, State Senator, you think drones should be  regulated?</p><p> SHORTEY:  Absolutely.  And I think they're necessary.  I mean, I think it's  -- I think it's a great industry and I -- and I will support it.  But  absolutely got to be regulated.  And, you know, the interest the -- you  know, the government's interest is to protect the citizen first.  To  advance then the industry is second and then when there is conflict their  job is to come in and balance that conflict out.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> SHORTEY:  And that's what we need -- that's what we need the government to  do right now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Senator, good to have you  on the program today.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> SHORTEY:  Thank you very much.  You have a good day.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  State Senator Ralph Shortey joining us there from Oklahoma.  I  want to see what the Trump administration has to say about regulating the  drone industry.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This got to have to happen.  And by the way, there's a  lot of (inaudible) in cellular and other kinds of businesses where you have  to regulate.  Otherwise, people are going to be crossing over your line.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What are conservatives going to say about that?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to point one thing out.  Amazon if they start drone  delivery.  They'll just make you sign a waiver.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No question about it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  When you order.  If that's how they get around it. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, I'm on the board of the (inaudible) and one  of the things they're trying to do is defense plays a role here too.  And  this has to be orchestrated in some way because you have (inaudible)  flying, there are drones right near the airport.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That makes no sense.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you got to have to have your shotgun ready that's for sure.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  (inaudible)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  A doctor at your fingertips.  The devices that you  need to have to upgrade your lifestyle straight ahead.  And then markets  eyeing the February Jobs Report, we'll bring you the numbers and the  analysis in the next hour.  Stay with us.  Big day ahead with markets and  the jobs number coming out.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  From what you eat to what you breed it is  important to put good things into your body and with modern technology it's  easier than ever to track your health between doctor visits.  Oh, not only  for you but your children as well.  You can monitor results straight from  your phone.  </p><p> It's amazing what you can do today.  Joining me once again for part two of  our special series.  (inaudible) certified Cardiologist Preventive Health  Expert, Dr. Tiffany Sizemore.  Good to see you.  Thank you so much for  joining us.</p><p> DR. TIFFANY SIZEMORE, CARDIOLOGIST PREVENTIVE HEALTH EXPERT:  Hi.  Thanks  for having me again.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dr. Tiffany.  All right.  So we have some things.  I know  you're not associated with any of these companies.  </p><p> SIZEMORE:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That make these products.  But let first begin with the  thermometer.  This is a different thermometer then you showed us yesterday.   You also got the ear thermometer.</p><p> SIZEMORE:  So, yesterday was the temporal kind of scan (inaudible) through  the forehead.  This is a typical what a lot of parents are used to.  Just a  regular ear thermometer.  What's nice about it, it's just a one button push  and it also links to an app as well.  This is a Philips as well.  So, when  you take your child to the pediatrician then the pediatrician has a record  of all of the different temperatures.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p> SIZEMORE:  So, it's very straightforward.  It is a lot more expensive than  the one -- excuse me, inexpensive than the one we have on yesterday.  It's  a very good option.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Now, a lot of adults are interested in monitoring  their blood pressure.  There's a smart option for that as well so far.  </p><p> SIZEMORE:  Yes.  And as a cardiologist, these are very important to me.   So, again, we have a Withings blood pressure cuff and a Philips blood  pressure cuff.  Again, as with the other products that we had yesterday  they all link to an app.  So, the Withings are all link to the Withings  app, and the Philips all link to the Philips' app.  What's nice about this  is how small they are.  So, you can actually to put this in a tote if  you're a female and you could take it with you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's easy to do.</p><p> SIZEMORE:  Super easy to do.  I mean, I'll do it if you want me to.  But  you basically just put it on and hit a button.  And then with the Withings,  automatically launches the app and the app spits out your blood pressure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Incredible.</p><p> SIZEMORE:  Awesome.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let me -- let me ask you about improving sleep.  We  all need that here.  This is something that improves your sleep?  </p><p> SIZEMORE:  Well, this actually monitors.  Basically everything that's going  on -- well, not just everything, in your bedroom.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> SIZEMORE:  So -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Almost everything.</p><p> SIZEMORE:  Yes.  Almost everything.  I mean, mostly your activity but --  so, basically what's cool about this, it sleeps -- it sleeps underneath the  sheet.  So, you can imagine if it just goes underneath the tablecloth.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> SIZEMORE:  Underneath the sheet and it's got a very long extension cord  where it plugs -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Under the sheet?</p><p> SIZEMORE:  -- into the wall.  Yes.  So, you don't have to touch anything.   As soon as you lay on the bed it starts monitoring.  It goes directly to an  app.  It tells the temperature, the humidity in the room, what your  respirations were at night, what your heart rate was at night.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, it'll tell you when you're having real Z's like a good  night -- </p><p> SIZEMORE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- sleep versus getting up a lot?</p><p> SIZEMORE:  And it also links to an app.  And so, it can tell what kind of  level of sleep you're in and when is most appropriate for you to wake up so  you're not alarmed.  So, it has the smart alarm set to it as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Very interesting.  All right.  That's about $140 there.  Tell  us about the air monitoring devices.  Why do we need air monitoring?</p><p> SIZEMORE:  You know, I think this is great for people with children maybe  if they have animals or people that have allergies that are concerned about  the allergens in the air.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, for school.  Yes, yes, that's right.</p><p> SIZEMORE:  So, this is -- basically it's the same exact product but one is  made out of wood and one has a silicon rubber.  So, this is great for  nurseries because it's -- it has rounded corners.  It's not very hard.  And  I'm not sure if it'll show up here.  But basically it analyzes the air and  spits out the number in the app from zero to one hundred.  </p><p> One hundred being wonderful air quality, zero being not so great.  That app  then then tells you why your air quality is not good and then gives you  advice as to what to do to improve the air quality.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because there could be particles in the air and that will  -- </p><p> SIZEMORE:  Right.  And then carbon dioxide -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p> SIZEMORE:  -- dust, chemicals.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, that's really important.</p><p> SIZEMORE:  It's great.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Then you've got a smart kitchen scale here.  We saw  the scales that we had yesterday.  That's an -- </p><p> SIZEMORE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- an actual scale.  This is the kitchen scale.  </p><p> SIZEMORE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's that all about?</p><p> SIZEMORE:  This is actually it's great because it's very lightweight.  It  weighs basically nothing.  So, it's easy to get around in your kitchen.  It  weighs solids and liquids.  And if you can see.  I'm not sure if -- I'll do  it here.  But -- I don't know if they hit the zero.  But anyway -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, how much it weighs?</p><p> SIZEMORE:  It shows you how much it weighs.  It's very accurate.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, why do I need that?</p><p> SIZEMORE:  This is also great too.  It's also has an app and you can -- it  tells you based upon what you're putting on the scale it tells you calorie.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes (inaudible) </p><p> SIZEMORE:  It tells you carbohydrate, it tells you if you're trying to  watch your sodium intake.  So, it's really -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.</p><p> SIZEMORE:  -- good for people who do have some cardiovascular issues that  have to watch certain sodium intake.  It's also good for people who are  really trying to watch what they're eating in terms of carbohydrate to lose  weight.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredibly informant.</p><p> SIZEMORE:  Yes, it's awesome.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, we do need that.</p><p> SIZEMORE:  I don't cook so I'll never use it.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tracking workout.  There's a lot of things to track your  workout today, right?  But this is -- it can record distance traveled and  how many push-ups you did?</p><p> SIZEMORE:  Yes.  So, this is really great for people who don't really want  to wear a smart watch.  They're not into being, you know, having every  single step they take monitor.  This is actually a chest trap and you use  it only when you're actually exercising.  </p><p> And it is probably the most accurate because it is right by the heart and  it's excellent at measuring exactly what your pulses, how many push-ups  you're doing.  So, in terms of accuracy it's probably the best.  But it's  not something you're going to wear every day.  It's only something that you  wear when you exercise.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, it just really monitoring your heart rate?</p><p> SIZEMORE:  Correct.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  OK, good stuff.  Dr. Tiffany great to see you.</p><p> SIZEMORE:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks for going through all of this.</p><p> SIZEMORE:  Absolutely.  Thanks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Of course, this is great.  Tiffany Sizemore joining us there.   Take a short break.  When we come back, Michael Jordan's slip of the tongue  is now paying off big time.  How he's cashing in on the mistake he made.   And then catch my interview with Tony Robbins on Wall Street Week this  weekend.  We talk everything from his business empire to his investing  tips.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A wild first day of free agency in the NFL.   Jared Max joins us now with the whole story.  Jared.</p><p> JARED MAX, FBN SPORTSCASTER:  Happy Friday, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And to you.</p><p> MAX:  When players have the power to break their own new stories on social  media it can lead to confusion.  Like we have at this very moment.  Around  4:00 am Eastern Time less than four hours ago.  The verified Instagram  account of Patriots backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo posted this, \"So  grateful for my time in New England.  Peace out Boston.\"  </p><p> What's worse is that the top NFL insiders believe this was a prank or a  hoax that Garoppolo's account was hacked.  NFL.com's Ian Rapoport tweeted  this morning, \"Spoke to someone in the grandma point --dash mike the  verified instagram report.  They believe it was a prank or hoax.  They  tweeted this morning.  </p><p> Spoke to someone close to Garoppolo who had no knowledge of any trade and  believes it's a hack.  And WBZ in Boston says, \"The Patriots spokesman  saying the team is not aware of Garoppolo leaving.  Stay tuned.\"  One  Instagram post from an NFL quarterback we can verify as genuine.  This  video posted yesterday by soon-to-be ex-Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony  Romo.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TONY ROOM, QUARTERBACK, DALLAS COWBOYS:  Me and my family felt the  outpouring support and love from all of you.  It's been overwhelming.  And,  you know, it doesn't go unnoticed.  So, I want to say thank you and we have  a lot to think about going forward but we'll see what happens.\"</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MAX:  For the times they aren't changing.  You catch that plane at the  background?  Romo was not released by the Cowboys as wildly reported  yesterday.  He could get traded now.  Perhaps to the Houston Texans.  One  year since they snagged quarterback Brock Osweiler from Denver Broncos for  the $72 million dollar contract.  Texans traded Brock Osweiler yesterday to  the Cleveland Browns.  </p><p> Houston frees up to $10 million and salary cap space perhaps for Tony Romo.   And they get a fourth round draft pick this year.  Second and six rounders  in next year.  But Osweiler reportedly could be traded baked to be flipped  in another deal.  Browns have said to be interested in Jimmy Garoppolo.  A  federal lawsuit was filed yesterday against the NFL.  Over 1,800 former  players are suing the league they claim that medical staffs on team's  pumped up players with powerful pain medications an anti-inflammatories to  keep the players on the field.  </p><p> The sue claims that teams pressure the medical staffs to inject the players  with the pain killers to keep them in playing condition.  And anybody  turned on the TV yesterday and wondered why Michigan basketball players  were wearing their practice jerseys against Illinois?  Well, because the  FAA and the NTSB are investigating why the Wolverines' charter flight had  skidded 400 yards approximately off the runway, Wednesday.  </p><p> Well, the team does not have access to its luggage.  It's under  investigation part of it.  So, this contains the Wolverines' uniforms home  in a way along with shoes and warm-ups.  So, they had to wear the jerseys,  the practice jerseys yesterday.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Huh?</p><p> MAX:  And they'll continue to do it because the stuff is -- they can't get  to it.  It's under investigation.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, what about this thing in the NFL with the pumping  them up with pain killers?  I mean, anybody who read North Dallas Forty,  you know, this has been going on for 50 years, 40 years, forever and ever.</p><p> MAX:  Yes.  And, you know, and this is -- there's another argument against  this which is been going on and tied with other stuff with medical  marijuana where they are trying to -- players, ex-players, current players  saying this is what they want for treatment.  And the NFL not going in that  direction.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I tell you, this is a big cost to pay.  To -- and that's what  Jason Herston told us yesterday.  And when I said to him, \"Would you go  into the NFL today?\"  He was like, \"It's a big cost to pay.\"  But I want to  ask you about this rebound.  NBA legend Michael Jordan turning a simple  slip up into big money.  During the Duke-North Carolina basketball game on  Saturday, the Tar Heel alum accidentally said the ceiling is the roof  instead of the sky's the limit.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ceiling is the roof.  And so now he's embracing the phrase  reportedly (inaudible) to sell the shirt that says \"Ceiling.  Roof.  Goat.\"   Which it stands for greatest of all time.  Oh, that's funny.</p><p> MAX:  Imagine it was a brilliant marketing plug by Michael Jordan for his  brand.  Screw up really badly.  Make itself deprecating and then sell the  shirt.  It's like the baseball cards, the misprints for the most popular  ones always.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he's going to make good money on it, huh?</p><p> MAX:  Yes, good money.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Note to the kiddies, when you screw up just own it. </p><p> MAX:  Own it.  Own it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he is.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's owning it all right.  And he's owning it all the way to  the bank.  Jared, thank you.  We'll be right back.

Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thank you so much for joining us.  It is  Friday, March 10th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 on the East Coast.  It is Jobs Day, we are 30 minutes  away from February Jobs report.  Economists are looking for 190,000 jobs that have added to the  economy.  Peter Kiernan says it's going to be --</p><p> PETER KIERNAN, FORMER GOLDMAN SACHS PARTNER:  A blowout.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A blowout.  The unemployment rate expected to take down to 4.7 percent.  If we get a big  number, it's going to impact the markets and obviously we're expecting interest rate hike next week on the  15th.  The numbers as soon as they hit the tape on to you.  The growing debate over healthcare in  America meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan trying is to explain why the current plan should be passed  but not all republicans are onboard yet.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PAUL RYAN, SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  This is the  closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare.  The time is here, the time is now, it really  comes down to a binary choice, we now have the ability through the budget rules that we have in the  senate with our three-pronged approach to actually make good on our word.  </p><p> JIM JORDAN, UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE FOR OHIO:  God bless the speaker but that's not  how the legislative process works, right?  If you -- if you got an idea that you can get to the floor, bringing  the member to the floor.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The very latest straight ahead this morning.  Meanwhile, markets rallying today ahead of  jobs report.  Check out this market, we're off of the highs of the morning, nonetheless double-digit move.   Dow Industrial is expected to be up about 60 points, NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500, also higher.  NASDAQ up  about 14 points, anticipating a very strong jobs number for the month of February.  We're checking wages,  we are checking the participation rate as well in 30 minutes' time.</p><p> In Europe, the markets are looking like this, also gains across the board, you got the major averages there  up between half and two-thirds of one percent.  In Asia overnight, markets are mostly higher with the  exception of China, take a look, Nikkei average in japan up 1 1/2 percent.  Hang Seng, up a quarter of a  percent.</p><p> In Hong Kong, watching the price of oil, all of a sudden markets once again focused on the oil market.   Crude prices are recovering a bit this morning.  A little stabilization here after closing at lowest level  since November yesterday, oil $49.64 a barrel.  Pope Francis signalling another possibly change to the  church.  Why he said he may allow married men to join clergy.  </p><p> Plus, remembering the rapper Notorious B.I.G., one congressman using the house floor for a tribute to  Big.  We will show you the results coming up.  And Game of Thrones are dealing the premier of its next  season but the announcement had fans going crazier than the mad king.  All those stories coming up this  morning.  And joining to talk all about it, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, Barron's Interim  Editor Jack Otter, and the editor online, New York Times best-selling author Peter Kiernan.  Great to see  you.</p><p> KIERNAN:  Great to see you too.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congratulations.  Got a promotion.</p><p> JACK OTTER, BARRON'S INTERIM EDITOR:  I appreciate.  Thanks very much, Maria.  We have to  make Barron's even better.  </p><p> MARQUEZ:  Yes.  We're going to keep watching that and we will show you the cover of Barron's coming  up in the hour.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  But first, jobs -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jobs, jobs, jobs.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's our number one priority and we are looking at it, we got the numbers coming  out in 30 minutes, so stay with us on that.  Meanwhile, Capitol Hill this morning is buzzing as well.   Republicans are moving forward with the replacement of Obamacare, despite mounting skepticism for the  bill.  Blake Burman live at White House right now with very latest.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Maria.  Good morning to you.  And a senior administration official is telling Fox this morning that this is  President Trump in his element at the moment.  We are told that the president is currently in deal making  mode as it relates to the American healthcare act, that senior administration official saying the president  is listening to the numbers, all of the numbers here weighing all of his options.</p><p> They remain very confident here at the White House that this thing will eventually get passed.  Take a  listen to the Vice President Mike Pence.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are very confident because of  President Trump's leadership and support here in the congress.  I'm very confident we'll repeal and  replace Obamacare and that will all be done by this spring.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  The sales pitch though is very much under way, for example, Paul Ryan yesterday, the house  speaker was up on the Hill, literally with his jacket off, his shirt rolled up as he gave a PowerPoint  presentation, trying to pitch this plan one in which he describes a binary choice essentially take it or leave  it repeal and replace Obamacare going forward.  However, there are many conservative skeptics here, one  of them being Rand Paul who rejected that binary choice label and said last night that the bill as it stands  is currently dead on arrival.  </p><p> RAND PAUL, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY:  The speaker needs to like  bring people into the room, conservatives and hear what we want, we are withholding our vote.  This is a  message for the speaker, we are withholding our vote, we want a seat at the table and it's not a binary  choice.</p><p> BURMAN:  Back in what that senior administration official is telling Fox this morning, Maria, we are  told Mick Mulvaney, the head of OMB is working 20-hour days at this point listening to the opposition,  taking in ideas trying to make that work and -- this work and as a senior administration official says,  nothing is locked in stone at this morning, that person tells us that everyone will get either something they  love, but there will be things that they love and things that they love less.  That is how it was phrased to  us, Maria.  Back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The got to get onboard together with the things that they love and hopefully come out  with a bill that they're all behind and the budget of course going to be release next week, Mick Mulvaney  working on that and that's on Wednesday.  Blake, good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> BURMAN:  Bye. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great reporting as always from Blake Burman at the White House.  Well, first  Obamacare, then tax reform, senator majority leader Mitch McConnell now suggesting that the White  House is August decline for reform may be unrealistic.  The Trump administration still sticking to the  timeline.  Watch this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MITCH MCCONNELL, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY:  I think finishing  on tax reform will take longer.</p><p> SPICER:  The president's uniquely qualified as a businessman, a successful businessman to understand  the -- what a good business climate does to job creation.  For him this is deeply personal and I think that  you're going to see Secretary Mnuchin and others work on the contours of that in the next several weeks  but we intend to maintain to the schedule that he laid out.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, Senior Strategist BGC Partners, Fox News About Contributor Steve  Cortes.  I don't know, Steve.  Good morning to you.  I don't -- </p><p> STEVE CORTES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm feeling like the administration and now Mitch McConnell are trying to manage  expectations.  Take the expectations down in terms of tax reform, this market up 14 percent since Election  Day, if we don't see tax reform by august, what happens? </p><p> CORTES:  If we don't see it by august, I think we're going to see a serious correction not just in the  market but in the real economy and that's why it just simply can't happen and I don't want to hear  naysaying from somebody like Mitch McConnell, you know, you were just talking about NFL free agency,  well, the American voter, gave the republicans the ball on the one-yard line first and goal by giving us  both houses of congress and the Oval Office and they are demanding as they should, they're demanding  outcomes that they voted for, including a repeal and replace and including tax reform.</p><p> So I believe the president is going to be successful, our deal maker in chief, he is really on a charm  offensive, he's having lunches and dinners and bowling, he's the charmer in chief lately too, he's going to  twist arms, he's going to persuade people, we're going to get this done on the White House this timeline  and we have to for the people.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we'll see it, Dagen, I mean, he's going to through to sell that Obamacare plan  this weekend, right?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Or whatever you want to call it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  In Kentucky.  You're going to Kentucky.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Exactly.  Where -- by the way, you won six more counties than Rand Paul who's  opposed to GOP plan coming out of the house.  But Steve, I want to bring this, it's not a complete repeal  which is what some conservatives have a problem with.  That it still requires government handouts for  people to buy insurance whether you -- so they're not called subsidies, they're called tax credits but  refundable tax credits, that it's still -- you've got all the senators and governors who accepted this giant  Medicaid expansion, fussing about that going away in 2020 and the conservatives want it gone even  sooner than that.  So how do you bring those two sides together? </p><p> CORTES:  Right.  No.  And Dagen, look, you make great points, I tend to lean pretty libertarian, so this is  an imperfect bill to be sure but I don't think we should make the perfect the enemy of the good.  And what  we are trying do -- what the administration is trying to do here I think is satisfy both house conservatives  among republicans and then senate liberals among republicans, and so to thread that needle is incredibly  difficult but I think this bill does and by the way, one thing I will push back at, a tax credit is not a  subsidy.  When you pay money to the government and get some it back, that is not a subsidy.  It is for  people who don't pay taxes.  But it is --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  If it's refundable and in this bill, it's refundable, now a small percentage of people will get  it but when you don't pay taxes and you get money back through a tax credit, that's a handout, that's a  subsidy.</p><p> CORTES:  Right.  For those people but for most of us who pay taxes, it's not a subsidy.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to leave there but I know you're sticking with us for our Jobs in  America Special this hour, Steve.  Thank you.  Stay right there.  </p><p> CORTES:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Still ahead.  Could we see soon see a seismic shift for Catholics, why Pope Francis says  the church may no longer be married to one longstanding tradition.  </p><p> Then we are less than 20 minutes away from the first full jobs report for the month of Trump's presidency.   We're breaking down what you need to know about jobs, markets off of the highs right now going into the  number.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Pope Francis signaling that he is open to married men becoming priests.   Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now.  Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  So this big news in the catholic  community, Maria.  In an interview with German newspaper, Pope Francis says the church must study  whether it's possible ordain married men to become catholic priests as the church is facing a shortage of  them in remote communities.  The pope says the option would allow men who are already married to be  ordained but single men who already are priests would not be allowed to marry after the fact.  We will  keep you posted.</p><p> And other headlines this morning.  Hip hop has made it to the house of representatives.  Brooklyn  Congressman Hakeem Jeffries paid tribute to the late rapper Biggie Smalls also known, I was just told as  Notorious B.I.G.  because the whole crew has been on me about this.  He was killed 20 years ago  yesterday, well, Jeffries recited the lyrics to the 1994 song Juicy, listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HAKEEM JEFFRIES, UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE FOR NEW YORK:  It was all a dream, I  used to read Word Up! Magazine, salt-n-pepa and heavy D up in the limousine, hanging pictures on my  wall, every Saturday rap attack, Mr.  Magic, Marley Marl.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, Biggie Smalls rose in streets of New York to be one of the successful rap  artist in history.  He was killed in drive-by shooting in Los Angeles back in 1997.  And finally, for your  Game of Thrones fans, we now know that season seven of the hit series is going to start on July 16.  Mark  your calendars, HBO making the announcement during a 15-minute long segment on Facebook live.  And  a very cool twist of marketing guys, the news was hidden in a giant block of ice and then viewers had to  comment fire to melt the ice.  Games of Thrones also releasing an official teaser that included \"from past  seasons.\" </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> EMILIA CLARKE, DAENERYS TARGARYEN IN THE HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES:  I know  what my father was, what he did.  I know the Mad King earned his name</p><p> DAVID RINTOUL, KING AERYS II TARGARYEN IN THE HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES:   Burn them all.  </p><p> MARK ADDY, ROBERT BARATHEON IN THE HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES:  Kill ever  Targaryen.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  And for all the drama, the video actually had a few stops and starts of the ice gimmick by the  way, it lasted longer than an average episode of Game of Thrones which we hear, Maria.  Pretty long.   Anyway, people are obsessed with the show.  I'm very excited about this whole thing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Everybody really is, you're right.  Cheryl, thank you.  Up next, the February Jobs report  moments away.  What you need to know ahead of the release.  What it will mean for markets and your  opportunities.  Stay with us.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are just under 10 minutes away from February Jobs report.  Here is  what we're expecting.  Economists are looking for 190,000 jobs added to economy in the last month in  February with the unemployment rate ticking down to 4.7 percent.  We want to bring in our all-stars right  now, the founder of capitalistpig.com, Jonathan Hoenig is with us, the host of Making Money With  Charles Payne, Charles Payne with us, and, of course, Steve Cortes is also with us along with our great  panel here, Charles good to see you.</p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, MAKING MONEY WITH CHARLES PAYNE HOST:  You too.  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good job, Charles.  You want to do any rapping before we start?</p><p> PAYNE:  I think I get it out of my system.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He was rapping, he just --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Give us one.  </p><p> PAYNE:  We got to do it?  OK.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Go.</p><p> PAYNE:  It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! Magazine, salt-n-pepa and heavy D up in the  limousine.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  Thank you for that.  Now --</p><p> PAYNE:  No, really.  That was -- that was a very uplifting song.  The guy was really happy that he made  it out of the hood and he took his friends with him.  That's a beautiful thing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Awesome.  Tell us about jobs now, Charles.  </p><p> PAYNE:  I think a lot of people going to make it out of the hood in February according to jobs report -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You think it's going to be a blowout?</p><p> PAYNE:  Let me tell you guys.  I think we under reported that ADP report and I know that ADP is not  BLS, Bureau of Labor Statistics but the goods producing part of that, the headline hogged everything,  298,000, that wasn't the story.  106 goods producing jobs is the highest number ever for ADP report going  back to 2002.  That's the highest they've ever seen.  66,000 constructing jobs, over 8,000 money jobs,  money jobs pay $28 an hour, these are good paying jobs and by the way, this is the epicenter of the  financial crisis, the great recession, hit these people harder than anything else.  How did Donald Trump  win Pennsylvania, how did he win Wisconsin?  Was these folks didn't have a job, it felt like everyone  ignored their pleas and now a lot of them are getting jobs now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  So money is finally breaking out.</p><p> PAYNE:  Money had a good number.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's one area we're going to watch with this -- with this jobs report.  Let me quickly get  your take on snap because it went public over a week ago, it was obviously a rocky debut although going  into it, it was priced 17, Peter, it opened to 24.  You said sell it when?  </p><p> KIERNAN:  I sold it 25 on air on Fox Business News.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Nice.  Sweet.</p><p> KIERNAN:  The reason was if you look at 8 of the last 10 big tech IPOs, they all in one year traded below  the IPO price.  So people are watching, do not chase these deals, do not, they will always --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Can I sell it here if I own it at 22.71?</p><p> KIERNAN:  You know, I'm not in love with this company right now, I think it is priced at about 35  billion market cap, something like that, 30 billion.</p><p> PAYNE:  Just to piggyback on that, the top 20 if you go back in the last several years, peak at 38 days on  average and then go down for four months straight.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> PAYNE:  That's the stat.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So that was the trend?</p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jack Otter, Barron's called it, you said to sell it, you told leaders.  </p><p> OTTER:  Barron's was negative on it, I mean, it was 93 times sales.  Even if this year optimistic sales  reach a billion dollars, that's still 34 times sales, it's just you the too expensive.  And I always hate to bet  against the technology company that's young, that's exciting, 158 million excited users including my 13- year-old daughter who loves it, but you got to wonder if Snap can really go in direction of Facebook which  has such huge broad base, Twitter might be a better comparison, you know, we all use Twitter but didn't  catch on the way that some other social media companies do and we're coming out with a story tomorrow  where we say maybe GoPro is actually the better example and that is not been a good stock.  I actually left  my GoPro.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you're comparing -- you're comparing Snap to GoPro.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's check out cover of Barron's.  Let's reveal.  Give us big reveal for the cover this  weekend because you got a story in the ETFs.</p><p> OTTER:  Yes.  We got some of the smartest people in ETFland.  In fact, three of those people control 80  percent of the assets on the management in the ETFland, so we're asking them what's next?  It's a very  interesting financial device.  I mean, it gets kind of geek, so, Dagen will love it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I was the first financial reporter to cover ETF 20 years ago.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  It's been 20 years, huh?  </p><p> OTTER:  Nearly 20 years old.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Exactly.  </p><p> OTTER:  But for instance -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was our first words.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> OTTER:  In a big day in the market, people are buying ETFs all day.  Well, toward the end -- towards  4:00 then the market needs to start adjusting for all those buys, so people start loading, they have to -- they  have to rebalance, so they start loading up on stocks on a bad day it goes the other way.  So it really  changes the dynamics of the market and that's going to be a story going forward.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jump in here.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  Yes.  I think ETFs are going to be worth watching because in market interruptions, they do  not perform -- excuse me, anywhere like stocks because there isn't sort of dynamic market making  underneath.  And I think this is one is the -- I think Achilles heels of the ETF.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The big story Barron's this weekend that we'll be watching.  We got the February Jobs  report right after break.  We're not going to miss it, we got all details next.  Back in a moment.  Stay with  us, markets rallying going into that jobs report.</p><p> JONATHAN NOVACK , TENNIS CHANNEL'S COURT REPORT HOST:  Hey guys.  Tennis Channel  Jonathan Novack with another special court report for Fox Business.  The temperatures hit the 80s in  Coachella Valley on day two of the 2017 BNP Paribas Open.  And Thursday I saw one young American  move on to second round for th3e biggest win of his career so far.  </p><p> Bjorn Fratangelo is a former junior champion at Roland Garros, and he's 23-year-old showed his class as  he dispatched Bernard Tomic in straight sets.  Fratangelo closing out the victory just over an hour,  Bernard Tomic's fourth opening round loss since the Aussie Open.  </p><p> Lauren Davis started the year by lifting the trophy in Auckland and she continued that kind of form with  an excellent comeback against Victoria Golubic.  Up next, Anastasija Sevastova.  And don't forget, PC  Plus in tennis channel live coverage from Indian Wells, continues Friday 1:00 pm Eastern.  I'm Jonathan  Novack.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday everybody.  Thank you so much joining us.  It is Friday,  March 10th.  Breaking news, we are moments away from February Jobs report, here is what we are  looking for.  Economists looking for 190,000 jobs to have been added to the economy in the month of  February.  The unemployment rate expected to tick down to 4.7 percent.  Markets are rallying going into  the report, it's just two minutes away.  Take a look where markets are, now at highs of the morning, up 76  points on the Dow Jones Industrial average.  Jonathan Hoenig is with us this morning.  Give us your  thoughts ahead of this number.  We all spoke with the panel already and people are looking for a very  strong number.  What about you? </p><p> JONATHAN HOENIG, FOUNDER OF CAPITALISTPIG.COM:  Yes.  I think you'll see a beat, Maria,  you saw in the ADP number yesterday but ironically a beat for jobs will be a bad thing for the economy,  you know, jobs come less, we talked for eight years about where are jobs, the jobs are finally here, I think  you see --- buy rumor, sell the fact and a good jobs number actually precipitates a decline and a correction  for stocks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't know about that, Dagen.  Yesterday you made such an important point because  you said, look if we get a good jobs number, that's a vote of confidence, things are getting better.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  And watch the government jobs because remember Donald Trump when he  became president froze federal hiring in late January, this is the first time that's going to show up in this  report.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  They'll be down.  They've been down but I always still disagree with Jonathan in the sense  that, you know, let's get it going, you know, 300, 400, 500,000 jobs, you know, I think good is a relative  term these days and a stronger than expected number is still not kind of good jobs number I think that will  be counterintuitive to the market or the economy.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look, I used to do this a minute before number but you put a three handle on it.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KIERNAN:  I think we're going to have a good show and I don't it's going to take the market down.  I  really think that what we're beginning to see is a second leg, we have the Trump rally and now we have  the proof in the pudding part of the rally and if we get good jobs, I think we're going to see the market  continue to grow here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Guys, we're all talking about jobs, what about wages, OK?  Steve Cortes, do you think  we're going to see any movement up 2.8 percent?  It's what people are looking for year over year wages.  </p><p> CORTES:  I do.  Maria, wages are finally moving.  I gave up pessimism for lent, so I'm going to tell you  that we're going to have a blowout number.  I think 300 is possible.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You do, so you are with Peter as well -- as well say that.  And then there's the  participation rate guys, real quick.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It was up 2/10 of a percent, in January at 52.9, let's hope it goes up.  </p><p> CORTES:  Indeed.  I want to see wages go up because if we get enough -- people hired eventually they're  going to have to start paying them more unless participation -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  The number is on top.  It's going to be out in a moment.  Let's get to Peter  Barnes, he's at the Labor Department right now with the news.  Peter Barnes, over to you.</p><p> PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:   235,000 new non-foreign payroll jobs in February, Maria.  235,000 new payroll jobs last month.  The first  full month of the Trump administration and above analysts' expectations.  The unemployment rate ticking  down to 4.7 percent from 4.8, as more than 300,000 people returned to the labor force last month.  And  that sent the labor force participation rate, up to 63 percent, the highest level in a year.  Hourly wages rose  by 0.2 percent last month, to $26.09 an hour.  Year over year, wages are up 2.8 percent.</p><p> Construction had a great month last month, up 58,000 jobs, the biggest monthly increase since March  2007.  But likely due in part to the warm weather we've been having around the country, manufacturing  jumped 28,000 jobs.  But retail down, 26,000, likely post-holiday cuts.  Education and health, up 62,000.   Business and professional services, plus 27.  Leisure and hospitality, plus 26.  And government, added  8,000 jobs mostly at the local level.  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Peter, thank you.  We're seeing the markets react positively.  It is better than  expected, but we - is it fair to say it was better than expected but that was expected?  Peter, what do you  think?  </p><p> PETER KIERNAN, GOLDMAN SACHS FORMER PARTNER:  I think it was one of those in line, I  think where you're going to see nice fallout is.  This really clears any underbrush away from a rate hike  next week, that's going to happen.  And when that happens, I think you're going to see a very nice move  in the financials.  They've moved very nicely so far, but this - if particularly, if the fed wants to do four  rate hikes this year, which they could potentially do.  That could put billions of dollars of earnings into  banks.  </p><p> JACK OTTER, BARRONS.COM EDITOR:  We all groan when the number came out because we were  really expecting them to over deliver -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I didn't.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I did not groan. </p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  You said 2:30?  You won the bed,  by the way.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, you did. </p><p> OTTER:  Good solid number, it's only bad if you are judging by ADP.  And you think, oh my gosh!  We're  going to have some incredible - but this is a solid number and, you know, I know Charles wants to see as  4, 500.  But we are albeit a very slow, this point of recovery, we are eight years into recovery.  So -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PAYNE:  That's the number that I think would - that will prove Jonathan's theory.  In other words, 235  beats the estimates but this is not the kind of counterintuitive number that would point to some kind of,  end of the - you know, the business cycle, traditionally has been blown out of whack.  This is, you know,  from all of different things that have done it's not what it used to be.  You can go ahead, Jonathan.  </p><p> JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALIST PIG HEDGE FUND FOUNDING MEMBER:  Well, in terms of  number, it's outstanding.  I'm happy to see that as you said, it's been a long time coming upwards of eight  years.  And the fact that this has gone under Donald Trump's first month in office, is also a bull shine.   But look at the underpinnings of the market, more new lows, than new highs yesterday.  And bonds just  across the board, you can then take it out to woodshed.  I think despite the fact the numbers are good,  some of the dynamic underpinnings of the stocks themselves give reason - one reason for some worry at  this point.  </p><p> OTTER:  Yes, I would add to that, Jonathan, the - I mean, excuse me, the small-cap stocks rise into  thousand and is down about 3.8 percent, copper is down.  So, not everything is bullish out there.  I mean,  as we all look at the recent performance of the S&amp;P 500 which has been great.  But there are a few signs,  that maybe we're getting a little too blurb.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what about mining, Charles?  Do we know, in terms of - </p><p> PAYNE:  I didn't see.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I didn't hear Peter discussed mining.  </p><p> PAYNE:  We've got construction and manufacturing but, those are two numbers though that were almost  identical to ADP, right.  66,000 ADP, 58,000 construction.  Yes, I know it was warmer, but we've had  warm patches over the last several years that haven't created this kind of construction.  And we need them  for a couple reasons, think about dearth of homes - the man is out there.  Month supply is at so - it's such  a low point.  If we get that going again - they're all connected.  I think this is a phenomenal number.  I  love the idea that 300,000 people came back to the workforce.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He thanked you.  Thank you.  Can get a halleluiah?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Participation is the most important thing.  The unemployment rate fell, despite the fact  that 300,000 people started looking for work.  That means that they found work.  That they came back.  A  highest labor participation rate in a year.</p><p> PAYNE:  And we need people to believe.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because that's, that's the optimistic sign.  Can go out there and get a job?  Yes, you can.   Amen.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  Well, one of the things that's also happening is we're a long away from the peak labor  participation rate of 67 percent.  But were trending upward, and that is a very important number.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  63 percent participation rate.  Steve Cortes, go ahead.  </p><p> STEVE CORTES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  And Maria, listen, I think that is by far the most  important news this morning - this participation rate.  And I'm so glad that they're also connected to  construction and mining.  Those are businesses which tends to be dominating - the workers are mostly  male.  If you look at workforce participation, it's been trending down for everybody which is a terrible  thing for men, under the Obama administration it hit a recorded low.  </p><p> So, that is great news, that construction and mining are coming back, to life.  It's huge for men, it's huge  for our economy.  So, to get the participation rate up, and still keep jobless rate down, that is just a  massive win for the economy.  So, I know we have some naysayers on the panel, I think the stock market's  going to go manically higher.  I think growth going to accelerate in a really material way.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, Charles, look at these wages numbers, the brisk clip of hiring was accompanied by  steady wage growth.  Hourly earnings rising six cents, that's 2/10th of a percent.  You want more,  obviously, but it's in the right direction.  2.8 percent, year over year.</p><p> PAYNE:  It's in the right direction.  And also, the skills aspect of this, you know, earlier in the week  LinkedIn did their workforce report.  And they talked about the skills gap, and we talk about it always  associated with technology.  But oil-well drillers and people who can, you know, work on construction  projects.  When we started to get all of those things filled in, but what do you need?  I think these numbers  will even take off even more than they have already.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  I like to pick up on that point, because there are a lot of people who are focused on the retail  piece of equation, and there are a lot of jobs that are being lost in retail.  JC Penney, alone says they're  going to lay off 5500 people, but there's a balance to that.  And that is, that people like Amazon are  saying, this year we're going to create 100,000 new jobs.  So, what happens is, yes, so as retail jobs are  disappearing, but they're showing up somewhere else in the economic pile.  And that's good news.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, how about construction?  Jonathan Hoenig, go ahead.  Jump in, Jonathan. </p><p> HOENIG:  It's - it's buy the rumor, and sell fact.  You know, for eight years, people say, well the stock  market's going up but I don't know, we don't have jobs yet.  We don't have jobs yet.  Look, now we've got  jobs job.  The job numbers great.  I'm applauding that.  I'm just wondering if perhaps now the market has  gotten a little bit ahead of itself in that sense.  Our guest mentioned the - some of the retailers are getting  just absolutely taken to woodshed.  Real estate, that's related to the retailers are getting killed right now,  leverage loans, convertible bonds.  So, I'm not saying don't be enthusiastic about this great number,  remember to moment take a moment and think.  Is the good news now already out?  Is this a good  number, with the markets were anticipating 4.3 percent ago, on the Dow?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  See, I think it's all about - I think it's all about policy out of Washington.  Dagen, there's a  bit under this market come on, until they blow it on tax reform.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely, and I'll point out with wages - with wages growing at 2.8 percent.  That's  solid.  But it's not enough to really start worrying about inflation picking up.  That keeps the fed at bay  potentially - when you talk about four interest rate hikes?  Maybe, it is two.  But again, that is the kind of  not too hot, not to cold.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Goldilocks.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just right wage number.</p><p> OTTER:  One important point that you're - you have to use the word inflation, but as what you're referring  to.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I said it. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, you just said it. </p><p> OTTER:  So, I think that's very important.  We used to think that inflation is bad thing, but you're right,  inflation is a good thing.  And around the world, you're actually seeing a little bit of less concern about  deflation.  So, we're talking about draggy earlier, getting a teeny bit hawkish.  I mean, it's still very loose  over there, but he's saying, OK, maybe the deflation is not as big a worry as we thought.  And globally,  that's what we need.  </p><p> PAYNE:  It's so funny now, because for a long-time inflation was a four-letter word, right?  I also tell  people, well, are you happy when your paycheck is inflated?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, maybe.</p><p> PAYNE:  If the value of the house inflated?  You know, we want some inflation, right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out, because we're watching the Futures.  The Dow would need to  gains 147 1/2 points today, to be in positive territory.  Because right now, it's going to snap a four-week  winning streak.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, you were talking about the sell-off and face small cap stocks in the last week? </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  The rest is down six sessions in a row, the last time it was up was the day after President  Trump's speech, which kind of tells, you know.  I think that group, though, is much more sensitive to  President Trump, and the nuances of President Trump because it's a lot of American centric businesses,  that will do very we'll.  And it's almost a barometer actually, of the presidency to a degree.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  And one of the things you and I debated and discussed over the years is, what happens to the  high dividend paying risk free or risk less stocks in this market?  They've - initially, we're not doing very  well, now people are starting to drift back in the utilities.  To me, that follows like the bottom mark of it,  people are a little unsure where're the market's going now.  I feel like this is a pause - </p><p> PAYNE:  Some of that comes back to what Maria just said with the - with respect to taxes.  And I think  also - let's face it, a lot of people frustrated on investment world that Obamacare had to come before  anything else, thinking that some of these other things could have been done pretty easily.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're pulling it back in reforming it, repealing it, whatever you want to call it.  It is a tax  cut.  It's a tax cut on investors.  </p><p> PAYNE:  It's a $600 billion tax cut.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a big tax cut.</p><p> PAYNE:  But it's not the kind of tax cut though, that's going to get a company to invest in a new building  project or get the average person watching this show to go out and spend more money, or even start to  leverage credit.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, the whole border adjustment tax was like a buzz kill.  I mean, we didn't hear  anything about the border adjustment tax during the campaign.  And all of the sudden, now we're talking  about raising revenue while cutting taxes.  Just cut the taxes.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  I hope that fades away.  </p><p> HOENIG:  There's going to be tremendous surprises, Maria.  Just look at something like oil, which is  expected to be a major beneficiary, of course, of the Trump administration.  Oil stocks are almost at 52- week lows across the board.  Ironically, it's the green energy stocks that are starting to outperform.  This is  going to be - is this going to end up not as otherwise would imagine?  The market's going to surprise us, I  think even in the face of these excellent job numbers.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you mean?  So, you think - you're expecting a sell-off in stocks?  You'd be  selling into this rally, today? </p><p> HOENIG:  I think you have to be very hesitant buying, Maria, once the good news is out.  Again, buy the  rumor, sell the fact - the time to buy stocks I think is when job numbers weren't terrible.  And people  saying, I'm not going to buy until the - we're starting to get these numbers now.  And the fact that stocks  are now starting to do poorly, again, more new 52-week lows and highs, just tells me that the internals are  weak.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hey, Steve Cortes, you on the other side of that trade?  </p><p> CORTES:  I sure am, Maria.  And you know, listen, I think you're right that the biggest risk is  Washington, D.C., out there, if Washington doesn't deliver.  But I guess I would say this, you know, as  somebody who campaigned very hard for then candidate Trump, and now President Trump, I believe  staking his presidency on this legislative agenda on repeal the replace, and more importantly, on tax  reform.  And because of that, I think he's going to press members of Congress like you can't believe, and  they do not want to go back to their districts - in Republican districts and Republican leaning states, where  President Trump is incredibly popular.  They don't want to go back and face voters and explain, why they  were the obstacle to this agenda that they voted for?  So, it's not going to happen -  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, why did Mitch McConnell say what he said?  I mean, Mitch McConnell, you  know.  </p><p> CORTES:  You know, both of these Kentucky Senators are really annoying me lately, they're both  naysayers.  By the way, Mitch McConnell, has often been, I would say, unhelpful at times to the President.   But even he, I think will have to toe the line eventually - again, he and Rand Paul, I don't think want to go  back to Kentucky whenever they're up for reelection, and explain why they impeded President Trump and  the will of the American people, by the way.  So, we're going to get - it's going to be ugly the headlines,  there's a lot of consternation back-and-forth.  I think it is why the market's pausing, right now, I really do.   It's unrest, and uncertainty about Washington, but once we do get these - </p><p> PAYNE:  Let me just say one thing of that, Steve.  What if they go back to these voters a few years from  now?  And they say, why did you guys pass Obamacare 2.0?  Nothing changed for me, from what you  guys promised.  I don't know if they want to face that as well, that's the other side of their political risk  here, for them.  </p><p> CORTES:  Sure, but plenty is changing is changing this bill.  I mean, it's not fair, I think, to call it 2.0.   But I also think more importantly, this is the step to the even bigger reform, which is tax reform.  And  once we get tax reform and this economy starts really growing again.  Then they won't have to explain  anything to their voters, they'll just be high fiving them and accepting their support. </p><p> KIERNAN:  One of the areas where Mitch McConnell was right though, is that tax reform is hard.  It's  easy to underestimate the complexity of the task, and I do think an August deadline is ambitious.  I  thought it was ambitious when Trump said it as President, I thought it was ambitious when the Treasury  Secretary said it.  And what we don't see a lot of on Senate, particularly, is multitasking.  And we're  asking to do two things, simultaneously, that are big complicated, vexing, and have to be sold back home  as well.  </p><p> OTTER:  You know, a lot of people were critical of Obama, not just for Obamacare, but for the fact that  he put that first.  And they said, we got a serious - we're coming out of a pretty big recession here, let's  worry about that and then do health care.  And we could see that same criticism of Republicans now.  I  know they say, in order to do the tax bill, we need fix Obamacare first.  But, you know, I kind of wish  they've gone straight to Obamacare, because you're right, it is incredibly complicated.  How long did it  take Reagan?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's mean taxes.</p><p> OTTER:  It's mean taxes.  How long did take to get the Reagan - </p><p> PAYNE:  But you could get lower rates quicker than you could get a full-fledged - </p><p> OTTER:  And I'd love to see growth.  That's the good Trump, and market wants that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If you're going to spend your political capital?  Give the American people their capital  back.  Let them keep more if their income.  Do it immediately, and make it retroactive to January 1.  Do  you know how much - people would have backed off, and be like, OK, now you can deal with reforming  Obamacare.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Exactly.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm perfectly happy.  I'm going to go buy a new ATV.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  And you to prove to people that you're a good guy, that you can get things done, that you can  make your deals - and by the way, everyone is going home saying, I brought you home tax reform.  And  with that, winning can take on the tough stuff.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But instead they work GOP, and the House.</p><p> CORTES:  Let's do it then!  It's all talk, let's do it!</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Guys, does anybody -</p><p> CORTES:  They keep talking about tax cut, let's do it Donald Trump.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've been saying that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You have been.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've been saying that, instead we got the border adjustment tax shoved in there. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly. </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Some tax to raise a trillion dollars over 10 years.  Does anybody want to touch on retail  here, Charles?  Down 26,000 jobs in retail.  That's one of the few areas where we actually showed job cuts.   We got strength in construction up 50,000, strength leisure hospitality, strength in manufacturing,  strength in government.</p><p> PAYNE:  It's the long - everyone just talked about the death of brick and mortar, you know.  And as I  already mentioned here, it's been off-set to a degree by Amazon.  But even these retailers doing well,  children's place this week, one of the biggest winners in the market - two days ago, was up 20 percent in  one day.  They're doing well because of last two years, they've closed 142 non-performing stores.  So, even  if these stores that are doing well, relatively speaking, are closing stores, are firing people, so, you know,  that's just something that's not going to exist. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Some of this could be seasonal adjustment from the Labor Department, though. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  In retail?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  In the post-holiday months.  That, it could be some of that.  You could see some  give back in the next month's jobs' report. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's a pretty steep decline.</p><p> KIERNAN:  And Texas had a very tough month last month on their oil patch.  And so, there are punch on  these things that I think are little moments in the sun, where I we can see them come back.  And I think  jobs are going to continue to grow throughout the rest of the year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Hot morning here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, we're going to talk a short  break.  More on the February jobs report, after this short break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, the February jobs report just out.  As we've been reporting, the economy  created 235,000 jobs, in the month of February, beating economists' expectations.  The unemployment rate  ticked down slightly to 4.7 percent.  Also expected, the labor force participation rate; this was highlight  came in at 63 percent.  That was better than expected.  I want to bring in the host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\", Stuart Varney now, joining us with his thoughts.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK VARNEY &amp; COMPANY HOST:  Good morning,  Maria.  I will say this.  I think it was a solid report; not spectacular, not a blowout, but I think it marks  what I'm going to call the beginning of the Trump expansion.  Call me crazy but I think that's where it's  at.  Now, you're going to get folks on the left who say this was a solid jobs' report result of President  Obama's policy or Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve.  That's nonsense.  </p><p> The change in the mood of the country towards more optimism, towards more growth, towards more  confidence, that started November the 8th with the election.  So, I'm calling this the beginnings of the  Trump expansion.  58,000 new construction jobs, what was it?  28,000 manufacturing, those are good  well paid-jobs.  And I think they're' going to expand that front in the future.  That's where I'm coming  from. </p><p> BARTIMORO:  Wait till we get an infrastructure program, right?  I mean, those construction jobs are  going to benefit even more. </p><p> VARNEY:  Absolutely.  And that infrastructure program will come. I think it's got bi-partisan support,  not sure how you pay for it.  But it's got bipartisan support.  Something on that front is going to get done  this year.  That is very good news for those high paid construction jobs and manufacturing, too, positive.</p><p>  CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Sir, what do you think about your  buddy though, Elon Musk?  He might get a bit chunk of that infrastructure for the hyper loop.</p><p> VARNEY:  My buddy, Elon Musk.  Well, said with tongue-in-cheek there, Charles?  I do declare.  I'm not  wild about companies that live on government subsidies especially green subsidies.  But look, if this guy  can come up with a way of making a battery that stores enormous amounts of electricity, then you are on  to a winner.  That's my story. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let me just point something out.  All the people who drive Teslas don't pay for our  infrastructure now because they don't pay any gas taxes.  They're plugging in and refuelling that way, and  so they're basically getting a free ride on the back of all the other taxpayers in this country.  So that -- it  shocks me a little bit too. </p><p> VARNEY:  It's -- you are pointing the finger towards real outrage here.  I think Tesla should be banned.   OK, I'm joking.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> VARNEY:  Just warming it up. </p><p> BARTIMORO:  Well, you know, what do you think about retail?  Retail was down 26,000.  Does that  matter or do you think that's just a fluke because of the holidays. </p><p> VARNEY:  Oh no.  I think that, that really reinforces our story.  We keep talking about the retail ice age.   They're having a very hard time.  The bricks-and-mortar people meeting the challenge of online selling  and this down , 26,000 -- 26,000 retail jobs, that's a big deal. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> VARNEY:  That tells the story.  I wouldn't want to be a mall operator right now.  I wouldn't want to be  buying real estate in a shopping mall in this day and age.  I think they got a real problem here. </p><p> BARTIMORO:  Yes, that's a good point.  It's really online that's winning here.  Hey Stu, are you tired of  winning it?</p><p> VARNEY:  You mean in the ratings?  I'll never get tired of winning.</p><p> BARTIMORO:  You'll never get tired of that.  Now that we have Donald Trump, you're going to get so  sick of winning.  We're winning, right.  OK.  Stu, we'll see you in about -- </p><p> VARNEY:  We'll you give an opportunity, Maria.  I thought I'd grab it with both hands.</p><p> BARTIMORO:  Yes, I love it.  That was a lob.  That's what they call a lob, Stu.  Congratulations to you  and Fox Business Network.  We got the All-Stars right here.  </p><p> PAYNE:  There you go.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congratulations everybody .</p><p> PAYNE:  Yes, thank you, you too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  For beating the competition.  Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  Join \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" top of the hour.  Steve, final thoughts from you and Jonathan.  Your take on today's number,  final word. </p><p> CORTES:  You know, final thoughts, Maria.  Between Fox Business and the ratings and Trump and the  White House, and the stock market, I'm not tired of winning yet but we might get there soon.  I think this  is a fantastic report.  I really do, particularly the participation.  Too many people had given up on  America, had given up on life really, in a lot of ways.  Not to be too philosophical but we need them back  in the workforce and they're coming back and that's great news. </p><p> BARTIMORO:  Jonathan Hoenig.</p><p> HOENIG:  There's an unlimited amount of wealth and jobs that can be created, Maria.  It's freedom that's  needed to make that happen.  So long as the government and you're right, Washington, is very much at  the center of Wall Street these days.  As so long as the government can keep this trend going, lower taxes,  lower regulation, more individual and economic freedom, I think 200,000 new jobs is just the start.</p><p> BARTIMORO:  All right we will leave it there.  Steve Cortes, Jonathan Hoenig, good to see you both.   Gentlemen, have a good weekend.  We got the best team in business.  After this short break, right here at  the panel.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> BARTIMORO:  Welcome back, final thoughts from our All-Star Panel.  We got markets on fire this  morning on the hills.  It has been better than expected jobs report.  Financials leading the rally at Peter  Kiernan, you called it.</p><p> PETER KIERNAN, ENTREPENEUR:  I have to say financers are incredibly well positioned and what's  going to be exciting to see is whether small businesses really take this opportunity to hire, to expand and  whether the big company starts parting some of that cash and the best thing in the long term.  Property  plan equipment and expanding. </p><p> BARTIMORO:  Yes, I want to get Charles' take on this though.  Because Charles, you know how to make  money in this market.  Would you think it's overvalued at this point? </p><p> PAYNE:  I think there are a lot of individual names that are overvalued.  When you see companies miss,  they're taken out to the woodshed pretty good so that's where your risk is.  And this is by no means a dart  throwing kind of rally.  I think that people need to understand too, a handful of names have been  overwhelmingly responsible for the move, right?  Because of the way the Dow forensics is weighted.  But  you know, we've got to think longer term.  And this motion of occasional dips, you know yesterday, we  talked about the eight-year anniversary of the market.  </p><p> Think about the longest streak ever, right.  It went from '87 to 2000.  Well, guess what?  From '82 to '87,  there was also a rally.  So you can almost argue from '82 to 2000, with a three month blip, could you live  with that?  Hell yes, if you were in the market.  So, it's going to happen.  I think we don't want to get too  fixated on the market occasionally pulling back.  Think longer term. </p><p> BARTIMORO:  Yes.</p><p> JACK OTTER, AMERICAN JOURNALIST:  It's important for investors to understand the good news  does not always mean good start.  The good news was baked in a long time ago, Jonathan Hoenig was  making that point.  And so we have to be careful of buy the rumor and sell the news, and especially if  maybe the market is too optimistic about tax breaks, about deregulation and we get bogged down in  Obamacare or bore taxes. </p><p> BARTIMORO:  What do you mean by good news was baked in?  I mean, you - how many people we're  like Trump's going to win and the markets are going to sell off?  Well, what is baked in?</p><p> OTTER:  Well, because as soon as he was elected, suddenly the market took off.  And we've been - I  watch the market.</p><p> PAYNE:  The $3 trillion in additional market evaluation. </p><p> OTTER:  Yes, yes. </p><p> BARTIMORO:  The anticipation about policy.</p><p> OTTER:  That's what I'm saying. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PAYNE:  Materializing so far into reality.  We're seeing sentiment materialize into reality as long as you  have that, that's the ultimate support.</p><p> OTTER:  How long to keep up?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to point out in terms of optimism.  300,000 people re-entered the work force.  The  unemployment rate falls which means that people found work.  The labor participation rate continues to  go up, that is your Trump optimism right there. </p><p> BARTIMORO:  How about wages, Dagen?  I mean, you got wages up 2.8 percent.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Again, and not hot enough to make people worry about the Federal Reserve. </p><p> KIERNAN:  And I think the central point, in addition, there's room to grow.  We still have a lot of room  to grow to get where we've been before and I think that's great news for this economy. </p><p> BARTIMORO:  And then there's trade this Sunday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES,\" I'm going to  be speaking with Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross.  He is my special guest to talk about trade and how  that fits into all of this.  That's one of the worries out there.  We'll talk with the Wilbur Ross, joining me  on the Fox News Channel.  Thanks, everybody.  </p><p> KIERNAN:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Have a great weekend.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" right now.  Stuart, take it away</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Hello there, Lauren, thank you so much.  Good morning, everyone, thanks for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Thursday to you.  It is Thursday, March 7th, your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  The push for privacy at Facebook, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is shifting focus to private communication, the details on this major strategy shift for the world's largest social network.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chinese Telecom giant Huawei making it official this morning, the company will file a lawsuit against the United States, saying that Congress acted as judge, jury, and executor.  The end of an era, General Motors closing its Lordstown Ohio plant, what it means for workers there, as the White House focuses on jobs in America this week.  Last one standing, there is one remaining blockbuster store in the entire world, find out where it is exactly, coming up right here, right now.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Welcome back.  Well, markets are watching China and the U.S. Trade talk for any sign of progress this morning.  Take a look at Futures indicating we are seeing a lower opening, for the broader averages this morning.  Futures indicating the Dow Industrials will open down about 70 points, one-third of one percent, 76 points lower.  S&amp;P 500 right now is down 5-3/4 points, and the NASDAQ down 15.  This as the U.S. trade deficit for 2018 hit a record of $891.3 billion, excluding services.</p><p>Joining me now to talk markets and investing, is Altium Wealth Portfolio Manager and Market Strategist, Michael Lee.  Michael, good to see you this morning.  What do you want to focus on here in terms of the China deal, the Fed, ECB meeting coming up -- what's the most important?</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER &amp; MARKET STRATEGIST, ALTIUM WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  So, what I think is the most important is manufacturing in the U.S.  The U.S. is out of the half a million new manufacturing jobs in the last two years, this is nothing short of remarkable.  What I think everybody is missing is the multiplier effect that that's going to take effect into the economy.  So, a dollar in manufacturing is a dollar (INAUDIBLE) to the economy.</p><p>Every new manufacturing job is responsible for two to four other jobs as you look into it, and what's really crazy and what's happened over the last couple of years is the U.S. resurgence in manufacturing.  I think that has put the economy in a much sounder footing and while we didn't have four or five percent GDP growth last year, we had three.  I think the chances of us falling below two or slowing into that secular stagnation that many were worried about that we're heading into than say, 2015-2016, it's just not a reality, and we're set up for a lot more continued growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we've got the February jobs report out tomorrow morning, 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  The unemployment rate is expected to tick down to 3.9 percent.  We're expecting 180,000 jobs added to the economy.  Is this largely priced in?  I mean, you talked about manufacturing jobs at the top.  What would be a market mover from this report tomorrow?</p><p>LEE:  Well -- so, what I'm looking for is not only the headline number but the revisions.  So, we got, you know, 300,000 number in December which got it down to 225,000.  The 300,000 number in January, we'll see what that's revised to.  So, tomorrow, if we get a big blow-out number, we have two lower revisions.  I would say, you know, that's fine.  But if we're somewhere in the neighborhood of 200,000 jobs, you know, this is good.  This is steady growth.  In terms of a catalyst, if we have another 300,000 number, I think that could push the markets higher.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But look at these markets here.  We had a really nice beginning to 2019, but this week is the weakest week, worst week for Dow, S&amp;P, NASDAQ in several weeks.</p><p>LEE:  Yes, it seems like we ran out of a little bit of a gas here.  And I would say to most investors that have missed this rally, this is probably the beginnings of what could be a good entry point in that.  The Fed is on hold, OK?  The Fed has -- the Fed has decided they're not moving from the time being, and I think that's more political than it is economic.  So, if you look at the Taylor Rule -- and the Taylor Rule is equilibrium between containing inflation and maximizing economic growth.  That puts the frontend somewhere between 4-1/4 and 4-3/4.</p><p>So, the fact that the Fed stopping where it is now in the low to mid-twos, means that they want these trade -- they want the U.S. to win these trade wars, they want sustaining growth, they want a strong equity market, and so why fight the Fed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, one of the top stories in The Journal today about the trade deficit, basically, that the U.S. trade deficit expanded 10 percent last year.  We mentioned it early, 891 billion despite the effort by this administration to narrow the gap.</p><p>LEE:  Yes, you know, I don't know that narrowing the gap is the best metric.  I think you want to look at total trade, and total trade for the U.S. expanded just under 370 billion last year.  That's the largest -- that's the largest growth since 2011.  And, also, tariffs in China have come down in 2017-2018 from just under 10 percent to 7-1/2 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LEE:  So, what we're doing, our economic strength, the tariffs, all of these policies are working in our favor.  And if these policies were working in our favor, we wouldn't have added these manufacturing jobs, which I think going to have many long-term positive economic benefits.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does it -- does it bother you that not just the Dow is having a tough week, but even the Dow Transports.  You're looking at the worst performance here in 11 weeks or so.</p><p>LEE:  No.  I mean, market can't go straight up forever or straight down forever.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And you are talking about a very good rally year-to-date, 11 percent or something.</p><p>LEE:  Yes.  A very -- you know, a very strong move in a very short period of time.  Eventually, you kind of ran out of gas.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you want to do, you want to take to the sidelines now, or should we be putting new -- looking at this market for entries?</p><p>LEE:  Well, look, I think -- look, it's -- this is an extremely difficult market to trade.  So, if you missed this rally, say, you are out in cash in the fall and you did not get invested after Christmas, you know, now is the time to start getting in because I ultimately think before the year is over, we hit all-time new highs on all three major investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  New highs in '19, even though earnings are slowing down this year.</p><p>LEE:  Yes, but we still have five percent revenue growth, and I'm a big believer that earnings are managed and manipulated to fit, you know, corporate strategy and, you know, markets (INAUDIBLE) and all sorts other factors need to be taken into account in addition to earnings.  So, with five percent revenue growth not really stretched value -- multiple valuations, and what I think will be much greater economic growth this year, I'd say GDP comes in the high 2s versus the low 2s, which most people are predicting.  Meaning, 2020 should look a lot better than I think people are looking at right now, and that 2020 earnings will be the story as you move into the back half of 2019.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what we're going to be trading on, the 2020 numbers.  Yes, it's a good point.  Michael, good to see you.</p><p>LEE:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Michael Lee joining us there.  Be sure to tune in tomorrow morning for our full coverage of the Jobs report, \"JOBS IN AMERICA\" specials kicks off at 8:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow morning when we identify where the jobs are, where the wage increases are as well, tomorrow morning, right here.</p><p>Meanwhile, top story this morning, Facebook's future, founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiling a new plan to address privacy concerns.  Something that Dagen McDowell has been looking up for a long time.  Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Do not laugh, I'm being serious, this is a real story.  So, Facebook says its future lies in private messaging, not the sharing of public content, which has been the focus of much ire.  Here is what Facebook is doing, Facebook is going to start focusing on private messaging and small group chats.</p><p>This, according to a blog post from founder Mark Zuckerberg.  It's going to offer encrypted messaging across all of its major products and allow people to make private conversations (INAUDIBLE) or make them disappear.  Zuckerberg in that blog post also talks about it's going to develop products within these messaging services, payments, e-commerce products that will eventually allow it to diversify away from ad-supported businesses that led to these privacy mishaps, missteps, if you will.</p><p>Think of the WhatsApp messaging platform as kind of the idea of where Facebook is going with this.  Here is what Mark Zuckerberg -- these are a couple of comments from that blog post I want to point out.  \"I believe the future of communication will increasingly shift to private encrypted services, where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure, and their messages and content won't stick around forever.  This is the future, I hope we will help bring about.  I believe we should be working toward a world --</p><p>Let me read it like I would.  This is how I was thinking about it.  \"I believe we should be working toward a world where people can speak privately and live freely, knowing that their information will only be seen by who they want to see it and won't all stick around forever.  If we can help move the world in this direction, I will be proud of the difference we've made.\"  Do you trust Mark Zuckerberg to keep your information private as the central issue?  Facebook is not going to be able to read these messages, apparently, they are end-to-end encrypted, and advertisers won't be able to mine the contents to target users.  It also basically helps alleviate the pressure on Facebook to monitor or police the content on its platforms.</p><p>But I will leave you with this, Jason Gay is the sports writer at The Wall Street Journal.  Here's what he said, I'm paraphrasing on Twitter, this is like McDonalds pivoting to protecting cows.  Back to you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good one.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I couldn't steal it.  I had to give Jason Gay credit for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.  Oh God.  All right.  Wow, that's a big change.  We're going to talk more about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you believe him?  Do you believe him?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Do you trust Facebook more than Huawei, by the way?  Taking me into the next story, that's another good question.  Huawei is escalating its fight with the United States this morning.  Lauren Simonetti with the details there.  Lauren, good morning to you.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good question, Maria.  Good morning.  Well, Huawei is now suing the U.S. government, saying a law limiting its business in the United States is unconstitutional.  The law was signed by President Trump last August.  It bars federal agencies and their contractors from using Huawei equipment and Huawei services.  Huawei has been accused of stealing trade secrets from U.S. companies, but its Chief Security Officer told you earlier this week, Maria, that Huawei is not a security threat.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you saying that Huawei Technologies has not stolen trade secrets from other companies in the west?</p><p>ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES:  We have been trusted for the last 30 years in 170 countries.  There have been no major cyber security incidents involving Huawei in the world.  But we're not saying that because of the record, there should not be strict scrutiny of the kinds of products and technologies that we sell.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The lawsuit marks the latest confrontation between China and the United States.  Last year, it ended with the arrest of Huawei's Chief Financial Officer in Canada at the request of the U.S.</p><p>Well, Sears is headed back to courts.  Stanley Black &amp; Decker now suing Sears over its new line of tools under the Craftsman Ultimate Collection brand.  Sears sold Craftsman brand to Stanley in 2017 for about $900 million and retained a limited license to sell some Craftsman products.  But Sears is touting its story as the real home of Craftsman which Stanley says undermines its Craftsman products.  Now you know.</p><p>And then there was one.  Yes, Bend, Oregon is now home to the last Blockbuster Store in the entire world.  There was one other location, it was in Perth, Australia.  It is now closing.  The manager of the last Blockbuster in Oregon says she's excited hers is the only one left on the planet.  When two stores closed in Alaska last year, the Bend Blockbuster sold hats and they sold t-shirts celebrating the occasion.  The store continues to attract tourists and those seeking nostalgia.  But the issue is, a lot of people don't have DVDs anymore, the players.  To play the DVDs that you can rent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, you got to buy the t-shirt in memory of the fact that one still exists, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes (INAUDIBLE) the hats.  Oh, the sign of the times.  Thank you, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, coming up next, high emotions at G.M. this morning, the final Chevy rolls off the line at the company's Lordstown, Ohio plant.  We're taking a look at what's next for the automaker as that plant closes.  Then, a change of plans, Hillary Clinton reportedly still mulling a run in 2020, despite saying that she would not early this week.  Oh, I was kidding.  It comes as one major pop star readies her voice for politics.  All right here, next up.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Big program this morning.  Coming up, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson is with us this morning.  New York Congressman and Ways and Means Committee member Tom Reed joining us, he will be on the panel with New Jersey Congressman and Problem Solvers Caucus co-chair Josh Gottheimer joining us this morning.  Florida Congressman and House Judiciary and Foreign Affairs Committee member Ted Deutch joining us, along with the former White House Press Secretary and author of \"The Briefing\" Sean Spicer here as well.  Big three hours ahead, don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>And we want to kick it off here this hour with this, 2020 vision, Hillary Clinton saying that she is not running for President in 2020 but that may not be the case after all actually.  New York Times White House Correspondent Maggie Haberman, tweeting this.  \"Spoke to someone close with Hillary -- with Clinton in contact with her today.  They say she was not trying to be emphatic and close the door on running when she spoke to a local reporter yesterday, and that she was surprised but how definitively it played.  The person also says that she is extremely unlikely to run, but that she remains bothered that she's expected to close the door on it when, say, John Kerry is not.  She has told her team she is waiting at least to see the Mueller report.\"</p><p>Then this, Taylor Swift also weighing in on 2020, the popstar telling L Magazine that she's finding her voice in politics.  She said, quote, \"I'm going to do more to help.  We have a big race coming up next year.\"  Joining the conversation to talk about all of that, The Wall Street Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor James Freeman is here this morning, along with Fox News Contributor and Columnist for The Hill, Liz Peek.  Great to see you guys this morning.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm just going to lay down because I have such a headache from that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Really?  What's bothering you?</p><p>PEEK:  Fell by Hillary Clinton.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you talked about the Haberman tweet yesterday during the show.  We didn't get to it.  Wow.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, she's mad about Kerry not giving up.  I think that's --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a -- that's a perfect gender pivot.  Let me make it about my gender and not about the fact that I was this -- an utter failure for the Democratic Party and an embarrassment, too.</p><p>PEEK:  But I think tying -- hitching her wagon to John Kerry's potential candidacy.  Are you kidding?  That's like a very low bar.  Look, Hillary Clinton is not going to run for President because the Democratic Party absolutely wants her gone, end of story.  And I think we've seen that in the way of -- their comments are covered and, you know, in terms of where her place in the party right now, it doesn't exist.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you wrote a good piece about Hillary the other day about the fake crisis that she created, as you wrote.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes, I mean, the crisis in America?  Come on, folks, I mean, look at every gauge of consumer sentiment, comfort level, contentment with the way the country is going, Americans are feeling pretty good about where things are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to add really quickly.  If Democrats truly feel that the election was stolen from Hillary Clinton, why aren't they shouting to the rooftop, screaming to the heavens for her to run?  That it's her --</p><p>PEEK:  That's a good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- her role, it's hers, everybody ought to get out of the way -- they already tried that, but I didn't mean to interrupt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, to chime that with -- you know, with Nadler and Elijah Cummings trying to get all these investigations going against the Trump administration.  But I loved your op-ed in the Journal today, James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about that, Republicans, Democrats, and decent guys, or any 2020 candidates interested in civility?  You talk about all the troubled politicians are falling into when they try to cross partisan lines.  Tell us more.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think they're actually -- among voters, I think there is an appetite for civility.  I think people do find it a little exhausting watching this sort of non-stop partisan warfare, but it's been kind of an interesting disturbing phenomenon as candidates get into the 2020 race.  Joe Biden thinking about a run and thinking about kind of being the moderate voice in the race, but he recanted after calling Mike Pence, the vice president, a decent guy, he got some static on Twitter from Cynthia Nixon, and he backed off agreeing that Pence was horrible.  And now, you have Montana Governor Steve Bullok, testing the waters in Iowa, he's out there, and he's asked, do you think Pence is a decent guy?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And even though he's worked with him and said nice things with him on others -- on other occasions, wouldn't go there.  So, it's -- really, it's kind of an amazing time (INAUDIBLE) politics.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But isn't it another indication of this lurch to the left, that, you know, a decent guy or somebody who's sort of in the middle?  I mean, look at what Howard Schultz is doing, can't even get past the massive radicals.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you have to point out why Cynthia Nixon and people in the LGBTQ community do not like Vice President Mike Pence is because of the religious freedom law that they found -- that they in Indiana -- that he pushed that never went through, but he pushed it, and it was seen as codifying discrimination against people, gays and lesbians, transgender individuals in the state.  So, that's -- you have to point out, that's why they feel the way they do about Governor Pence -- I mean, or now Vice President Pence.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That -- so they have -- they have different beliefs.  He believes that the government should not force, for example, a cake baker to bake a cake with a specific message that he doesn't agree with.  That Colorado case, by the way, has been resolved in the cake baker's favor.  So, I think there's a -- there's a legal argument by that.  But the point is look --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will note though it was pushed back from private businesses in Indiana and Arkansas from the likes of Wal-Mart that kept these laws from going on the books.  So, there is a role for private companies and the private sector in all of this.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But my point is they -- obviously, they have a disagreement about where individual liberty should begin and end in this case, but that doesn't mean they can't have a respectful political dialogue.  I mean, you know, not --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But given --</p><p>FREEMAN:  I understand the times we're living in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, James, given the way that President Trump -- and again, I've said I'll debate policy all day long, I'm not going to debate personality, but President Trump is a bomb-thrower, he throws grenade -- figurative grenades at everybody, and so the Democrats are trying to make sure that they don't wind up like Low Energy Jeb, and Little Marco, and Lying Ted because they're expecting to be called names by the President.  So, to call for civility on one side, then you have to call for civility on the other side, and it's not happening.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, we'll see.  We'll see what voters think of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  We'll take a short break on that note.  When we come back, rethinking retail, Amazon is shutting all of its pop-up stores nationwide.  We've got the details on that, coming up, and where it's focusing now.</p><p>Then, barking mad, one New Jersey town is suggesting jail time if you can't stop your dog from barking.  Oh, I'm in big trouble then.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Headlines across America this morning now.  The Seattle Times reporting that the State Senate passes a bill to create a European-style consumer data privacy law in Washington.  Now, this bill would allow citizens to know what information data companies are gathering.  That would include companies like Facebook and Microsoft along with retail stores and data brokers.</p><p>The Las Vegas Review-Journal says an Elon Musk-founded company is in talks for a potential Las Vegas project.  We are talking about Musk's Boring Company, the CEO of the Las Vegas Visitors and Convention Authority, says that with Vegas on the forefront of autonomous vehicle testing, the Boring Company's tunnel transportation model could make sense.</p><p>In New Jersey, The Record writing this morning that Saddle River gets tough on barking dogs that disturb neighbors.  A new ordinance would prohibit loud, frequent, or habitual continuous barking, howling, or yelping.  Between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., dogs would be limited to 20 minutes of barking.  From 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., it would be 15 minutes.  Fines could range from $100 to $1,000, followed by community service or prison.  And of course, as I just told you guys, my new rescued baby, Bella Dusty, has been barking, so I got to get her to learn not to bark at people that are in my world.  There she is, she's so cute.  She'll learn it.  I'm sure she's going to learn it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, she better --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's very smart.  She's learned everything else.  What do you think, Dagen.  Will she figure this out to stop barking at my friends?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She will.  And the -- and governments have not business trying to fine people for their dog barking.  All of --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's Charlie and Ramon.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's Charlie and Ramon, neither one of them barked, but I'm lucky with Mable.  Mable barked nonstop and it eventually dissipates, but they have no business getting -- of all of the things that they should be taking care of, worrying about somebody's dog barking --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>PEEK:  I can -- I can just imagine how many people are staying up late recording the barking of the neighbor's dog, right?  And then the question is, is it 20 minutes consecutively, 20 minutes total?  I mean, there's a lot we don't know about this measure still, right?  So, we'll see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, boy.  All right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Coming up, jobs in America that our country's top CEOs met with President Trump for the first meeting of the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board yesterday.

His reaction right here later this hour.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning, but first, our top story this half an hour, Jobs in America.  President Trump meeting with some of the country's top CEOs at the White House yesterday, for the first meeting of the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board.  The President touting his record on manufacturing jobs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If you remember from past years, others said that manufacturing was not going to happen, those jobs were never coming back, and they are coming back with 600,000.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They're coming roaring.</p><p>TRUMP:  Right, they're roaring back.  We have 600,000 and it'll be a lot higher than that when the next report comes out.  And it's really been something, the manufacturing jobs, so we're going to be up to getting close to record numbers.  Nobody thought they were coming back, and I said, how does that not happen, right, Mike?  If manufacturing jobs come back, does the country come back?  And we're doing really well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President's daughter, Ivanka Trump, is leading that advisory board.  Joining us right now is the National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO, Jay Timmons, he was at the meeting, yesterday.  Jay, good to see you, thanks so much for being here.</p><p>JAY TIMMONS, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS:  Good morning.  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell us the takeaway of that meeting yesterday, what were their priorities?</p><p>TIMMONS:  Well, the interesting takeaway is, as you heard, manufacturing is really on the rise right now.  We've created about 450,000 jobs in the last two years.  And the two years prior to that is about 60,000.  So, you can see the huge increase, the number of jobs being created in manufacturing.  It's no secret why, it's because of tax reform, it is because of regulatory certainty.  So, manufacturers are very optimistic.  About 91.8 percent, 9 out of 10 manufacturers are optimistic about the future.  That record has been consistent for nine consecutive quarters.  But the problem that we have right now is we can't find enough people to do the jobs that we have open.  We have 428,000 openings in manufacturing, that was one of the topics yesterday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about educating our people in terms of what's going on with machine learning, A.I., China.  I mean, all of these threats seem to be getting higher, what are we doing to counter that?</p><p>TIMMONS:  Yes.  So, you know, I wouldn't call it a threat, I'd call it an opportunity, and that is exactly what the focus was yesterday, and I think the administration is very, very right to be able to look at what we need to do to align our educational curriculum, to be able to promote these new jobs that are available in manufacturing.  They're all based on technology and robotics and artificial intelligence.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>TIMMONS:  So, the jobs aren't leaving us, in fact, as we just said, they're coming in droves, but we need people with the skills necessary to do those jobs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  So, are we teaching those skills is really what I'm asking?</p><p>TIMMONS:  Yes.  So, no, I don't think we're doing it well enough.  I mean, we are -- we are somewhat, and certainly, that's one of the things we're doing at the National Association of Manufacturers, is we are -- we are working with institutions of higher education, elementary schools, to try to make sure that we align the curriculum for the job of the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  James?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Hi, Jay, James Freeman of The Wall Street Journal.  I wanted to --</p><p>TIMMONS:  Hi, James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Good to see you.  I wanted to ask you about -- you mentioned that there's general optimism but companies can't find workers.  We've seen lately some kind of soft data for manufacturing, good service data from the Service Economy, but manufacturing numbers kind of soft, is that the employment problem not being able to find jobs and you see that continuing or is it -- you think there's a blip and the surveys get better as we go forward through the year?</p><p>TIMMONS:  Well, let's hope it's a blip, James, and I think it is, because you're exactly right, it's hard to produce what we produce without people to do it.  So, there's 428,000 as I mentioned, openings today.  The Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte have studied this problem for many years.  Their latest data indicate that we're going to have to hire 4. -- now, this is amazing number -- 4.6 million people over the course of the next 10 years.</p><p>But on the trajectory that we're currently on, 2.4 million of those jobs will go unfilled.  That is not good for our productivity, that is not good for our output, and that is not good for America's standing in the global economy.  So, we need to find those people, we need to train them and educate them, and that's what the American Workforce panel is all about.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So, did anyone at the meeting urged the President to lift immigration levels?</p><p>TIMMONS:  There was some discussion of immigration.  And you saw it publicly yesterday, and the President even talked about the need for legal immigration to help ease some of this crisis.  The National Association of Manufacturers has put out a plan, it's called, \"A Way Forward,\" and it's a comprehensive look of what we need to do.  And it tries to get through all that rhetoric that we're seeing on both sides of this issue, and come up with a very solid and thoughtful plan.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because that's what you normally hear from technology CEOs, because they can't find the people to put them in the jobs that they have, partly because of the rise of automation.  We spoke with Kai-Fu Lee, who is the former President of Google China.  Here's what he said about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are the jobs that are most at risk of being eliminated as a result of artificial intelligence?</p><p>KAI-FU LEE, FORMER PRESIDENT, GOOGLE CHINA:  Well, routine jobs are at the most risk, especially the routine jobs are basically reaching quantitative decisions, and actually, the white-collar jobs, entry-level jobs that are routine are most at risk.  Then, the -- I think a lot of the same environment blue-collar work will get displaced.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Liz, that's why I brought up the issue of education because a lot of this goes right to that, we have to train our people well.</p><p>PEEK:  Absolutely, but it does seems as though that there's a big push -- individual companies are undertaking really substantial training programs, companies that really weren't particularly in that space.  Before, they're going directly as I understand it to community colleges, and even high schools now, and getting kids into workplace programs, which by the way, I think is fantastic because kids are not learning the skills they need in our high schools and even in our junior colleges.</p><p>TIMMONS:  Liz is exactly right about that.  There's no question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PEEK:  Can I ask you another question, just following up.  Is the growth in manufacturing mainly from domestic companies that have not been impacted by all the tariff wars and so forth, or do you see over the next couple of years, a lot of European companies setting up shop in the U.S.?  Where do you think the sweet spot is?</p><p>TIMMONS:  So, I think the sweet spot is really for domestic and the international companies because of our very favorable tax rates here in this country, because of our regulatory certainty.  You're seeing -- you're seeing foreign direct investment, you're also seeing expansion of traditional domestic companies here, and that's what's leading to this growth and jobs that are available.  I think Liz is right, though, if we don't train today at our -- at our elementary schools and our high schools and through our technical schools and community colleges, we're not going to be able to compete successfully in the future, and that's exactly what the President set up this panel for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And hey, Jay.  And stop shaming individuals if they choose not to get a four-year college degree if they do chose to go to a community college.  And I can't wait for more of these technology companies to just start hiring right out of high school.  We will give you the skillset if you find a 5-year contract with us after your training is over with.  I'm looking for those days.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.</p><p>TIMMONS:  And those jobs are so exciting.  And we just completed our two-week state of manufacturing tour, we went to eight states, 25 cities.  We visited all kinds of manufacturers and technical schools, and you should see these jobs that are available today.  Kids love to see what's going on in manufacturing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But again, this goes back to education.  I mean, we need an education policy that ensures we are teaching these kinds of things in middle school, so that -- so that younger people understand where the skills are that are necessary to thrive in the future.  Jay, it's great to get your --</p><p>TIMMONS:  My third-grade daughter -- I have to tell you, my third-grade daughter presented me with a little plastic heart that she 3D-printed in her third-grade class.  I was so excited about that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that.</p><p>TIMMONS:  I want to see that all across the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's fantastic.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One of my teeth is 3D-printed.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm not joking.  I have a cap that is 3D-printed, and I would think that was the coolest thing to do, ever.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is.  That is amazing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll show it to you later.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's great.  Jay, great to have you, thank you so much.  Jay Timmons joining us.</p><p>TIMMONS:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be sure to tune in tomorrow for our coverage of \"JOBS IN AMERICA,\" we are kicking that off at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  We're going to identify where the jobs are and how to get them tomorrow morning.</p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, \"Jeopardy\" Host Alex Trebek, revealing he has cancer.  Lauren Simonetti with more on that.  Lauren?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Wow.  Maria, Trebek announcing yesterday that he is fighting Stage 4 pancreatic cancer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEX TREBEK, HOST, JEOPARDY:  I plan to beat the low-survival rate statistics for this disease.  Truth told, I have to because under the terms of my contract, I have to host \"Jeopardy\" for three more years, so help me.  Keep the faith, and we'll win.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  We wish him well.  The 78-year-old right there, making light of the news.  According to TMZ, he does plan to at least finish Jeopardy's current season.  We wish him well.  Well, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and J.P. Morgan Chase's joint health care venture now has a name, Haven.  The three companies announced last month that they were teaming up to tackle rising healthcare costs.  Haven is designed to improve healthcare for the company's 1.2 million employees and family members.</p><p>And Amazon shutting down its pop-up stores, all 87 will be closed by the end of April, ending the year-long experiment.  Amazon says it's rethinking its physical retail strategy, as it prepares to roll out a new line of grocery stores and more of its cashier-less Amazon Go Stores.  So, they destroyed brick &amp; mortar, and now they're moving back in, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right, thank you, Lauren.  Coming up, an emotional day for G.M. workers this morning as the final Chevy rolls off the line at the Lordstown, Ohio plant.  What's next for the automaker and that plant, coming up?</p><p>And then, LeBron James's big moment last night, the Lakers great reaching a milestone passing Michael Jordan on NBA's career scoring list.  The special message he had for Air Jordan, coming up</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  An emotional end.  General Motors closing its Lordstown, Ohio plant.  Ashley Webster now with more details there.  Ashley, good morning.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, very sad.  We had the workers crying, the very last Chevy Cruze coming off the assembly line.  This is a plant in Lordstown, which is near Youngstown.  It's been in place since 1966.  It's pumped that 16 million vehicles but no longer.  G.M. now closed this factory unallocated, it's part of an overall restructuring of G.M.  They're going to close down five plants in all: four in the U.S., one in Ontario Canada.</p><p>In all, about 14,000 workers, now this Lordstown complex, a particular sole point for President Trump, who had made -- singled it out as a place that he wanted to remain open.  Of course, politically, it's a part of the country that's important to him in 2020.  But G.M. says, sorry, we are restructuring, we want to invest our money in cars of the future.  So, they're going to focus, as they have been on SUVs; they're going to be making trucks, electric cars and autonomous vehicles.</p><p>Now, G.M. says, look, these workers, we will do best to reassign them if they want to, and also give them up to $30,000 in assistance to do that.  I'd say about a third of those workers have applied to move somewhere else.  But no doubt, this is a very sad day for this particular plant.  Those, I say, a lot of tears on the factory floor today, as that last Chevy Cruze rolled off the assembly plant.  By the way, the UAW, the union, has already filed lawsuit saying that this move, and the closure of the other plants, is a violation of their collective bargaining agreement, saying that you can't do this.  That will play out in the courts, G.M. says, sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How can it be against the bargaining agreement?</p><p>WEBSTER:  They say that (INAUDIBLE) that does not allow G.M. to idle these plants without the input of the union.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, why would G.M. sign such a thing in the first place?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Also, I know a lot of people are going to be blaming the company or globalization.  As you said, this is consumer demand.  Americans don't like small cars.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>PEEK:  But why can't they retool this plant?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And why can't (INAUDIBLE) rather than a third go to work at some of these, you know, to make the SUVs?</p><p>WEBSTER:  They could.  And you know, but some people just don't want to move.  But regardless, a sad day for this particular facility.</p><p>PEEK:  But it's an amazing complex.  I mean, you don't just have a plant just doing this.  I mean, there's a whole infrastructure that -- I'm surprised that they can't retool, in which they've done a million times.</p><p>WEBSTER:  They may allocate another vehicle to this plant down the future but they don't have those plans in place.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  G.M. is the right size that make the cars that people want to buy.  And G.M. you know, federal government bailed out G.M. to the tune of $50 billion and they need to -- they need to reduce the production capacity and other automakers have done that.  G.M. is still playing catch-up.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, that's true and they say the memories of 2008 is very clear in their mind.  They don't want to be caught with too many factories and too many workers ever again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Ashley, thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, coming up, an NBA milestone: LeBron James getting emotional on the court after passing his hero, Michael Jordan's, all-time scoring record.  His special tribute to Air Jordan, plus more in sports next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  History in the making: LeBron James overtaking Michael Jordan.

These rings right out there at the top.  And I wanted a championship, (INAUDIBLE) that I needed inspiration and I needed some type of positive influence.  M.J. was that guy for me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  LeBron tweeted credit to Nike Basketball for his sneaker last night.

What is the show online where they make celebrities eat hot wings while they do the interview?  It's -- anyway --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that right?</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's outstanding.  People get very candid because they're so busy trying to put out the fire.  They don't really worry about what they're supposed to be saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to get some hot wing on this set.</p><p>PEEK:  That is nuts.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Good interview.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I didn't want Miller win \"Dancing with the Stars\", can't that man --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Did he?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or he was on it, I think.</p><p>MAX:  I don't know, but he's a funny, funny man.

And so I mean, it is funny though that she woke up the next day and said what have I done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, Maggie Haberman which Dagen was talking about yesterday tweeted out a conversation that she had with somebody someone close to Hillary.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.

Do you remember that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And now she wonders why black Americans didn't come out in the same numbers for her that they did for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.  So again, she still needs to -- there's a lot of like self-analysis that Hillary Clinton needs to do.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Maybe.  But the Clinton Foundation needs to raise money and I think that's why --</p><p>PEEK:  That's why she keeps her oar in.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's to raise money.  And I think when you shut the door on future high office that's not --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  They did around the election, I don't know where that stands now.

One of Huawei's chairmen saying that the Congress acted as the judge, jury and executer.  Coming up we're going to talk more about that.</p><p>It comes amid the U.S.-China trade uncertainty.  But President Trump has signaled progress in those negotiations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They're moving along well.  We'll see what happens.  They're either going to be a good deal or it's not going to be a deal.  But I think they're moving along very nicely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the former White House press secretary under President Trump, America First Action senior adviser and the author of \"The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President\", Sean Spicer is with us this morning.</p><p>Sean -- good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>SEAN SPICER, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  You bet.  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean the President was one of the first to poke China in terms of pushing back on China and all of the issues that we speak about, not just the trade imbalance but really the IP theft, the forced transfer of technology.  And now we're learning so much more about espionage and how they're spying on countries across the world -- Sean.</p><p>SPICER:  Yes, absolutely.  I mean as you point out, for decades the President's been very clear about his concern of the trade imbalance and other issues with China and Japan.</p><p>But in this particular issue, Huawei is kind of the embodiment of all of those concerns all at once.  It poses a huge national security risk for the United States.  And as we build out this 5G network in our country and throughout other places in the world, there is a deep concern about China's involvement.  I mean it is a state-owned company.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SPICER:  And it's kind of rich that Huawei is not only suing us but citing our constitution as a concern.  If you think about it, we have an entire CFIUS process to talk about foreign ownership.  And this isn't even a jump ball.  It is controlled by the Chinese government.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SPICER:  So the idea that we're taking a further step in protecting our national security and our key cyber infrastructure is crucial.</p><p>They already have foreign problems, foreign ownership issues with U.S. companies doing business in China.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SPICER:  The idea that they'd come here and basically be doing it through a back door technologically-speaking is something that the President's very right to be protecting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it's one of the issues that I brought up last week in my exclusive interview with Huawei's chief security officer, Andy Purdy, last week.  And I mentioned to him that he's got Communist Party members on his board of directors.  And yet here's what he said about IP theft.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI:  On the theft of intellectual property by the China government, that's not us.  The China government does not speak for us.  We don't speak through the China government.</p><p>I applaud the efforts of the United States and others to try to crack down on the global theft in intellectual property which has been a disgrace over the last 15 years that we haven't done enough about it.</p><p>So I'm glad to see President Trump is raising that as an important issue in the trade talks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, there you go.  The follow-up there was how many people on your board are from the Communist Party.  And there are several, actually -- Sean.</p><p>SPICER:  Right.  But I actually look at IP theft as two things.  One is sort of the manufactured goods, right.  So if you think about everything from movies to knock-off watches and iPhones -- things where they're stealing our intellectual property and making products that present themselves as U.S.-made products.</p><p>But then you have the intellectual property that Huawei really poses a deep threat on which is going into the networks and pulling out the guts of what a lot of our companies and networks that our things run on and the computing and being able to embed their information into our critical infrastructures.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SPICER: I think that's the big problem that Huawei poses.  And I don't think that people understand that.  Just owning some of their phones in itself, you've got to kind of be able to pull it back and wonder what's embedded in that phone.  Are they able to send back encrypted data and messages and other key infrastructure type things back to their home network.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Which is why when the Secretary of State was in the studio just a couple of weeks ago he said if European countries are using Huawei telecom, James -- then the U.S. is going to have to pull back and not share all of the information that normally we would with our European friends.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, that's right.  I think that was a really key interview, just pointing out that there could be consequences to countries that don't cooperate with the U.S. on this.</p><p>But Sean -- I'm wondering just as a political question, in terms of persuasion, do you think the President has a good political case here, whether it's to a domestic audience or to countries overseas, that he's trying to persuade not to use Huawei technology?</p><p>SPICER:  I think domestically, James -- it makes a ton of sense.  I don't think that there's a ton of concern about standing up to China in any of these issues -- whether it's trade, IP theft, et cetera, tech transfer.  The President's going to be hopefully rewarded in a bipartisan way because I think all Americans understand not just the national security threats that China poses but the sort of -- the other trade issues that we have with China.  And so I think the President would have bipartisan accolades for standing up to them.</p><p>I think my fear is more that China presents sort of this cheap option not to just domestic consumers with their phones but also to European folks who may not have the same capability to build the networks that we do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>SPICER:  And that's where I think the problem is.  They present this cheap immediate alternative that's really appealing to folks that would have long-term devastating consequences.  And that's why I think the President's not just standing up for America but frankly standing up for the entire world right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because this is a major issues.</p><p>We've got to switch gears and get your comment on this Democratic-control House Judiciary Committee meeting and how they issued the subpoenas to 81 individuals and entities as part of an investigation into President Trump -- Sean.  You are one of the people receiving a subpoena.  Tell us, have you received it?</p><p>SPICER:  Well, I'm not going to comment clearly on anything with respect to this investigation.  I will say the Democrats started this whole thing off a while back talking about Russia and collusion.  They had a House investigation, didn't prove anything; in fact came out and said there was no collusion.</p><p>Then they put all their chips in the Senate basket.  That came out, Senator Burr --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SPICER: -- and even Senator Warner and said nothing.</p><p>Now, they've moved on and even Chairman Nadler has said now they're going beyond that scope.  And I think there's a point at which they're going to jump the shark and lose the support of the American people who realize this is purely a fishing expedition into a political opponent.</p><p>They're now going after the President, his associates, his business dealings and his past interactions with individuals because simply they don't like him.  They're literally on a fishing expedition.  They had three shots at this --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  They got their guy, now they're looking for the crime.</p><p>SPICER: -- the House Committee, the Senate --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to correct something though.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They haven't been subpoenaed.  Based on what we know they're request for documents, that's different.  Maybe it takes -- maybe the judiciary committee takes that step.  But I do not believe --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  If they don't -- right --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I don't believe they've been subpoenaed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  If they don't willingly send the documents, then the documents will be subpoenaed as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just to clarify that and if I'm wrong, I'll correct it.  But I don't believe it's gone that far yet.</p><p>PEEK:  Has there ever been a president subjected to this kind of scrutiny and investigation to your knowledge -- Sean?</p><p>SPICER:  Well, I think one of the things that's interesting, Liz -- is it's one thing to be subjected to scrutiny, right.  If there's been a crime, if there's something to look into.</p><p>PEEK:  Exactly.</p><p>SPICER:  At this point what they're saying is we don't know so we're just going to look into all of these entities and all of these individuals and see what we come up with.</p><p>I think that's vastly different in terms of approach because everyone keeps looking at past issues, where there is evidence of something and there was an investigation that followed it.</p><p>In this case, I think the Democrats like I said have jumped the shark.  They basically have said we've got to get him.  So let's figure out all of the people and associations and corporations and associations around him.  And if we dig far enough we'll probably find something.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SPICER:  And so I think that's the big difference because it's not an investigation into wrongdoing.  It's an investigation to find wrongdoing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  They have their guy.  Now they want to find the crime.  So they're going to go under every rock to try to do that.</p><p>Meanwhile we know that there was wrongdoing done in the 2016 election.  We know that there was FISA abuse.  We know that a couple of people tried to put their finger on the scale and change an election and get the duly-elected president out but there's no mention of that.</p><p>SPICER:  Well there's also, look -- and I'm not trying to rehash old talking points here -- but there's also, if they want to talk about associations with Russia, we know of them.  We know that the Clinton Foundation took money, we know that the former president received money, we know that John Podesta was -- you know -- so we know all of these things.</p><p>And the fact of the matter is that they have just sort of turned a blind eye to all of those past wrongdoings that are known and we've spent no time investigating those actual issues of wrongdoing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, exactly.  Sean -- thank you.  We will see you soon.</p><p>SPICER:  You bet -- guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sean Spicer joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the home of the future -- one company is using 3D printers to build affordable homes.  We will take a tour of that with HUD Secretary Ben Carson later this hour.  He's going to join us live.</p><p>And then a new way to never be bored, a look at how Nintendo is using cardboard in its new VR product for its wildly (ph) popular Switch game.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Democrats are divided over a measure on Congresswoman Ilhan Omar's comments.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details on that now -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  And Maria -- some in-fighting in the Democratic Party.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is postponing a vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism because some House Democrats are pushing back.  This after freshman Congresswoman Ilhan Omar suggested last week that Jewish-Americans are pushing lawmakers to pledge allegiance to Israel.</p><p>The Minnesota lawmaker giving Fox News, check this out, the silent treatment when questioned about her perceived anti-Semitic comments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Congresswoman Omar, it seems like there's some confusion among your colleagues.  Are you anti-Semitic?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Didn't answer Peter Doocy there.  Omar's fellow freshmen and their liberal supporters protesting the way Democratic leaders tried to rush out the resolution.</p><p>Well, Family Dollar is getting a makeover. Its parent company, Dollar Tree, announcing it will close up to 390 Family Dollar stores this year.  It's also going to experiment with charging more than a dollar for some items and selling alcohol.  Dollar Tree admitting that it paid too much for Family Dollar, writing off nearly $3 billion in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Let's take a look.  Shares of Dollar Tree, they're up 12 percent for the year.  That's a one week chart that you're looking at.</p><p>Women's fashion retailer Charlotte Russe is closing all of its remaining stores as it files for bankruptcy.  The company was unable to find a buyer before the deadline set by lenders and has run out of cash.  Charlotte Russe said it had more than 500 stores when it filed for bankruptcy.</p><p>So another store closes shop -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, incredible.</p><p>All right.  Thank you -- Lauren.</p><p>Coming up automation transforming manufacturing -- the effect on jobs in America coming up next.</p><p>Then, it is wine o'clock somewhere.  Yes, wine o'clock.  We've got the best time of the day to enjoy a glass of wine.  Details on when you should unwind later this hour.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>The future of manufacturing -- Rockwell Automation helping companies across several industries make their production more efficient.  A key issue for many companies now is uncertainty over the potential U.S./China trade deal.</p><p>Joining us right now is Rockwell Automation CEO Blake Moret.  Great to see you -- Blake.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>BLAKE MORET, CEO, ROCKWELL AUTOMATIN:  Great -- Maria.  Thank you for -- thanks for allowing me to be on your show.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, we're happy you're here.  You know, this is such an important industry and the China story has been integral to really the growth of so many businesses.</p><p>Let me start there in terms of the U.S.-China trade deal.  Has the tariffs and the impact of it been an impact for your company?</p><p>MORET:  Well, the uncertainty is certainly not helping.  But as we're providing customers from around the world being more productive, China's an important market for us.</p><p>The U.S. is our largest market and our ability to help U.S. manufacturers do more with less and to create sustainable production processes is really important for us and that continues to be strong.  The American economy, the American manufacturing economy remains strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And automation is so important in the manufacturing economy.  Where are you seeing growth right now in terms of sectors?</p><p>MORET:  So we provide automation and workforce development for a wide variety of industries within the U.S., particularly important and particularly strong growth areas are food and beverage, as U.S. manufacturers seek to expand their operations around the world.</p><p>Life sciences, as people want to live longer and healthier and we've seen strong growth in the life sciences pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>Certain heavy industries, so U.S. oil and gas and so on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, in the last quarter you talked a lot about paper and pulp being among those heavy industries that were among the drivers.  Does that stand still?</p><p>MORET:  It does.  Pulp and paper added a lot of capacity back in the late 80s and early 90s.  And a lot of that equipment needs to be refreshed.  And people are looking for new, modern technology.  And so we're seeing quite a boost in that industry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean we're talking about the automation, industrial automation as far as a growth story for the U.S.  What steps need to be taken to ensure that our workers can thrive in today's economy?  Because a lot of people say, look, our people are not skilled enough.</p><p>That's why the White House is going through this skills advisory board, that a number of CEOs are involved.  I know you as well.  So tell us about that.</p><p>MORET:  So first of all, I think the perception, and we're happy to see the trends going in the right direction, that the recognition that manufacturing is at the vital core of the American economy is starting to be more widely recognized.  And so as more people look at manufacturing as a great destination for their career, that's a good starting point.</p><p>Then the concept of life-long learning, so becoming comfortable with STEM skills early in their careers and then having manufacturers continue to make the commitment to provide training so that workers are comfortable with the advanced technology -- that's the winning combination.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Isn't that about education?</p><p>MORET:  It is about education but in a variety of forms.  It's not necessarily requiring college degrees.  We have a program that we started a year ago, the academy of advanced manufacturing for returning veterans.  We graduated over a hundred veterans so far on our way to a thousand a year.</p><p>Most of these veterans have high school educations and in a 12-week hands-on program, we equip them for technician level skills at U.S. manufacturers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that you're doing this because this is really underlining the point that it's really the onus is on private business, the onus is on companies to make sure our people are trained.</p><p>MORET:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It should be a partnership, I guess.  But you don't want government getting involved in everything but you could actually do it as a private company.</p><p>MORET:  There are certain things the government can do to help but we're not waiting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>The company recently partnered with Schlumberger to create a company with a goal of advancing digital technology and automation in the oil field.  Tell us about that and about the innovation you're seeing in the oil field.</p><p>MORET:  So again, in oil as in other industries that we serve, it's about doing more with less.  And if you can have more efficient wells, then you have to drill less of them.  And so the ability to work with Schlumberger, which has unequaled domain expertise in oil and gas and with our control know-how, it's a great marriage, brought together to help advance the concept of a digital oil field.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So tell me where the growth comes from at this point from Rockwell.  Let's say looking out three years.</p><p>MORET:  Well, it's certainly about the basic automation.  There continues to be demand for the basic automation of repetitive physical processes, but increasingly it's about taking the data that's a natural byproduct of those automation processes and turning it into additional insights, whether it's through artificial intelligence, whether it's through other forms of software-based technology to take that data, turn it into insights and working with the people who are in these manufacturing operations to help them make better decisions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  AI is so important and getting more important.  What kind of data are you referring to as it relates to oil?</p><p>MORET:  So a lot of that is about predicting maintenance issues before it causes down time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p>MORET:  Nothing drives a return on investment like reducing unplanned down time and so that's a big part of the focus of what we're doing with Schlumberger.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we're looking at a chart of your stock.  And obviously you've done real well in terms of your execution.  And we are happy to report that your company was named one of the most ethical companies in the world.</p><p>MORET:  Well, it's about long-term value and it's about winning the right way.  And it's important to our customers.  It's important to our share owners.  And it's important to our employees.  It's one of our best recruiting tools.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Blake -- it's great to have you on the program.</p><p>MORET:  Thanks so much -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Blake Moret here --</p><p>MORET:  I appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- joining us, the CEO of Rockwell Automation.</p><p>Coming up, the longest-held American hostage in history.

Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, March 7th.</p><p>Your top stories right now, just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Chinese telecom giant Huawei making it official this morning.  The company has filed a lawsuit against the United States, saying that Congress acted as judge, jury and executioner.</p><p>Markets are on edge this morning, futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages.  Dow Industrials down about 90 points right now, one-third of 1 percent.  This is the low of the morning right here.  S&amp;P 500 down 7.25, Nasdaq down 21 points this morning.</p><p>That after another day of declines yesterday making it three in a row.  The market was lower across the board.  Dow Industrials down 133 points yesterday, at the close, half of a percent.  S&amp;P 500 was down 18.  And the Nasdaq was down 70 points, it was almost 1 percent lower on the Nasdaq.</p><p>In Europe this morning we are awaiting on the European Central Bank.  We will get the decision on stimulus as well as the news conference from ECB president, Mario Draghi.  Investors are looking to see what he says about tightening policy amid the economic slowdown in the region</p><p>Markets are down across the board in Europe.  FT 100 down 30 points.  CAC 40 in Paris down 18.  And the DAX index in Germany lower by 50 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets are mostly lower with the exception of China.

Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>I just really hope Hillary Clinton comes in the race.  I just think that would be so much fun.  Sorry.</p><p>I really do.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It would.</p><p>PEEK:  I mean everyone was shocked that she actually made this announcement to a very small, local newspaper I believe it was.  And so I mean, it is funny though that she woke up the next day and said what have I done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, Maggie Haberman which Dagen was talking about yesterday tweeted out a conversation that she had with somebody someone close to Hillary.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And she -- Hillary of course, immediately pivoted to gender bias, saying how -- why aren't you asking John Kerry if he's not running.  Well, because you ran against Trump and lost and you won't go away.</p><p>You gave this speech in Alabama over the weekend, that you lived in the south for much of your adult life and you still can't sound like a southerner.  And she was blaming the Voting Rights Act being chipped away at as one of the reasons that she lost.</p><p>PEEK:  She is also now blaming people in Minnesota or Michigan on race, basically, that they --</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Wisconsin.</p><p>PEEK:  Wisconsin -- excuse me.  That's right.  I mean, really.  Get over it Hillary, please.  Do something else.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me just point out something.  1994 crime bill, later which was -- she lobbied for, her husband signed into law.  She later referred to essentially young black men in part who were in gangs as super predators.</p><p>And then remember she asked -- she said that she wasn't going to drop out of the Democratic nomination process against Barack Obama in 2008 because she said remember, Kennedy got shot in June.  Do you remember that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And now she wonders why black Americans didn't come out in the same numbers for her that they did for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.  So again, she still needs to -- there's a lot of like self-analysis that Hillary Clinton needs to do.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Maybe.  But the Clinton Foundation needs to raise money and I think that's why --</p><p>PEEK:  That's why she keeps her oar in.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's to raise money.  And I think when you shut the door on future high office that's not --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  They did around the election, I don't know where that stands now.  Let's talk about that actually coming up.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning is Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson joining us this morning, along with New York Congressman and House Ways and Means Committee member Tom Reed joining us.

So if you think about everything from movies to knock-off watches and iPhones -- things where they're stealing our intellectual property and making products that present themselves as U.S.-made products.</p><p>But then you have the intellectual property that Huawei really poses a deep threat on which is going into the networks and pulling out the guts of what a lot of our companies and networks that our things run on and the computing and being able to embed their information into our critical infrastructures.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SPICER: I think that's the big problem that Huawei poses.  And I don't think that people understand that.  Just owning some of their phones in itself, you've got to kind of be able to pull it back and wonder what's embedded in that phone.  Are they able to send back encrypted data and messages and other key infrastructure type things back to their home network.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Which is why when the Secretary of State was in the studio just a couple of weeks ago he said if European countries are using Huawei telecom, James -- then the U.S. is going to have to pull back and not share all of the information that normally we would with our European friends.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, that's right.  I think that was a really key interview, just pointing out that there could be consequences to countries that don't cooperate with the U.S. on this.</p><p>But Sean -- I'm wondering just as a political question, in terms of persuasion, do you think the President has a good political case here, whether it's to a domestic audience or to countries overseas, that he's trying to persuade not to use Huawei technology?</p><p>SPICER:  I think domestically, James -- it makes a ton of sense.  I don't think that there's a ton of concern about standing up to China in any of these issues -- whether it's trade, IP theft, et cetera, tech transfer.  The President's going to be hopefully rewarded in a bipartisan way because I think all Americans understand not just the national security threats that China poses but the sort of -- the other trade issues that we have with China.  And so I think the President would have bipartisan accolades for standing up to them.</p><p>I think my fear is more that China presents sort of this cheap option not to just domestic consumers with their phones but also to European folks who may not have the same capability to build the networks that we do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>SPICER:  And that's where I think the problem is.  They present this cheap immediate alternative that's really appealing to folks that would have long-term devastating consequences.  And that's why I think the President's not just standing up for America but frankly standing up for the entire world right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because this is a major issues.</p><p>We've got to switch gears and get your comment on this Democratic-control House Judiciary Committee meeting and how they issued the subpoenas to 81 individuals and entities as part of an investigation into President Trump -- Sean.  You are one of the people receiving a subpoena.  Tell us, have you received it?</p><p>SPICER:  Well, I'm not going to comment clearly on anything with respect to this investigation.  I will say the Democrats started this whole thing off a while back talking about Russia and collusion.  They had a House investigation, didn't prove anything; in fact came out and said there was no collusion.</p><p>Then they put all their chips in the Senate basket.  That came out, Senator Burr --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SPICER: -- and even Senator Warner and said nothing.</p><p>Now, they've moved on and even Chairman Nadler has said now they're going beyond that scope.  And I think there's a point at which they're going to jump the shark and lose the support of the American people who realize this is purely a fishing expedition into a political opponent.</p><p>They're now going after the President, his associates, his business dealings and his past interactions with individuals because simply they don't like him.  They're literally on a fishing expedition.  They had three shots at this --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  They got their guy, now they're looking for the crime.</p><p>SPICER: -- the House Committee, the Senate --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to correct something though.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They haven't been subpoenaed.  Based on what we know they're request for documents, that's different.  Maybe it takes -- maybe the judiciary committee takes that step.  But I do not believe --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  If they don't -- right --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I don't believe they've been subpoenaed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  If they don't willingly send the documents, then the documents will be subpoenaed as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just to clarify that and if I'm wrong, I'll correct it.  But I don't believe it's gone that far yet.</p><p>PEEK:  Has there ever been a president subjected to this kind of scrutiny and investigation to your knowledge -- Sean?</p><p>SPICER:  Well, I think one of the things that's interesting, Liz -- is it's one thing to be subjected to scrutiny, right.  If there's been a crime, if there's something to look into.</p><p>PEEK:  Exactly.</p><p>SPICER:  At this point what they're saying is we don't know so we're just going to look into all of these entities and all of these individuals and see what we come up with.</p><p>I think that's vastly different in terms of approach because everyone keeps looking at past issues, where there is evidence of something and there was an investigation that followed it.</p><p>In this case, I think the Democrats like I said have jumped the shark.  They basically have said we've got to get him.  So let's figure out all of the people and associations and corporations and associations around him.  And if we dig far enough we'll probably find something.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SPICER:  And so I think that's the big difference because it's not an investigation into wrongdoing.  It's an investigation to find wrongdoing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  They have their guy.  Now they want to find the crime.  So they're going to go under every rock to try to do that.</p><p>Meanwhile we know that there was wrongdoing done in the 2016 election.  We know that there was FISA abuse.  We know that a couple of people tried to put their finger on the scale and change an election and get the duly-elected president out but there's no mention of that.</p><p>SPICER:  Well there's also, look -- and I'm not trying to rehash old talking points here -- but there's also, if they want to talk about associations with Russia, we know of them.  We know that the Clinton Foundation took money, we know that the former president received money, we know that John Podesta was -- you know -- so we know all of these things.</p><p>And the fact of the matter is that they have just sort of turned a blind eye to all of those past wrongdoings that are known and we've spent no time investigating those actual issues of wrongdoing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, exactly.  Sean -- thank you.  We will see you soon.</p><p>SPICER:  You bet -- guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sean Spicer joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the home of the future -- one company is using 3D printers to build affordable homes.  We will take a tour of that with HUD Secretary Ben Carson later this hour.  He's going to join us live.</p><p>And then a new way to never be bored, a look at how Nintendo is using cardboard in its new VR product for its wildly (ph) popular Switch game.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Democrats are divided over a measure on Congresswoman Ilhan Omar's comments.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details on that now -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  And Maria -- some in-fighting in the Democratic Party.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is postponing a vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism because some House Democrats are pushing back.  This after freshman Congresswoman Ilhan Omar suggested last week that Jewish-Americans are pushing lawmakers to pledge allegiance to Israel.</p><p>The Minnesota lawmaker giving Fox News, check this out, the silent treatment when questioned about her perceived anti-Semitic comments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Congresswoman Omar, it seems like there's some confusion among your colleagues.  Are you anti-Semitic?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Didn't answer Peter Doocy there.

Thank you -- Lauren.</p><p>Coming up automation transforming manufacturing -- the effect on jobs in America coming up next.</p><p>Then, it is wine o'clock somewhere.  Yes, wine o'clock.  We've got the best time of the day to enjoy a glass of wine.  Details on when you should unwind later this hour.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>The future of manufacturing -- Rockwell Automation helping companies across several industries make their production more efficient.  A key issue for many companies now is uncertainty over the potential U.S./China trade deal.</p><p>Joining us right now is Rockwell Automation CEO Blake Moret.  Great to see you -- Blake.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>BLAKE MORET, CEO, ROCKWELL AUTOMATIN:  Great -- Maria.  Thank you for -- thanks for allowing me to be on your show.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, we're happy you're here.  You know, this is such an important industry and the China story has been integral to really the growth of so many businesses.</p><p>Let me start there in terms of the U.S.-China trade deal.  Has the tariffs and the impact of it been an impact for your company?</p><p>MORET:  Well, the uncertainty is certainly not helping.  But as we're providing customers from around the world being more productive, China's an important market for us.</p><p>The U.S. is our largest market and our ability to help U.S. manufacturers do more with less and to create sustainable production processes is really important for us and that continues to be strong.  The American economy, the American manufacturing economy remains strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And automation is so important in the manufacturing economy.  Where are you seeing growth right now in terms of sectors?</p><p>MORET:  So we provide automation and workforce development for a wide variety of industries within the U.S., particularly important and particularly strong growth areas are food and beverage, as U.S. manufacturers seek to expand their operations around the world.</p><p>Life sciences, as people want to live longer and healthier and we've seen strong growth in the life sciences pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>Certain heavy industries, so U.S. oil and gas and so on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, in the last quarter you talked a lot about paper and pulp being among those heavy industries that were among the drivers.  Does that stand still?</p><p>MORET:  It does.  Pulp and paper added a lot of capacity back in the late 80s and early 90s.  And a lot of that equipment needs to be refreshed.  And people are looking for new, modern technology.  And so we're seeing quite a boost in that industry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean we're talking about the automation, industrial automation as far as a growth story for the U.S.  What steps need to be taken to ensure that our workers can thrive in today's economy?  Because a lot of people say, look, our people are not skilled enough.</p><p>That's why the White House is going through this skills advisory board, that a number of CEOs are involved.  I know you as well.  So tell us about that.</p><p>MORET:  So first of all, I think the perception, and we're happy to see the trends going in the right direction, that the recognition that manufacturing is at the vital core of the American economy is starting to be more widely recognized.  And so as more people look at manufacturing as a great destination for their career, that's a good starting point.</p><p>Then the concept of life-long learning, so becoming comfortable with STEM skills early in their careers and then having manufacturers continue to make the commitment to provide training so that workers are comfortable with the advanced technology -- that's the winning combination.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Isn't that about education?</p><p>MORET:  It is about education but in a variety of forms.  It's not necessarily requiring college degrees.  We have a program that we started a year ago, the academy of advanced manufacturing for returning veterans.  We graduated over a hundred veterans so far on our way to a thousand a year.</p><p>Most of these veterans have high school educations and in a 12-week hands-on program, we equip them for technician level skills at U.S. manufacturers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that you're doing this because this is really underlining the point that it's really the onus is on private business, the onus is on companies to make sure our people are trained.</p><p>MORET:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It should be a partnership, I guess.  But you don't want government getting involved in everything but you could actually do it as a private company.</p><p>MORET:  There are certain things the government can do to help but we're not waiting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>The company recently partnered with Schlumberger to create a company with a goal of advancing digital technology and automation in the oil field.  Tell us about that and about the innovation you're seeing in the oil field.</p><p>MORET:  So again, in oil as in other industries that we serve, it's about doing more with less.  And if you can have more efficient wells, then you have to drill less of them.  And so the ability to work with Schlumberger, which has unequaled domain expertise in oil and gas and with our control know-how, it's a great marriage, brought together to help advance the concept of a digital oil field.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So tell me where the growth comes from at this point from Rockwell.  Let's say looking out three years.</p><p>MORET:  Well, it's certainly about the basic automation.  There continues to be demand for the basic automation of repetitive physical processes, but increasingly it's about taking the data that's a natural byproduct of those automation processes and turning it into additional insights, whether it's through artificial intelligence, whether it's through other forms of software-based technology to take that data, turn it into insights and working with the people who are in these manufacturing operations to help them make better decisions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  AI is so important and getting more important.  What kind of data are you referring to as it relates to oil?</p><p>MORET:  So a lot of that is about predicting maintenance issues before it causes down time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p>MORET:  Nothing drives a return on investment like reducing unplanned down time and so that's a big part of the focus of what we're doing with Schlumberger.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we're looking at a chart of your stock.  And obviously you've done real well in terms of your execution.  And we are happy to report that your company was named one of the most ethical companies in the world.</p><p>MORET:  Well, it's about long-term value and it's about winning the right way.  And it's important to our customers.  It's important to our share owners.  And it's important to our employees.  It's one of our best recruiting tools.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Blake -- it's great to have you on the program.</p><p>MORET:  Thanks so much -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Blake Moret here --</p><p>MORET:  I appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- joining us, the CEO of Rockwell Automation.</p><p>Coming up, the longest-held American hostage in history.  We're talking with the son of Bob Levinson this morning.  The former FBI agent has been held for nearly 12 years in Iran.</p><p>Wait until you hear this.  That's next.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 7th, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Markets are lower this morning.  Dow Industrials expected to be down about 60 points, right out of the gate, a quarter of a percent lower, S&amp;P 500 is down 5, and the NASDAQ is down 16, after another day of declines yesterday, making it three in a row.  Yesterday, the markets were down, the triple digits on the Dow, down 133 points.  The S&amp;P 500 is down 18 and the NASDAQ down 70.</p><p>The big event this morning is the European Central Bank meeting, we will hear details out of the ECB in about 15 minutes on whether the ECB will move on interest rates, provide stimulus for the European economy.</p><p>Mario Draghi, the president of the ECB will also give a news conference.  We're looking to see what he says about tightening policy amid the economic slowdown in the region.  Last check, we were expecting the Eurozone to grow just one percent in 2019.</p><p>All the major indices are lower this morning, in Europe, FT 100 down 26, CAC Quarante down 18, and the DAX Index down 56.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly lower, it was fractional moves pretty much.  The Hang Seng, the worst performer, down almost one percent in Hong Kong.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, bringing Americans home, President Trump spoke out yesterday on negotiations for Americans held captive overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We've gotten a lot of them out and they shouldn't have been there.  Aya from Egypt and many others, North Korea, we have a few negotiations going on right now.  I won't tell you where because we don't want to blow the negotiation out the window, but we have a few negotiations going on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And one of the Americans that the President could be talking about is Robert Levinson.  You remember this story.  He disappeared in Iran, 12 years ago, on Saturday.  Levinson was in the FBI and on a private investigation as a contractor for the CIA, when he disappeared in Iran.</p><p>Today, his wife will appear at a hearing on Capitol Hill to discuss the status of American hostages held in Iran.  Joining me right now is Congressman Ted Deutch from the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Robert Levinson's son, Daniel Levinson, is joining us as well.  Good to see you both, gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. TED DEUTCH (D-FL), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Congressman, you are going to be bringing -- introducing a bill that would create a Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs.  Tell us about this and whether or not you believe Bob Levinson will be freed any time soon.</p><p>DEUTCH:  Well, thanks for having me and it's good to be with Dan, as well.  Bob's the longest-held American in history, Saturday will mark 12 years, and we have to do everything we can to bring the world's attention to Bob's case.</p><p>That's why we're reintroducing a resolution that I've introduced to every Congress to get the entire House of Representatives on record, speaking as one, to bring Bob home.</p><p>And this legislation, Maria that you talked about that will elevate the person who is in charge of working to negotiate, to bring home all hostages, in this case, the focus being on Bob, and will impose sanctions on countries who take Americans, hostage.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DEUTCH:  This is -- this is an issue that should matter to every American because every American is at risk when one of us is taken hostage around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Daniel, have you heard anything about your father?  What can you tell us?</p><p>DANIEL LEVINSON, SON OF BOB LEVINSON, MISSING IN IRAN:  We're constantly hearing from people inside and outside of Iran.  There are sightings of him.  It's always encouraging because we're just looking for every kind of -- any kind of information.</p><p>It's been several years since we actually got the proof of life.  But we're just meeting with anybody who has information, talking to anybody.  So, that's the latest on him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're saying you've heard that there were sightings of your father in Iran?</p><p>LEVINSON:  Yes.  We get a lot of information coming in and out and, you know, it's hard to discern what is true and what's not, but we know that the FBI's looking into it, the U.S. government's always looking into it, and we're going to follow up with anybody who has information.</p><p>There is a $5 million reward out there for anybody who does have information, leading to my dad's safe return home.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it feels like President Trump is adamant about making this a priority.  Do you think there's been enough pressure on Iran to free your father?</p><p>LEVINSON:  We're encouraged, especially with the bills, like what Congressman Deutch was talking about, that are going to impose sanctions.  And I think I'm encouraged -- encourage increased pressure against Iran, increased sanctions by the United States government over the past year is going to --</p><p>We're hopeful that's going to bring the Iranians to the table and actually pressure them to finally release my dad.  It's only going to -- we've learned from experience, for 12 years, dealing with the Iranians, they only respond to pressure.  And we're going to have to keep up the pressure.  We're hopeful that the President and his administration are going to keep doing that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about that, Congressman?  What kind of pressure can you put on the Iranians to free Mr. Levinson?</p><p>DEUTCH:  Well, that's one of the reasons that we're introducing this legislation, the idea is that we ought to be able to make countries, in this case, to make Iran pay, if they take Americans, hostage.  You can do that through sanctions.  You can do that by denying visas.</p><p>The important thing to remember here is that Bob's the longest-held American hostage in history and Iran has offered to cooperate and yet, they have not.  They refuse to acknowledge any responsibility for Bob, being taken captive.  And we have to continue to work here in Congress and with our allies around the world to increase, to maximize pressure on Iran.</p><p>The President has a powerful -- a powerful pulpit from which to do that and I've spoken to multiple -- every Secretary of State since I've been here, I've raised this with anyone in the administration, two different administrations who can help.  The Levinsons are a beautiful family and they deserve to have Bob, home, with them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And Daniel, I mean, your father spent 20 years in the FBI, he retired from the FBI in '98 and was working as a -- as a private investigator when he traveled to Kish Island, Iran.  Can you tell us a bit about what happened when he left and when the last time you spoke with him?</p><p>LEVINSON:  Well, I can confirm that he never left.  He was definitely taken -- detained by authorities there, in his hotel, somewhere around between the time that he checked out of his hotel and he never made it to the airport.  His flight has never -- his passport's never shown up in any -- in any other countries, no flight manifest ever had his name.</p><p>So, we know that he's still in the country and that the Iranian government definitely knows exactly where he is.  There are people -- it might be just a few people within the government, but they know that he was taken on Kish Island.  It's a very small island.  I've been there twice now.</p><p>And it's impossible to believe that they don't know exactly what happened to him.  It's very tiny and very -- it's a tight security state, so they know what's going on there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Congressman, you serve as the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East.  What can you do?  I mean, how has this platform helped you pursue Bob's case?</p><p>DEUTCH:  Well, today, we're using this platform to highlight Bob's case and all the Americans who have gone -- have been held hostage in Iran and we're holding a hearing so that, again, this Congress will make clear that we can't accept this any longer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DEUTCH:  We're going to give -- we're going to give Christine the opportunity to speak to the world about Bob.  And Maria, can I just add, you have an important network that major business executives watch.  The power of CEOs and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DEUTCH:  -- the business community to actually take a stand here, in dealing with the business that affects Iran --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DEUTCH:  -- is also important and I hope that people will consider that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think this is a really important point.  And Daniel, I want to get back to this in a moment and ask you what you're expecting to hear from your mother.</p><p>But Congressman, let me stay with you for a moment and ask you, given your prominent position on the Foreign Affairs Committee, obviously, one of the big topics of conversation is your colleague, Congresswoman Omar's comments.  Do you want her to step off of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Sir?</p><p>DEUTCH:  Well, I'll tell you what I want, Maria.  I want a very strong condemnation of anti-Semitism to pass in the House today.  We've had lots of discussions about foreign policy.  But the fact is that using anti-Semitic tropes, like the Dual-Loyalty Charge, which I take so personally, both as a member of Congress and the son of a World War II veteran, that language is unacceptable and must be condemned.</p><p>It's important that we do it clearly.  It's important that we do it singularly, and it's important that we do it today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  How come this keeps getting delayed?  I mean, I'm sort of like, scratching my head a little, saying well, obviously, anti-Semitism is -- should be condemned and, obviously, bigotry should be condemned.  I mean, we need a resolution to tell us that?  I mean, this is pretty obvious, isn't it?</p><p>DEUTCH:  Well, of course, it should be condemned and we --and we condemn it --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how come it keeps getting delayed, though?  It keeps getting delayed, right?</p><p>DEUTCH:  We should condemn it every way we can.  It's important for the entire house, I believe, to have the opportunity to condemn the use of anti-Semitic tropes that throughout the history of the Jewish people, has led to threats and expulsion from countries and violence and death, and we need to do it quickly.  There is no time to waste, I agree with you.  It needs to happen right away.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I totally agree with you, Congressman, and that's all good and fine, but people say that that's not going far enough.  I mean, if you've got a key member on your committee, Congresswoman Omar, who is obviously making anti-Semitic comments, wouldn't the best thing to just ask her to step off of the committee?</p><p>I mean, that's what the Republicans did with Steve King, right, they relieved him of all of his committee assignments.  Why not just relieve her of this committee assignment?</p><p>DEUTCH:  Yes.  Look, Maria, I think the last -- the last time we dealt with this, just weeks ago, entire house leadership offered a strong condemnation.  This time, it's important for the entire House of Representatives to do the same thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that would be enough for you, you don't need her to step off Foreign Affairs?</p><p>DEUTCH:  And that's -- and that's it.  And there is -- and there is no tolerance for this kind of language beyond that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DEUTCH:  There is no -- we can't accept it.  We just -- we can't accept it because of what it does to corrode the operation --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I totally get that.</p><p>DEUTCH:  -- the operation of the Congress.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I agree with you.  So, why not just ask her to step off of Foreign Affairs, sir?</p><p>DEUTCH:  Well, because I'm focused right now on dealing not with comments that have anything to do with Foreign Affairs.  I want it today, Maria, I want to condemn anti-Semitism.  I don't want -- I don't want to have a conversation about foreign policy.  This isn't about foreign policy today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's Foreign Affairs.  If you're -- if you're -- if you're on the Foreign Affairs Committee and you're trashing Israel, obviously, the first thing is step off of Foreign Affairs, because there's -- you obviously can't be fair.</p><p>DEUTCH:  Well, when you're -- when you're using -- when you're using anti-Semitic tropes that have done such damage to the Jewish community throughout our history, the first thing -- respectfully, the first thing is that we condemn the use of that language so that it stops.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>DEUTCH:  And when you suggest -- when you suggest, Maria, the idea that because I am a supporter of Israel, that I have some dual loyalty to Israel, that is -- that's enormously problematic, not just because it's unfair and unacceptable to suggest that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I think we're agreeing with each other.  I'm just wondering why you're not going the extra step and getting her off of Foreign Affairs, Congressman.</p><p>DEUTCH:  Well, I'm -- as I said, Maria, right now, let's do this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  OK.</p><p>DEUTCH:  Tomorrow, we'll have conversations about foreign policy and the impacts and why statements that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DEUTCH:  -- suggest that our important relationship with Israel is founded on anything other than the strong shared values that we have, are unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will watch that, Congressman, thank you.  And very quickly, Daniel, final comments from you.  What should we expect from your mother today, as she testifies in this important hearing?</p><p>LEVINSON:  I'm one of seven children.  My parents have seven kids.  They've been married for almost 45 years, and in 2 months, my sister's going to walk down the aisle.  She's the last one that my dad has a chance to walk down the aisle.  It's going to be on my parents' anniversary.</p><p>And she's going to talk about how tough this has been for the past 12 years for everyone in our family, and no family should ever have to go through what we're going through.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>LEVINSON:  It's a reminder, if you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Congressman Ted Deutch, Daniel Levinson, our prayers are with you, Daniel Levinson, we hope you have success.  Congressman, we appreciate you joining us.  Gentlemen, thank you.</p><p>DEUTCH:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>LEVINSON:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up next, HUD Secretary Ben Carson is here.  He will join us later this hour, to discuss housing in America.  You don't want to miss that, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Nintendo introducing its new virtual reality kit, Lauren Simonetti with all the details in headlines now.  Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It's pretty low tech, Maria, the new V.R. kit is for the Nintendo switch, it is part of its Labo series of do-it-yourself cardboard sets.  The main kit comes with six different accessories to build, including goggles and a camera.  It costs about 80 bucks.  It comes out next month.  But there's also a smaller version that will set you back $40.00</p><p>And take a look at this, a massive sinkhole opened up at a zoo in Louisville, Kentucky.  Officials had to close the zoo after finding the sinkhole, the size of a football field.  Fortunately, the sinkhole is in an undeveloped area, no animals were hurt, no people either.  Engineers now working to find out what caused that.</p><p>A new study finds something you might have already known, wine makes us happy, 65 percent of respondents named a glass of wine as their best little treat.  Half said they drink wine, at least, weekly.  When is the best time to indulge?  6:59 p.m., to be exact.  That was voted wine o'clock, if you will.</p><p>The pole of 2,000 respondents was done in conduction with the winemaker, Jam Cellars.  And if you really love wine, wait until you hear this, and look at this.  The Quinta da Pacheca vineyard in Portugal, you can literally sleep inside a wine barrel.  These are replicas of wine barrels made of pine.</p><p>They include all of the amenities of a regular hotel.  You even get Wi-Fi, $300 a night.  I know you're going to ask me, is the wine free?  You get a free tour of the vineyard.  I'm sure you can sip a little bit for free.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is gorgeous.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Definitely clever.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, 6:59 p.m.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Head there.  It's in Portugal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wine o'clock.  Thank you, Lauren.  Coming up, the future of home building, one company is using 3D printers to build affordable homes.  We're going to tell you how.  We will take you there.  We're taking a tour with the HUD Secretary, Ben Carson.  He's up next, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Revolutionizing home building, one company managed to do the unthinkable, build a home in less than 48 hours for just $10,000.  That's Icon, the Austin-based construction company.  It's using 3D printing to build homes.</p><p>Joining me now is Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, who will tour the Austin 3D printed house later today.  Secretary, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BEN CARSON, SECRETARY, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT:  Good to be with you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So tell us about this Icon, it sounds pretty extraordinary.</p><p>CARSON:  Well, you know, there are a lot of new technologies that are coming online.  And you know, we have an affordable housing crisis.  So what we have to do is update what we do and start thinking out of the box.  And Icon, I wanted to come down here and witness it for myself.  Obviously, I've read things about it and seen things.</p><p>But this kind of technology actually is able to print a house, believe it or not, in a short period of time, for amazingly little money.  And, you know, there are other types of technologies that are coming along in terms of building materials to make them much more resilient.</p><p>But you can see how something like this could be a tremendous advantage to us after a natural disaster, where multiple homes are destroyed.  You think about what happened last week in Alabama and the ability to now come in and produce -- these are -- they appear to be very nice homes.</p><p>You also look at the technologies and other types of buildings, accessory dwelling units, tiny homes, manufactured homes.  A lot of times when people think of manufactured homes, they think about trailers.  We've gone far beyond that.  And now, you know, manufactured housing looks better than site-built housing, and is much more resilient.</p><p>So, looking at these kinds of things, I think we have an opportunity to make a real dent in the affordable housing crisis.</p><p>PEEK:  Secretary, good morning.  The issue is price.  Do you have any sense at all?  Can you give us a clue about what the cost of something like the house that we're looking at on the screen, looks -- amounts to?</p><p>CARSON:  Well, they say they were able to produce that house for like $10,000.  But I think, you know, by the time you get through with the plumbing, all the amenities, electrical, you're still talking, you know, 140, 150, $160,000, which is considerably less than the average price of a home.</p><p>PEEK:  Sure, competitive.</p><p>CARSON:  So, yes.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes.</p><p>CARSON:  And resilient also.  You're able to build it out of materials that can resist natural disaster, because that's what we're really concentrating on now.  I will have to give credit to our Congress who actually came up after the 2017 season of unprecedented disasters --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CARSON:  -- with enough money for us to actually begin to concentrate on mitigation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, I know you're going to be stepping down soon.  We so appreciate your time this morning.  Thank you so much.</p><p>CARSON:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ben Carson there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: March 7, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 030703cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Huawei Sues U.S. Government Over Product BANFIELD: Rep.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 7th.  8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Your top stories right now, Chinese telecom giant Huawei making it official.  The company filing a lawsuit against the U.S. saying that Congress acted as judge jury and executer.</p><p>Markets are on edge this morning but well off of the lows of the morning.  Dow Industrials now down just nine points, the S&amp;P 500 is actually up, it is positive territory by a fraction.  And NASDAQ is -- right now lower by two.  A big bounce after the ECB meeting this morning where we did not see any moves in interest rates.  Another decline yesterday for the markets making it three in a row.</p><p>Take a look, Dow Industrials down 133 points yesterday.  The S&amp;P was down 18 and the NASDAQ down 70.  The European Central Bank have left interest rates unchanged this morning setting a new round of long-term loans.  ECB President Mario Draghi holding a news conference later this hour.  We will bring you all of the developments but as you see her too, we're seeing a big of a turnaround after the ECB meeting.</p><p>Markets are well off of the lows, the FT-100 is down just 15 points, the CAC quarante in Paris is actually positive by three points and the DAX Index Germany still down but down just 10 points right now.  Pretty good bounce after the ECB meeting this morning.  In Asia overnight, market mostly lower with the exception of China, Shanghai Composite was up a fraction.</p><p>The push for privacy at Facebook.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg shifting focus to private communication.  The details on this major strategy shift to world's largest social network coming up.  And Apple facing slowing iPhone sales.  We are taking a look at what the technology giant is looking to do instead with services that's become a big business for Apple.</p><p>Plus, a new twist on a Philly cheesesteak.  It is raising some eyebrows because it's salty and sweet as well.  The controversy coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman and Fox News Contributor Liz Peek.  Great to see you this morning.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  Good news from the ECB I guess.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PEEK:  Great, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll see if the ECB actually starts easing at some point because the economy in Europe is quite slow.  The other day we had Mohamed el-Erian on and he said that the Eurozone would be lucky to see growth -- GDP growth of one percent this year.</p><p>PEEK:  And that's pretty much the forecast I think and there was an expectation they were going to lower that.  I don't know if they did that or not but, yes, they need a change in regimen lower over there.  Lower taxes, deregulation, sound familiar?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what you write about in France with the 33 percent corporate rate in your op-ed today, James.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  So, instead of doing the reforms you're talking about they want to get the rest of the world to force tax rates higher, not good for growth but you wonder with Europe how long they can do this extending and pretending the very loose monetary policy.  The government of Greece this week is back in the bond market borrowing money, healthy demand, less than four percent and the European regulator said they haven't fulfilled their promises, they haven't done the privatization and either kind of reforms that you would want to see.</p><p>So, it doesn't really make sense why these highly indebted governments with zero growth economies can borrow so cheaply but they'll see how long they can --</p><p>PEEK:  Because they know if they're going to about bailed out by the ECB, that's why, right?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  But I --</p><p>PEEK:  There is back stop.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think there's a reckoning at some point if you don't --</p><p>PEEK:  Yes.  For sure.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- transition as we have done to a real economy.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Based on by the decision making.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  No.  I was just going to say this -- the -- I want to point this out, the U.S. economy is so much healthier than the rest of the world.  That's why our trade deficit hit a record last year and I will call out a lot of these publications, a lot of these media organizations the way that they're framing this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're trying to bait the President into doing something that's destructive to economic growth in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  They're framing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- what a failure and expanded, he's trying to narrow the gap.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Front page of the New York Times, U.S. trade deficit under President bulges to record failing a Trump metric.  I think that they're trying to go and poke the President into doings something rash.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I think you're reading it right.  And by the way, we'll talk more about your op-ed on tax rates in France and the U.S.'s response what Steven Mnuchin said about that.  But first our top story this hour is Huawei, it is suing the United States as President Trump signals progress with China on trade talks.  Blake Burman is covering the story, he's at the White House this morning.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to you as well.  You're right.  Huawei is now fighting back as it has sued the U.S. government in a Federal Court.  At issue here is a provision that was in the middle of the National Defense Authorization Act that was put into law at the end of last year which says that Federal agencies cannot use Huawei products.</p><p>Now Huawei is saying that that is singling out company and that they claim is unlawful.  Huawei's chief information officer though has said in the recent days that the company should be trusted and is completely separate from the Chinese government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI:  On theft of the intellectual property by the China government that's not us, the China government does not speak for us, we don't speak through the China government.  I applaud the efforts of the United States and others to try to crack down on the global theft of intellectual property which has been a disgrace over the last 15 years that we haven't done enough about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  The issue of I.P. theft as you heard him mention there is at the heart of a possible trade deal between the U.S. and China.  President Trump yesterday continued to remain more optimistic than pessimistic at the prospects of a detail.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Gong OK.  We're moving along, we're discussing that with Lindsey and Mitt.  That moving along well, we'll see what happens.  There either going to be a good deal or it's not going to be a deal but I think they're moving on very nicely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  As we've talked about, Maria, any possible deal needs to eventually be signed off by President Trump and President Xi of China, a possible meeting between those two are likely meeting between those two as it relates to a possible date.  That has not yet though confirmed up by the White House.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We've been hearing rumblings of the end of March in Mar-a-Lago, right?</p><p>BURMAN:  End of March, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see.</p><p>BURMAN:  Yes.  End of March, we'll see.  Still awaiting the official word from the folks behind me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you.  Blake Burman is at the White House this morning.  And joining me right now is House Ways and Means Committee Member, Congressman Tom Reed and House Financial Services member, Congressman Josh Gottheimer.  Good to see you, gentlemen.  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>REP. TOM REED (R), NEW YORK:  Good to see you.</p><p>REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D), NEW JERSEY:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Congressman Reed, let me kick this off with you.  Your reaction in terms of Huawei suing the U.S.?</p><p>REED:  Well, you know, obviously, they have been one of the individuals we've been looking at in regards to intellectual property theft, the unfair trade advantages that Chinese companies as well as Chinese government have taken advantage for for years.  And so I think now accountability is being imposed by this administration and that's the right thing to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, I guess -- is this somewhere where we have common ground, Congressman Gottheimer in terms of China?  You know.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER:  Definitely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Huawei says, it's -- the Congress, you and your colleagues acted as judge, jury, and executioner.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Well, I think we need to hold them accountable.  I think Tom is exactly right on this.  And, you know, we know that there has been questions of practices and a lot of our security at stake here and we have to be incredibly mindful that in wary of their intentions and hold them accountable at every step.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But I mean, how do you do that?  Right?  Isn't that the real question here?  because isn't this a culture?  I mean, they have been stealing I.P. for decades and I don't know that you change a culture so easily.  They've got a lot of money, they're acquiring companies from energy to financial, acquiring companies in Silicon Valley, they've got their Confucius centers in and around Silicon Valley to soak up more intelligence from the U.S.  How do you -- how do you turn this ship?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER:  I think -- I think we make sure that we don't put their 5G centers all over the United States.  We make sure we got great companies like Qualcomm doing that and be very careful from a national security perspective of watching our I.P. and being vigilant.  And I think the administration is holding them accountable on it.  Right, Tom?</p><p>REED:  And I would say, Maria, this is -- most Americans don't realize, we don't have a trade agreement with China per se.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>REED:  They work under an old WTO type standard.  We need enforcement mechanisms at the table negotiated that.  When you engage in these activities, this theft of our intellectual property.  There is accountability immediately and enforceable accountability in those agreements.  That's why I so appreciate President Trump sitting at the table face-to-face saying enough is enough, we're going to hold you accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The enforcement is really critical here because they've said they would do things in the past and then they didn't follow up like they said they would buy all this beef.  So you think there is a measure, Congressman Gottheimer that you can actually put in place that if things go awry, they don't keep up their promises, you can quickly and easily put the tariffs back in place?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER:  I think we have to and I think we need to use our legislative authority to do that.  And of course, the administration has to enforce it enforce all trade deals.  But I think we have to act and I agree that with Tom that we've got to find a way the mechanisms in place to make sure that we can react so they can't steal our intellectual property, all of our technology they've been doing it for a long time and it's time to put our foot down about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I agree.  I think this is such an important subject, we've been covering it a lot, so thank you for input both of you on this.  Let me move to another issue, Congressman Gottheimer because House Democrats obviously are divided over how to deal with this measure on freshman Congresswoman Ilhan Omar's comments regarding U.S. policy towards Israel, a vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, being delayed in the House as a result.</p><p>What's with all the delays here?  I mean, can't we all agree that anti-Semitism should not be in the Foreign Affairs Committee and in the Congress?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: I think there is sweeping agreement about the fact that there is no room for anti-Semitism in our country or any hate speech or Islamophobia.  You know, there's no room for that.  And in our public discourse, obviously, someone who is Jewish, the idea that you would question my -- some would question my loyalty to the United States of America because of my fact is unacceptable.</p><p>Just like it was unacceptable when they questioned President Kennedy's allegiance to our great country because he is catholic.  There's no room for that in our country and it's clearly anti-Semitic.  You know, I think there's -- there are different ways to approach this and broadly talk about a lot of rhetoric that's happened in our country which is unacceptable over many years but especially over the last couple years.</p><p>And I think we need to address that too but we can't let-- get lost that what happened here and one member of Congress said about me and my faith and others are questioning our loyalty  is unacceptable.  We want to make sure that that does not get lost, move our foot down and say no anti-semitism in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I mean, we all agree with that.  I mean, we all agree with you but how come it keeps getting delayed?  Like what's the delay?  What are we questioning?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: I think it's just a -- I think honestly it's a question of all -- there're so many issues that of course concerning when it comes hate in this country.  It's what else should we address in a resolution we bring to the floor and I think that's what really the discussion is about at this point.  I don't think anyone is questioning that the anti-Semitic comments that were made were unacceptable.</p><p>And we have to make sure that speak out against them.  I think it's the approach in how we do it.  And, you know, we're working obviously together to try to get there.  But, you know, it's unacceptable and there is no room for it as you point out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think she should step off foreign affairs?  I mean, wouldn't that cure this?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Well, I think that's certainly above my pay grade but I'll tell -- but I know what I feel about what was said and that's what I can speak to.  It's unacceptable questioning anyone's loyalty in Congress to the United States of America because of their fate.  It's unacceptable and we have to -- and we just have to make sure that people understand in this country there's no room for it in our rhetoric.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's the Nancy Pelosi's decision then, right, Congressman Reed?</p><p>REED:  Yes, it is. But Maria, I would add one thing and I so appreciate Josh leading the charge standing up for being, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Me too.</p><p>REED:  And leading that charge and taking on anti-semitism head on.  But this is also a symptom of extremism in our politics.  This is more about a political issue that I think we used to face potentially in the Republican Party after 2010 that are now seeing the Democratic Party.  You see a very strong vocal minority trying to push back on this issue and it's about internal politics more than dealing with the actual root cause.</p><p>And I encourage my colleagues on the Democratic side.  Stand with Josh, send the message, anti-semitism is not allowed.  Anybody who speaks it, anybody who believes in it needs to be about called and shouldn't be in any party, Democrat or Republican.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's nice to see you, guys, having this common ground.  Let me ask you about taxes, Congressman Reed.  The state and local tax burden for New York, 12.7 percent, that s that is the highest in the country.  New Jersey ranked number three by the way, Congressman  --</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Yes.  Not good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gottheimer.  State and local tax burden of 12.2 percent, this information according to the tax foundation, both your states dealing with an exodus of residents fleeing to lower tax states.  So, Congressman Reed, what are you going to do about it?</p><p>REED:  I'm going to keep putting pressure on our state capitol and encourage my fellow New Yorkers wake up, we need to change policies out of Albany that are going to lower taxes, business a business friendly climate to the table so that people invest across all spectrums in New York and also stand with the existing businesses and residents first before you hand out goodies to potential people that you want to entice to come to the state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, Congressman Gottheimer, same deal in New Jersey.  Do you guys have the power to actually move the needle on this?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER:  First on those jobs, I'll take them in Jersey, Tom, especially in Amazon.  We'll take them but let me, you know, be clear what I feel.  We've got to cut taxes in New Jersey, this tax hike bill that came through last year raised taxes on it.  Jersey is pointing out on those statistics because of gutting the state and local tax reduction.  We've got to reinstate it, stop double taxation, so we're working on that but frankly I'm sick and tired of these other states taking of our -- tacking of our tax dollar and Jersey and, you know, we're not getting anything back for it.</p><p>We've got a tunnel between New York and New Jersey that's crumbling.  We can't get any resources for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: We're sick and tired of it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want to solve deduction back, right?  You want that solved?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Yes.  Got to get -- got to get salt back, it's critical.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, both of you, good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: It's good to be with you, Maria.</p><p>REED:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Reed and Gottheimer there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching shares of Kroger this morning.  The stock falling on earnings.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange checking that out in the broader markets.  Gerri, good morning.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  That's right.  A double miss for Kroger on both the top line and the bottom line.  Take a look at these numbers, the stock down nearly 10 percent here.  EPS of 52 cents a share, that was the expectation, they came in at 48 cents a share.  Revenue estimate was 28.38 billion --nah ah, 28.1 billion, as you can see right here,</p><p>So a big disappointment in this -- what is really a narrow margin business, very difficult business because the margins are so narrow.  This company spending heavily on technology and delivery services to better compete with companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon.  As you remember on Friday, the stock was down mightily after Amazon announced they're going to start their own line of grocery stores in major American cities.</p><p>Now, tonight, the opposite side of the coin, Costco coming in big expectations for that company.  EPS estimates of $1.69 at stock, up marginally here.  We expect a positive earnings result and revenue should be higher as well at 35 billion.  So higher membership fees at E-commerce revenue should be higher for Costco.  I guess we'll have to wait and see but Kroger, double miss today.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thank you.  Coming up next, defending the border.  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended President Trump's emergency declaration over the border crisis.  We're going to bring you what she said.  And then, flip-flop fine.  The beautiful clinic, Cinque Terre Italian Coastline is ready to implement a no flip-flop rule for tourists.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defending the President's national emergency declaration.  Lauren Simonetti with headlines now.  Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria.  Secretary Nielsen saying that the country faces a serious and sustained crisis at the southern border in her testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  The projections are dire at the current pace we are on track to encounter close to one million illegal aliens at our southern border this year.</p><p>Our capacity is already severally restrained but these increases will overwhelm the system entirely.  This is not a manufactured crisis, this is truly an emergency.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The Senate expected to pass the measure in opposition to the national emergency declaration.  The President has vowed to veto that resolution.  Well, SoftBank's next big bet is in Latin America.  The Japanese company launching a $5 billion fund to invest in tech start-ups in the region.  SoftBank says, it will work with the Saudi backed $99-billion SoftBank vision fund to make bigger investments.</p><p>It's already shaken up the tech industry with splashy investments and start-ups including Uber and WeWork.  And finally an historic Philadelphia restaurant is putting together two of the city's famous foods, cheesecake and pound cake.  Joe's Steaks and Soda Soups is selling a hybrid sandwich of the two.  Every Tuesday this month pound cake cheese steak.  You can even top it with chocolate icing.</p><p>So it's added to the menu to celebrate Jo's Steak's 70th anniversary.  Some people are writing on Twitter.  April Fool's Day is next month but, yes, it's not getting the best rest reviews as you can imagine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  You don't have to very dessert, you just have the dinner and dessert all in one.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  That's very practicable, Maria.  Yes.  That's a good justification.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't like it.  What do you guys, think?  Dagen?  Do you eat that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm just thinking it's like a hamburger instead of a bun, you use two Krispy Kreme donuts, that's the same -- it's just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Just stick with the regular bond and mushrooms and pepperoni.  Some people call that a Carmen, it's outstanding.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>PEEK:  It all sounds like a heart attack on a plate, honestly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It does.</p><p>PEEK:  Forgive me but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Italian stuff, that a Philly too, when I used to eat meat that had the -- it's broccoli raab and the beef steak.  I remember that being quite delicious.</p><p>PEEK:  It's a different direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Coming up.  Facebook's privacy push, CEO Mark Zuckerberg's plan to go private sharing after losing users.  Details next.  And then awaiting key economic data this morning.  Initial jobless claims are out, moments from now, we will bring you the numbers and see if there's an impact on markets.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 7th.  Your top stories right now just before 8 a.m. on the East Coast.  New stimulus from the European Central Bank sparking a turnaround.  Futures as you see are higher across the board.  The ECB left rates unchanged.  In Europe the European Central Bank taking new measures to support the struggling European economy.</p><p>The ECB is launching a new round of long-term loans.  As you can see, the markets completely reversed course.  In the U.S. as well as in Europe, the FT-100 is still lower but just by nine points.  And the CAC Quarante is up 11 points, and DAX Index up 15.  Ditto for the U.S. markets as you saw a moment ago.  We are waiting on jobless claims which will be out in about 30 sections right here.</p><p>In Asia overnight, take a look at the markets.  And as you can see, it was lower across the board with the exception of China, Shanghai Composite, did squeak out a fractional gain.  iPhone sales are slowing.  There could be more problems brewing for Apple.  We're going to take a look this morning.  And the end of an era today.  General Motors closing its Lordstown, Ohio plant which has been open since 1966.</p><p>Plus, a fine over flip-flops.  Get this.  A major tourist destination in Italy focusing on footwear.  You will have to pay up.  We have the story.  But first we begin this half an hour.  It's Facebook's future.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a new plan to address privacy concerns after losing users.  Joining me now is Wedbush Securities Managing Director of Equity Research, Dan Ives.  Dan, it's good to see you.</p><p>DAN IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the -- let's talk about what you're seeing out of -- out of this company, and whether or not this is the way to move in terms of Facebook and private.</p><p>IVES:  Yes, I think we'll get to posturing, too.  I mean given what they've seen the Beltway in Brussels to some extent here, you know, they really need, from a privacy perspective, to kind of give, you know, I think directionally go in this move.  (INAUDIBLE) comes down to monetization.  The game hasn't changed Facebook in terms of how they're going to monetize this.  And I think that's what really investors are focused on.  But I think right now, they continue to face an uphill battle on the privacy side as we've seen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So they're going to offer encrypted messaging across all of it's products, some of the messages, the private conversations will be ephemeral, is the word, the operative word.  The problem is Facebook has never figured out a way how to make money, expect from revenue from advertisers.  Ninety-eight percent of its revenue comes from advertisers.  How did -- this actually hurts Facebook.  And to your point, the issue hasn't been really -- it's how Facebook treats our private information.  Just because you say our conversations are going to be private in the future, how are you going to prove to us that you're not going to be selling our data, that you're going to be combing through our conversations to get the juiciest details to then offload to advertisers for money?</p><p>IVES:  Yes.  I mean look, they're playing nice in the sandbox, but the reality is it's 98 percent revenue, and that's not going to change, that's why, you know, as they went through the congress, and they went in Brussels, they've kind of done some of those moves.  But if you'll get numbers, you've seen obviously advertising revenue hasn't really been hit.  And I think this is just a move where they need to continue to go from a privacy perspective, in that direction, especially when you look at Cook and Apple and you saw obviously the advertisement at CES, I mean they've kind of gotten the other side.  So right now, there's kind of a battle brewing among tech giants with Facebook on one side, Apple on the other.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dan, I said this privately really quickly.  I went through my preferences on my Facebook app, I don't -- I rarely use Facebook anymore.  I do use Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, and under my ad preferences, it said advertisers who uploaded a contact list with your information in it is a thousand advertisers.  And I've barely used that service in the last --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you can actually do that, you can actually go in and see how many advertisers uploaded your content.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And who there are.  And who there are.  And I had -- you have to go through though and block every single one of them, basically delete them.</p><p>PEEK:  It's almost impossible.</p><p>IVES:  Yes.</p><p>PEEK:  And what we know is from last week, revelation, I think that they're -- even if you're not on Facebook, they're taking your information somehow and selling it.  So, it seems to me that this constant parade of mea culpas from Facebook are become meaningless.  I mean they're going to have to do something to address this issue or people are going to stop using Facebook.</p><p>IVES:  And there's a lack of teeth in terms of what you're seeing from a regulatory perspective.</p><p>PEEK:  Sure.</p><p>IVES:  That's pushing back the background.  (INAUDIBLE) the stocks jumped significantly, investors now view it as background noise.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>IVES:  Versus maybe a year ago where it actually was a big overhang in stock.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't understand the business model going forward.  You're saying that they're not going to get their money from fees, from subscription fees.  It's still going to be almost entirely advertising.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said it's 98 percent.</p><p>IVES:  Yes.  I mean, look, you're going to -- you'll -- you could start to slightly to move that, but realistically right now and you look at it in the numbers, advertising (INAUDIBLE) Facebook is.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  So you -- if you're transition in a big way from people publishing stuff and large audiences being able to see it to private communications in small groups where audiences are very much restricted from seeing it.  That sounds, on its face, like much lower advertising revenue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>IVES:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Is there a reason they can charge more per thousand or per chat group?  Or how do they --</p><p>IVES:  And then --</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- sustain the revenue?</p><p>IVES:  And now --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you --and you compared it to WhatsApp.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  WhatsApp, which Facebook owns --</p><p>IVES:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- is private when they spend -- how much did they spend?  $19 billion for WhatsApp, and they haven't figured out a way how to monetize these private messaging platforms.  The plan is, and I don't mean to interrupt you, Dan, is to build payment systems and e-commerce systems within these private messaging apps and that's how they would theoretically make money off of --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do we know --</p><p>IVES:  Yes.  Driving Whats -- the -- it's really driving the WhatsApp acquisition in trying to monetize that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  But I mean why would that mean that your private conversations are not going to go to the advertisers?</p><p>IVES:  It does -- and look, and that's why right now --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It doesn't.</p><p>IVES:  I mean fundamentally, this is a paper -- it's a -- it looks good on paper, but the jury's still out in terms of --</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think it looks good on paper.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't -- yes.  I don't know if it looks good on paper either.</p><p>FREEMAN:  From a -- from a shareholder perspective.  If you're saying -- when you said these huge audiences (INAUDIBLE) now we're going to tiny audiences, that doesn't sound like an advertisement bonanza --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, like --</p><p>IVES:  And investors have seen -- and investors have seen through it.  Investors looked at this and kind of, you know, I think shrugged their shoulders in terms of what this release ultimately (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It lets -- it -- well, you have to think about it in terms of, say, the iMessage that Apple offers on its phones, which is a protected messaging service, like in iMessage, you can use your Apple Pay and send cash to people.  That's the model that Facebook is potential using within the -- offering private messaging across its platform.</p><p>IVES:  That's really the ultimate goal --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>IVES:  -- on the next step, but the first step is where you have to really get those private message and you could ultimately monetize.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It seems --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then this raises the issue though of Mark Zuckerberg because he's -- well, a phony baloney, has damaged the company's reputation and his reputation so much, does anybody believe him?  Again, it's -- this is impossible to quantify, but it raises the issue of like -- but can they build out this idea with the users trusting this guy?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think?</p><p>IVES:  Yes.  Look, I think right now, it's an average, like, uphill battle for him to prove, you know, not just to consumers but even investors, that they can do this successfully, and that's why right now then you see the stock in the penalty box.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>IVES:  And then the other side --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you still avoiding the stock?</p><p>IVES:  Look, we continue -- we would much rather own a name like, you know, a name like Microsoft, on the Clouds on large cap --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>IVES:  -- rather than Facebook here, you know, in terms of our opinion, or even Apple.  Just to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about Apple?  I mean they have their own issues, slowing iPhone sales.  Apple's app fees might be next because companies are pushing back on how much Apple is charging them.</p><p>IVES:  Look, iPhones obviously fell off the cliff in China, and it's really about to services business, 50 billion a year right now.  And, look, you saw with Netflix, Netflix pulled the ripcord going off of, you know, the App Store, and I think that's why right now for Apple, March 25th, they'll announce their video streaming service, it's about putting few (INAUDIBLE) on that content on the services side.  We ultimately think Apple is continuing to have pressure to do an acquisition on content, on original content.  And I think right now, remember that case is going to the courts, too, in terms of the App Store.</p><p>PEEK:  It seems to me one of the sort of derivative problems for the tech companies is that with all these bad publicity, Europe is feeling freer and freer to impose taxes on revenues.  I mean, you know -- and this is a small thing, but Europeans really don't like these big tech companies very well, and I think the latest thing was in fact a proposal that they're going to start to tax revenues.  I mean maybe that's what all this bad publicity leads to, not regulations on privacy because we all agree that's unenforceable possibly.  But simply a money pull.</p><p>IVES:  Yes, and, look, the four letters that no tech company wants to hear, GDPR.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well --</p><p>IVES:  And if you look at what happened in Europe --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's in place.</p><p>IVES:  And it's in place, and that's really the star, and I think that's the fear of tech companies, but when you look at Apple specifically, services is really the linchpin to the valuation, the installed base.  Right now, it's seeing more and more pressure on the services side, and I think Netflix is just the start of this.</p><p>PEEK:  Interesting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We will leave it there.  It's great to have you on the program, Dan.</p><p>IVES:  No, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Dan Ives.  Joining us there.  Coming up, high emotions at General Motors this morning, the final Chevy rolls off the line at the company's Lordstown Ohio Plant, we're taking a look at what's next for the automaker.  Then flip-flop fine, a top tourist destination in Italy, wants you to pay up if you're not wearing the right footwear, back in a minute.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Welcome back to another Tennis Channel court report.  For FOX Business, I'm Dani Klupenger.  There was plenty for the home fans to cheer for day one at Indian Wells as American women proudly flew the red, white, and blue.  Seventeen-year-old Amanda Anisimova is the youngest player in the WTA's top 100, and she cruised into the second round with a straight sets win over Serbia's Aleksandra Krunic.</p><p>Sofia Kenin continued her excellent running form with a comeback win over China's Wang Yafan.  The 20-year-old fighting her way back into the match after losing the opening set 6-1.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOFIA KENIN, TENNIS PLAYER:  In the third set, I started off good, but then things went -- didn't go so well but I was fighting and like I said, you guys are amazing and I love playing out here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KLUPENGER:  And don't forget, you can watch all the action from Indian Wells on Tennis Channel.  Our daily live coverage hits the air at 1:00 p.m. Eastern.  I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Democrats are pushing a vote to condemn Anti-Semitism, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi facing conflicts within her own party this morning.  Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in on that.  Stu, we've been talking about this a lot this morning.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Hey, look, if you can't condemn Anti-Semitism, clearly --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  -- don't be in congress.  If you can't condemn the scourge of centuries, you are a disgrace.  And furthermore, if you can't recognize and understand that there is a crisis on our border, you are wilfully blind.  And if you insist on undermining the present with constant investigations that will stretch out for the next couple of years, just looking for dirt of any kind, you're just a hater.  I'm frankly disgusted with the state of the Democrat Party, and I'm going to let everybody know on my three-hour show.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  They are a disgrace.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I'll tell you, I had two Democratic congressman on in the last 15 minutes, Stu, and it kept asking that question, why do we need, you know, why do we need a resolution to condemn this?  It's like I don't get it, you know.  And why is she still on Foreign Affairs?</p><p>VARNEY:  They can't get the wording right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't -- I don't understand.</p><p>VARNEY:  Are you kidding me?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  You can't get the wording right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's pathetic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we're going to be watching, Stu.  I know you'll have a lot more.  We will see you in about 15 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'll calm down.  I promise I'll calm down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, seriously, tell us how you really feel.</p><p>VARNEY:  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stuart Varney.  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart and his wonderful panel coming up.  First though, beyond clothes, Rent the Runway is moving into your home in a whole new way.  It's a partnership with West Elm and we've got it for you right after this, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A sad day for G.M. and the plant in Ohio, ending production.  Lauren Simonetti with the details there.  Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, Maria.  It's a sad story for the workers.  The last Chevy Cruze rolling off the assembly line at G.M.'s Lordstown Ohio Plant after more than half a century making about 16 million vehicles.  That factory is now idled, 1,700 jobs lost.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a day that I don't think anybody ever saw coming.  It's very tough.  It's hard to swallow.  It's almost surreal, like, is this really happening?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It'll night be a blow to the economy.  It'll be a blow to all the local businesses which rely on General Motors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The plant is the first of five North American factories that G.M. plans to close by next year.  Well, Rent the Runway is expanding beyond designer clothes, partnering with West Elm to allow subscribers to rent home goods, things like blankets, pillows, and quilts.  Rent the Runway's unlimited subscribers pay $159 a month to rent four outfits at a time for as long as they wish.  The home goods would count as one of the four items.  Just think millennials move around a lot, maybe they don't want to own furniture and the like.</p><p>And this, the Italian hot spot Cinque Terre is flipping its rules on tourists.  People will reportedly be fined up to $2,800 if they're caught wearing flip-flops, sandals, or pumps on hikes through those hills.  Officials say they're sick of rescuing people because they're wearing the wrong shoes.  Ooh.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I mean why would you wear high heels if you're hiking in Cinque Terre?  But anyway --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe people didn't know what they're up against.  I mean they don't --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  True.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- realize the terrain before they went out.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, you better realize now.  Otherwise, you're out 2,800 bucks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Wow.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It's a big number, right?  Italy needs money, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a lot of money, Liz.</p><p>PEEK:  Italy.  It's a growth industry.  Look, I think actually -- it's -- it is an interesting thing, when someone goes hiking in one of our national parks, they don't have a map, or they don't take with them, and then you have a search party that spends tens of thousands of dollars to find them.  There should be some accountability, right?  I mean I think this is kind of ridiculous, but, you know, I'm not totally unsympathetic that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They need to tell people beforehand.</p><p>PEEK:  -- people should be responsible.  Oh, totally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>PEEK:  I think that's right -- exactly right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, here's a revenue --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Maybe just a sign at the bottom of the trail would work.  I don't know.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just stay at the bottom of the trail.  Don't hike.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they don't read -- but they're Italian, and they don't read Italian because they're from --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- everywhere else.</p><p>FREEMAN:  All right.  Maybe English, too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, I'm proposing a $10,000 fine in New York City as a revenue raiser for all men wearing flip-flops because nobody needs to see your hairy toes.  I don't care if it's June or January.</p><p>PEEK:  That's discrimination, really, Dagen.  And so now --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I was told by my wife and kids that my sandals were ugly so I went to flip-flops even though they're not my favorite.  Now -- you're telling me that now?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now you're facing Dagen's fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you not dirty your feet walking around in flip-flops in New York City?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I don't.</p><p>PEEK:  Sneakers are good (INAUDIBLE) sneakers are good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got final thoughts from this all-star panel when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>PEEK:  Better than those.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A couple of lines from the ECB Meeting and the news conference that's happening.  As you just saw, the markets have reversed course again and are now negative.  One of the issues is that Mario Draghi put a growth outlook out there and his target is now GDP of 1.1 percent for Eurozone in 2019, that's down from 1.7 percent.  So, even though the ECB today said, you know, fresh measures to stimulate the Eurozone's faltering economy, they also talked about the weakness there in terms of the growth outlook, 1.1 percent versus 1.7 percent, turn these markets down again.  Dow Industrials lower, S&amp;P, and the NASDAQ, along with the European indices down across the board.</p><p>Meanwhile, comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin raising some questions about tax policy in Europe particularly taking a page out of France.  James Freeman wrote the op-ed this week, and you asked in your op-ed, James, is Team Trump getting along too well with France?  A bad tax idea gets a surprise U.S. endorsement.  Tell us about it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I know there's a concern obviously that this white house is not getting along so well with our traditional allies and I'm -- but I'm worried maybe the Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, is going too far to make the French feel better.  He -- I don't know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He agreed with the French policy.</p><p>FREEMAN:  He agreed that we ought to have a minimum corporate income tax.  I think maybe there will be a debate about what this ought to be, but this is a terrible idea.  You mentioned the slow growth in Europe, there is slow growth in France.  Instead of trying to become more competitive, their politicians want to try and get everybody else to raise tax levels up to where they are.  This is a play by that guy, Bruno Le Maire to tax and punish tech companies based in the United States and to go after Ireland's competitive low 12-1/2 percent corporate tax rate.  He doesn't like it because Ireland grows faster and steals business from France, he doesn't like low tax rates because the U.S. does better than France.  Why the U.S. wants to encourage them --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- participate in this effort beyond --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.  But I mean look at the rates.  I mean what is the corporate tax rate in Ireland and the corporate tax rate in France?  You write that the corporate tax rate in France was 33 percent.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Very high.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Compare that to the U.S. at 21 percent now.</p><p>FREEMAN:  This is the game-changer from this tax reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  We used to at 40 when you count the local --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- state and local.  Now we're competitive than France.</p><p>PEEK:  But France is really an outlier now because almost --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>PEEK:  -- everyone else in Europe has lowered corporate tax rates, but I mean it's sort of shocking to me that Mnuchin would advocate anything to do with the French tax scheme because it is clearly contrary to what we tried to do in this country successfully.  And --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Ireland's like 12 percent?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  12-1/2.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  12-1/2.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  Yes.  Very -- I'm just -- I'm hoping Mnuchin was confused and he wanted to make ties --</p><p>PEEK:  Lives now change.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- given that we've got these other trade disputes going on, but really, really negative signal.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, meantime, you have like Elizabeth Warren proposing the wealth taxing in the United States, unconstitutional, but she's trying to borrow from France, although it didn't work in France.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes.  They nixed it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That they had to nix it because guess what (INAUDIBLE) and they all leave because Maria keeps saying money's mobile.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And all these other nations, same thing happened with corporate tax rate.  All these other nations stepped back and go, oh, you don't want rich folks living in your country and paying taxes?  You want to confiscate their wealth?  You can come here.  Russia would be handing out passports right and left, to American if we tried to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it's important to look at the growth story here.  I mean we're just hearing this morning from Mario Draghi who cut his Eurozone growth target to 1.1 percent for 2019, down from 1.7 percent.  Part of that is the bite from taxes.</p><p>PEEK:  And this is not a one quarter phenomenon.  I mean since the recession, basically the United States has outperformed handily Europe, and it's not just -- it's also regulations.  The E.U. bureaucracy is nonpareil, there is no other group that puts regulations on industry the way they do.  So, look, they got to figure this out.  I think Macron would like to lower taxes and kind of deregulate, but this liberal's view, corporate taxes, as a painless enterprise.  They don't believe that it impacts growth, they don't believe it flows through the consumer, both things are true.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why the talking point on the left is that the tax cut plan went to the rich.</p><p>PEEK:  That's right.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's how they get there, by looking at the corporate tax rate.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Family of four got --</p><p>FREEMAN:  And the real result is more jobs for people at all income levels.</p><p>PEEK:  That's exactly right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And, of course, there was a cut at every income level, which often is overlooked.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they doubled the standard deduction.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  family of four got a tax cut of more than $4,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, guys.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Look, the, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And great piece.  Dagen McDowell, James Freeman, Liz Peek, good to see you.</p><p>PEEK:  Nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  It was a great show today.  Thank you for joining us.  Be sure to tune tomorrow, we've got the coverage of our jobs in America, special, it kicks off at 8:00 a.m. Eastern as we identify where the jobs.  We're expecting 180,000 jobs created in the month of February when we get that report tomorrow.  And the unemployment rate to move lower to 3.9 percent.  That'll do it for us today.  We'll see you again tomorrow.

Bernie Sanders are the top two recipients of 2020 campaign contributions among Americans who work at all 10 of the biggest U.S. tech companies, according to a nonpartisan watchdog organization.    Federal Election Commission data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics show a sea of blue at  Apple , Amazon , Microsoft , Alphabet , Facebook , Nvidia , PayPal , Adobe , Intel and SalesForce.com , the 10 U.S. tech companies with the highest market caps. President Donald Trump was the only Republican among the top 10 recipients of political donations at seven of the 10 companies. No Republican registered in the top tier at Adobe, Facebook and Google's parent company Alphabet.     Workers at all 10 have favored Democrats heavily with their giving, even though tech stocks and profits have soared during the Trump\u2019s presidency. One leader in Silicon Valley thinks she knows why: a guilt complex.    \u201cI think [employees] end up with a lot of money and not particularly\u2014I\u2019m now armchair psychologizing\u2014but probably feeling really guilty, or at least pretty lucky, and wanting to pay back some of that,\u201d said Misha Chellam, founder of the Council on Technology and Society. The group bills itself as a noprofit community of venture capitalists, startup CEOs, and big tech companies.    Chellam said social issues are likely more of a priority than headier issues like antitrust legislation. \u201cWe see people donating or voting against their economic self-interest all the time,\u201d he said.    Political contributions tracked by the center include money from political action committees fnuded by companies, plus donations made by employees, owners, and their immediate family members. Publicly traded companies cannot themselves contribute to candidates or party-run committees.         Poltical donors in the tech industry have long been among the most partisan , according to the center, a nonpartisan watchdog famous for its \u201cOpen Secrets\u201d website. Employees at tech companies in the U.S. have showered Democrats with nearly $23 million during the current election cycle. Republicans hauled in just $3.3 million.    Democrats\u2019 receipts from Big Tech totaled $9.2 million eight years ago, during the 2012 cycle, the last time an incumbent president stood for re-election. Republican donations that year were on par with their 2020 level, still barely one-third of what their opponents raised from top Silicon Valley brands.    Donations from the tech sector have also given a boost to Democratic candidates in tight Senate races, including Mark Kelly in Arizona and Amy McGrath in Kentucky.    The top 10 companies have donated $18.5 million to Democratic candidates at the federal level in 2019 and 2020, compared with nearly $2.6 million that went to Republicans.    Stuffing Democratic pockets with campaign cash is no guarantee it won't be openly hostile to Silicon Valley. Democrats have threatened to regulate tech giants, even as Republicans have accused them of censoring free speech online.    And while tech employees favor Democrats, company executives have cultivated relationships with the Trump White House. Apple\u2019s Tim Cook has visited 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to discuss jobs training, and Trump repaid the favor with a visit to an Apple manufacturing plant in Texas.         Cook had been alarmed by Trump's stated aim of piling new tariffs on everything China exports to the U.S. Like many of its peers, Apple might have to raise its prices if Trump raised the cost of doing transpacific business.    Microsoft worked closely with the Trump administration in its failed bid to acquire Chinese video app TikTok. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Trump in 2019.    And despite their eagerness to engage with federal officeholders and regulators 2,800 miles away, America's tech titans are barely a blip on the radar screen of U.S. political largesse.    Still, the tech industry hardly registers among the top 50 organizations making political donations in the election cycle that will culminate on Nov. 3. Only Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are on that list.    Political money emerging from two of the top four organizations, shipping company Uline Inc. and Blackstone Group, have favored Republicans. Donations to Republicans from those companies, their affiliates and their employees fell just short of $69 million as of Sept. 8.

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, April 25th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have breaking news this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joe Biden has entered the 2020 presidential race.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're talking with former DNC Chairman Donna Brazile this morning about what his candidacy means to the already crowded field of Democratic contenders this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus earnings in focus, 3M with a miss on revenue and earnings, set to shave more than 100 points off the Dow Industrials right at the opening of trading this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Southwest says that the grounding of the 737 contributed to a $200 million hit on revenue in the quarter.</p><p>We are waiting on Amazon and Starbucks and Ford, that happens after the bell tonight. We have a preview. Take a look, at 3m shares right now nine and two-thirds percent. A big hit on the heels of that miss on revenue.</p><p>Southwest Airlines is up. It's almost 3 percent on its numbers which were better than expected despite the hit from the 737.</p><p>Merger breakdown -- Deutsche Bank ending talks with Commerzbank, the merger between the two ailing banks would have created Germany's largest financial institution.</p><p>Markets this morning look like this. Futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages. Dow Industrials now down 113 points as I said, largely due to 3M. S&amp;P 500 is up, futures showing a gain there and the Nasdaq futures right now up 19 points, that's a quarter of a percent higher on Nasdaq.</p><p>Yesterday's markets were lower -- the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq finished down as you can see.</p><p>Microsoft and Disney though hit record highs. The DowIndustrials were down 59 points, the S&amp;P down 6.5 and the Nasdaq down 18 points at 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday.</p><p>European indices this morning are lower. FT 100 down 21 points, a third of a percent. The CAC in Paris down 13, quarter of a percent. Dax index in Germany lower by 17.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed story there. You have the Bank of Japan saying it's not going to ease and its' not going to cut right now. It's not going to raise either. The Nikkei average as expected from the BOJ, the Nikkei average was up one of half of 1 percent.</p><p>Shanghai getting a hit. Take a look at China. The index there down two and-a-half percent overnight. The Hang Seng and the Kospi also lower.</p><p>The Bank of Japan said that it will hold rates until -- at zero until the spring of 2020. There is concern about slowing growth in Japan and reaching the 2 percent inflation objective as well.</p><p>Resignation revelation, Magic Johnson reportedly resigned from the Lakers after accidentally being copied on an e-mail about bad job performance -- his own.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman; and PWC partner Mitch Roschelle. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: It wouldn't be the first time somebody stumbled across an e-mail that they weren't supposed to get.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We've got to be careful when you're e-mailing people and who you cc on it. Don't cc the subject.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Yes. People are very careful in my office not to copy me, because they know it would hurt my feelings.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: You're so thin-skinned.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Breaking news: Joe Biden is in. And he's going to give his first interview to \"The View\". Dagen -- what's that all about? ?</p><p>MCDOWELL: So he is going to join \"The View\" tomorrow for his first interview since announcing that he's entering the 2020 presidential race. And then Robin Roberts on Tuesday will have an interview with Joe and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden -- that.</p><p>So part of this is the relationship between -- Meghan McCain is one of the co-hosts on \"The View. And Joe Biden -- Meghan tweeted back on April 1st that Joe Biden is one of the truly decent and compassionate men in all of American politics. He helped her through her father's cancer diagnosis. Again -- Joe Biden's son, Bo, died of the same brain cancer, glioblastoma.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- through his treatment and ultimate passing. \"More than any one of my father's friends combined I wish there was more empathy from our politicians, not less.\"</p><p>That kind of led to speculation -- there was a story going around yesterday that the McCain family was going to support Joe Biden trying to unseat President Trump. Cindy McCain came out on Twitter yesterday and said \"Joe Biden is a wonderful man and dear friend of the McCain family. However, I have no intention of getting involved in presidential politics,\" said Cindy McCain.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I saw that tweet. So look, we were expecting that Joe Biden enters the race and he did so on YouTube. He launched his 2020 presidential campaign like this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time.</p><p>But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation -- who we are. And I cannot stand by and watch that happen.</p><p>The core values of this nation are standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that made America, America is at stake. That's why today I'm announcing my candidacy for president of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now over the phone is former Democratic National Committee chairman and Fox News contributor Donna Brazile. Donna -- always a pleasure to talk with you. Thanks so much for weighing in this morning.</p><p>DONNA BRAZILE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR (via telephone): Absolutely. Look, this is a big deal. Joe Biden is not only a proven leader but he is someone I think that will unify many Democrats, especially those who are center left.</p><p>I think he will bring much need assets to the field. But this is not going to be a cake walk, Maria. He has many candidates in the race already that's raising money and building up a very big grass roots operation.</p><p>So Joe Biden I think is talented and let's see if he can appeal to a younger generation of Democrats who may not be as familiar with his record.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Donna, let me ask you, what do you think he's talking about in that the video when he says we can't have Donald Trump in for eight years because he will forever alter the nation. Is he talking about the fact that Donald Trump, should he win another four years, will name more Supreme Court justices?</p><p>BRAZILE: Well, that's part of the argument. But I do believe that there's a large group of people in this country, especially in the Democratic Party, that believe that it's time for a different form of leadership.</p><p>They believe that the President is divisive, that he has not tried to unify the country. He is basically focused on his base and not really worked to improve America's standing in the world.</p><p>So Joe Biden also said -- I just saw the video for the second time -- that it's time for respected leadership on the world stage, dignified leadership at home. It is time for equal rights and equal justice.</p><p>So this is, again, a candidate who knows his way around Washington but also I believe his biggest challenge is to appeal to a different generation of Americans who may not be as familiar with his record.</p><p>FREEMAN: Donna -- hi. James Freeman here at the \"Wall Street Journal\". Wondering about the issue of climate for Biden. The premise of his candidacy it seems to me is that he can win blue collar voters in the industrial Midwest. He has called climate the biggest threat we face. But if he goes all the way to the GREEN NEW DEAL where the senators running for the Democratic nomination have gone, doesn't he alienate those blue collar voters?</p><p>BRAZILE: Well, everyone knows that, you know, the Obama-Biden administration made a big push for the Paris accord. They made a big push to make sure that we had a plan to begin the transition to renewable fuel and renewable energy.</p><p>So I don't think Joe Biden's record on climate will put him in any danger of reaching out to blue collar voters in the Midwest or in the sun belt.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Donna, good morning. Mitch Roschelle.</p><p>President Obama referred to it as a circular firing squad. How much Kevlar is Biden going to have to wear to avoid getting hit with shrapnel once the debates start.</p><p>BRAZILE: well I mean, you know, He's the front runner. As one of the frontrunners in the Democratic Party, many of the candidates will go after his record. They will also try to point out that the American people are not interested in a third Obama, Biden term. So I'm sure the vice president can handle all of the incumbents.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Donna, there was -- Maria brought this up earlier, Mike Emmanuel too at Fox News. This is Dagen McDowell, by the way. Made it clear that President Obama has said that he does not to endorse early in the primary process if at all in the primaries. What do you make of that? Seems a little bit odd.</p><p>BRAZILE: No, I think that's a great move on his part. Look, president Obama along with the former first lady has spent -- they've spent a lot of time trying to encourage young people to vote. They have embarked on a campaign to help with the reapportionment and redistricting battles ahead. I think they're going to continue to enlarge the electorate and convince a new generation of Americans to heed the call of leadership.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But I mean, the fact that it's his vice president and he's not going to be there, I mean, you've got a crowded field here, Donna. And it's interesting to note, you know, that he's coming out as a moderate but largely the entire field is progressive, radical in many cases. Is he going to be able to break through all the radicals?</p><p>BRAZILE: Well, the only thing radical within the Democratic Party or the Republican Party are those that sit on the sidelines and not get involved. These are people who --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh no, no, no. No I'm talking about Bernie Sanders. I'm talking about Bernie Sanders, Medicare for all. I'm talking about Elizabeth Warren and her wealth tax. I'm talking about AOC in the party, you know. I'm talking about the radical ideas comings out of the Democratic Party right now -- Donna.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BRAZILE: But these are ideas, I mean you are bringing forward ideas. Yes. But these are public policy ideas. Raising the minimum wage, trying to find jobs for people who are still out there looking. I mean --</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, I'm talking about the Green New Deal and the Medicare for all, Donna.</p><p>BRAZILE: Well, the cost of healthcare rising and more and more Americans spending their disposable income on healthcare, I mean, these are issues that people would like us to talk about.</p><p>I don't believe that we have all of the solutions, but you cannot allow these programs to go unaddressed. Look, go back to Joe Biden. Joe Biden has a wonderful opportunity because he is a proven leader, because he's run twice before. He has high name recognition.</p><p>Can he raise the money? Can he pull together a coalition? Can he convince a new generation of Americans that he has a vision for the future? And if he can, he will become the Democratic nominee. But it's going to be a battle.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, especially with Bernie Sanders raising all that money. Bernie Sanders has been very successful.</p><p>BRAZILE: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right now --</p><p>BRAZILE: People know Bernie. They know Bernie, they know his record, they know what he stands for. They know that he's an independent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BRAZILE: He caucuses with the Democrats. And he's the only self-identified Democratic socialist in the race. But Joe Biden brings a different type of leadership, a different message. But again, like many of the candidates of his generation, I think there's a hunger within the Democratic Party for new leadership and a new vision.</p><p>And that's one of his challenges. But he will bring tremendous assets to the race.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Donna, really quickly -- it's Dagen again. Bernie Sanders kind of got booed. When he -- he name-dropped Dr. Martin Luther King at the \"she, the people\" summit said that I marched on Washington with Dr. King and he was feeling some heat from the crowd to the point he had to kind of hold up his finger, trying to get a word in. What does that mean? What did that say?</p><p>BRAZILE: Because, you know, it's one thing to say I marched with Dr. back in 1963, 1965 -- whatever year you marched. What are you doing now? You know, it's an old song that Janet Jackson performed. What have you done for us lately. What are you doing now about criminal justice reform? What are you doing now to bring jobs and opportunities to the inner city? What are you doing now to build a new class of --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well President Trump did actually did -- the President Trump --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: President Trump did prison reform as well.</p><p>BRAZILE: Well, look, President Trump has challenge as well. But as you know, President Trump would spin it that he was down in Atlanta while Bernie was in Houston -- he was at a very important lead in on the opioid crisis. Something else that we have to address as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: For sure. Donna -- it's great to get your insights. Thanks so much.</p><p>BRAZILE: Look, forward to seeing you soon.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you too. Donna Brazile joining us there.</p><p>Joe Biden becoming one of 12 vice presidents to seek the White House throughout history. Some have been successful, others not so much.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE H.W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For seven and-a- half years I've helped the President conduct the most difficult job on earth. Ronald Reagan asked for and received my candor.</p><p>Now you must see me for what I am, the Republican candidate for president of the United States.</p><p>AL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For almost eight years now I've been the partner of a leader who moved us out of the valley of recession and into the longest period of prosperity in American history. I say to you tonight, millions of Americans will remember for a long time to come because of the job that's been done by President Bill Clinton.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was then vice presidents George H.W. Bush and Al Gore accepting their nominations for president back in 1988 and the year 2000.</p><p>One of those men, of course, was successful; the other was not. Today another vice president enters the race. Historically it might not be all easy for Joe Biden. Joining us right now is presidential historian Doug Wead. Doug -- great to see you this morning. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Hi -- Maria.</p><p>Your reaction this morning?</p><p>WEAD: Well, you know, if you're betting in Las Vegas, 14 vice presidents have become presidents of the United States. But as you said, it's very hard, only four were elected as sitting vice presidents and only one in all of history took a sabbatical like Joe Biden and then came back and won. So it's going to be brutal, I'll put it that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. What does he need to do to break through?</p><p>WEAD: Well, he's got to distinguish himself from the others and he's going to have to run in the primaries, not the general. George H.W. Bush 1985 started his campaign. I tell you -- Maria, it looked like the highway was absolutely clear all the way to the presidency. He had money, name recognition but almost didn't make it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Unbelievable. Doug -- it's great to get your insights. Thank you.</p><p>WEAD: Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Doug Wead.</p><p>Coming up -- coming up next, merger collapse, Deutsche Bank ending talks with Commerzbank. We've got the details after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We've got breaking news this morning. It's official, Joe Biden has entered the 2020 presidential race. We've got a lot more coming up throughout the morning to look at that.</p><p>But first, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank scrap merger talks.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details there -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Big news breaking this morning -- Maria. The Deutsche Bank/Commerzbank deal was expected to be announced as soon as tomorrow. \"Wall Street Journal\" though is reporting that the agreement lacked investor support and it faced stiff opposition from labor unions.</p><p>The merger between the two struggling banks would have created Germany's largest financial institution. And is no more.</p><p>Well, the measles outbreak in the U.S. surging to a 25-year high. 69 new cases reported. The CDC in just this past weeks folks, this placed the number of cases to 695 across 22 save. This is the worst tally since 1994. The highest number of outbreaks is here in New York and also in Washington state.</p><p>Well, Amazon's Alexa under fire again over privacy worries. Workers at the company can reportedly use location data to find users' home address through Alexa.</p><p>Enough incidents have been reported so far but Amazon says that quote, \"Access to internal tools is highly controlled and it's only granted to a limited number of employees who require these tools to train and improve the service for those users that like Alexa.</p><p>Amazon we should say, the big news going to report their latest earnings, that's after the bell today. Ahead of all that, in the premarket -- Maria, the stock by a little more than 1 percent. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Cheryl -- thank you so much.</p><p>James, what do you think about that?</p><p>FREEMAN: You know this measles outbreak is just -- it's tragic. It is -- people believing junk science, you've got to vaccinate. This is a disease that was eradicated years ago. Now it's back in the United States. It can be fatal and it also destroys the immune system so that kids who get it can be vulnerable to other illnesses.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's a lot of misinformation about vaccines. And that's the issue here.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. And you know, these objections, they're not really religious objections in many cases. But I think people have unfortunately -- I guess they're not believing medical authorities for some reason. They're getting bad information from celebrities who have made this kind of a campaign. You got to vaccinate.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But the problem is, this misinformation campaign by celebrities and the like has been going on for years about vaccinations.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And now you see the results of basically preaching these individuals with a little bit of name recognition, preaching magic at people and just preaching lies and now it's kind of gotten away from the entire nation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We've got to jump we've got to jump. Biden's White House bid is up next. The former vice president adding his name to the crowded Democratic field.</p><p>Plus Magic Johnson's shocking exit from the Lakers. Wait until you see what happened. Reportedly he wasp copied accidentally on an e-mail about his bad performance.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Earnings in focus this morning, Facebook reporting first quarter results, beating on both earnings per share and revenue. The company attributing the strong numbers to growth in stories, users and ads. The stock is up almost 9 percent right now.</p><p>Microsoft posted a double beat last night as well, the company moving past a trillion dollar market value. The market cap above a trillion dollars with the most recent move up, up 5 percent this morning.</p><p>This is a third of these major tech companies to hit the valuation of a trillion dollars after Apple and Amazon. Amazon releasing hits first quarter numbers later this afternoon, right after the close.</p><p>Joining us right now is Applico CEO, Alex Moazed and joining us right now. Alex -- good to see you.</p><p>ALEX MOAZED, APPLICO CEO: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. But first sort of assess the field for us in terms of these tech companies. What was your reaction to all the earnings that we saw.</p><p>MOAZED: We're really just getting started with big tech. These tech monopolies like Microsoft and Facebook, could be earnings and that's just the beginning. And I predict that Amazon is also going to beat quite aggressively.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes but we were tough on her earlier. I mean the business model of selling data to the advertising companies. I mean this breach of privacy that we see over and over again.</p><p>Is this just a state of the business model. Do you really want to own a stock if you see these kinds of pressure on the companies business model?</p><p>MOAZED: You know, the funny thing is privacy actually helps them and supports them to actually have a more dominant role if we look at what GDPR has done to Factbook and Google in the E.U.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mitch.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Are they able to grow users and do they need users to grow and do privacy concerns sort of stunt user growth?</p><p>MOAZED: Privacy concerns get this legislation going. That actually prevents the competition from Facebook and Google, from competing with them. So GDPR put all these rules and fines into place and Facebook and Google are in the best position to comply with those rules, post GDPR, Facebook and google have a more dominant share of digital advertising as a result.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: So the fundamentals of their business may not be changing but they're freezing out competition.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Until Elizabeth Warren comes along and breaks the company up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What if she breaks them up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly.</p><p>FREEMAN: And the theory is that they're kind of dominant monopolies and that there's not a market place competitor able to displace them which I think is your view as well.</p><p>MOAZED: Yes. and that's where -- that's really the vulnerability That's really the vulnerability, to your point right, is really the anti-trust regulation that these businesses are monopolies. But the question is, how do they compete with their supply and that's where they get into trouble. How are they regulating supply? How are they regulating the sellers on Amazon or the content creators on Facebook or Twitter. That's really where they're vulnerable.</p><p>FREEMAN: But you look at the history of tech. AOL was thought to dominate online consumer activity. Yahoo at one time dominating the search business. Competition tends to come out of nowhere more quickly than we expect.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Good point there.</p><p>MOAZED: There is a lot of competition amongst the big tech monopolies. They do compete quite aggressively.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not for google, they have 90 percent market share in search.</p><p>MOAZED: Google has -- yes magically somehow those numbers are under 70 percent but Google absolutely has a monopoly on search. They have a monopoly on content if you look in YouTube. And they're just getting started. There's huge growth in front of these companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're saying it's 70 percent, not 90 percent.</p><p>MOAZED: They will report under 70 percent. But if you look internationally it's always over 70 percent. It's funny how those numbers work out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. They don't want to show that it's dominant.</p><p>MOAZED: Yes. That would create some problems. But when it comes to their suppliers, that's really where this can be a problem for them, especially as we look towards, say, the elections next year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us what Applico does.</p><p>MOAZED: Applico helps these old, traditional incumbents say I need to compete against big tech, big tech has these new business models, I should build or buy this new business model because this is the inevitable future state of my industry.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: So you help an old analog business become more digital.</p><p>MOAZED: Yes, by essentially reinventing themselves. Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, they have the new business model. Why aren't the traditional companies trying to adopt the new as opposed to the new tech trying to go into the old.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Like geo tagging, you got your McDonald's app with your location on, you drive by McDonald's, it will let you know, we'll have your favorite quarter pounder with cheese and large fry ready for you, you can just hit a button, order it and pull through the drive-through and they have it ready for you. That's traditional business doing something right.</p><p>MOAZED: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, that's the golden arches in golden years I was hoping for.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not the AARP.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You want the drone delivering your food to you.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MOAZED: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- which by the way, that wing, that division of Google, got that approval in Blacksburg, Virginia to do and they're working with the community to figure out what they can delivering to people in this rural area of Virginia. It's sort overall might want.</p><p>I think that I mean that opens the door to something all together different in this country.</p><p>MOAZED: And I think we're going to see later today Amazon also beat earnings. I actually don't think they're just going to beat earnings this quarter, they're probably going to beat earnings next quarter and probably the quarter thereafter. We're really just in the beginning phase of seeing how these big tech monopolies are really getting into their strides.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's the biggest growth story within this space right now?</p><p>MOAZED: I think Amazon, you know. Just in the past year they turned on the revenues from advertising on the marketplace, but they have multiple other platform businesses coming behind that. B2B distribution is three times the size of consumer retail, it's a $6-8 trillion market. Consumer retails to a half trillion.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Is that U.S. certain level?</p><p>MOAZED: That's just in the United States, 2.5 trillion is in the U.S. consumer retail. B2B distribution is two to three times the size. And they only have $10 billion in GMB.</p><p>So, they have so many things that the core monopoly marketplace is throwing off a lot of cash for these other things that are rising fast as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you're expecting a really good quarters for that from Amazon.</p><p>MOAZED: I think Amazon is going to do very well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there. Alex, it's great to see you.</p><p>MOAZED: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Alex Moazed, joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, breaking news this morning, Joe Biden officially enters the 2020 race. We're bringing you the very latest on this entry and what it means for the field.</p><p>Plus, the latest nuclear negotiations as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet face-to-face for the first time, the details, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, April 25th.</p><p>We have breaking news this morning, Joe Biden has entered the 2020 presidential race officially. Former Trump campaign foreign policy affairs expert Walid Phares is with us. He will weigh in on that, coming up.</p><p>Earnings certainly the big focus for Wall Street. Take a look at 3M with a miss on revenue and earnings, the stock is down eight percent right now. That is set to shave about a hundred points off of the Dow Jones Industrial Average right at the open.</p><p>Southwest is surging, it had a double beat on earnings and revenue. The stock is up 2-1/3 percent on Southwest.</p><p>Tonight we are hearing from Amazon, Ford Motor and Starbucks right after the bell. Amazon could be a market mover for tech. We will be previewing that coming up.</p><p>Markets however are feeling the heat of 3M, look at the Dow Industrials right now, down 93 points. We are expecting a lower opening for the Dow as Futures will indicate because of 3M. But the other major indices are actually up. S&amp;P Futures are up almost one point and the NASDAQ Futures right now up 18 points, that's a quarter of a percent.</p><p>After yesterday's close where the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ at one point in the session hit record highs, but then retreated by the close. The Dow Industrials down 59 point, the S&amp;P 500 down 6-1/2 and the NASDAQ down 18 points at the close.</p><p>In Europe this morning the indices look like this, and it is lower across the board. FT-100 down 41 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris down 13 and the DAX Index in Germany down 15 points right now.</p><p>In Asia overnight, the -- well, the big news was the GDP in South Korea, it was weaker than expected. As you can see, the Korean Kospi Index was down one-half a percent. Japan was up about a half a percent, the Bank of Japan said that it is keeping extremely low interest rates where they are until at least the spring of 2020, pretty much expected that the BOJ wasn't going to do anything.</p><p>We've got streaming wars that viewers love watching reruns on Netflix. But some popular shows could be pulled. Which of your favorite shows could go away and not be on Netflix. We're going to tell you.</p><p>Plus, resignation revelations, check this out, Magic Johnson reportedly resigning from the Lakers after accidentally being copied on an e-mail about his bad job performance. All those stories coming up.</p><p>But first, the breaking news of the morning and that is Joe Biden made it official, entering the 2020 presidential race. Joining an already crowded Democratic field.</p><p>Joining us right now is former Trump campaign foreign policy advisor, Fox News national security and foreign affairs expert, Walid Phares. And great to see you, Walid. Thanks very much for weighing in here.</p><p>WALID PHARES, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS ANALYST: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to Joe Biden.</p><p>PHARES: Well, that was expected by most observers, that the most senior politician in the Democratic Party, the former vice president is in the best position in view of his advisors and the supporters to be the leading candidates of that field.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How significant a challenge is this to Donald Trump?</p><p>PHARES: Probably this is the best shot that the Democratic party would have, because Biden is experienced. He was for eight years in the White House and all is going to rest now with his team, who is he going to have as a teammate, who is going to be the vice presidential candidate would be the bigger question.</p><p>FREEMAN: Walid, hi, James Freeman here with the Wall Street Journal. How would a Biden foreign policy differ from the Trump foreign policy?</p><p>PHARES: Oh, it will be completely different. It will be a return to the Obama administration policies, including let's begin with Iran deal, a return to the Iran deal, a different policy with China. I am not sure what they're going to do with North Korea now that Chairman Kim is meeting with Putin. That's changing a lot of the chess game going on. So, we're going to see -- we're going to see a very clear difference between a Biden platform and a Trump platform.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Walid, good morning, Mitch Roschelle. You mentioned the China deal and I think we've talked about on the air Chinese are slow-playing the Trump administration in hopes that he doesn't win re-election and they don't have to sort of make the deal that's on the table.</p><p>How do you think China would potentially handicap a Biden administration and how could that influence potentially the remainder of the Trump first term from a negotiating with China perspective?</p><p>PHARES: Well, your angle is very interesting because it applies not only to China but to Iran and many other players who are under pressure by the Trump administration. China is the biggest actor who's under pressure -- who are under pressure to get a new deal in terms of finances, in terms of economy. And China is playing all the cards including as I said earlier, Chairman Kim now meeting with President Putin. I believe China is behind that. So that it's not dealing with this issue and now it's opening a new chapter so far that president Putin will be the one who will bring back Kim to the table of negotiations.</p><p>So I believe as you said that the next year and-a-half are going to be attempts by many international players to gain time, hoping that there will be no second presidency for President Trump but they may fail.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The meeting -- the meeting between -- it's Dagen McDowell, Walid. The meeting between Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, how is that not a black eye for the Trump administration and what's been going on with our two less than successful summits with North Korea?</p><p>PHARES: I think Chairman Kim meeting with Putin is in preparation and repositioning to speak with our president, with President Trump. That's what he's trying to do.</p><p>Chapter one failed. I mean, it all began when Kim fired those missiles, expecting that as was the case before, a Trump administration is going to go and negotiate and accept some sort of aid. It did not work.</p><p>President Trump tweeted first and then sent task forces. North Korean leaders ran to China and China told them you have to talk with the United States, and we saw what we saw. I mean, he was gratified that he has been at the high visibility. But when the time came and Trump asked him to deliver on nukes, he couldn't. So now he's going to Putin.</p><p>And Putin, it's very good for him because he's going to reposition himself to speak with President Trump after two years of -- you know, impossibilities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then there's China. The White House announcing that U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin are headed back to Beijing next week. They're going to go on the 30th to resume talks.</p><p>First, your thoughts on that. Are we going to see a deal? And what do you think Biden's policy platform will be? Will he take on China the way the president has?</p><p>PHARES: He is going in my view to be tougher on China but in reality they're going to negotiate with China from a weaker position. The Trump administration is stronger in terms of narrative but they will try to cut a deal with China and China understands that now they have two partners that they're going to be dealing with this, a sitting president and a strong candidate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, do you think Biden has articulated his strategy yet? What is it? I mean, or is it go -- I mean, is it going to be anything more than take down Trump?</p><p>PHARES: It's going to be first of all a strong primary. He's going to distinguish himself on foreign policy from everybody else. He's going to tell them, look, I have been vice-president for eight years, I know better on China, on Iran, on Russia and everything else, to win that first battle.</p><p>The second battle he's going to say, well, look, Trump has not yet given any results in terms of negotiating with China, what is the result, negotiating with Kim, what is the result, what is he doing on Iran. These would be the criticisms that will be used by vice president -- former vice president Biden against our president now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Walid, great to have your insights. Thank you so much.</p><p>PHARES: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Walid Phares, joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, Biden's White House bid. The former vice president adding his name to the crowded Democratic field. We're going to bring you the very latest on his entry into the 2020 race with analysis.</p><p>Then, Magic Johnson's shocking exit from the Lakers explained. He was reportedly copied on e-mails about his bad job performance, that story coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news, it is official this morning, Joe Biden has entered the 2020 presidential race. We have a lot more coming up on that throughout the morning. But first, Bayer facing a showdown with shareholders over Monsanto this morning. Cheryl Casone with the details there in headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, I guess some corporate wars going this morning, Maria. Bayer shares are actually rising overseas, better than expected results, giving that company a brief respite ahead of tomorrow's potentially very unruly and unpleasant shareholder meeting. Investors are growing impatient with the company's legal problems here in the United States. The German chemicals and pharmaceuticals company reported an above expected rise in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and sales, driven mostly by the integration of Monsanto which it acquired for $63 billion last year. So, expect fireworks there.</p><p>OK, Venmo gaining some popularity. More than 40 million people use the mobile payment app over the past 12 months. That is more users than top U.S. banks have on their apps like Bank of America, even Wells Fargo. Total payments on Venmo jumped by more than 70 percent to $21 billion just in the first quarter.</p><p>Now, PayPal which owns Venmo released these details as part of its quarterly earnings that came in after the bell. Premarket post earnings, PayPal is up almost two percent as you can see on your screen.</p><p>And then another stock to watch could be Netflix. They might have to say good-bye to some of their most popular shows. Wall Street Journal is reporting that as companies like Warner Media and NBC Universal are looking to start their own streaming services, they're going to want their programs back and one of them, yes, you can see it on your screen is \"Friends\", it's one of the most popular hits on Netflix, believe it or not. \"The Office\", another show, people love to stream on Netflix. Right now Netflix slightly higher in the premarket. Don't take my \"Friends\" away, Maria. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a big deal. I mean, they're paying all this money and investing so much -- you know, so many billions in original content.</p><p>CASONE: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But people want things like --</p><p>CASONE: They want \"Friends\", yes, they want the old -- the old good stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think about that?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: But now there's multiple platforms that you can stream on, the content -- we said it a million times, content is key but having forcing people to have multiple subscriptions so that they can get all of the content that they want, so you can't get some of the HBO content on this platform. You have to also subscribe to them. I think that's going to be the way the game is played. You're going to have to have multiple monthly bills to get all the content you want.</p><p>MCDOWELL: HBO now is going to have problems with \"Game of Thrones\" going away. The \"Deadwood\" movie comes out I think next month. And then after that, then what? Nothing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm not paying for that.</p><p>FREEMAN: Curb.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, curb your enthusiasm. That's really worth whatever bazillion dollars a year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's the thing, I wonder, I mean, you look at a company like Netflix, if they're going to lose some of the more important things, I mean, will you going to pay up for that? Probably you will (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I don't watch \"Friends\" reruns or even in \"The Office\" reruns. I watch --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you want the original content?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't -- yes, I don't watch \"Friends\". I really -- again, I've lived in New York City for 25 years. I know no apartment that looks like that every episode (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And no coffee shop looks like that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, exactly. And then to \"The Office\", it's all about the original office with Ricky Gervais, not the American version.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What were you going to say?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, just Netflix has been spending a lot of money to develop new content. And I think they're still not quite there. This is -- this is what it suggests to me is that they still need me to buy the rights to those Hollywood creation as opposed to their new stuff which a -- although they -- there is a good documentary if you get a chance, \"Battered Bastards Of Baseball\", it's about the actor Kurt Russell and his dad creating a minor league baseball team in the '70s. Fascinating story.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kurt Russell has been doing a lot.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, it's a -- it's really -- it's an amazing story, it's sort of an American entrepreneurial story of a guy kind of challenging the baseball establishment. It's really, really fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We've got a recommendation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And there's nobody more awesome than Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They're so wonderful. I love them both. It's true.</p><p>Coming up, Magic Johnson's shocking exit from the Lakers explained, he was reportedly copied on e-mails about his bad job performance. The story is next. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. So we've been telling you all morning an e-mail mistake may have led to Magic Johnson abruptly resigning from the Lakers. Jared Max with details now in sports. Jared, Good morning.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. According to NBA analyst, Rick Bucher of FS1, Magic Johnson's abrupt resignation as Lakers' president two weeks back may have been sparked by something that Magic read. Bucher tells FS1's Colin Cowherd that to his understanding, Magic was C.C.ed or blind C.C.ed on e-mails between the Lakers owner Jeanie Buss and Lakers G.M. Rob Pelinka, e-mails that Bucher said Pelinka was critical of the Lakers legend who did not appear to get offended by Jeanie Buss.</p><p>The question, have you been watching the NBA Playoffs?

We might need an actual investigation and a whole report to find out you know, when it all --</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, it seems like a tough business. Like most businesses if this happened it would be we're so sorry, we didn't mean it, please stay and --</p><p>MAX: And Magic I think thought that he had Jeanie Buss on his side. You know, from Jerry Buss the longtime owner.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, they have known each other for about four decades.</p><p>MAX: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Jeanie well hired her own real blood brother and hired Magic Johnson who she called her brother, that's how close they were.

So I --</p><p>MAX: Small, small, world. Small business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You have to be careful when you're e-mailing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Don't do business with your family is what I would say. Whether they're fans family by birth or family by choice.</p><p>MAX: NFL draft really fun to watch the first round.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tonight.</p><p>MAX: The truth is, most over-hyped event in sports. Tom Brady was a sixth round draft pick. And some of the best football players in history weren't even drafted. It's just to see who's going in. It's fun, period.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's funny to see how the like NFL does it versus you know, Fox or -- you know, I mean, when you look at the NFL draft on the NFL network, it just it's like exactly like the pump and circumstance that you would see in the major networks. I just think it's interesting what the NFL network is doing.</p><p>MAX: What's bigger than the NFL?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true.</p><p>MAX: Right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jared, thanks.

Elizabeth Warren, one of Biden's competitors for the Democratic nomination, has led the push for the break-up of big tech. In March she proposed that Facebook, Google and Amazon be dismantled, with the companies forced to sell off some of their major acquisitions, like Facebook's Instagram and WhatsApp. </p><p>In an interview with The Associated Press, Biden praised Warren for her push, saying that she \"has a very strong case to be made.\" But he also said it is \"premature\" to make a final judgment. </p><p>Biden's comments come the day after fellow 2020 contender Sen. Kamala Harris of California said on CNN that the United States \"should seriously take a look at\" dismantling Facebook. </p><p>Harris said Facebook \"has experienced massive growth and has prioritized its growth over the best interests of its consumers, especially on the issue of privacy.\" She said there needs to be \"serious regulation\" and \"more oversight\" of Facebook. </p><p>Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes wrote in a New York Times op-ed that the company has become a monopoly and should be forced to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp -- a position that led to Democratic presidential candidates weighing in. </p><p>Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders praised Hughes' op-ed on Twitter. </p><p>\"We are living in an era of monopolies that dominate every aspect of our lives -- including our government. It's time to take that power back,\" Sanders tweeted. </p><p>New Jersey Sen.

Biden seems confused, misinformed, or simply wrong about a lot of issues from free speech to Section 230 to copyright to video games. It's really bad. We already knew he was on an anti 230 kick when he gave a confused quote[1] on it late last year, but for the NY Times he goes even further[2]:Charlie Warzel: Sure. </p><p>Mr. Vice President, in October, your campaign sent a letter to Facebook regarding an ad that falsely claimed that you blackmailed Ukrainian officials to not investigate your son. I'm curious, did that experience, dealing with Facebook and their power, did that change the way that you see the power of tech platforms right now? No, I've never been a fan of Facebook, as you probably know. I've never been a big Zuckerberg fan. I think he's a real problem. I think \u2014\u2014 CW: Can you elaborate? No, I can. He knows better. And you know, from my perspective, I've been in the view that not only should we be worrying about the concentration of power, we should be worried about the lack of privacy and them being exempt, which you're not exempt. [The Times] can't write something you know to be false and be exempt from being sued. But he can. The idea that it's a tech company is that Section 230 should be revoked, immediately should be revoked, number one. For Zuckerberg and other platforms. CW: That's a pretty foundational laws of the modern internet. That's right. Exactly right. And it should be revoked. It should be revoked because it is not merely an internet company. It is propagating falsehoods they know to be false, and we should be setting standards not unlike the Europeans are doing relative to privacy. You guys still have editors. I'm sitting with them. Not a joke. There is no editorial impact at all on Facebook. None. None whatsoever. It's irresponsible. It's totally irresponsible.There is so much to talk about here. First of all, Biden admits upfront that the reason he thinks CDA 230 should be repealed is because of his personal dislike of Facebook's founder and CEO. It's one thing to argue that the platform creates harms and therefore we need a different regulatory approach, but to start out by saying you just don't like the guy, and use that as the basis for punishing the entire internet is... really something. Second, Biden seems to be (again) confusing the 1st Amendment with Section 230. It's not Section 230 that allows people to post false things on Facebook. It's the 1st Amendment. You know, the thing that Biden is supposed to \"protect and defend\" if he becomes President. Third, the comparison with the NY Times is completely offbase. The NY Times is also protected by Section 230 if a third party says something on its platform, they cannot be sued. And, similarly, if Facebook itself said something that violated the law, it can be sued. All 230 does is put the liability in the right place: on the actual speaker. Facebook is not \"exempt\" from any law. Biden is just wrong. Fourth, he's not even talking about reforming 230, he's talking about revoking it. That's insane and would lead to crippling litigation and vast silencing of the public. It's not even in the realm of reasonable discussion. Fifth, notice at casual he is about lumping in the rest of the internet, just because he dislikes Facebook. Take away 230 for the entire internet, even as it's what enabled free speech to really flourish on the internet. And, again, it's amazing how confused he is thinking that 230 is the issue when it's actually the 1st Amendment. Sixth, the point about \"editors\" is also completely nonsensical. Editors have nothing to do with it, unless he's saying that no one should be allowed to be posted on the internet unless it's been edited first. And just to be clear here, a lot of what Biden says in this interview is factually false. Yet, here, he's arguing that the NY Times should be liable for posting his falsehoods. And Facebook should be liable if people repost them there. And I should be liable because I'm posting his nonsense here. This is not someone who understand even the first thing about Section 230, how the internet works, or free speech online. He continued with more word salad:CW: If there's proven harm that Facebook has done, should someone like Mark Zuckerberg be submitted to criminal penalties, perhaps? He should be submitted to civil liability and his company to civil liability, just like you would be here at The New York Times. Whether he engaged in something and amounted to collusion that in fact caused harm that would in fact be equal to a criminal offense, that's a different issue. That's possible. That's possible it could happen. Zuckerberg finally took down those ads that Russia was running. All those bots about me. They're no longer being run. He was getting paid a lot of money to put them up. I learned three things. Number one, Putin doesn't want me to be president. Number two, Kim Jong-un thinks I should be beaten to death like a rabid dog and three, this president of the United States is spending millions of dollars to try to keep me from being the nominee. I wonder why.Civil liability for what? What exactly is the legal violation he's talking about? And notice, again, that he immediately resorts to a personal vendetta and stuff about Russia, ignoring that Facebook has a huge team constantly fighting and trying to take down Russian ads. Yet, Biden falsely states that Facebook was leaving them up to give Zuckerberg money. Does he not know how any of this works? Of course, then he more or less admits the reason he hates Silicon Valley is because they opposed him on SOPA/PIPA. If you don't recall, for years, Biden was one of Hollywood's biggest friends in the Senate. Even once he became VP, he convened a \"summit\" about copyright in which he only invited maximalists[3]. In the White House, he was the main voice pushing for SOPA/PIPA and apparently got quite upset when Obama eventually came out against the law. Here, he tries to rewrite history, pretending that SOPA/PIPA was just about \"protecting\" copyright and artists, when it was actually a massive tool for internet censorship -- and notice how he calls an internet exec \"a little creep.\" He goes on to display near total ignorance and direct hatred for Silicon Valley and innovation.There are places where [President Obama] and I have disagreed. About 30 percent of the time, I was able to convince him to my side of the equation. Seventy percent of the time I wasn't when we disagreed, when he laid something out. And you may recall, the criticism I got for meeting with the leaders in Silicon Valley, when I was trying to work out an agreement dealing with them protecting intellectual property for artists in the United States of America. And at one point, one of the little creeps sitting around that table, who was a multi- \u2014 close to a billionaire \u2014 who told me he was an artist because he was able to come up with games to teach you how to kill people, you know the \u2014\u2014 CW: Like video games. Yeah, video games. And I was lectured by one of the senior leaders there that by saying if I insisted on what Leahy'd put together and we were, I thought we were going to fully support, that they would blow up the network, figuratively speaking. Have everybody contact. They get out and go out and contact the switchboard, just blow it up. And then one of these righteous people said to me that, you know, 'We are the economic engine of America. We are the ones.' And fortunately I had done a little homework before I went and I said, you know, I find it fascinating. As I added up the seven outfits, everyone's there but Microsoft. I said, you have fewer people on your payroll than all the losses that General Motors just faced in the last quarter, of employees. So don't lecture me about how you've created all this employment. The point is, there's an arrogance about it, an overwhelming arrogance that we are, we are the ones. We can do what we want to do. I disagree. Every industrial revolution, every major technological breakthrough, every single one. We're in the fourth one. The hardest speech I've ever had to make in my life, I was asked to speak at the World Economic Forum, to give an answer on, to speak to the fourth industrial revolution. Will there be a middle class? It's not so clear there will be, and I've worked on it harder than any speech I've ever worked on. The fact is, in every other revolution that we've had technologically, it's taken somewhere between six years and a generation for a government to come in and level the playing field again. All of a sudden, remember the Luddites smashing the machinery in the Midlands? That was their answer when the culture was changing. Same thing with television. Same thing before that with radio. Same thing, but this is gigantic. And it's a responsibility of government to make sure it is not abused. Not abused. And so this is one of those areas where I think it's being abused. For example, the idea that he cooperates with knowing that Russia was engaged in dealing with using the internet, I mean using their platform, to try to undermine American elections. That's close to criminal.I can't even follow half of that word salad. It's nonsensical word spewing. The fact that the big tech companies don't employ so many people directly, completely misses the point that was being made: that the internet has enabled so many jobs around the world, not directly at those companies, but enabling so many people to start their own companies and businesses, and to create jobs at other companies because of the internet. Notice that Biden's world view is totally focused on how many jobs are created by single large companies. That's completely missing the point. And that final paragraph is just bizarre. He's suggesting government has to \"level the playing field\" with each new technological revolution. But he can't explain when or how they did that. When or how did they do that with the Luddites? When or how did they do that with TV? When or how did they do that with radio? What is he even talking about? At the end of this section he also insists that the internet is bad for children:Well the tech industry, look, not everyone in the tech industry is a bad guy, and I'm not suggesting that. What I'm suggesting is that some of the things that are going on are simply wrong and require government regulation. And it's happened every single time there's been a major technological breakthrough in humanities since the 1800s, and this requires it. For example, you have children? CW: No. Well, when you do and you'll watch them on the internet, it gets a little concerning. What in fact they can see and not see, and whether or not what they're seeing is true or not true. It matters. It matters. It's like \u2014 well, anyway.It's like -- well, anyway. Yeah. Look, there is false information on the internet. There is false information elsewhere. Hell, much of this interview with Biden is him spewing false information. Perhaps children shouldn't be allowed to read it. Or, perhaps, we teach our children how to be good information citizens, and teach them how to be skeptical and how to do more research. Perhaps, it's the job of parents and school teachers and other mentors to teach kids how to take in, filter, and understand information. Having politicians who don't know the first thing about the internet come in and tell them how to run things doesn't fix any of that. Indeed, it only makes the problem worse, by sweeping reality under the rug. Not that any of the candidates running for President seem particularly good on tech policy, but Biden's outright hatred for the internet, and \"creeps\" in Silicon Valley seems to have completely clouded his thinking.Permalink[4] | Comments[5] | Email This Story[6] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191112/10392843372/biden-spreads-false-info-saying-that-taking-away-section-230-will-make-facebook-liable-spreading-false-info.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191112/10392843372/biden-spreads-false-info-saying-that-taking-away-section-230-will-make-facebook-liable-spreading-false-info.shtml</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091215/0200387354.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091215/0200387354.shtml</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200117/09245943750/joe-biden-cant-tell-difference-between-1st-amendment-section-230-still-thinks-video-games-cause-violence.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200117/09245943750/joe-biden-cant-tell-difference-between-1st-amendment-section-230-still-thinks-video-games-cause-violence.shtml</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200117/09245943750/joe-biden-cant-tell-difference-between-1st-amendment-section-230-still-thinks-video-games-cause-violence.shtml#comments\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200117/09245943750/joe-biden-cant-tell-difference-between-1st-amendment-section-230-still-thinks-video-games-cause-violence.shtml#comments</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200117/09245943750/joe-biden-cant-tell-difference-between-1st-amendment-section-230-still-thinks-video-games-cause-violence.shtml?op=sharethis\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200117/09245943750/joe-biden-cant-tell-difference-between-1st-amendment-section-230-still-thinks-video-games-cause-violence.shtml?op=sharethis</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIRT102305157928439334425876100045</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIRT-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0S-15D1-F03R-N239-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2159\"/><timeReceived>6:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Techdirt</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 17, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We had Home Depot and Walmart this week as well.</p><p>HUGHES: Yes, Lowe's reported this morning, Maria, and it was phenomenal. Beating on both the top and bottom lines, revenue up 30.1 percent year- over-year. People are going home, they're fixing their homes. People are staying home, they're spending money, and we're seeing the fastest recession on record, five months Maria from the bottom to the top, and absolutely staggering amounts of liquidity injected into the global system, and record corporate debt issuance.</p><p>And the US hasn't really ever experienced money supply growth of this magnitude. But the market is running lockstep with local liquidity and other major markets really aren't keeping up. The MSCI ex USA is still off 20%, Japan hasn't seen a fresh high since 1989, and China's still down 40% from their 2007 high. So the US is really leading the pack here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean there's an op-ed in The Journal this morning called The Obama-Biden Economy Redux, talking about what Joe Biden wants to do with the economy, that the plan is best understood as Obamanomics pulled left by Bernie Sanders. He's going to raise taxes by $3 trillion to $4 trillion, $4 trillion by independent calculations.</p><p>And his spending plans run to at least $7.4 trillion in spending; this according to The Journal this morning. The 2020 Election has really not focused on a lot of the policies here. We've been watching the Democratic National Convention this week, but still no actual solutions coming out of this.</p><p>Investors meanwhile bracing for what could be an uncertain time. Keith, what's your take on markets and investing going into Election 2020?</p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD, PRINCIPAL, THE FITZ-GERALD GROUP: Well, I'm extremely cautious. You've got to be in to win all the way until election night, but a Biden effect is very real. I think it, potentially if he's elected, takes 35% right off the top if traders get skittish, looking at a shift in how people are investing.</p><p>For example, we're going very aggressively after things that President Trump has moved. Big tech is on the move, retail is on the move, consumer centric stocks are on the move, but if Biden's elected, that all shifts.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's true. I mean, we'll see what the priorities will be. They're not telling us. We haven't had one policy proposal, not one, and we are in two days--</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: That's the issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: --China's trade tensions.</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: We can't confuse having a plan with an actual plan.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: I'm sorry, you can't confuse having a plan with an actual plan. That's the frustrating part.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. But we know that part of his plans is raising taxes by $4 trillion, but he's not talking about it. He's not talking about who gets hit. You would expect that it's way more than just the top 1 or 10 percent. Then there's the China trade tensions. President Trump said yesterday he's cutting off talks entirely with China amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Jack, how does this impact markets at this point? Knowing that the markets have watched this fight get bigger and bigger between the United States and China, as China continues its bad behaviour.</p><p>MCINTYRE: Maria, it's obviously incredibly important, but as investors, we're making the assumption that politicians both Democratic and Communist are more about self preservation than ideology. Meaning that, hey, Trump wants to get re-elected. Yes, he's going to sound hawkish on China. Biden's going to sound hawkish.</p><p>But I don't think we're going to see this escalate. The trade talks, this was just sort of routine between Trade Rep Lighthizer and Vice Premier Liu He as part of phase one. I don't think this is a big deal on what we know today, so I don't think this is going to derail the rally that we're seeing in risk assets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you want to still put money to work then in this market going to the second half, then?</p><p>MCINTYRE: I like actually moving money outside the US. For the points that you just made, I mean if Biden wins, he's going to raise taxes. Capital does not like taxes. So it's going to go outside the US. We're going to see the dollar weaken and I think this is potentially a multi-year trend where we start to see maybe non-US equity markets outperform finally the US equities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have markets figured out who's going to win, and do you think that this is priced in already? Or are we going to see a real volatile situation in the second half as we get closer to the election, where markets trade down on this expectation that we are going to see higher taxes and bigger government? Keith, your thoughts on that? You think that the markets know, have a feeling about this election yet, or are we still too - yes.</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: Excellent question. I think they're beginning to get a sense. Traders I'm talking to around the world are beginning to really weigh that calculus. Before it was an assumption that Trump would win. Now there's a serious question mark. And again, money doesn't do politics, but politics definitely does money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alright, we will leave it there. We'll be watching. Keith Fitz- Gerald, Danielle Hughes, Jack McIntyre. Great to see you all. We so appreciate it. Market's up this morning about 54 points.</p><p>Quick break, and then Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar is here to talk about the convention and stimulus. Then Donald Trump Jr. will join me on the 2020 Election and mail-in voting, the debate there.</p><p>In the 8:00 a.m. hour, don't miss my exclusive with the CEO of Walmart, Doug McMillon is here, on his company's massive earnings beat. Plus Louisiana Senator John Kennedy on the China threat. Don't miss a moment.</p><p>You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Democratic National Convention in full swing. Joe Biden officially clinching the party nod for President last night. He will get the nomination officially. The nomination coming in a virtual cross country roll call. Speakers again slammed President Trump all night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STACEY ABRAMS, FOUNDER, FAIR FIGHT: Faced with a President of cowardice, Joe Biden is a man of proven courage. He will restore our moral compass by confronting our challenges, not by hiding from them or undermining our elections to keep his job.</p><p>SALLY YATES (D) FORMER ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL: From the moment President Trump took office, he's used his position to benefit himself rather than our country. He's trampled the rule of law, trying to weaponize our Justice Department to attack his enemies and protect his friends.</p><p>BILL CLINTON, 42ND U.S. PRESIDENT: You know what Donald Trump will do with four more years? Blame, bully and belittle. You know what Joe Biden will do? Build, back, better. It's Trump's us versus them America, against Joe Biden's America, where we all live and work together.</p><p>COLIN POWELL (R) FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: Joe Biden will be a President we will all be proud to salute. With Joe Biden in the White House, you will never doubt that he will stand with our friends and stand up to our adversaries. Never the other way around.</p><p>JILL BIDEN, FORMER SECOND LADY OF UNITED STATES: I know that if we entrust this nation to Joe, he will do for your family what he did for ours, bring us together and make us whole. Carry us forward in our time of need.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator Kamala Harris is set to accept the Vice Presidential nomination tonight. Joining me right now to talk more about that is Texas Congressman House Appropriations Committee Member Henry Cuellar. And Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks very much for joining us this morning.</p><p>REP. HENRY CUELLAR (D-TX): Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you Congressman about solutions and about the policy platform here, because I know that the party hates Donald Trump. I get that. For the last two nights, you've been hearing a lot of slamming of this President, but we haven't been hearing any substance in terms of the policy platform. What are the policy platforms of Joe Biden as you know it, and when do you expect we'll start hearing some of that?</p><p>CUELLAR: Certainly, once Biden speaks to the convention, he is going to talk about solutions. And look, we're just trying to lay out the foundation. What we're trying to do as Democrats is say, \"Look, it's not us versus them; it's actually - it's the United States of America.\" It's not Republicans versus Democrats; it's Americans, and we are going to be working together. As you know, Joe by himself, so many years in the Senate, he is a preacher of this institution that is, working together with Democrats and Republicans and trying to find solutions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I understand that and that all sounds great in terms of talking points, but the truth is, when you look at the proposals, the Republicans versus Democrats, it's a very different agenda. So, President Trump wants to lower taxes. He wants to cut regulation. Vice President Biden wants a tax hike that is pretty severe. He wants to raise taxes up to $4 trillion. You've got this Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendation, which includes a $2 trillion Green Deal and a lot of ideas for big government. That's the opposite of what the Trump Administration is pushing.</p><p>So, why do you think that now is the time to enact the Biden proposals, knowing that we just had a sharp contraction in the economy, almost 33%? We've got 30 million Americans out of work right now. Do you believe now the time is right to raise taxes by $4 trillion, sir?</p><p>CUELLAR: I think the time is now to work together as Democrats and Republicans, and that's what Joe Biden's going to do. Look, we know that soon we'll hear the Republican primary. There are many things in the platform that the Republicans have, Democrats have different things on platform, but the matter is, can you get some of those ideas from the platform, work out a consensus and get the job done?</p><p>There are some things in the Democrat platform that are probably not going to be done, just like there are some things on the Republican primary that are not going to be done. But, can we get together in the US Congress and work this with the President and get some things done. We want to make sure people get back to work. We want to make sure small businesses are provided the assistance, so they can grow. We want to make sure that education and healthcare are provided to Americans that need that help.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you say you want to get everybody back to work. But in fact, Democrat governors and mayors will not open schools. They do not want businesses open. Governor Cuomo a week ago, just decided that gyms can open. We're five months in here. So, do you think your colleagues really do want to get back to work before the election? Because that's not what they're saying with their actions.</p><p>CUELLAR: When you look at job growth and I know you're going to disagree with me over presidential terms. You will see that, for example, when George Bush was there and I know George Bush - when he was there, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month. Then we had the Obama-Biden administration, and we had one of the biggest slots (ph) that we have.</p><p>So again, look, it's - we are all - of course we want people to start working again, but first, you got to find the balance. Take care of this pandemic issue and get rid of it and let's find a solution to this. And then, make sure that we're open - to open up our economy in a safe way. It's a way - we need to find a way of balancing the health of the individual and the health of economy. Democrats want to have people go back to work. We want to make sure - look, I've been a small business owner before, and I know what it is to pay taxes and have overheads. We want to make sure that our businesses get back to work but, first, let's fight this pandemic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's why I really wanted to speak with you this morning, Congressman, because I know that you're a former business person and that you understand the issues that a business faces. But, if your colleagues really wanted that to happen, why did they leave Washington, a short-term stimulus deal? Where is it? Now, Speaker Pelosi is signaling that maybe Democrats are willing to compromise on a deal with Republicans, but she's still at $3 trillion.</p><p>Senate Republicans offered their own $500 billion plan, including unemployment expansion, postal service funding and liability protection for businesses, Congressman. But, when you start drilling down on where the pushback is and why they can't come up with a deal, it certainly feels like the Democrats really don't want a deal in front of the election, really don't want the economy open and back to normal ahead of the election.</p><p>They'd rather just have chaos all the time. Even on the ground in certain cities, you're not seeing Democratic mayors come out and stop the violence, put law and order back in place. Why?</p><p>CUELLAR: Look, first of all, law and order, we believe in law and order. I've got three brothers, starting off with a sheriff here. My three brothers are peace officers. I'm a big believer of law and order. But look, let's talk about the relief. Back in the middle of May, we passed our proposal, the HEROES Act, back in May, in the middle of May. We spoke with the Senate and we're still waiting for a proposal.</p><p>Finally, the last week of July, the Senate came out with a proposal. We tried to sit down, tried to find a consensus and we couldn't find a consensus. Now, there's an attack on the US Postal Service. It just doesn't stop. We want to find a consensus, but if you're going to go dancing, you need two people to go dancing. We provided the work already. In the appropriations, let me just finish with this, in the appropriations, we passed -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right. It takes two to tango. It definitely takes two to tango. Congressman, it's great to talk with you this morning. Henry Cuellar, thank you, sir.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are higher this morning. Take a look at Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading. The Dow Futures right now, up about 39 points. And NASDAQ has now turned negative, it is down five points. The S&amp;P 500 currently up 3.75. We have lost some momentum in the last hour or so in terms of futures this morning.</p><p>We are certainly looking at a big week for retail. We are waiting on the CEO of Walmart this morning. We will speak with Doug McMillon to talk about what has taken place in the retail space. We've got some great numbers this morning out of the retail space, which is interesting to see, retail doing so well, particularly on e-commerce obviously with this pandemic.</p><p>Right now, we are - Alli McCartney, your thoughts on where we are in terms of this market and what's taking place this morning? Are you seeing anything negative out there to turn markets lower?</p><p>MCCARTNEY: Maria, I don't want to be a glass half empty all the time, but we're at new highs in this. The economic reality that most people are facing is very different than the highs that the market is experiencing. Everything that has been talked about this morning, uncertainty around the election, concern over relations with China, US dollar weakening, concern about what's going on in Washington with lack of additional fiscal stimulus, to me, all of that points to volatility and all of that points to continued upside for gold.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about the Individual Investor Survey? Tell me where you see individuals today? This market has been on fire despite all the issues.</p><p>MCCARTNEY: Again, I'm glad you brought that up. We are talking about this tale of two cities, right. You have the Walmarts of the world that have done extraordinarily well, up hundreds of percent as people take their stimulus checks, spend time at home. On the other side, you don't have a lot of breadth in this market.</p><p>What that means is that these FANG+ plus stocks have been the one that have taken us up and up and up, whereas the rest of the market is sort of flat to down. That doesn't bode well for the future of the market and you see that in some of the survey data. So, there was an Investors Survey that just came out. Only 23 percent, less than a quarter of investors, expect additional upside in the next six months.</p><p>Now, if you look at history, when markets hit new highs like today, you tend to have a higher 12-month return than average. So I think again, there are plenty of ways to look at the market (ph) and be positive. There are also reasons to be cautious, stay invested, but make sure you're in the right names, get back to the cyclicals and be diversified.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alright, we will take a short break and then continue looking at markets. We've got the CEO of Walmart coming up, Doug McMillon, back in a moment.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: Well, welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, August 19th. A look at markets this morning, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures eyeing another record-breaking day. Take a look. Dow futures up 33 points, the S&amp;P futures up 2.75, the Nasdaq has turned negative. It is now down 10 points. But yesterday was another momentous day. The Nasdaq closing at all-time highs along with the S&amp;P 500 with the Nasdaq up 81 points and the S&amp;P up 7.75. The Dow was down 66 yesterday. The S&amp;P 500 scoring its fastest rebound from a bear market in history with the move back to record strength.</p><p>Meanwhile, the strength of the American consumer. Lowe's and Target nearing fresh all-time highs this morning after strong earnings released. Target reporting digital sales surged nearly 200 percent. Walmart said the same thing, up 100 percent earlier in the week.</p><p>Global markets this morning are mostly higher. In Europe it is green across the board. Take a look at European indices. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is warning that there will be no further lifting of restrictions as coronavirus cases spike. The FT 100 is up 12, the CAC quarante is up 4, and the DAX index is higher by 30.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mixed. The U.S. State Department is urging colleges and universities to divest Chinese holdings ahead of a potential delisting of those Chinese stocks. In Hong Kong a typhoon was delayed -- the typhoon happened and delayed the opening of trading, rather. Nonetheless, the markets were mixed and the Asian markets, as you see there, Hong Kong was down 0.75 percent and the Shanghai composite down 1.25 percent.</p><p>Sending packages during the busy holiday season getting more expensive now.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with those details.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Maria.</p><p>FedEx is joining UPS and the U.S. Postal Service by adding new surcharges to help maintain service during what's expected to be a very busy online shopping season. FedEx says the surcharges are primarily for larger customers. They include a $2 fee on all packages shipped the week after Thanksgiving using its smart post service, $5 on its premium express service. Want to take a look at FedEx in the pre-market, up more than 0.25 percent right now.</p><p>Well, shedding its assets. ViacomCBS reportedly in talks to sell tech news and review site cnet.com. Red Ventures is said to be the potential buyer here. That's according to \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning. The selling price, about $500 million.</p><p>Red Ventures already runs several other sites, including bankrate.com and reviews.com. ViacomCBS has been looking to consolidate since its merger last year.</p><p>Let's take a look at the stock in the pre-market, up about half a percent.</p><p>And the nation's leading CEOs getting a 14 percent pay raise last year. Chief executives at the top 350 U.S. companies by sales made an average of $21.3 million in 2019. That's according to the Economic Policy Institute. This means the average CEO made 320 times more than their typical employee, Maria.</p><p>And those are your headlines. Back over to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>Clinching the nomination. Joe Biden officially securing his party's nod in the race for the White House during night two last night of the Democratic National Convention. Current and former party leaders speaking out about the former vice president.</p><p>Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: Our party is united in offering you a very different choice, a go to work president, a down-to-earth, get the job done guy, a man with a mission to take responsibility, not shift the blame, concentrate, not distract, unite, not divide. Our choice is Joe Biden.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): With president Biden, vice president Harris and a Democratic majority, we will make healthcare affordable for all. We'll undo the vicious inequality of income and wealth that has plagued America for far too long.</p><p>JILL BIDEN, WIFE OF JOE BIDEN: We just need leadership worthy of our nation.</p><p>Leadership to reimagine what our nation will be. That's Joe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Another big moment last night was Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, using her time to endorse Bernie Sanders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): Millions of people in the United States are looking for deep, systemic solutions, including guaranteed healthcare, higher education, living wages. I hereby second the nomination of Senator Bernard Sanders.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the Trump Organization Executive Vice President and the son of President Donald Trump, Donald Trump Junior.</p><p>Don, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining me.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP JR.,, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, TRUMP ORGANIZATION: Good to be with you, Maria. How are you?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that was something that AOC endorsed Biden -- Bernie Sanders, rather. I didn't hear her talk much about Joe Biden.</p><p>But give me your take on the last two nights of the Democratic National Convention, Don.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: Man, they've been boring. Maria, I really think the Democrats have lost their step when it comes to flair and glamour ever since Harvey Weinstein went to prison. It's really sad to see what happened. I saw a lot of boring things and a lot of the Democrat dribble in the talk points.</p><p>For example, talking about unity. How about this, they don't seem that unified. If AOC is endorsing Bernie Sanders at the convention when it's clear that Joe Biden's the nominee. Try being a conservative around a group of people in Portland or one of the other major cities around this country that's burning to the ground. They're not that unified as Americans. Remember, they're only unified if you're 100 percent in lockstep with the Democrat talking points. The second you veer away from that, the second you're maybe only 99 percent there, you're no longer welcome. You are persona non grata.</p><p>So I heard a lot of nonsense the other -- the last couple nights and, frankly, couldn't watch most of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, they were all slamming President Trump and his performance, but not necessarily offering real solutions to some of the issues.</p><p>But you've got to wonder why so many Republicans have now turned to support Biden. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell was there last night among the list of GOP members supporting the vice president.</p><p>Here's what he had to say. Listen to this, Don.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COLIN POWELL, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: I support Joe Biden because beginning on day one, he will restore America's leadership and our moral authority. He'll be a president who knows that America is strongest when, as he has said, we lead both by the power of our example and the example of our power.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don, it's not just Colin Powell. He joined former Ohio Governor --</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: Well, listen, I think that Colin Powell is obviously a little bit upset because we're not in endless wars because of Donald Trump. We're not trying to get into those things.</p><p>And, by the way, the Democrats and the media do a very good job of this, of saying, oh, look at all the Republicans, you know, that are endorsing Joe Biden. The reality, what you're talking about, the Whitmans yesterday, I think these were the most rhino Republicans I've ever seen. They were basically liberals in Republican positions.</p><p>Colin Powell himself has not voted for a Republican since 2004. He voted for Clinton. He voted for Obama twice. So, you know, I know they under -- they want that marketing boost of this is some sort of great Republican leader, but all he is, is a war mongering leftist in the -- in reality.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Look, you make a -- you make an important point in terms of who we're talking about. But let's not forget Ohio -- the former Ohio governor, John Kasich, also Cindy McCain, she expressed support for Biden during the DNC, Don.</p><p>I remember during the 2016 campaign season the Republican Convention was in Ohio, Don, and John Kasich would not go. He was the governor. He was the sitting governor and he would not go to the convention back in '16, July of '16, because Donald Trump was the candidate.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: Again, I mean, they've -- they have definitely pulled out a list of the biggest rhinos in government and put them there. I mean I don't think anyone's going to say Cindy McCain is going come and support Trump. Oh, wow, look, the GOP is looking to her for influence and I don't think that the GOP is looking to any of those people as thought leaders. I mean I guess the only other person they could really roll out would be Mitt Romney to really round out the diversity of Democrats for -- or Republicans for Biden, but I don't think that's going to happen.</p><p>So, you know, I imagine that part of the show is over. The media will continue to try to boost it as though it's a real thing. But the reality is, the Republican base, conservatives, they see what Donald Trump has done. They've seen the unprecedented economic numbers that he was able to deliver. He's not a 50 year swamp creature like Joe Biden.</p><p>I mean, honestly, Maria, if Joe Biden knew how to fix anything, anything, why didn't he tell Obama? Why didn't he do it in the first half a century of his swamp career? Because he can't.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: I mean, so we get to see people like Bill Clinton, who yesterday put out a statement, literally on the same day that the photos are released of him getting a massage from one of Epstein's victims, and the Democrats still put him on the stage because they -- they get to deal with liberal reverence (ph), right? They can say and do whatever they want. No one's going to hold them accountable. No one's going to question them. They're just going to let you run with their gospel, they're going to sell it really hard. I mean the irony was yesterday, Bill Clinton put out a statement essentially talking about the sanctity of the Oval Office. I mean, Bill Clinton. This is the hypocrisy of the left. It's absolutely disgusting. And I truly believe the American people see through this nonsense at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I thought it was interesting that Sally Yates would be there talking negatively about President Trump when, in fact, there are still questions around her role in Russia-gate or the origins of the Russia investigation, given the fact that we know that there was real wrongdoing at the top of the FBI, potentially at the top of the DOJ --</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: A hundred percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And there she is saying that the president is -- is trying to manipulate the Justice Department, exactly what her colleagues did.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: You know, again, the irony and the hypocrisy of the left knows no bound. They will say and do anything. You saw that. Whether it's the Brennans, the Strzoks, the Comeys, the people who literally lied under oath to Congress. Had I lied under oath to Congress, I wouldn't be sitting here right now talking to you, Maria. But they can manipulate anything. They can massage anything. Some of their testimony, they literally made testimony that said x, then they get on TV and literally say the opposite because it was the Democrat talking point.</p><p>So they knew it was wrong, but that didn't stop them from selling it on TV for three years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: I mean you literally even see this week, they're trying to revive the Russia, Russia, Russia stuff against Donald Trump. Again, because the media has seeded their role as journalists and instead become activists for the far left, that's what you're going to get. So, again, the American people have to look at this stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: They have to see the hypocrisy. And I imagine they see through it given the nonsense that we've been watching for the last few days.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to ask you about mail-in voting. We know how President Trump feels about it. Let's go through that as New Jersey right now is sending ballots to everybody.</p><p>We are talking with Donald Trump Jr. this morning.</p><p>We'll take a short break and then we're going to come back with more on mail-in voting and, of course, day three of the DNC with President Obama waiting for his day in the sun tonight.</p><p>We're back with Don Jr. in two minutes' time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>And I am back with Donald Trump Jr. talking about a ballot battle, Don.</p><p>The Trump Campaign is now suing New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy over his vote by mail executive order. That order requires millions of garden state voters to receive vote by mail ballots for November. This comes as the postmaster general now is pausing any cost-cutting measures until after the election following backlash. You can't make such major changes when we've got 70 days before a presidential election.</p><p>Don, what do you make of what's taking place in terms of mail-in voting and the campaign's suit now against the governor of New Jersey?</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: Well, the Democrats are trying to do this across the country because they understand that's the only way they can actually win. They have a candidate that doesn't know where he is 50 percent of the time. I mean he literally cannot remember where he is. So this is the way they can do that. They see that. Whether it's Jerry Nadler, not exactly a conservative, talking about the failures of mail-in balloting in New York, you have the examples in Michigan where tens of thousands of ballots are coming back incorrect, they were put in late. You had a dead cat that received a ballot that's been dead for 12 years, since the end of the Bush administration in Atlanta.</p><p>'I mean this is the kind of insanity, the kind of plan that the Democrats want to try to manipulate this election. They're all on the record prior to Donald Trump being in office saying how disastrous this is. But it's, honestly, the only way they can win.</p><p>I know someone who got four ballots to the same address, to their house, for people who no longer live there. The roles are filled with millions and millions of people across the country who may no longer live in those things, making an opportunity ripe for election interference. For the party that's so concerned about election interference, they seem to be 100 percent fine with all of these procedures that could totally manipulate and change an election and give you the opposite result of what the American people actually want.</p><p>So what's going on is pretty sick. And, obviously, we have to fight those sort of things.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Actually, I have a friend who showed me ballots that on the -- on the outside of the ballots there's a number and it's lots of different numbers but in the middle of it is says either \"R\" or \"D.\" And she was -- she was concerned about that because if it says \"R\" or \"D\" on the outside of your ballot, then if you're a Democrat you might say, oh, this is an \"R,\" I'm just going to chuck it.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm just going to throw it away.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: A hundred percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you're right, there -- there is this potential.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: And -- and that could very well happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: And, you know, and, in fact, most of the post office probably lean a little bit left. So I, you know, that -- that happening wouldn't surprise me.</p><p>But, again, you hear about the cases all over the country, Maria.</p><p>Now, we have to make a distinction. I think we are fine -- and my father's been very clear about being fine with absentee balloting where one individual goes through a procedure, requests a ballot. This is a system that's worked very well in Florida and many other states. But it's tied to an individual with an actual form of identification to eliminate that fraud.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: And if you go through that process, we're 100 percent fine with that for those who don't necessarily want to go to the polling booth that day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: So it's not that we're trying to say you can't do any of it. You know, again, I think if you could loot in person, you can vote in person. The Democrats seem fine with the looting in person part --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: Not so much the other way because they want to be able to do it all by mail where they can manipulate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don --</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: But, again, we're 100 percent fine with absentee balloting. People go through the regular process.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: And you know that one person is getting one vote. That's the way our system is designed and we're 100 percent fine with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, real quick, you mentioned this earlier but there are new photos that were acquired by \"The Daily Mail\" showing former President Bill Clinton allegedly receiving a massage from a Jeffrey Epstein accuser, Chauntae Davies. The photos were reportedly taken during a trip Clinton took on Epstein's plane in 2003. While Davies has accused Epstein of sexual assault, she's not accusing Clinton. She's reportedly said he was a gentleman, Don.</p><p>But, yes, you're right, there are pictures of him getting a massage by her. This did -- obviously, you know, the timing right when he's the lead speaker at the DNC last night.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: Well, listen, I mean, it's not a secret. I mean this is one trip of, what, I believe it's 28 trips that he made to the island. I heard that he signed off from Secret Service protection for some of those trips. You know about all of the other things that are going on.</p><p>You know, I see the media every day. They flash the two pictures that exist of two billionaires, Jeffrey Epstein and my father, in New York City and they try to make that association. But, you know, Bill Clinton, 28 trips to Epstein island, perhaps signing off from a Secret Service detail, you know, going there, you know, that's 100 percent fine. That -- this should be the thought leader of the Democrat Party.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: And, again, they do it because they can get away with it because no one in the media will report on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: Again, I've seen more reporting about the two pictures --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don, real quick before you go --</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: The two pictures that you see of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don, real quick. We know what's --</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: They don't talk about the fact he was thrown out of our club in Florida, in Palm Beach, on suspicion of this way before anything was actually ever levied against him, way before he was guilty of anything. But whether it's George Stephanopoulos --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don --</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: Whether it's numerous --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: Numerous major Democrat donors, big names, successful people --</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got to jump. We've got to jump, but real quick before you go --</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: They were having dinner and having this guy over to their house, were going over to his house literally after he was a convicted pedophile is pretty amazing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don, we have seen --</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: And the silence is deafening.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We've seen -- we've seen --</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: And it should disgust all of us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don, I got it. I got it.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: The Trump administration is the first administration to be opening this (INAUDIBLE), who actually addressed the child sex trafficking problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: They recently funded it with millions of dollars in permanent funding to address this scourge.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: And the fact that they didn't talk about these things (ph) --</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: And all of a sudden no one has any interest in, you know, what happened over there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don, thank you.</p><p>TRUMP, JR.: It's pretty sad and it's also pretty --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We were just talking with Donald Trump, Jr.</p><p>Governor Huckabee, your reaction to that? He made a lot of important points. I was trying to jump in at the end because I wanted to pivot back to the crime in New York City where he has his operations, you no, the Trump headquarters, as well as where he lives. And I want to know if he's going to run for mayor because he's obviously been outspoken about what has happened to New York and so many of our cities, Governor.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Well, somebody needs to run for mayor of New York and understand that the people who live there have a right to live in peace and security, which they do not have right now because de Blasio is so interested in trying to appease people on the far left.</p><p>I thought Don Jr., his only problem is he just lacks the enthusiasm. If he could just sort of rev it up a little bit in the morning, because I could see that he was -- and I'm being facetious, of course.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: But, you know, I appreciate the fact that he is definitely a great spokesman for his father, no doubt.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, he was terrific.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a break. When we come back, we've got the CEO of Walmart on tap with a pretty strong retail environment right now.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020081902cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MK-S4N1-DXH2-650G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7336\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00027GQ</classCode><className>JOHNSON &amp;

That's THE STORY on this Thursday, April 25th. Tucker Carlson is up next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TAMMY BRUCE, PRESIDENT, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE: Good evening, everybody. Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. I'm Tammy Bruce filling in for Tucker this evening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joe Biden has entered the 2020 presidential race and is immediately a front-runner, but can he beat 20 radical democrats fighting to take him down? Mark Steyn, one of your favorites will be here in just a minute to talk about that, plus the hecklers who went after Bernie Sanders last night, that's also just ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, a Massachusetts judge and court officer who helped an illegal immigrant criminal escape the custody of I.C.E. have actually been indicted for obstruction of justice and several other criminal charges. Trace Gallagher joins us with more. Hi Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Tammy. Jose Medina Perez is an illegal immigrant who has been deported twice, who is wanted on drunk- driving warrants and was appearing in a Massachusetts courtroom before Judge Shelley Richmond Joseph on drug charges. If Medina Perez made bail, there was an I.C.E. agent in the courthouse hallway waiting to re-arrest him.</p><p>Now, here's the conversation picked up on courtroom audio between Judge Joseph and the defense attorney for Medina Perez. Now, they speak softly so listen close. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID JELLINEK, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: I.C.E. will pick him up if he walks out the front door.</p><p>SHELLEY RICHMOND JOSEPH, JUDGE: I.C.E. is going to get him. What if we continue ...</p><p>JELLINEK: Are we filming?</p><p>JOSEPH: Larry, can we go off the record for a moment?</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Yes, so it's unclear what was said when they turned off the audio recorder, but the defense lawyer later told the judge, Medina Perez needed to get his property downstairs which the judge allowed. That's when prosecutors say the court officer, Wesley McGregor who is also charged used his access card to slip Medina Perez out the back door.</p><p>The lead Federal investigator said quoting, \"The people of the this country deserve nothing less than to know that they're appointed and elected representatives that are working on their behalf while adhering to and enforcing the rule of law not a personal agenda.\"</p><p>Today, the judge and court officer were indicted by a grand jury and pled not guilty to obstruction of justice. As she left the courthouse, Judge Joseph lost her composure and began to cry and her attorney says the case is purely political -- Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE: All right, Trace, thank you. Boy, what a scene there. Thanks for that report. Now Howie Carr is a Boston area radio host. Hi, Howie, he joins us now. How are you doing?</p><p>HOWIE CARR, RADIO HOST: Very good, Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE: Good. Boy, what a remarkable event. We know that President Trump was elected in part because Americans were tired of not having the rule of law and seeing it in place and applied uniformly to all people and now, suddenly we have an example of where it just might have been. Give us some background. That's your state. It's pretty thrilling, isn't it?</p><p>CARR: Right. Well it is, I mean, I talked to the director of I.C.E. today, the Acting Director. He said as far as he knows, this is the first time this has happened. There are these sanctuary jurisdictions all across the country, but no judge, no politician, no sheriff or police commissioner has ever been indicted for letting these illegal aliens go and in Massachusetts as in most other areas of the country, this has gotten to be a terrible problem in the same courthouse which is just outside of Boston - - Newton District Court.</p><p>Last year, you had another judge had a had an illegal Dominican gangbanger in front of her who was accused of raping a BC college co-ed well while she was drunk and the prosecutors had asked for a high bail so that I.C.E. could grab this guy and get him deported or at least get him locked up while he faced charges. The judge cut the bail to $2,500.00 and he escaped out the back door.</p><p>They had a case south of Boston in Quincy, another rape case involving an Uber-Lyft type driver and he was let go at the courthouse and he escaped to Africa.</p><p>BRUCE: You know, Howie, I've got to say though, this is unusual in that and I think the lack of law and the lack of cooperating with Federal law enforcement kind of invites this as with that audio that we heard, there's like collusion. There was like an effort made to help facilitate the escape. It wasn't even just using the law as a state might have passed it and we can debate whether that would be constitutional or legal, but this is an actual effort to facilitate the escape by this judge and that clerk. I mean, extraordinary.</p><p>CARR: This judge, she violated all kinds of laws. You know, the courtrooms are open. If she wouldn't even let this guy who's not just a U.S. citizen, but he is an officer of the law, a sworn officer, an I.C.E. agent, she wouldn't even let him in the courtroom and then there are all these rules of the Massachusetts Trial Court that you don't turn off the tape recorder just for the very reason that they did turn off the tape recorder.</p><p>BRUCE: But look, if you're willing to do what they did, allegedly, and again, there's been an indictment, then I don't think the other smaller issues bother you either, but this seems to be I think a mentality that especially on the left and even within law enforcement as we've seen of course, even at the highest Federal levels that maybe the rules don't apply to them and the nation, I think is sent a message here very strongly that we want law and order and the rule of law to apply to everyone.</p><p>Great job out there also with all of your work, Howie, thanks for joining me tonight. Appreciate it.</p><p>CARR: Thank you, Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes, not a story that we all want to hear, but it was good to see how it is turning out.</p><p>Now, the U.S.-Mexico border has become a huge mess with literally thousands of people crossing over every day. Now, \"New York Times\" columnist Thomas Friedman says he has seen enough.</p><p>In a recent column, Friedman shocked many on the left by coming out in favor of a border wall. He said so on CNN.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: When you say though you want a high wall with a big gate ...</p><p>THOMAS FRIEDMAN, COLUMNIST, \"NEW YORK TIMES\": Yes.</p><p>BLITZER: A smart gate, but a high wall that's going to sound to a lot of folks out there that's what Donald Trump wants.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Well, I think you've got to control the border. When you have an increase of illegal apprehensions of illegal entries by 374 percent since October, obviously you've got a situation where the border security is not sufficient.</p><p>I'm for a high wall with a big gate, a compassionate, a smart gate, so we can keep immigration going.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: All righty, well, Jonathan Harris is a Democratic strategist. He joins us now. Jonathan, welcome aboard, sir.</p><p>JONATHAN HARRIS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Hi, how are you? Good to be with you.</p><p>BRUCE: Good. I know, it's like all of us are seeing pigs fly by the window, right, no matter which side you're on here. What's your take on this? I know that you don't like -- you don't agree with Mr. Friedman, exactly why?</p><p>HARRIS: Right, well the thing is I think we've all -- we've heard the numbers now. We've heard that a border wall would only curb about a third of illegal immigration because that's not where it comes from. It actually doesn't come predominantly from the southern border. It's people coming in through legal ports of entry and things like that. It would only cut about a third of illegal immigration, and I think a lot of people disagree with it on the front of number one, it's just not cost-effective to spend that much money to cut a third of illegal immigration and then also just the way that Trump promoted the wall which was essentially calling Mexicans rapists and criminals and so on and so forth.</p><p>Whether you agree with the wall or not, if you isolate just that, those remarks leave a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths and it just -- I think a lot of people who maybe even would have supported you know, some of -- a wall or extended fencing, when you hear what he says about Muslims and Mexicans, you just don't want to even be associated with it at all.</p><p>BRUCE: Here's our issue though. A lot of people don't like what the President says or even how he says it and then there's the facts of the matter and the reality.</p><p>HARRIS: Right.</p><p>BRUCE: So even taking your numbers which we can debate whether that's a case or not. In March alone, a hundred thousand illegal immigrants were apprehended, so you know, having 30,000 of those individuals stopped, why not do that? But isn't the nation's national security -- doesn't that matter especially with Al Qaeda still out there, especially with other terrorist groups with what happened in Sri Lanka? Don't we have a -- and this is not a zero-sum game. It's not just the wall. It is a comprehensive framework of border security with the wall being part of that.</p><p>HARRIS: Of course.</p><p>BRUCE: Especially when it comes to fentanyl and the drugs coming over, what would be -- what would make you happy? Just no wall? Or what would be the solution?</p><p>HARRIS: Well again, the issue for me, I think, and again for a lot of people on the left -- lawmakers, voters -- is cutting a third of illegal immigration and then asking the taxpayer to foot the bill for billions of dollars when you said to your supporters to America that Mexico is paying for this repeatedly. You've promoted the wall by calling Mexicans rapists and --</p><p>BRUCE: Well, whether -- we can argue with whether or not the President approached it properly or not, I think -- I think he did. Americans aren't going -- Americans aren't doing this and it's like -- any more than you wouldn't go to the doctor if you think there's only a 30 percent chance of a certain medicine working for you, just don't think, take it.</p><p>HARRIS: Of course.</p><p>BRUCE: But there has got to be a point where we come together as Friedman has at least went down to the border, saw what was going on and said, \"Yes, we've got to take control of this.\"</p><p>HARRIS: I'm agreeing with what you're saying sort of in principle. I'm just saying that it doesn't -- the way he sold it was vile and the facts don't support the need for it.</p><p>BRUCE: Look, so that's John, thank you. I appreciate that and that's, you know, very 2016 of you.</p><p>HARRIS: Nineteen.</p><p>BRUCE: Thank you. I'll see you next time. Two years ago -- thanks for joining us. Two years ago, the college student, Otto Warmbier was returned to the United States from North Korea. None of you will forget that. However, Otto was in a comatose state and died days later.</p><p>Now sources say that when North Korea released Warmbier, they also gave the U.S. government $2 million bill for the \"treatment\" quote-unquote that he received. According to those sources, U.S. envoy Joseph Yun signed that bill, but for at least the following year, it was never paid.</p><p>The Trump administration has insisted that it paid no ransom money for the release of Warbier or any other North Korean hostages, three more of which were also released later. Extraordinary development there.</p><p>Joe Biden, in the meantime, has entered the Democratic presidential race as we know, but is Obama's Vice President liberal enough to win in the modern Democratic Party? That is next. Plus Mayor Bill de Blasio has declared a new war on hotdogs. That's just ahead.</p><p>BRUCE: All righty, after months of waiting and speculation, Joe Biden finally entered the Democratic presidential race today. In his announcement, Biden said that giving Donald Trump eight years in the White House would permanently damage the country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are in the battles for the soul of this nation. I believe history will look back on four years of this President and all he embraces, as an aberrant moment in time, but if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation -- who we are -- and I cannot stand by and watch that happen.</p><p>That's why today, I'm announcing my candidacy for President of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: All right, well Biden leads in the polls, but commentators are already warning that his age, sex and skin color are liabilities in the modern Democratic Party.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It'll be really interesting seeing him be able to or attempt to connect with these voters who have quite frankly been paying attention to people like Kamala Harris and other younger lawmakers who are just a bit closer to the current base.</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: What makes you so confident that a 76-year- old white man that this is his moment?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Has he missed his moment? There's a Democratic base that is young and progressive and apparently somewhat desperate for an outsider. Do they want someone like a Joe Biden -- older, centrist, the consummate insider if you will?</p><p>DAVID GREGORY, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Joe Biden understands that this modern Democratic Party is going to sit back and say \"Really? We want a 76-year-old, white man?\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez isn't thrilled either.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): That does not particularly animate me right now.</p><p>I can understand why white people would be excited by that. This idea that we can go back to the good old days with Obama with Obama's Vice President and I think, you know, there's an emotional element to that, but I don't want to go back. I want to go forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Well, author and columnist, Mark Steyn joins us now. I have a feeling you have a few things to say, Mark. Welcome aboard.</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST: Hey, great to be with you, Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE: Look, this is -- it is very interesting. I mean there's -- I agree with Alexandria, no one wants to go back, but I don't think anyone wants to go back to having their two jobs delivering pizza either, because this is be a rough primary and certainly, would be an even rougher general election. What do you think is his biggest liability? Is it his skin color? Is it his age? Is it being associated with the past? What do you think they're looking at here?</p><p>STEYN: Well, I don't think it's his skin color or his age because as much as I enjoy hearing all these people beat up on a 76-year-old white man, his principal rival in the Democratic primary is a 77-year-old white man and the difference between them, I think is that Bernie is a romance for his supporters. He is a romantic figure. He is a romantic insane figure, but he is romantic.</p><p>Biden is tired and is in the awful position of being unable to run as himself because the Democrats have basically disowned 90 percent of what Joe Biden has been doing in Washington for the last 45 years. So that's a terrible problem for a guy when you have to run in an essentially dishonest way, which is why he gave this tortured and weird rationale as to why he's decided to get into the race in this video.</p><p>So Bernie has it way easier. Bernie just has to be Bernie and Biden is trying to be something other than Biden.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes, in the video, it was interesting in that he really based it in Charlottesville and it seemed as though that it was this fear that all of America had become racist and he is supposed to be the moderate and yet, that is the rhetoric of the left and the rhetoric of the left really also is kind of sexist and racist in a way, an ageist for a group that's politically correct. They seem to be moving into an arena that they used to condemn people for.</p><p>STEYN: Well it is very interesting that old people are the last people you can beat up on and I think that's to do with the fact that Democratic ideology essentially now is living in a kind of hyper-present tense.</p><p>BRUCE: Right, good point.</p><p>STEYN: So that anything that happened before the day before yesterday is entirely irrelevant so that means the people who exemplify it, that is -- you know, candidates who are older than 12 years old can be beaten up on the grounds of their age. But Biden doesn't even do the old thing well, because you say what you like about Russian collusion, but the basic premise of the Russian collusion fever was that Trump was some kind of deep sleeper or not so deep sleeper for Vladimir Putin. That doesn't indict all Trump supporters.</p><p>This weird thing that Trump somehow is leading to this resurgence of white supremacism necessarily indicts not just Trump, but half the population of the country, too.</p><p>BRUCE: Well that's it and it's difficult to have to fit into that now, and the other older white man, Bernie Sanders last night attended an event called She, The People. A woman in the crowd asked Sanders what he would do to fight against so-called white nationalism. When he evaded giving an answer, Mark, he began to get heckled. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let me just follow up, Senator. The core of the question is about, as President what would you do with the rise of white supremacist violence to protect our communities?</p><p>(Cheering and Applause)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Absolutely. You know as somebody who I know I date myself a little bit here, but I actually was at the march on Washington with Dr. King back in 1963 and --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Boy, he got booed for mentioning that. What's going on there, Mark?</p><p>STEYN: Well, I think Bernie, in fairness to him, well I'll say one thing by the way, he looks fabulous there. He doesn't look 77. He looks like 83, 97 maybe but you can tell he's actually serious about running for President because he lives just across the Connecticut River from me in Vermont and he looks more quaffed and groomed than I've ever seen him. So he is serious this time.</p><p>BRUCE: He is. He is serious and I think he's ready to take it -- to take it on, but this is just one, I think, one kind of taste of what everyone can expect in this Democratic primary season, Mark. Thank you so much. Appreciate you coming on tonight.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tammy. Great being with you.</p><p>BRUCE: Great being with you, too, dear. Well, identity politics is consuming the Democratic Party. Now, even presidential candidates are apologizing for their sex and skin color. Many of the men running are already pledging to pick a woman for Vice President if they get the nomination.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I will have a woman running mate to me. It's really clear that we do that.</p><p>BETO O'ROURKE (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It would be very difficult not to select a woman with so many extraordinary women who are running right now.</p><p>SANDERS: I think we would look for somebody who is maybe not of the same gender that I am.</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've pledged that I would ask a woman to serve as Vice President.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: All, righty. Well, Rochelle Ritchie as a former Press Secretary for the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee as she joins us now, a friend of mine, too. Welcome back. Nice to see you, dear.</p><p>ROCHELLE RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY FOR THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC POLICY AND COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE: Yes, I'm so happy to see you.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes, now I think we agree on a lot of situations here, but you could even hear the -- I guess, the discomfort of Bernie Sanders. He couldn't even say woman. I don't know why not, but do you think there's a problem with focusing on just the kind of the bean-counting if you will of gender as opposed to getting the right person for that job?</p><p>RITCHIE: Well, let me be the first to say I certainly believe that we should pick the most qualified person to hold that position as Vice President, however I always find it very interesting that we seem to, when we talk about identity politics, Tammy, we always seem to focus on marginalized groups of people, right? We always focus on African-Americans or women.</p><p>But it's weird because that same notion should also apply -- this identity politics notion -- should also apply to Republicans who may appeal to more white male dominated audiences. So is white or Caucasian a race? Isn't male a gender? So I'm not really sure why it's only when someone is speaking to issues to people that look like me that all of a sudden it becomes identity politics.</p><p>BRUCE: But I think it comes up in the specificity of what's being discussed pointedly for that reason like in that clip from where he was being heckled about you know, how are black women going to be represented? What are you -- or in the case of the question about the Vice President, are you going to elect a woman? It's a difference between that and policies that appeal across the board or to let's say blue-collar workers in the Midwest who might be primarily male or have a different point of view in that.</p><p>It's a difference between deliberately appealing to a group of individuals for the sake of doing that versus having policies that happen to appeal to a particular constituency in the country.</p><p>But I would also say, I don't know if you noticed this why would the men then -- somebody like Beto O'Rourke presuming that the women running are running to be his Vice President?</p><p>RITCHIE: And that's the other thing.</p><p>BRUCE: It's like what's that about?</p><p>RITCHIE: There is this assumption that the woman running is fine with -- I mean, yes, women running for President and you think that these women are interested in being Vice President? I don't think so, and Stacey Abrams I think it was on \"The View\" where she actually said this, that you know, if I were to run, I have intentions of running as President, not as Vice President.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes.</p><p>RITCHIE: But I think that we have to sort of understand that, you know, picking a female candidate to run as VP is not necessarily -- it may appear to be a winning strategy, but it's not always a winning strategy and I think we saw that with what happened with John McCain and Sarah Palin. You know, he sort of thought maybe he could pull some of those Hillary Clinton supporters after Barack Obama got the nomination from the DNC.</p><p>He thought, \"Oh, I can pull those women.\" But it's about if you're going to do -- have a woman, don't say, \"I'm going to select a woman,\" say, \"I'm going to select the most qualified one,\" and that way, you're looking at her qualifications as opposed to her gender.</p><p>BRUCE: And there's enough talent -- yes. There is enough talent to where you could do that without even making a statement about it, because it was the right thing to do.</p><p>RITCHIE: And there is plenty of qualified women running for President right now.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes, exactly. Great job. Thank you. Nice seeing you.</p><p>RITCHIE: Nice seeing you. Great job to you, too.</p><p>BRUCE: No doubt, we'll be talking about this for -- which is good -- for a long time to come.</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes, we will.</p><p>BRUCE: All right Facebook spies on you. Amazon spies on you, but is your car spying on you as well? That is next. Plus prosecutor Kim Foxx let Jussie Smollett go unpunished. Now a judge is asking why she won't give the same leniency to people who aren't friends with Michelle Obama. That's next.</p><p>BRUCE: Big tech is spying on you almost all the time. Facebook says it expects to be fined up to $5 billion for spying, I guess, they shrug. And now they're facing a new investigation in New York for collecting users e- mail address books, your entire book.</p><p>Tech giants aren't just monitoring your computer though, they're also in your living room and even in your car. Fox News Headlines 24/7 anchor, Brett Larson has more.</p><p>BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 ANCHOR: Hey, Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE: Hey, Brett.</p><p>LARSON: Yes, this a bit of a frightening find that we -- as we continue to uncover these things of what technology knows about us from the products we buy to the things we search for to just how often you change the oil in your car.</p><p>The average person is creating a binary breadcrumb trail that links together virtually everything we do and big companies are making a fortune off of it and it's not just big tech either.</p><p>Car manufacturers in Detroit are buying and selling your personal information like your location and your driving habits. Industry insiders think data from your cars could be worth as much as $750 billion by 2030. So who is making the money? Consumer Rights groups, car manufacturers, even the folks who fix your car are all fighting over who owns your private information.</p><p>California state government is trying to combat the data collection. They're actually considering a law that would give consumers the right to obtain data collected on them, ask for it to be deleted and block companies from selling your personal information.</p><p>Opponents of the law say some of the data collected like where you've been and where you are will make it more difficult for emergency services to find you, but your car isn't the only thing tracking your every move.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You must have gotten our membership back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I guess, I did. The bigwigs promoted me to manager. I've been training new employees. We know this stuff arrived.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It just came a few hours ago. Oh, Steven, you did it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARSON: Okay, it turns out that South Park clip is real. Amazon.com has a team of employees who listen to owners who talk to their Alexa smart device. Amazon says the humans are necessary to help the artificial intelligence understand this. This is how it starts, but some reports suggest that Amazon employees who listen in can see your location and at one point, had access to your phone number.</p><p>Silicon Valley is fighting against laws that would protect consumer privacy. A lobbying group actually representing companies like Google and Facebook and Amazon came out swinging against a bill in Illinois that would actually have stopped companies from recording private conversations unless you agree to it in a written policy, but it's not clear that fines and regulations will work on the larger-than-life tech companies.</p><p>Facebook, as we've discussed already prepared to handover billions of dollars' worth of fines admitting they set aside $3 billion for a settlement last quarter, a move that actually sent their stock soaring today on Wall Street. That was in their financial disclosure yesterday.</p><p>BRUCE: Extraordinary.</p><p>LARSON: They are setting aside this money for legal fees and fines because when you're making $15 billion in profit, $3 billion dollars, that's a fifth of your profit.</p><p>BRUCE: And a major part of that profit is going to be the selling of this data, so it becomes this vicious circle.</p><p>LARSON: Right.</p><p>BRUCE: So they're paying with your money effectively that they're using your data for to be able to continue on to do this.</p><p>LARSON: To continue selling, and there's been a lot of people saying, \"Well, why don't they just make a version of Facebook where you pay $8.00 a year for it,\" because that's what your data -- well, Facebook is not going to agree to that. They make more money.</p><p>BRUCE: I just love that they say they have to do this in order to keep you safe. So that they'll be able to have people to save you.</p><p>LARSON: Yes.</p><p>BRUCE: Yeah, right. All right, Thank you, Brett. Great job. Well the cast of the TV show \"Empire\" have released a joint letter demanding that actor Jussie Smollett return to the show \"Empire.\" The letter claims that Smollett is quote, \"honest and filled with integrity,\" end quote -- and says he is innocent of all claims against him.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Chicago a woman charged with making a false police report is accusing State's Attorney Kim Foxx on a double standard. Judge Mark Martin agreed demanding that prosecutors tell him why they were prosecuting her, but not Smollett.</p><p>Robby Soave is an editor at \"Reason\" and the author of \"Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump.\" He joins us. Welcome aboard, dear. Nice to see you.</p><p>ROBBY SOAVE, EDITOR, REASON: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes, fascinating situation here because the judge in this from what I can tell was also equally perplexed at the fact that she seemed to be taking a very different position with this young woman versus what she took with Mr. Smollett.</p><p>SOAVE: Yes, the judge raises an excellent point, and said explicitly, you know what's different with this person who filed a false -- allegedly filed a false report. Is it that they're not a rich, well-connected famous celebrity who has politically involved friends or associates or acquaintances? Is that why this person is being brought to justice at all cost where Jussie was just allowed to walk through without even pleading guilty? You know, that's what Kim Foxx did wrong in that case. She just said no, I don't want to move forward with this case, even though the evidence is good and I would convict him, I just don't feel like doing it.</p><p>Why? I think a lot of people were baffled by that. They wanted some sense of closure in the Smollett case that frankly we are unlikely to get now because of what the prosecutor did.</p><p>BRUCE: And also, as we've just now seen, what it does to other cases that should be perhaps adjudicated and handled in a certain way and now, at the same time, there's a County Inspector General who is also very curious about that decision-making process with her and you know, various lawsuits as well.</p><p>So eventually we may find out what the reasoning was, but in the meantime, good for that judge. Robby, thanks for joining us tonight. Appreciate it.</p><p>SOAVE: My pleasure.</p><p>BRUCE: All righty, well Tucker is back after the break. Lauren Blanchard is going for a \"Final Exam\" record. Can she join Shannon Bream in the Hall of Fame? That is next. Plus Bill de Blasio has declared war on New York's iconic hotdogs. That's just ahead.</p><p>BRUCE: All righty, Tucker is back for our next segment. Lauren Blanchard just made her bid to join the \"Final Exam\" Hall of Fame. Here's what happened.</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: It's time now for \"Final Exam\" where the news professionals compete with one another for a chance to be crowned the news knowledge champion.</p><p>For 10 straight weeks, Fox correspondent Lauren Blanchard has faced 10 separate opponents. She has crushed them all. They've all been buried by Blanchard. Tonight, she's aiming to break the standing all-time win record set by Shannon Bream by winning her 11th match in a row. If she does, she'll join Bream on our Hall of Fame wall.</p><p>Her opponent in this eleventh and final match is \"Roll Call\" reporter, Kathryn Lyons. We brought in just for tonight's showdown.</p><p>KATHRYN LYONS, REPORTER, ROLL CALL: I'd like to extend my congratulations.</p><p>LAUREN BLANCHARD, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: There's so much pressure on me.</p><p>CARLSON: I know, it is making me tense. Let's just jump right in this. You both know the rules. I'm going to repeat them as we always do. Hands on buzzers. I ask the questions. The first one to buzz in gets to answer. You have to wait until I finish asking the question before answering it. You can answer once I acknowledge you by saying your name. Every correct answer gives you a point. Every incorrect answered detracts a point from your total. Best of five wins. Are you ready?</p><p>LYONS: Not unless this is coming from the fourth hour of \"The Today Show.\"</p><p>CARLSON: You are. Okay.</p><p>BLANCHARD: All right, let's do this.</p><p>CARLSON: All right, question one, and by the way, it may be coming from just there. Multiple choice, the first question: The President and First Lady just held the White House's biggest social event of the year. That of course is the White House Easter Egg Roll. Thirty thousand kids and adults turned up throughout the day. The question tonight, when was that event, the Easter Egg Roll first held? Was it A. 1878? B. 1787? Or C. 1692? Lauren Blanchard.</p><p>BLANCHARD: It was 1878. It was the 141st.</p><p>CARLSON: It wasn't 1692?</p><p>BLANCHARD: No, it was not.</p><p>CARLSON: Who put that in there? Okay, is Lauren correct?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn of the White House, First Lady Melania Trump hosting the annual event for children. It's a White House tradition dating back to 1878, and President Trump will blow the whistle to start the first race about ten minutes from now.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Happy Easter. Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LYONS: I pushed it at the same time.</p><p>CARLSON: So our producers just reminded me. Alex McCaskill, our senior producer who writes this says, 1692 was the Salem witch hunts. So that's why -- if that sounded familiar. It's the art of -- okay, question two. American musician, Gavin DeGraw recently sang the National Anthem at a Stanley Cup playoff game. Something embarrassing happened to him as soon as he was done singing, what happened? Lauren.</p><p>LYONS: Oh, geez.</p><p>BLANCHARD: He slipped on the ice when he was done. He like stepped off the carpet and foop.</p><p>CARLSON: And foop, did he -- roll tape please.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYS)</p><p>LYONS: He was standing there, he stepped back and just missed the carpet. He slipped.</p><p>CARLSON: Our judges are saying, your description went foop is correct. That's in fact exactly what he just did. Okay, question three. This once more a multiple-choice question. Queen Elizabeth, the Queen of England had her birthday just the other day, how old is she now? Is she A. 93? B. 94? C. 95? Kathryn Lyons?</p><p>LYONS: She's B. 94.</p><p>CARLSON: You think she's 94 years old.</p><p>LYONS: Yes, 94 years young.</p><p>CARLSON: Is she indeed 94?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I want to say happy birthday Queen Elizabeth. She turned 93 yesterday.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wow. Fantastic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LYONS: Ninety three.</p><p>CARLSON: She would be and I happen to know that she watches the show. She is probably throwing a glass of sherry at the TV right now. \"I'm 93, not 94.\"</p><p>LYONS: I could use a glass of sherry right now. I'll take it.</p><p>CARLSON: That's pretty funny. So could Congressman -- okay, this is our Daily Double. This is a two-pointer. Congressman Eric Swalwell is running for President. He is asking for donations. He is advising people to stop spending on one specific type of snack and to give that money to him instead. What food does Eric Swalwell want you to forgo? Lauren.</p><p>BLANCHARDD: Potato chips, don't eat your dollar.</p><p>CARLSON: Potato chips. Is it potato chips?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One dollar could buy you a half bag of chips or it could save us from a crumbling government. How will you spend yours? I'll take year-old stale chips over Representative Swalwell. You know what, we should put one of these open somewhere in the green room for a year, and a year from now we should taste what they taste like.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, yum. Swalwell chips. I like that.</p><p>BLANCHARD: You can't get a bag of chips for a dollar.</p><p>CARLSON: for like freedom fries.</p><p>BLANCHARD: I don't think even a vending machine does that.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay, final question, this question is about \"Jeopardy,\" our gameshow rival, a sports bettor from Las Vegas, a pro sports bettor is bankrupting that show pretty much because he just keeps winning. He recently broke a record, he surpassed a million dollars in the shortest time ever. How many days did it take this man to win a million dollars? Kathryn Lyons.</p><p>LYONS: Twenty three.</p><p>CARLSON: Twenty three days. It's very specific.</p><p>LYONS: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay, did it take him 23 days?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEX TREBEK, HOST, JEOPARDY: You have 30 seconds. Good luck. Did he come up with Grant and Lee? He did. So you are up to $118, 816.00, a 14-day total of $1,061,554.00. The guy is amazing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LYONS: That was close.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay, it was. It was close. It was a little bit double, actually, but on this show unlike the SAT, we encourage guessing.</p><p>LYONS: I wanted to try something.</p><p>CARLSON: And it is rewarded maybe not in the outcome, but with our admiration, so we admire you Kathryn for guessing. Thank you very much.</p><p>LYONS: I do, too. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: And you Lauren you've won your 11th in a row and with that, it is time to induct you into the \"Final Exam\" Hall of Fame. You're the second person to make it there, alongside Shannon Bream. But first we have a video of how you prepared for this moment. We want our viewers to see this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD: This smells like victory.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That's unbelievable and I just want to be totally clear. When we shot that, we had no idea. We didn't give you the questions ahead of time.</p><p>BLANCHARD: No.</p><p>CARLSON: That's how confident we were.</p><p>BLANCHARD: It made me study even harder because if I lost and that thing played --</p><p>CARLSON: Kathryn, don't feel bad. I could never --</p><p>LYONS: Oh, I don't feel bad at all.</p><p>CARLSON: All right, well now for the big reveal. Emily Lynn is here with your prizes, Lauren Blanchard. Emily has something for you.</p><p>BLANCHARD: This is such an exciting moment.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, and Louis does, too.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Oh my gosh.</p><p>CARLSON: A sash and a tiara. There's not a dry eye in the studio. Lauren Blanchard, ladies and gentlemen. Really the all-time winner. The highest score ever. You will live forever in the hearts and memories of our viewers. Lauren, thank you very much.</p><p>LYON: Congratulations.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Thank you for being here.</p><p>CARLSON: That's it for this week's special \"Final Exam.\" Pay attention to the news every week. We'll be back next Thursday. Tell us if you can beat the experts then we'll be right back.</p><p>BRUCE: This is a Fox News Alert. Text messages between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page indicate that the FBI may have tried to use post-election briefings to monitor the Trump team. These text messages were released in 2018, but Fox has learned that they are now under renewed scrutiny from congressional investigators.</p><p>The text Strzok and Page discussed using post-election briefings to find people they could quote \"develop for potential relationships,\" end quote, which may refer to cultivating sources to inform on the President's associates.</p><p>The texts also discussed tracking lines of questioning they received and quote, \"assessing changes in demeanor by those at the meetings.\" Congressman Devin Nunes of California tells Fox that these texts are evidence of deep irregularities as you might imagine in the FBI's Trump- Russia investigation.</p><p>Senators Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson meanwhile have sent a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr demanding more information. We will continue to monitor this extraordinary story.</p><p>Now California's cities are filling up with homeless camps, needles and human waste. Instead of fixing those problems, the government has given financial aid to illegal immigrants and banned straws.</p><p>Now lawmakers have a new idea, they want to ban schools from suspending students for willful defiance as they call it. In other words students can be disruptive as much as they want in class and schools will be powerless to punish them. Jason Rantz is a Seattle radio host, he joins us now. Jason, welcome aboard.</p><p>JASON RANTZ, RADIO SHOW HOST: Thank you. It's insane, isn't it?</p><p>BRUCE: Yes, you know look I'm a native Californian. I've lived in New York for a number of years. I love the West. Your state is extraordinary. California is wonderful, but what can you tell us about this. Banning straws is one thing, what is this about not wanting to take control of a classroom educational environment? What's behind this?</p><p>RANTZ: Yes, my guess is what's behind it is social justice, right. We have a bunch of ideologues who are in charge of major states of the West Coast and they're kind of running them into the ground.</p><p>When you look at something like this, it's usually about institutionalized racism, right? When you look at the data, it suggests that if you're a student of color, you're at a higher likelihood of being suspended.</p><p>So they're looking at this and saying, okay, there has to be something wrong. There has to be something wrong beyond what the teachers are doing. Let's just stop it rather than look at the data.</p><p>So they say, okay, we're not going to do the suspensions, but you're ignoring the root cause because I think all of us will probably agree there are some situations where teachers or administrators are rushing to suspending certain students or expelling students for whatever their conduct is.</p><p>But if you take an entire tool out of that toolbox, well you're making it harder for the teachers and by the way, you're literally ignoring the fact that institutionalized racism or not, these are teachers and educators who are suspending these students, right? I mean, this should be seen as a slap in the face to teachers, but progressives like to say, you know we fight for the teachers. Not really, because you're telling me that they're racists and they're targeting African-American students at a disproportionately high rate. It's a little bizarre.</p><p>BRUCE: Well and of course, for everyone involved including the students, if there was -- you wouldn't you would think that there would be a policy indicating that or at least an awareness that if someone is acting out in class, there may be a problem and that the efforts should be in addressing that issue, but by either -- but especially by ignoring that issue, it then sends a message also to the other students that you can do these things and have no punishment, in addition, to perhaps wanting to notice the nature of what dangers may be in that environment for the other students. You know everybody loses with this kind of a policy.</p><p>RANTZ: They do and I mean think about the fact that, why are these students acting out and why are they being willfully defiant?</p><p>BRUCE: Right, exactly.</p><p>RANTZ: Maybe there's something going on in the home. So let's say you decide we're no longer going to do the suspensions, we're going to do some alternative form of punishment, okay fine, but that's still not addressing that root cause of what maybe is going on in the home and while you're dealing with this to your point, you've got students who are just there trying to learn who are constantly being interrupted.</p><p>BRUCE: Beyond punishment, but just even inquiry. All right, well, Jason that's all the time we've got. Obviously this will continue on. I appreciate you bringing it to us. Thank you, dear.</p><p>RANTZ: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BRUCE: All righty, in 2014, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio had nothing but good things to say as most of us do about hotdogs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY), MAYOR: A great New York tradition, the annual Nathan's Famous Hotdog Eating Contest in Coney Island, something that is quintessentially New York, a place I love to visit.</p><p>I just personally loved Nathan's Hotdogs and look for every opportunity to have one.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Now though, de Blasio has flip-flopped. He sure looked like he was enjoying that dog though, didn't he? Hotdogs are evil now. The mayor has put his name to New York's version of the Green New Deal and as part of that policy, New York will aim to remove processed meats including hotdogs from all city property including hospitals and schools.</p><p>Melissa Francis co-host \"After the Bell\" on Fox Business. She joins us now. Melissa, what the heck is going on?</p><p>MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS CO-HOST: Yes, no and \"Outnumbered\" on Fox News Channel, don't forget, but yes there is a war on Hotdogs. Mayor de Blasio has loved his last hotdog and now he feels like we don't need them any longer. It's always a money grab when you look at these things. That's what you have to understand and this is part of as you said, the Green New Deal. We're going to do away with processed meats because you've heard about cows and animals and they're little bit gassy and we've got to get rid of them to have a livable planet.</p><p>So this is part of his plan where he's going to take away buildings with lots of windows, no one is going to drive and we're going to get rid of plastic and paper bags in spots, but if you look closely, these things are never bans. What it really is, is you can do it for a price.</p><p>So for example, with the glass buildings, you can still do it if you want to do it. You know, people who want to live in huge lovely towers, but he's going to charge you millions of dollars and it's the exact same thing with the bags. It's the same thing with the congestion pricing, the problem is that taxes in New York are too high already and people are fleeing because we can't do the salt deduction any longer, so they came up $3.4 billion short due to personal income taxes from people who fled the state and didn't pay. In a panic did they decide to spend less? Oh no, Tammy Bruce, why would they do that?</p><p>No, they're going to dream up new ways to tax the rest of us and those few idiots like myself who are left here. They're going to drive us out by taking away our hotdogs and taxing us for living in a house with windows.</p><p>BRUCE: I live here as well, which means they're going to make --</p><p>FRANCIS: Oh, I thought you are in California.</p><p>BRUCE: It is going to look like -- I think \"The Post\" had him as Fred Flintstone. We're going to have stone based homes and I would suggest maybe that maybe the mayor might have a Hotdog or two in the privacy of his own mansion. It'd just be poor us who won't be able to eat the processed meats. I mean, Spam -- people enjoy Spam and bologna. Who doesn't like a bologna sandwich? It's ridiculous.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm not a huge fan of bologna, but I love bacon. I've never seen a strip of bacon that I didn't want to eat. The irony is, is that he's supposed to be a man of the people, but what he's doing is he is depriving all these things to people who can't afford them.</p><p>BRUCE: Correct.</p><p>FRANCIS: And he's just putting them off to the side to the big real estate developers and saying you're going to have to pay few extra million dollars to have your glass windows. If you want to drive in New York, you're going to have to pay more money and you're just hurting the people he claims he is for and it's all under the guise of A Green New Deal. They make it about the environment.</p><p>BRUCE: So it's an excuse.</p><p>FRANCIS: But, it's just about money.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes, it is -- it's always, you know, you never want to let a good crisis go to waste, right? They're not going to solve any of the problems we have, but they're going to make regular people miserable as they get all the benefits. All right, Melissa thank, you so much. Great seeing you.</p><p>FRANCIS: You, too. Have a hotdog. I'm going to go have one right now while I can.</p><p>BRUCE: Indeed.</p><p>FRANCIS: Street meat in front of the box right now.</p><p>BRUCE: Good, perfect.

That's THE STORY on this Thursday, April 25th.  Tucker Carlson is up next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TAMMY BRUCE, PRESIDENT, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  Good evening, everybody.  Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.  I'm Tammy Bruce filling in for Tucker this evening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joe Biden has entered the 2020 presidential race and is immediately a front-runner, but can he beat 20 radical democrats fighting to take him down?  Mark Steyn, one of your favorites will be here in just a minute to talk about that, plus the hecklers who went after Bernie Sanders last night, that's also just ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, a Massachusetts judge and court officer who helped an illegal immigrant criminal escape the custody of I.C.E. have actually been indicted for obstruction of justice and several other criminal charges.  Trace Gallagher joins us with more.  Hi Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Tammy.  Jose Medina Perez is an illegal immigrant who has been deported twice, who is wanted on drunk-driving warrants and was appearing in a Massachusetts courtroom before Judge Shelley Richmond Joseph on drug charges.  If Medina Perez made bail, there was an I.C.E. agent in the courthouse hallway waiting to re-arrest him.</p><p>Now, here's the conversation picked up on courtroom audio between Judge Joseph and the defense attorney for Medina Perez.  Now, they speak softly so listen close.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID JELLINEK, DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  I.C.E. will pick him up if he walks out the front door.</p><p>SHELLEY RICHMOND JOSEPH, JUDGE:  I.C.E. is going to get him.  What if we continue ...</p><p>JELLINEK:  Are we filming?</p><p>JOSEPH:  Larry, can we go off the record for a moment?</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER:  Yes, so it's unclear what was said when they turned off the audio recorder, but the defense lawyer later told the judge, Medina Perez needed to get his property downstairs which the judge allowed.  That's when prosecutors say the court officer, Wesley McGregor who is also charged used his access card to slip Medina Perez out the back door.</p><p>The lead Federal investigator said quoting, \"The people of the this country deserve nothing less than to know that they're appointed and elected representatives that are working on their behalf while adhering to and enforcing the rule of law not a personal agenda.\"</p><p>Today, the judge and court officer were indicted by a grand jury and pled not guilty to obstruction of justice.  As she left the courthouse, Judge Joseph lost her composure and began to cry and her attorney says the case is purely political -- Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE:  All right, Trace, thank you.  Boy, what a scene there.  Thanks for that report.  Now Howie Carr is a Boston area radio host.  Hi, Howie, he joins us now.  How are you doing?</p><p>HOWIE CARR, RADIO HOST:  Very good, Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE:  Good.  Boy, what a remarkable event.  We know that President Trump was elected in part because Americans were tired of not having the rule of law and seeing it in place and applied uniformly to all people and now, suddenly we have an example of where it just might have been.  Give us some background.  That's your state.  It's pretty thrilling, isn't it?</p><p>CARR:  Right.  Well it is, I mean, I talked to the director of I.C.E. today, the Acting Director.  He said as far as he knows, this is the first time this has happened.  There are these sanctuary jurisdictions all across the country, but no judge, no politician, no sheriff or police commissioner has ever been indicted for letting these illegal aliens go and in Massachusetts as in most other areas of the country, this has gotten to be a terrible problem in the same courthouse which is just outside of Boston -- Newton District Court.</p><p>Last year, you had another judge had a had an illegal Dominican gangbanger in front of her who was accused of raping a BC college co-ed well while she was drunk and the prosecutors had asked for a high bail so that I.C.E. could grab this guy and get him deported or at least get him locked up while he faced charges.  The judge cut the bail to $2,500.00 and he escaped out the back door.</p><p>They had a case south of Boston in Quincy, another rape case involving an Uber-Lyft type driver and he was let go at the courthouse and he escaped to Africa.</p><p>BRUCE:  You know, Howie, I've got to say though, this is unusual in that and I think the lack of law and the lack of cooperating with Federal law enforcement kind of invites this as with that audio that we heard, there's like collusion.  There was like an effort made to help facilitate the escape.  It wasn't even just using the law as a state might have passed it and we can debate whether that would be constitutional or legal, but this is an actual effort to facilitate the escape by this judge and that clerk.  I mean, extraordinary.</p><p>CARR:  This judge, she violated all kinds of laws.  You know, the courtrooms are open.  If she wouldn't even let this guy who's not just a U.S. citizen, but he is an officer of the law, a sworn officer, an I.C.E. agent, she wouldn't even let him in the courtroom and then there are all these rules of the Massachusetts Trial Court that you don't turn off the tape recorder just for the very reason that they did turn off the tape recorder.</p><p>BRUCE:  But look, if you're willing to do what they did, allegedly, and again, there's been an indictment, then I don't think the other smaller issues bother you either, but this seems to be I think a mentality that especially on the left and even within law enforcement as we've seen of course, even at the highest Federal levels that maybe the rules don't apply to them and the nation, I think is sent a message here very strongly that we want law and order and the rule of law to apply to everyone.</p><p>Great job out there also with all of your work, Howie, thanks for joining me tonight.  Appreciate it.</p><p>CARR:  Thank you, Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, not a story that we all want to hear, but it was good to see how it is turning out.</p><p>Now, the U.S.-Mexico border has become a huge mess with literally thousands of people crossing over every day.  Now, \"New York Times\" columnist Thomas Friedman says he has seen enough.</p><p>In a recent column, Friedman shocked many on the left by coming out in favor of a border wall.  He said so on CNN.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  When you say though you want a high wall with a big gate ...</p><p>THOMAS FRIEDMAN, COLUMNIST, \"NEW YORK TIMES\":  Yes.</p><p>BLITZER:  A smart gate, but a high wall that's going to sound to a lot of folks out there that's what Donald Trump wants.</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  Well, I think you've got to control the border.  When you have an increase of illegal apprehensions of illegal entries by 374 percent since October, obviously you've got a situation where the border security is not sufficient.</p><p>I'm for a high wall with a big gate, a compassionate, a smart gate, so we can keep immigration going.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE:  All righty, well, Jonathan Harris is a Democratic strategist.  He joins us now.  Jonathan, welcome aboard, sir.</p><p>JONATHAN HARRIS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Hi, how are you?  Good to be with you.</p><p>BRUCE:  Good.  I know, it's like all of us are seeing pigs fly by the window, right, no matter which side you're on here.  What's your take on this?  I know that you don't like -- you don't agree with Mr. Friedman, exactly why?</p><p>HARRIS:  Right, well the thing is I think we've all -- we've heard the numbers now.  We've heard that a border wall would only curb about a third of illegal immigration because that's not where it comes from.  It actually doesn't come predominantly from the southern border.  It's people coming in through legal ports of entry and things like that.  It would only cut about a third of illegal immigration, and I think a lot of people disagree with it on the front of number one, it's just not cost-effective to spend that much money to cut a third of illegal immigration and then also just the way that Trump promoted the wall which was essentially calling Mexicans rapists and criminals and so on and so forth.</p><p>Whether you agree with the wall or not, if you isolate just that, those remarks leave a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths and it just -- I think a lot of people who maybe even would have supported you know, some of -- a wall or extended fencing, when you hear what he says about Muslims and Mexicans, you just don't want to even be associated with it at all.</p><p>BRUCE:  Here's our issue though.  A lot of people don't like what the President says or even how he says it and then there's the facts of the matter and the reality.</p><p>HARRIS:  Right.</p><p>BRUCE:  So even taking your numbers which we can debate whether that's a case or not.  In March alone, a hundred thousand illegal immigrants were apprehended, so you know, having 30,000 of those individuals stopped, why not do that?  But isn't the nation's national security -- doesn't that matter especially with Al Qaeda still out there, especially with other terrorist groups with what happened in Sri Lanka?  Don't we have a -- and this is not a zero-sum game.  It's not just the wall.  It is a comprehensive framework of border security with the wall being part of that.</p><p>HARRIS:  Of course.</p><p>BRUCE:  Especially when it comes to fentanyl and the drugs coming over, what would be -- what would make you happy?  Just no wall?  Or what would be the solution?</p><p>HARRIS:  Well again, the issue for me, I think, and again for a lot of people on the left -- lawmakers, voters -- is cutting a third of illegal immigration and then asking the taxpayer to foot the bill for billions of dollars when you said to your supporters to America that Mexico is paying for this repeatedly.  You've promoted the wall by calling Mexicans rapists and --</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, whether -- we can argue with whether or not the President approached it properly or not, I think -- I think he did.  Americans aren't going -- Americans aren't doing this and it's like -- any more than you wouldn't go to the doctor if you think there's only a 30 percent chance of a certain medicine working for you, just don't think, take it.</p><p>HARRIS:  Of course.</p><p>BRUCE:  But there has got to be a point where we come together as Friedman has at least went down to the border, saw what was going on and said, \"Yes, we've got to take control of this.\"</p><p>HARRIS:  I'm agreeing with what you're saying sort of in principle.  I'm just saying that it doesn't -- the way he sold it was vile and the facts don't support the need for it.</p><p>BRUCE:  Look, so that's John, thank you.  I appreciate that and that's, you know, very 2016 of you.</p><p>HARRIS:  Nineteen.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you.  I'll see you next time.  Two years ago -- thanks for joining us.  Two years ago, the college student, Otto Warmbier was returned to the United States from North Korea.  None of you will forget that.  However, Otto was in a comatose state and died days later.</p><p>Now sources say that when North Korea released Warmbier, they also gave the U.S. government $2 million bill for the \"treatment\" quote-unquote that he received.  According to those sources, U.S. envoy Joseph Yun signed that bill, but for at least the following year, it was never paid.</p><p>The Trump administration has insisted that it paid no ransom money for the release of Warbier or any other North Korean hostages, three more of which were also released later.  Extraordinary development there.</p><p>Joe Biden, in the meantime, has entered the Democratic presidential race as we know, but is Obama's Vice President liberal enough to win in the modern Democratic Party?  That is next.  Plus Mayor Bill de Blasio has declared a new war on hotdogs.  That's just ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRUCE:  All righty, after months of waiting and speculation, Joe Biden finally entered the Democratic presidential race today.  In his announcement, Biden said that giving Donald Trump eight years in the White House would permanently damage the country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are in the battles for the soul of this nation.  I believe history will look back on four years of this President and all he embraces, as an aberrant moment in time, but if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation -- who we are -- and I cannot stand by and watch that happen.</p><p>That's why today, I'm announcing my candidacy for President of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE:  All right, well Biden leads in the polls, but commentators are already warning that his age, sex and skin color are liabilities in the modern Democratic Party.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It'll be really interesting seeing him be able to or attempt to connect with these voters who have quite frankly been paying attention to people like Kamala Harris and other younger lawmakers who are just a bit closer to the current base.</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR:  What makes you so confident that a 76-year-old white man that this is his moment?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Has he missed his moment?  There's a Democratic base that is young and progressive and apparently somewhat desperate for an outsider.  Do they want someone like a Joe Biden -- older, centrist, the consummate insider if you will?</p><p>DAVID GREGORY, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Joe Biden understands that this modern Democratic Party is going to sit back and say \"Really?  We want a 76-year-old, white man?\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE:  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez isn't thrilled either.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY):  That does not particularly animate me right now.</p><p>I can understand why white people would be excited by that.  This idea that we can go back to the good old days with Obama with Obama's Vice President and I think, you know, there's an emotional element to that, but I don't want to go back.  I want to go forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, author and columnist, Mark Steyn joins us now.  I have a feeling you have a few things to say, Mark.  Welcome aboard.</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST:  Hey, great to be with you, Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE:  Look, this is -- it is very interesting.  I mean there's -- I agree with Alexandria, no one wants to go back, but I don't think anyone wants to go back to having their two jobs delivering pizza either, because this is be a rough primary and certainly, would be an even rougher general election.  What do you think is his biggest liability?  Is it his skin color?  Is it his age?  Is it being associated with the past?  What do you think they're looking at here?</p><p>STEYN:  Well, I don't think it's his skin color or his age because as much as I enjoy hearing all these people beat up on a 76-year-old white man, his principal rival in the Democratic primary is a 77-year-old white man and the difference between them, I think is that Bernie is a romance for his supporters.  He is a romantic figure.  He is a romantic insane figure, but he is romantic.</p><p>Biden is tired and is in the awful position of being unable to run as himself because the Democrats have basically disowned 90 percent of what Joe Biden has been doing in Washington for the last 45 years.  So that's a terrible problem for a guy when you have to run in an essentially dishonest way, which is why he gave this tortured and weird rationale as to why he's decided to get into the race in this video.</p><p>So Bernie has it way easier.  Bernie just has to be Bernie and Biden is trying to be something other than Biden.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, in the video, it was interesting in that he really based it in Charlottesville and it seemed as though that it was this fear that all of America had become racist and he is supposed to be the moderate and yet, that is the rhetoric of the left and the rhetoric of the left really also is kind of sexist and racist in a way, an ageist for a group that's politically correct.  They seem to be moving into an arena that they used to condemn people for.</p><p>STEYN:  Well it is very interesting that old people are the last people you can beat up on and I think that's to do with the fact that Democratic ideology essentially now is living in a kind of hyper-present tense.</p><p>BRUCE:  Right, good point.</p><p>STEYN:  So that anything that happened before the day before yesterday is entirely irrelevant so that means the people who exemplify it, that is -- you know, candidates who are older than 12 years old can be beaten up on the grounds of their age.  But Biden doesn't even do the old thing well, because you say what you like about Russian collusion, but the basic premise of the Russian collusion fever was that Trump was some kind of deep sleeper or not so deep sleeper for Vladimir Putin.  That doesn't indict all Trump supporters.</p><p>This weird thing that Trump somehow is leading to this resurgence of white supremacism necessarily indicts not just Trump, but half the population of the country, too.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well that's it and it's difficult to have to fit into that now, and the other older white man, Bernie Sanders last night attended an event called She, The People.  A woman in the crowd asked Sanders what he would do to fight against so-called white nationalism.  When he evaded giving an answer, Mark, he began to get heckled.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Let me just follow up, Senator.  The core of the question is about, as President what would you do with the rise of white supremacist violence to protect our communities?</p><p>(Cheering and Applause)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Absolutely.  You know as somebody who I know I date myself a little bit here, but I actually was at the march on Washington with Dr. King back in 1963 and --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE:  Boy, he got booed for mentioning that.  What's going on there, Mark?</p><p>STEYN:  Well, I think Bernie, in fairness to him, well I'll say one thing by the way, he looks fabulous there.  He doesn't look 77.  He looks like 83, 97 maybe but you can tell he's actually serious about running for President because he lives just across the Connecticut River from me in Vermont and he looks more quaffed and groomed than I've ever seen him.  So he is serious this time.</p><p>BRUCE:  He is.  He is serious and I think he's ready to take it -- to take it on, but this is just one, I think, one kind of taste of what everyone can expect in this Democratic primary season, Mark.  Thank you so much.  Appreciate you coming on tonight.</p><p>STEYN:  Thanks a lot, Tammy.  Great being with you.</p><p>BRUCE:  Great being with you, too, dear.  Well, identity politics is consuming the Democratic Party.  Now, even presidential candidates are apologizing for their sex and skin color.  Many of the men running are already pledging to pick a woman for Vice President if they get the nomination.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I will have a woman running mate to me.  It's really clear that we do that.</p><p>BETO O'ROURKE (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It would be very difficult not to select a woman with so many extraordinary women who are running right now.</p><p>SANDERS:  I think we would look for somebody who is maybe not of the same gender that I am.</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I've pledged that I would ask a woman to serve as Vice President.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE:  All, righty.  Well, Rochelle Ritchie as a former Press Secretary for the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee as she joins us now, a friend of mine, too.  Welcome back.  Nice to see you, dear.</p><p>ROCHELLE RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY FOR THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC POLICY AND COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE:  Yes, I'm so happy to see you.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, now I think we agree on a lot of situations here, but you could even hear the -- I guess, the discomfort of Bernie Sanders.  He couldn't even say woman.  I don't know why not, but do you think there's a problem with focusing on just the kind of the bean-counting if you will of gender as opposed to getting the right person for that job?</p><p>RITCHIE:  Well, let me be the first to say I certainly believe that we should pick the most qualified person to hold that position as Vice President, however I always find it very interesting that we seem to, when we talk about identity politics, Tammy, we always seem to focus on marginalized groups of people, right?  We always focus on African-Americans or women.</p><p>But it's weird because that same notion should also apply -- this identity politics notion -- should also apply to Republicans who may appeal to more white male dominated audiences.  So is white or Caucasian a race?  Isn't male a gender?  So I'm not really sure why it's only when someone is speaking to issues to people that look like me that all of a sudden it becomes identity politics.</p><p>BRUCE:  But I think it comes up in the specificity of what's being discussed pointedly for that reason like in that clip from where he was being heckled about you know, how are black women going to be represented?  What are you -- or in the case of the question about the Vice President, are you going to elect a woman?  It's a difference between that and policies that appeal across the board or to let's say blue-collar workers in the Midwest who might be primarily male or have a different point of view in that.</p><p>It's a difference between deliberately appealing to a group of individuals for the sake of doing that versus having policies that happen to appeal to a particular constituency in the country.</p><p>But I would also say, I don't know if you noticed this why would the men then -- somebody like Beto O'Rourke presuming that the women running are running to be his Vice President?</p><p>RITCHIE:  And that's the other thing.</p><p>BRUCE:  It's like what's that about?</p><p>RITCHIE:  There is this assumption that the woman running is fine with -- I mean, yes, women running for President and you think that these women are interested in being Vice President?  I don't think so, and Stacey Abrams I think it was on \"The View\" where she actually said this, that you know, if I were to run, I have intentions of running as President, not as Vice President.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.</p><p>RITCHIE:  But I think that we have to sort of understand that, you know, picking a female candidate to run as VP is not necessarily -- it may appear to be a winning strategy, but it's not always a winning strategy and I think we saw that with what happened with John McCain and Sarah Palin.  You know, he sort of thought maybe he could pull some of those Hillary Clinton supporters after Barack Obama got the nomination from the DNC.</p><p>He thought, \"Oh, I can pull those women.\"  But it's about if you're going to do -- have a woman, don't say, \"I'm going to select a woman,\" say, \"I'm going to select the most qualified one,\" and that way, you're looking at her qualifications as opposed to her gender.</p><p>BRUCE:  And there's enough talent -- yes.  There is enough talent to where you could do that without even making a statement about it, because it was the right thing to do.</p><p>RITCHIE:  And there is plenty of qualified women running for President right now.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, exactly.  Great job.  Thank you.  Nice seeing you.</p><p>RITCHIE:  Nice seeing you.  Great job to you, too.</p><p>BRUCE:  No doubt, we'll be talking about this for -- which is good -- for a long time to come.</p><p>RITCHIE:  Yes, we will.</p><p>BRUCE:  All right Facebook spies on you.  Amazon spies on you, but is your car spying on you as well?  That is next.  Plus prosecutor Kim Foxx let Jussie Smollett go unpunished.  Now a judge is asking why she won't give the same leniency to people who aren't friends with Michelle Obama.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Big tech is spying on you almost all the time.  Facebook says it expects to be fined up to $5 billion for spying, I guess, they shrug.  And now they're facing a new investigation in New York for collecting users e-mail address books, your entire book.</p><p>Tech giants aren't just monitoring your computer though, they're also in your living room and even in your car.  Fox News Headlines 24/7 anchor, Brett Larson has more.</p><p>BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 ANCHOR:  Hey, Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE:  Hey, Brett.</p><p>LARSON:  Yes, this a bit of a frightening find that we -- as we continue to uncover these things of what technology knows about us from the products we buy to the things we search for to just how often you change the oil in your car.</p><p>The average person is creating a binary breadcrumb trail that links together virtually everything we do and big companies are making a fortune off of it and it's not just big tech either.</p><p>Car manufacturers in Detroit are buying and selling your personal information like your location and your driving habits.  Industry insiders think data from your cars could be worth as much as $750 billion by 2030.  So who is making the money?  Consumer Rights groups, car manufacturers, even the folks who fix your car are all fighting over who owns your private information.</p><p>California state government is trying to combat the data collection.  They're actually considering a law that would give consumers the right to obtain data collected on them, ask for it to be deleted and block companies from selling your personal information.</p><p>Opponents of the law say some of the data collected like where you've been and where you are will make it more difficult for emergency services to find you, but your car isn't the only thing tracking your every move.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You must have gotten our membership back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I guess, I did.  The bigwigs promoted me to manager.  I've been training new employees.  We know this stuff arrived.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It just came a few hours ago.  Oh, Steven, you did it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARSON:  Okay, it turns out that South Park clip is real.  Amazon.com has a team of employees who listen to owners who talk to their Alexa smart device.  Amazon says the humans are necessary to help the artificial intelligence understand this.  This is how it starts, but some reports suggest that Amazon employees who listen in can see your location and at one point, had access to your phone number.</p><p>Silicon Valley is fighting against laws that would protect consumer privacy.  A lobbying group actually representing companies like Google and Facebook and Amazon came out swinging against a bill in Illinois that would actually have stopped companies from recording private conversations unless you agree to it in a written policy, but it's not clear that fines and regulations will work on the larger-than-life tech companies.</p><p>Facebook, as we've discussed already prepared to handover billions of dollars' worth of fines admitting they set aside $3 billion for a settlement last quarter, a move that actually sent their stock soaring today on Wall Street.  That was in their financial disclosure yesterday.</p><p>BRUCE:  Extraordinary.</p><p>LARSON:  They are setting aside this money for legal fees and fines because when you're making $15 billion in profit, $3 billion dollars, that's a fifth of your profit.</p><p>BRUCE:  And a major part of that profit is going to be the selling of this data, so it becomes this vicious circle.</p><p>LARSON:  Right.</p><p>BRUCE:  So they're paying with your money effectively that they're using your data for to be able to continue on to do this.</p><p>LARSON:  To continue selling, and there's been a lot of people saying, \"Well, why don't they just make a version of Facebook where you pay $8.00 a year for it,\" because that's what your data -- well, Facebook is not going to agree to that.  They make more money.</p><p>BRUCE:  I just love that they say they have to do this in order to keep you safe.  So that they'll be able to have people to save you.</p><p>LARSON:  Yes.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yeah, right.  All right, Thank you, Brett.  Great job.  Well the cast of the TV show \"Empire\" have released a joint letter demanding that actor Jussie Smollett return to the show \"Empire.\"  The letter claims that Smollett is quote, \"honest and filled with integrity,\" end quote -- and says he is innocent of all claims against him.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Chicago a woman charged with making a false police report is accusing State's Attorney Kim Foxx on a double standard.  Judge Mark Martin agreed demanding that prosecutors tell him why they were prosecuting her, but not Smollett.</p><p>Robby Soave is an editor at \"Reason\" and the author of \"Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump.\"  He joins us.  Welcome aboard, dear.  Nice to see you.</p><p>ROBBY SOAVE, EDITOR, REASON:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, fascinating situation here because the judge in this from what I can tell was also equally perplexed at the fact that she seemed to be taking a very different position with this young woman versus what she took with Mr. Smollett.</p><p>SOAVE:  Yes, the judge raises an excellent point, and said explicitly, you know what's different with this person who filed a false -- allegedly filed a false report.  Is it that they're not a rich, well-connected famous celebrity who has politically involved friends or associates or acquaintances?  Is that why this person is being brought to justice at all cost where Jussie was just allowed to walk through without even pleading guilty?  You know, that's what Kim Foxx did wrong in that case.  She just said no, I don't want to move forward with this case, even though the evidence is good and I would convict him, I just don't feel like doing it.</p><p>Why?  I think a lot of people were baffled by that.  They wanted some sense of closure in the Smollett case that frankly we are unlikely to get now because of what the prosecutor did.</p><p>BRUCE:  And also, as we've just now seen, what it does to other cases that should be perhaps adjudicated and handled in a certain way and now, at the same time, there's a County Inspector General who is also very curious about that decision-making process with her and you know, various lawsuits as well.</p><p>So eventually we may find out what the reasoning was, but in the meantime, good for that judge.  Robby, thanks for joining us tonight.  Appreciate it.</p><p>SOAVE:  My pleasure.</p><p>BRUCE:  All righty, well Tucker is back after the break.  Lauren Blanchard is going for a \"Final Exam\" record.  Can she join Shannon Bream in the Hall of Fame?  That is next.  Plus Bill de Blasio has declared war on New York's iconic hotdogs.  That's just ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRUCE:  All righty, Tucker is back for our next segment.  Lauren Blanchard just made her bid to join the \"Final Exam\" Hall of Fame.  Here's what happened.</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST:  It's time now for \"Final Exam\" where the news professionals compete with one another for a chance to be crowned the news knowledge champion.</p><p>For 10 straight weeks, Fox correspondent Lauren Blanchard has faced 10 separate opponents.  She has crushed them all.  They've all been buried by Blanchard.  Tonight, she's aiming to break the standing all-time win record set by Shannon Bream by winning her 11th match in a row.  If she does, she'll join Bream on our Hall of Fame wall.</p><p>Her opponent in this eleventh and final match is \"Roll Call\" reporter, Kathryn Lyons.  We brought in just for tonight's showdown.</p><p>KATHRYN LYONS, REPORTER, ROLL CALL:  I'd like to extend my congratulations.</p><p>LAUREN BLANCHARD, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  There's so much pressure on me.</p><p>CARLSON:  I know, it is making me tense.  Let's just jump right in this.  You both know the rules.  I'm going to repeat them as we always do.  Hands on buzzers.  I ask the questions.  The first one to buzz in gets to answer.  You have to wait until I finish asking the question before answering it.  You can answer once I acknowledge you by saying your name.  Every correct answer gives you a point.  Every incorrect answered detracts a point from your total.  Best of five wins.  Are you ready?</p><p>LYONS:  Not unless this is coming from the fourth hour of \"The Today Show.\"</p><p>CARLSON:  You are.  Okay.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  All right, let's do this.</p><p>CARLSON:  All right, question one, and by the way, it may be coming from just there.  Multiple choice, the first question: The President and First Lady just held the White House's biggest social event of the year.  That of course is the White House Easter Egg Roll.  Thirty thousand kids and adults turned up throughout the day.  The question tonight, when was that event, the Easter Egg Roll first held?  Was it A. 1878?  B. 1787?  Or C. 1692?  Lauren Blanchard.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  It was 1878.  It was the 141st.</p><p>CARLSON:  It wasn't 1692?</p><p>BLANCHARD:  No, it was not.</p><p>CARLSON:  Who put that in there?  Okay, is Lauren correct?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn of the White House, First Lady Melania Trump hosting the annual event for children.  It's a White House tradition dating back to 1878, and President Trump will blow the whistle to start the first race about ten minutes from now.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Happy Easter.  Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LYONS:  I pushed it at the same time.</p><p>CARLSON:  So our producers just reminded me.  Alex McCaskill, our senior producer who writes this says, 1692 was the Salem witch hunts.  So that's why -- if that sounded familiar.  It's the art of -- okay, question two.  American musician, Gavin DeGraw recently sang the National Anthem at a Stanley Cup playoff game.  Something embarrassing happened to him as soon as he was done singing, what happened?  Lauren.</p><p>LYONS:  Oh, geez.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  He slipped on the ice when he was done.  He like stepped off the carpet and foop.</p><p>CARLSON:  And foop, did he -- roll tape please.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYS)</p><p>LYONS:  He was standing there, he stepped back and just missed the carpet.  He slipped.</p><p>CARLSON:  Our judges are saying, your description went foop is correct.  That's in fact exactly what he just did.  Okay, question three.  This once more a multiple-choice question.  Queen Elizabeth, the Queen of England had her birthday just the other day, how old is she now?  Is she A. 93?  B. 94?  C. 95?  Kathryn Lyons?</p><p>LYONS:  She's B. 94.</p><p>CARLSON:  You think she's 94 years old.</p><p>LYONS:  Yes, 94 years young.</p><p>CARLSON:  Is she indeed 94?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I want to say happy birthday Queen Elizabeth.  She turned 93 yesterday.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Wow.  Fantastic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LYONS:  Ninety three.</p><p>CARLSON:  She would be and I happen to know that she watches the show.  She is probably throwing a glass of sherry at the TV right now.  \"I'm 93, not 94.\"</p><p>LYONS:  I could use a glass of sherry right now.  I'll take it.</p><p>CARLSON:  That's pretty funny.  So could Congressman -- okay, this is our Daily Double.  This is a two-pointer.  Congressman Eric Swalwell is running for President.  He is asking for donations.  He is advising people to stop spending on one specific type of snack and to give that money to him instead.  What food does Eric Swalwell want you to forgo?  Lauren.</p><p>BLANCHARDD:  Potato chips, don't eat your dollar.</p><p>CARLSON:  Potato chips.  Is it potato chips?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One dollar could buy you a half bag of chips or it could save us from a crumbling government.  How will you spend yours?  I'll take year-old stale chips over Representative Swalwell.  You know what, we should put one of these open somewhere in the green room for a year, and a year from now we should taste what they taste like.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  Oh, yum.  Swalwell chips.  I like that.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  You can't get a bag of chips for a dollar.</p><p>CARLSON:  for like freedom fries.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  I don't think even a vending machine does that.</p><p>CARLSON:  Okay, final question, this question is about \"Jeopardy,\" our gameshow rival, a sports bettor from Las Vegas, a pro sports bettor is bankrupting that show pretty much because he just keeps winning.  He recently broke a record, he surpassed a million dollars in the shortest time ever.  How many days did it take this man to win a million dollars?  Kathryn Lyons.</p><p>LYONS:  Twenty three.</p><p>CARLSON:  Twenty three days.  It's very specific.</p><p>LYONS:  Yes.</p><p>CARLSON:  Okay, did it take him 23 days?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEX TREBEK, HOST, JEOPARDY:  You have 30 seconds.  Good luck.  Did he come up with Grant and Lee?  He did.  So you are up to $118, 816.00, a 14-day total of $1,061,554.00.  The guy is amazing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LYONS:  That was close.</p><p>CARLSON:  Okay, it was.  It was close.  It was a little bit double, actually, but on this show unlike the SAT, we encourage guessing.</p><p>LYONS:  I wanted to try something.</p><p>CARLSON:  And it is rewarded maybe not in the outcome, but with our admiration, so we admire you Kathryn for guessing.  Thank you very much.</p><p>LYONS:  I do, too.  Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON:  And you Lauren you've won your 11th in a row and with that, it is time to induct you into the \"Final Exam\" Hall of Fame.  You're the second person to make it there, alongside Shannon Bream.  But first we have a video of how you prepared for this moment.  We want our viewers to see this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD:  This smells like victory.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  That's unbelievable and I just want to be totally clear.  When we shot that, we had no idea.  We didn't give you the questions ahead of time.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  No.</p><p>CARLSON:  That's how confident we were.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  It made me study even harder because if I lost and that thing played --</p><p>CARLSON:  Kathryn, don't feel bad.  I could never --</p><p>LYONS:  Oh, I don't feel bad at all.</p><p>CARLSON:  All right, well now for the big reveal.  Emily Lynn is here with your prizes, Lauren Blanchard.  Emily has something for you.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  This is such an exciting moment.</p><p>CARLSON:  Oh, and Louis does, too.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  Oh my gosh.</p><p>CARLSON:  A sash and a tiara.  There's not a dry eye in the studio.  Lauren Blanchard, ladies and gentlemen.  Really the all-time winner.  The highest score ever.  You will live forever in the hearts and memories of our viewers.  Lauren, thank you very much.</p><p>LYON:  Congratulations.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  Thank you for being here.</p><p>CARLSON:  That's it for this week's special \"Final Exam.\"  Pay attention to the news every week.  We'll be back next Thursday.  Tell us if you can beat the experts then we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRUCE:  This is a Fox News Alert.  Text messages between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page indicate that the FBI may have tried to use post-election briefings to monitor the Trump team.  These text messages were released in 2018, but Fox has learned that they are now under renewed scrutiny from congressional investigators.</p><p>The text Strzok and Page discussed using post-election briefings to find people they could quote \"develop for potential relationships,\" end quote, which may refer to cultivating sources to inform on the President's associates.</p><p>The texts also discussed tracking lines of questioning they received and quote, \"assessing changes in demeanor by those at the meetings.\"  Congressman Devin Nunes of California tells Fox that these texts are evidence of deep irregularities as you might imagine in the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation.</p><p>Senators Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson meanwhile have sent a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr demanding more information.  We will continue to monitor this extraordinary story.</p><p>Now California's cities are filling up with homeless camps, needles and human waste.  Instead of fixing those problems, the government has given financial aid to illegal immigrants and banned straws.</p><p>Now lawmakers have a new idea, they want to ban schools from suspending students for willful defiance as they call it.  In other words students can be disruptive as much as they want in class and schools will be powerless to punish them.  Jason Rantz is a Seattle radio host, he joins us now.  Jason, welcome aboard.</p><p>JASON RANTZ, RADIO SHOW HOST:  Thank you.  It's insane, isn't it?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, you know look I'm a native Californian.  I've lived in New York for a number of years.  I love the West.  Your state is extraordinary.  California is wonderful, but what can you tell us about this.  Banning straws is one thing, what is this about not wanting to take control of a classroom educational environment?  What's behind this?</p><p>RANTZ:  Yes, my guess is what's behind it is social justice, right.  We have a bunch of ideologues who are in charge of major states of the West Coast and they're kind of running them into the ground.</p><p>When you look at something like this, it's usually about institutionalized racism, right?  When you look at the data, it suggests that if you're a student of color, you're at a higher likelihood of being suspended.</p><p>So they're looking at this and saying, okay, there has to be something wrong.  There has to be something wrong beyond what the teachers are doing.  Let's just stop it rather than look at the data.</p><p>So they say, okay, we're not going to do the suspensions, but you're ignoring the root cause because I think all of us will probably agree there are some situations where teachers or administrators are rushing to suspending certain students or expelling students for whatever their conduct is.</p><p>But if you take an entire tool out of that toolbox, well you're making it harder for the teachers and by the way, you're literally ignoring the fact that institutionalized racism or not, these are teachers and educators who are suspending these students, right?  I mean, this should be seen as a slap in the face to teachers, but progressives like to say, you know we fight for the teachers.  Not really, because you're telling me that they're racists and they're targeting African-American students at a disproportionately high rate.  It's a little bizarre.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well and of course, for everyone involved including the students, if there was -- you wouldn't you would think that there would be a policy indicating that or at least an awareness that if someone is acting out in class, there may be a problem and that the efforts should be in addressing that issue, but by either -- but especially by ignoring that issue, it then sends a message also to the other students that you can do these things and have no punishment, in addition, to perhaps wanting to notice the nature of what dangers may be in that environment for the other students.  You know everybody loses with this kind of a policy.</p><p>RANTZ:  They do and I mean think about the fact that, why are these students acting out and why are they being willfully defiant?</p><p>BRUCE:  Right, exactly.</p><p>RANTZ:  Maybe there's something going on in the home.  So let's say you decide we're no longer going to do the suspensions, we're going to do some alternative form of punishment, okay fine, but that's still not addressing that root cause of what maybe is going on in the home and while you're dealing with this to your point, you've got students who are just there trying to learn who are constantly being interrupted.</p><p>BRUCE:  Beyond punishment, but just even inquiry.  All right, well, Jason that's all the time we've got.  Obviously this will continue on.  I appreciate you bringing it to us.  Thank you, dear.</p><p>RANTZ:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BRUCE:  All righty, in 2014, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio had nothing but good things to say as most of us do about hotdogs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY), MAYOR:  A great New York tradition, the annual Nathan's Famous Hotdog Eating Contest in Coney Island, something that is quintessentially New York, a place I love to visit.</p><p>I just personally loved Nathan's Hotdogs and look for every opportunity to have one.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE:  Now though, de Blasio has flip-flopped.  He sure looked like he was enjoying that dog though, didn't he? Hotdogs are evil now.  The mayor has put his name to New York's version of the Green New Deal and as part of that policy, New York will aim to remove processed meats including hotdogs from all city property including hospitals and schools.</p><p>Melissa Francis co-host \"After the Bell\" on Fox Business.  She joins us now.  Melissa, what the heck is going on?</p><p>MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS CO-HOST:  Yes, no and \"Outnumbered\" on Fox News Channel, don't forget, but yes there is a war on Hotdogs.  Mayor de Blasio has loved his last hotdog and now he feels like we don't need them any longer.  It's always a money grab when you look at these things.  That's what you have to understand and this is part of as you said, the Green New Deal.  We're going to do away with processed meats because you've heard about cows and animals and they're little bit gassy and we've got to get rid of them to have a livable planet.</p><p>So this is part of his plan where he's going to take away buildings with lots of windows, no one is going to drive and we're going to get rid of plastic and paper bags in spots, but if you look closely, these things are never bans.  What it really is, is you can do it for a price.</p><p>So for example, with the glass buildings, you can still do it if you want to do it.  You know, people who want to live in huge lovely towers, but he's going to charge you millions of dollars and it's the exact same thing with the bags.  It's the same thing with the congestion pricing, the problem is that taxes in New York are too high already and people are fleeing because we can't do the salt deduction any longer, so they came up $3.4 billion short due to personal income taxes from people who fled the state and didn't pay.  In a panic did they decide to spend less?  Oh no, Tammy Bruce, why would they do that?</p><p>No, they're going to dream up new ways to tax the rest of us and those few idiots like myself who are left here.  They're going to drive us out by taking away our hotdogs and taxing us for living in a house with windows.</p><p>BRUCE:  I live here as well, which means they're going to make --</p><p>FRANCIS:  Oh, I thought you are in California.</p><p>BRUCE:  It is going to look like -- I think \"The Post\" had him as Fred Flintstone.  We're going to have stone based homes and I would suggest maybe that maybe the mayor might have a Hotdog or two in the privacy of his own mansion.  It'd just be poor us who won't be able to eat the processed meats.  I mean, Spam -- people enjoy Spam and bologna.  Who doesn't like a bologna sandwich?  It's ridiculous.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I'm not a huge fan of bologna, but I love bacon.  I've never seen a strip of bacon that I didn't want to eat.  The irony is, is that he's supposed to be a man of the people, but what he's doing is he is depriving all these things to people who can't afford them.</p><p>BRUCE:  Correct.</p><p>FRANCIS:  And he's just putting them off to the side to the big real estate developers and saying you're going to have to pay few extra million dollars to have your glass windows.  If you want to drive in New York, you're going to have to pay more money and you're just hurting the people he claims he is for and it's all under the guise of A Green New Deal.  They make it about the environment.</p><p>BRUCE:  So it's an excuse.</p><p>FRANCIS:  But, it's just about money.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, it is -- it's always, you know, you never want to let a good crisis go to waste, right?  They're not going to solve any of the problems we have, but they're going to make regular people miserable as they get all the benefits.  All right, Melissa thank, you so much.  Great seeing you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You, too.  Have a hotdog.  I'm going to go have one right now while I can.</p><p>BRUCE:  Indeed.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Street meat in front of the box right now.</p><p>BRUCE:  Good, perfect.  All right, you guys, that's about it for us tonight.  It's great to be with you here.  Tune in each night at 8:00 p.m. to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.  Also, don't forget to DVR the show if you haven't already set that up.  Have a great night.  Sean Hannity is next.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2215214413</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYF-7TV1-JBHT-D12H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7917\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

That's THE STORY on this Thursday, April 25th.  Tucker Carlson is up next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TAMMY BRUCE, PRESIDENT, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE:  Good evening, everybody.  Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.  I'm Tammy Bruce filling in for Tucker this evening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joe Biden has entered the 2020 presidential race and is immediately a front-runner, but can he beat 20 radical democrats fighting to take him down?  Mark Steyn, one of your favorites will be here in just a minute to talk about that, plus the hecklers who went after Bernie Sanders last night, that's also just ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, a Massachusetts judge and court officer who helped an illegal immigrant criminal escape the custody of I.C.E. have actually been indicted for obstruction of justice and several other criminal charges.  Trace Gallagher joins us with more.  Hi Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Tammy.  Jose Medina Perez is an illegal immigrant who has been deported twice, who is wanted on drunk-driving warrants and was appearing in a Massachusetts courtroom before Judge Shelley Richmond Joseph on drug charges.  If Medina Perez made bail, there was an I.C.E. agent in the courthouse hallway waiting to re-arrest him.</p><p>Now, here's the conversation picked up on courtroom audio between Judge Joseph and the defense attorney for Medina Perez.  Now, they speak softly so listen close.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID JELLINEK, DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  I.C.E. will pick him up if he walks out the front door.</p><p>SHELLEY RICHMOND JOSEPH, JUDGE:  I.C.E. is going to get him.  What if we continue ...</p><p>JELLINEK:  Are we filming?</p><p>JOSEPH:  Larry, can we go off the record for a moment?</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER:  Yes, so it's unclear what was said when they turned off the audio recorder, but the defense lawyer later told the judge, Medina Perez needed to get his property downstairs which the judge allowed.  That's when prosecutors say the court officer, Wesley McGregor who is also charged used his access card to slip Medina Perez out the back door.</p><p>The lead Federal investigator said quoting, \"The people of the this country deserve nothing less than to know that they're appointed and elected representatives that are working on their behalf while adhering to and enforcing the rule of law not a personal agenda.\"</p><p>Today, the judge and court officer were indicted by a grand jury and pled not guilty to obstruction of justice.  As she left the courthouse, Judge Joseph lost her composure and began to cry and her attorney says the case is purely political -- Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE:  All right, Trace, thank you.  Boy, what a scene there.  Thanks for that report.  Now Howie Carr is a Boston area radio host.  Hi, Howie, he joins us now.  How are you doing?</p><p>HOWIE CARR, RADIO HOST:  Very good, Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE:  Good.  Boy, what a remarkable event.  We know that President Trump was elected in part because Americans were tired of not having the rule of law and seeing it in place and applied uniformly to all people and now, suddenly we have an example of where it just might have been.  Give us some background.  That's your state.  It's pretty thrilling, isn't it?</p><p>CARR:  Right.  Well it is, I mean, I talked to the director of I.C.E. today, the Acting Director.  He said as far as he knows, this is the first time this has happened.  There are these sanctuary jurisdictions all across the country, but no judge, no politician, no sheriff or police commissioner has ever been indicted for letting these illegal aliens go and in Massachusetts as in most other areas of the country, this has gotten to be a terrible problem in the same courthouse which is just outside of Boston -- Newton District Court.</p><p>Last year, you had another judge had a had an illegal Dominican gangbanger in front of her who was accused of raping a BC college co-ed well while she was drunk and the prosecutors had asked for a high bail so that I.C.E. could grab this guy and get him deported or at least get him locked up while he faced charges.  The judge cut the bail to $2,500.00 and he escaped out the back door.</p><p>They had a case south of Boston in Quincy, another rape case involving an Uber-Lyft type driver and he was let go at the courthouse and he escaped to Africa.</p><p>BRUCE:  You know, Howie, I've got to say though, this is unusual in that and I think the lack of law and the lack of cooperating with Federal law enforcement kind of invites this as with that audio that we heard, there's like collusion.  There was like an effort made to help facilitate the escape.  It wasn't even just using the law as a state might have passed it and we can debate whether that would be constitutional or legal, but this is an actual effort to facilitate the escape by this judge and that clerk.  I mean, extraordinary.</p><p>CARR:  This judge, she violated all kinds of laws.  You know, the courtrooms are open.  If she wouldn't even let this guy who's not just a U.S. citizen, but he is an officer of the law, a sworn officer, an I.C.E. agent, she wouldn't even let him in the courtroom and then there are all these rules of the Massachusetts Trial Court that you don't turn off the tape recorder just for the very reason that they did turn off the tape recorder.</p><p>BRUCE:  But look, if you're willing to do what they did, allegedly, and again, there's been an indictment, then I don't think the other smaller issues bother you either, but this seems to be I think a mentality that especially on the left and even within law enforcement as we've seen of course, even at the highest Federal levels that maybe the rules don't apply to them and the nation, I think is sent a message here very strongly that we want law and order and the rule of law to apply to everyone.</p><p>Great job out there also with all of your work, Howie, thanks for joining me tonight.  Appreciate it.</p><p>CARR:  Thank you, Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, not a story that we all want to hear, but it was good to see how it is turning out.</p><p>Now, the U.S.-Mexico border has become a huge mess with literally thousands of people crossing over every day.  Now, \"New York Times\" columnist Thomas Friedman says he has seen enough.</p><p>In a recent column, Friedman shocked many on the left by coming out in favor of a border wall.  He said so on CNN.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  When you say though you want a high wall with a big gate ...</p><p>THOMAS FRIEDMAN, COLUMNIST, \"NEW YORK TIMES\":  Yes.</p><p>BLITZER:  A smart gate, but a high wall that's going to sound to a lot of folks out there that's what Donald Trump wants.</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  Well, I think you've got to control the border.  When you have an increase of illegal apprehensions of illegal entries by 374 percent since October, obviously you've got a situation where the border security is not sufficient.</p><p>I'm for a high wall with a big gate, a compassionate, a smart gate, so we can keep immigration going.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE:  All righty, well, Jonathan Harris is a Democratic strategist.  He joins us now.  Jonathan, welcome aboard, sir.</p><p>JONATHAN HARRIS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Hi, how are you?  Good to be with you.</p><p>BRUCE:  Good.  I know, it's like all of us are seeing pigs fly by the window, right, no matter which side you're on here.  What's your take on this?  I know that you don't like -- you don't agree with Mr. Friedman, exactly why?</p><p>HARRIS:  Right, well the thing is I think we've all -- we've heard the numbers now.  We've heard that a border wall would only curb about a third of illegal immigration because that's not where it comes from.  It actually doesn't come predominantly from the southern border.  It's people coming in through legal ports of entry and things like that.  It would only cut about a third of illegal immigration, and I think a lot of people disagree with it on the front of number one, it's just not cost-effective to spend that much money to cut a third of illegal immigration and then also just the way that Trump promoted the wall which was essentially calling Mexicans rapists and criminals and so on and so forth.</p><p>Whether you agree with the wall or not, if you isolate just that, those remarks leave a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths and it just -- I think a lot of people who maybe even would have supported you know, some of -- a wall or extended fencing, when you hear what he says about Muslims and Mexicans, you just don't want to even be associated with it at all.</p><p>BRUCE:  Here's our issue though.  A lot of people don't like what the President says or even how he says it and then there's the facts of the matter and the reality.</p><p>HARRIS:  Right.</p><p>BRUCE:  So even taking your numbers which we can debate whether that's a case or not.  In March alone, a hundred thousand illegal immigrants were apprehended, so you know, having 30,000 of those individuals stopped, why not do that?  But isn't the nation's national security -- doesn't that matter especially with Al Qaeda still out there, especially with other terrorist groups with what happened in Sri Lanka?  Don't we have a -- and this is not a zero-sum game.  It's not just the wall.  It is a comprehensive framework of border security with the wall being part of that.</p><p>HARRIS:  Of course.</p><p>BRUCE:  Especially when it comes to fentanyl and the drugs coming over, what would be -- what would make you happy?  Just no wall?  Or what would be the solution?</p><p>HARRIS:  Well again, the issue for me, I think, and again for a lot of people on the left -- lawmakers, voters -- is cutting a third of illegal immigration and then asking the taxpayer to foot the bill for billions of dollars when you said to your supporters to America that Mexico is paying for this repeatedly.  You've promoted the wall by calling Mexicans rapists and --</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, whether -- we can argue with whether or not the President approached it properly or not, I think -- I think he did.  Americans aren't going -- Americans aren't doing this and it's like -- any more than you wouldn't go to the doctor if you think there's only a 30 percent chance of a certain medicine working for you, just don't think, take it.</p><p>HARRIS:  Of course.</p><p>BRUCE:  But there has got to be a point where we come together as Friedman has at least went down to the border, saw what was going on and said, \"Yes, we've got to take control of this.\"</p><p>HARRIS:  I'm agreeing with what you're saying sort of in principle.  I'm just saying that it doesn't -- the way he sold it was vile and the facts don't support the need for it.</p><p>BRUCE:  Look, so that's John, thank you.  I appreciate that and that's, you know, very 2016 of you.</p><p>HARRIS:  Nineteen.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you.  I'll see you next time.  Two years ago -- thanks for joining us.  Two years ago, the college student, Otto Warmbier was returned to the United States from North Korea.  None of you will forget that.  However, Otto was in a comatose state and died days later.</p><p>Now sources say that when North Korea released Warmbier, they also gave the U.S. government $2 million bill for the \"treatment\" quote-unquote that he received.  According to those sources, U.S. envoy Joseph Yun signed that bill, but for at least the following year, it was never paid.</p><p>The Trump administration has insisted that it paid no ransom money for the release of Warbier or any other North Korean hostages, three more of which were also released later.  Extraordinary development there.</p><p>Joe Biden, in the meantime, has entered the Democratic presidential race as we know, but is Obama's Vice President liberal enough to win in the modern Democratic Party?  That is next.  Plus Mayor Bill de Blasio has declared a new war on hotdogs.  That's just ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRUCE:  All righty, after months of waiting and speculation, Joe Biden finally entered the Democratic presidential race today.  In his announcement, Biden said that giving Donald Trump eight years in the White House would permanently damage the country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are in the battles for the soul of this nation.  I believe history will look back on four years of this President and all he embraces, as an aberrant moment in time, but if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation -- who we are -- and I cannot stand by and watch that happen.</p><p>That's why today, I'm announcing my candidacy for President of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE:  All right, well Biden leads in the polls, but commentators are already warning that his age, sex and skin color are liabilities in the modern Democratic Party.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It'll be really interesting seeing him be able to or attempt to connect with these voters who have quite frankly been paying attention to people like Kamala Harris and other younger lawmakers who are just a bit closer to the current base.</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR:  What makes you so confident that a 76-year-old white man that this is his moment?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Has he missed his moment?  There's a Democratic base that is young and progressive and apparently somewhat desperate for an outsider.  Do they want someone like a Joe Biden -- older, centrist, the consummate insider if you will?</p><p>DAVID GREGORY, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Joe Biden understands that this modern Democratic Party is going to sit back and say \"Really?  We want a 76-year-old, white man?\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE:  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez isn't thrilled either.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY):  That does not particularly animate me right now.</p><p>I can understand why white people would be excited by that.  This idea that we can go back to the good old days with Obama with Obama's Vice President and I think, you know, there's an emotional element to that, but I don't want to go back.  I want to go forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, author and columnist, Mark Steyn joins us now.  I have a feeling you have a few things to say, Mark.  Welcome aboard.</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST:  Hey, great to be with you, Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE:  Look, this is -- it is very interesting.  I mean there's -- I agree with Alexandria, no one wants to go back, but I don't think anyone wants to go back to having their two jobs delivering pizza either, because this is be a rough primary and certainly, would be an even rougher general election.  What do you think is his biggest liability?  Is it his skin color?  Is it his age?  Is it being associated with the past?  What do you think they're looking at here?</p><p>STEYN:  Well, I don't think it's his skin color or his age because as much as I enjoy hearing all these people beat up on a 76-year-old white man, his principal rival in the Democratic primary is a 77-year-old white man and the difference between them, I think is that Bernie is a romance for his supporters.  He is a romantic figure.  He is a romantic insane figure, but he is romantic.</p><p>Biden is tired and is in the awful position of being unable to run as himself because the Democrats have basically disowned 90 percent of what Joe Biden has been doing in Washington for the last 45 years.  So that's a terrible problem for a guy when you have to run in an essentially dishonest way, which is why he gave this tortured and weird rationale as to why he's decided to get into the race in this video.</p><p>So Bernie has it way easier.  Bernie just has to be Bernie and Biden is trying to be something other than Biden.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, in the video, it was interesting in that he really based it in Charlottesville and it seemed as though that it was this fear that all of America had become racist and he is supposed to be the moderate and yet, that is the rhetoric of the left and the rhetoric of the left really also is kind of sexist and racist in a way, an ageist for a group that's politically correct.  They seem to be moving into an arena that they used to condemn people for.</p><p>STEYN:  Well it is very interesting that old people are the last people you can beat up on and I think that's to do with the fact that Democratic ideology essentially now is living in a kind of hyper-present tense.</p><p>BRUCE:  Right, good point.</p><p>STEYN:  So that anything that happened before the day before yesterday is entirely irrelevant so that means the people who exemplify it, that is -- you know, candidates who are older than 12 years old can be beaten up on the grounds of their age.  But Biden doesn't even do the old thing well, because you say what you like about Russian collusion, but the basic premise of the Russian collusion fever was that Trump was some kind of deep sleeper or not so deep sleeper for Vladimir Putin.  That doesn't indict all Trump supporters.</p><p>This weird thing that Trump somehow is leading to this resurgence of white supremacism necessarily indicts not just Trump, but half the population of the country, too.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well that's it and it's difficult to have to fit into that now, and the other older white man, Bernie Sanders last night attended an event called She, The People.  A woman in the crowd asked Sanders what he would do to fight against so-called white nationalism.  When he evaded giving an answer, Mark, he began to get heckled.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Let me just follow up, Senator.  The core of the question is about, as President what would you do with the rise of white supremacist violence to protect our communities?</p><p>(Cheering and Applause)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Absolutely.  You know as somebody who I know I date myself a little bit here, but I actually was at the march on Washington with Dr. King back in 1963 and --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE:  Boy, he got booed for mentioning that.  What's going on there, Mark?</p><p>STEYN:  Well, I think Bernie, in fairness to him, well I'll say one thing by the way, he looks fabulous there.  He doesn't look 77.  He looks like 83, 97 maybe but you can tell he's actually serious about running for President because he lives just across the Connecticut River from me in Vermont and he looks more quaffed and groomed than I've ever seen him.  So he is serious this time.</p><p>BRUCE:  He is.  He is serious and I think he's ready to take it -- to take it on, but this is just one, I think, one kind of taste of what everyone can expect in this Democratic primary season, Mark.  Thank you so much.  Appreciate you coming on tonight.</p><p>STEYN:  Thanks a lot, Tammy.  Great being with you.</p><p>BRUCE:  Great being with you, too, dear.  Well, identity politics is consuming the Democratic Party.  Now, even presidential candidates are apologizing for their sex and skin color.  Many of the men running are already pledging to pick a woman for Vice President if they get the nomination.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I will have a woman running mate to me.  It's really clear that we do that.</p><p>BETO O'ROURKE (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It would be very difficult not to select a woman with so many extraordinary women who are running right now.</p><p>SANDERS:  I think we would look for somebody who is maybe not of the same gender that I am.</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I've pledged that I would ask a woman to serve as Vice President.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE:  All, righty.  Well, Rochelle Ritchie as a former Press Secretary for the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee as she joins us now, a friend of mine, too.  Welcome back.  Nice to see you, dear.</p><p>ROCHELLE RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY FOR THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC POLICY AND COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE:  Yes, I'm so happy to see you.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, now I think we agree on a lot of situations here, but you could even hear the -- I guess, the discomfort of Bernie Sanders.  He couldn't even say woman.  I don't know why not, but do you think there's a problem with focusing on just the kind of the bean-counting if you will of gender as opposed to getting the right person for that job?</p><p>RITCHIE:  Well, let me be the first to say I certainly believe that we should pick the most qualified person to hold that position as Vice President, however I always find it very interesting that we seem to, when we talk about identity politics, Tammy, we always seem to focus on marginalized groups of people, right?  We always focus on African-Americans or women.</p><p>But it's weird because that same notion should also apply -- this identity politics notion -- should also apply to Republicans who may appeal to more white male dominated audiences.  So is white or Caucasian a race?  Isn't male a gender?  So I'm not really sure why it's only when someone is speaking to issues to people that look like me that all of a sudden it becomes identity politics.</p><p>BRUCE:  But I think it comes up in the specificity of what's being discussed pointedly for that reason like in that clip from where he was being heckled about you know, how are black women going to be represented?  What are you -- or in the case of the question about the Vice President, are you going to elect a woman?  It's a difference between that and policies that appeal across the board or to let's say blue-collar workers in the Midwest who might be primarily male or have a different point of view in that.</p><p>It's a difference between deliberately appealing to a group of individuals for the sake of doing that versus having policies that happen to appeal to a particular constituency in the country.</p><p>But I would also say, I don't know if you noticed this why would the men then -- somebody like Beto O'Rourke presuming that the women running are running to be his Vice President?</p><p>RITCHIE:  And that's the other thing.</p><p>BRUCE:  It's like what's that about?</p><p>RITCHIE:  There is this assumption that the woman running is fine with -- I mean, yes, women running for President and you think that these women are interested in being Vice President?  I don't think so, and Stacey Abrams I think it was on \"The View\" where she actually said this, that you know, if I were to run, I have intentions of running as President, not as Vice President.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.</p><p>RITCHIE:  But I think that we have to sort of understand that, you know, picking a female candidate to run as VP is not necessarily -- it may appear to be a winning strategy, but it's not always a winning strategy and I think we saw that with what happened with John McCain and Sarah Palin.  You know, he sort of thought maybe he could pull some of those Hillary Clinton supporters after Barack Obama got the nomination from the DNC.</p><p>He thought, \"Oh, I can pull those women.\"  But it's about if you're going to do -- have a woman, don't say, \"I'm going to select a woman,\" say, \"I'm going to select the most qualified one,\" and that way, you're looking at her qualifications as opposed to her gender.</p><p>BRUCE:  And there's enough talent -- yes.  There is enough talent to where you could do that without even making a statement about it, because it was the right thing to do.</p><p>RITCHIE:  And there is plenty of qualified women running for President right now.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, exactly.  Great job.  Thank you.  Nice seeing you.</p><p>RITCHIE:  Nice seeing you.  Great job to you, too.</p><p>BRUCE:  No doubt, we'll be talking about this for -- which is good -- for a long time to come.</p><p>RITCHIE:  Yes, we will.</p><p>BRUCE:  All right Facebook spies on you.  Amazon spies on you, but is your car spying on you as well?  That is next.  Plus prosecutor Kim Foxx let Jussie Smollett go unpunished.  Now a judge is asking why she won't give the same leniency to people who aren't friends with Michelle Obama.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRUCE:  Big tech is spying on you almost all the time.  Facebook says it expects to be fined up to $5 billion for spying, I guess, they shrug.  And now they're facing a new investigation in New York for collecting users e-mail address books, your entire book.</p><p>Tech giants aren't just monitoring your computer though, they're also in your living room and even in your car.  Fox News Headlines 24/7 anchor, Brett Larson has more.</p><p>BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 ANCHOR:  Hey, Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE:  Hey, Brett.</p><p>LARSON:  Yes, this a bit of a frightening find that we -- as we continue to uncover these things of what technology knows about us from the products we buy to the things we search for to just how often you change the oil in your car.</p><p>The average person is creating a binary breadcrumb trail that links together virtually everything we do and big companies are making a fortune off of it and it's not just big tech either.</p><p>Car manufacturers in Detroit are buying and selling your personal information like your location and your driving habits.  Industry insiders think data from your cars could be worth as much as $750 billion by 2030.  So who is making the money?  Consumer Rights groups, car manufacturers, even the folks who fix your car are all fighting over who owns your private information.</p><p>California state government is trying to combat the data collection.  They're actually considering a law that would give consumers the right to obtain data collected on them, ask for it to be deleted and block companies from selling your personal information.</p><p>Opponents of the law say some of the data collected like where you've been and where you are will make it more difficult for emergency services to find you, but your car isn't the only thing tracking your every move.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You must have gotten our membership back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I guess, I did.  The bigwigs promoted me to manager.  I've been training new employees.  We know this stuff arrived.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It just came a few hours ago.  Oh, Steven, you did it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARSON:  Okay, it turns out that South Park clip is real.  Amazon.com has a team of employees who listen to owners who talk to their Alexa smart device.  Amazon says the humans are necessary to help the artificial intelligence understand this.  This is how it starts, but some reports suggest that Amazon employees who listen in can see your location and at one point, had access to your phone number.</p><p>Silicon Valley is fighting against laws that would protect consumer privacy.  A lobbying group actually representing companies like Google and Facebook and Amazon came out swinging against a bill in Illinois that would actually have stopped companies from recording private conversations unless you agree to it in a written policy, but it's not clear that fines and regulations will work on the larger-than-life tech companies.</p><p>Facebook, as we've discussed already prepared to handover billions of dollars' worth of fines admitting they set aside $3 billion for a settlement last quarter, a move that actually sent their stock soaring today on Wall Street.  That was in their financial disclosure yesterday.</p><p>BRUCE:  Extraordinary.</p><p>LARSON:  They are setting aside this money for legal fees and fines because when you're making $15 billion in profit, $3 billion dollars, that's a fifth of your profit.</p><p>BRUCE:  And a major part of that profit is going to be the selling of this data, so it becomes this vicious circle.</p><p>LARSON:  Right.</p><p>BRUCE:  So they're paying with your money effectively that they're using your data for to be able to continue on to do this.</p><p>LARSON:  To continue selling, and there's been a lot of people saying, \"Well, why don't they just make a version of Facebook where you pay $8.00 a year for it,\" because that's what your data -- well, Facebook is not going to agree to that.  They make more money.</p><p>BRUCE:  I just love that they say they have to do this in order to keep you safe.  So that they'll be able to have people to save you.</p><p>LARSON:  Yes.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yeah, right.  All right, Thank you, Brett.  Great job.  Well the cast of the TV show \"Empire\" have released a joint letter demanding that actor Jussie Smollett return to the show \"Empire.\"  The letter claims that Smollett is quote, \"honest and filled with integrity,\" end quote -- and says he is innocent of all claims against him.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Chicago a woman charged with making a false police report is accusing State's Attorney Kim Foxx on a double standard.  Judge Mark Martin agreed demanding that prosecutors tell him why they were prosecuting her, but not Smollett.</p><p>Robby Soave is an editor at \"Reason\" and the author of \"Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump.\"  He joins us.  Welcome aboard, dear.  Nice to see you.</p><p>ROBBY SOAVE, EDITOR, REASON:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, fascinating situation here because the judge in this from what I can tell was also equally perplexed at the fact that she seemed to be taking a very different position with this young woman versus what she took with Mr. Smollett.</p><p>SOAVE:  Yes, the judge raises an excellent point, and said explicitly, you know what's different with this person who filed a false -- allegedly filed a false report.  Is it that they're not a rich, well-connected famous celebrity who has politically involved friends or associates or acquaintances?  Is that why this person is being brought to justice at all cost where Jussie was just allowed to walk through without even pleading guilty?  You know, that's what Kim Foxx did wrong in that case.  She just said no, I don't want to move forward with this case, even though the evidence is good and I would convict him, I just don't feel like doing it.</p><p>Why?  I think a lot of people were baffled by that.  They wanted some sense of closure in the Smollett case that frankly we are unlikely to get now because of what the prosecutor did.</p><p>BRUCE:  And also, as we've just now seen, what it does to other cases that should be perhaps adjudicated and handled in a certain way and now, at the same time, there's a County Inspector General who is also very curious about that decision-making process with her and you know, various lawsuits as well.</p><p>So eventually we may find out what the reasoning was, but in the meantime, good for that judge.  Robby, thanks for joining us tonight.  Appreciate it.</p><p>SOAVE:  My pleasure.</p><p>BRUCE:  All righty, well Tucker is back after the break.  Lauren Blanchard is going for a \"Final Exam\" record.  Can she join Shannon Bream in the Hall of Fame?  That is next.  Plus Bill de Blasio has declared war on New York's iconic hotdogs.  That's just ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRUCE:  All righty, Tucker is back for our next segment.  Lauren Blanchard just made her bid to join the \"Final Exam\" Hall of Fame.  Here's what happened.</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST:  It's time now for \"Final Exam\" where the news professionals compete with one another for a chance to be crowned the news knowledge champion.</p><p>For 10 straight weeks, Fox correspondent Lauren Blanchard has faced 10 separate opponents.  She has crushed them all.  They've all been buried by Blanchard.  Tonight, she's aiming to break the standing all-time win record set by Shannon Bream by winning her 11th match in a row.  If she does, she'll join Bream on our Hall of Fame wall.</p><p>Her opponent in this eleventh and final match is \"Roll Call\" reporter, Kathryn Lyons.  We brought in just for tonight's showdown.</p><p>KATHRYN LYONS, REPORTER, ROLL CALL:  I'd like to extend my congratulations.</p><p>LAUREN BLANCHARD, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  There's so much pressure on me.</p><p>CARLSON:  I know, it is making me tense.  Let's just jump right in this.  You both know the rules.  I'm going to repeat them as we always do.  Hands on buzzers.  I ask the questions.  The first one to buzz in gets to answer.  You have to wait until I finish asking the question before answering it.  You can answer once I acknowledge you by saying your name.  Every correct answer gives you a point.  Every incorrect answered detracts a point from your total.  Best of five wins.  Are you ready?</p><p>LYONS:  Not unless this is coming from the fourth hour of \"The Today Show.\"</p><p>CARLSON:  You are.  Okay.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  All right, let's do this.</p><p>CARLSON:  All right, question one, and by the way, it may be coming from just there.  Multiple choice, the first question: The President and First Lady just held the White House's biggest social event of the year.  That of course is the White House Easter Egg Roll.  Thirty thousand kids and adults turned up throughout the day.  The question tonight, when was that event, the Easter Egg Roll first held?  Was it A. 1878?  B. 1787?  Or C. 1692?  Lauren Blanchard.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  It was 1878.  It was the 141st.</p><p>CARLSON:  It wasn't 1692?</p><p>BLANCHARD:  No, it was not.</p><p>CARLSON:  Who put that in there?  Okay, is Lauren correct?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn of the White House, First Lady Melania Trump hosting the annual event for children.  It's a White House tradition dating back to 1878, and President Trump will blow the whistle to start the first race about ten minutes from now.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Happy Easter.  Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LYONS:  I pushed it at the same time.</p><p>CARLSON:  So our producers just reminded me.  Alex McCaskill, our senior producer who writes this says, 1692 was the Salem witch hunts.  So that's why -- if that sounded familiar.  It's the art of -- okay, question two.  American musician, Gavin DeGraw recently sang the National Anthem at a Stanley Cup playoff game.  Something embarrassing happened to him as soon as he was done singing, what happened?  Lauren.</p><p>LYONS:  Oh, geez.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  He slipped on the ice when he was done.  He like stepped off the carpet and foop.</p><p>CARLSON:  And foop, did he -- roll tape please.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYS)</p><p>LYONS:  He was standing there, he stepped back and just missed the carpet.  He slipped.</p><p>CARLSON:  Our judges are saying, your description went foop is correct.  That's in fact exactly what he just did.  Okay, question three.  This once more a multiple-choice question.  Queen Elizabeth, the Queen of England had her birthday just the other day, how old is she now?  Is she A. 93?  B. 94?  C. 95?  Kathryn Lyons?</p><p>LYONS:  She's B. 94.</p><p>CARLSON:  You think she's 94 years old.</p><p>LYONS:  Yes, 94 years young.</p><p>CARLSON:  Is she indeed 94?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I want to say happy birthday Queen Elizabeth.  She turned 93 yesterday.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Wow.  Fantastic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LYONS:  Ninety three.</p><p>CARLSON:  She would be and I happen to know that she watches the show.  She is probably throwing a glass of sherry at the TV right now.  \"I'm 93, not 94.\"</p><p>LYONS:  I could use a glass of sherry right now.  I'll take it.</p><p>CARLSON:  That's pretty funny.  So could Congressman -- okay, this is our Daily Double.  This is a two-pointer.  Congressman Eric Swalwell is running for President.  He is asking for donations.  He is advising people to stop spending on one specific type of snack and to give that money to him instead.  What food does Eric Swalwell want you to forgo?  Lauren.</p><p>BLANCHARDD:  Potato chips, don't eat your dollar.</p><p>CARLSON:  Potato chips.  Is it potato chips?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One dollar could buy you a half bag of chips or it could save us from a crumbling government.  How will you spend yours?  I'll take year-old stale chips over Representative Swalwell.  You know what, we should put one of these open somewhere in the green room for a year, and a year from now we should taste what they taste like.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  Oh, yum.  Swalwell chips.  I like that.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  You can't get a bag of chips for a dollar.</p><p>CARLSON:  for like freedom fries.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  I don't think even a vending machine does that.</p><p>CARLSON:  Okay, final question, this question is about \"Jeopardy,\" our gameshow rival, a sports bettor from Las Vegas, a pro sports bettor is bankrupting that show pretty much because he just keeps winning.  He recently broke a record, he surpassed a million dollars in the shortest time ever.  How many days did it take this man to win a million dollars?  Kathryn Lyons.</p><p>LYONS:  Twenty three.</p><p>CARLSON:  Twenty three days.  It's very specific.</p><p>LYONS:  Yes.</p><p>CARLSON:  Okay, did it take him 23 days?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEX TREBEK, HOST, JEOPARDY:  You have 30 seconds.  Good luck.  Did he come up with Grant and Lee?  He did.  So you are up to $118, 816.00, a 14-day total of $1,061,554.00.  The guy is amazing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LYONS:  That was close.</p><p>CARLSON:  Okay, it was.  It was close.  It was a little bit double, actually, but on this show unlike the SAT, we encourage guessing.</p><p>LYONS:  I wanted to try something.</p><p>CARLSON:  And it is rewarded maybe not in the outcome, but with our admiration, so we admire you Kathryn for guessing.  Thank you very much.</p><p>LYONS:  I do, too.  Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON:  And you Lauren you've won your 11th in a row and with that, it is time to induct you into the \"Final Exam\" Hall of Fame.  You're the second person to make it there, alongside Shannon Bream.  But first we have a video of how you prepared for this moment.  We want our viewers to see this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD:  This smells like victory.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  That's unbelievable and I just want to be totally clear.  When we shot that, we had no idea.  We didn't give you the questions ahead of time.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  No.</p><p>CARLSON:  That's how confident we were.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  It made me study even harder because if I lost and that thing played --</p><p>CARLSON:  Kathryn, don't feel bad.  I could never --</p><p>LYONS:  Oh, I don't feel bad at all.</p><p>CARLSON:  All right, well now for the big reveal.  Emily Lynn is here with your prizes, Lauren Blanchard.  Emily has something for you.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  This is such an exciting moment.</p><p>CARLSON:  Oh, and Louis does, too.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  Oh my gosh.</p><p>CARLSON:  A sash and a tiara.  There's not a dry eye in the studio.  Lauren Blanchard, ladies and gentlemen.  Really the all-time winner.  The highest score ever.  You will live forever in the hearts and memories of our viewers.  Lauren, thank you very much.</p><p>LYON:  Congratulations.</p><p>BLANCHARD:  Thank you for being here.</p><p>CARLSON:  That's it for this week's special \"Final Exam.\"  Pay attention to the news every week.  We'll be back next Thursday.  Tell us if you can beat the experts then we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRUCE:  This is a Fox News Alert.  Text messages between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page indicate that the FBI may have tried to use post-election briefings to monitor the Trump team.  These text messages were released in 2018, but Fox has learned that they are now under renewed scrutiny from congressional investigators.</p><p>The text Strzok and Page discussed using post-election briefings to find people they could quote \"develop for potential relationships,\" end quote, which may refer to cultivating sources to inform on the President's associates.</p><p>The texts also discussed tracking lines of questioning they received and quote, \"assessing changes in demeanor by those at the meetings.\"  Congressman Devin Nunes of California tells Fox that these texts are evidence of deep irregularities as you might imagine in the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation.</p><p>Senators Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson meanwhile have sent a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr demanding more information.  We will continue to monitor this extraordinary story.</p><p>Now California's cities are filling up with homeless camps, needles and human waste.  Instead of fixing those problems, the government has given financial aid to illegal immigrants and banned straws.</p><p>Now lawmakers have a new idea, they want to ban schools from suspending students for willful defiance as they call it.  In other words students can be disruptive as much as they want in class and schools will be powerless to punish them.  Jason Rantz is a Seattle radio host, he joins us now.  Jason, welcome aboard.</p><p>JASON RANTZ, RADIO SHOW HOST:  Thank you.  It's insane, isn't it?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, you know look I'm a native Californian.  I've lived in New York for a number of years.  I love the West.  Your state is extraordinary.  California is wonderful, but what can you tell us about this.  Banning straws is one thing, what is this about not wanting to take control of a classroom educational environment?  What's behind this?</p><p>RANTZ:  Yes, my guess is what's behind it is social justice, right.  We have a bunch of ideologues who are in charge of major states of the West Coast and they're kind of running them into the ground.</p><p>When you look at something like this, it's usually about institutionalized racism, right?  When you look at the data, it suggests that if you're a student of color, you're at a higher likelihood of being suspended.</p><p>So they're looking at this and saying, okay, there has to be something wrong.  There has to be something wrong beyond what the teachers are doing.  Let's just stop it rather than look at the data.</p><p>So they say, okay, we're not going to do the suspensions, but you're ignoring the root cause because I think all of us will probably agree there are some situations where teachers or administrators are rushing to suspending certain students or expelling students for whatever their conduct is.</p><p>But if you take an entire tool out of that toolbox, well you're making it harder for the teachers and by the way, you're literally ignoring the fact that institutionalized racism or not, these are teachers and educators who are suspending these students, right?  I mean, this should be seen as a slap in the face to teachers, but progressives like to say, you know we fight for the teachers.  Not really, because you're telling me that they're racists and they're targeting African-American students at a disproportionately high rate.  It's a little bizarre.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well and of course, for everyone involved including the students, if there was -- you wouldn't you would think that there would be a policy indicating that or at least an awareness that if someone is acting out in class, there may be a problem and that the efforts should be in addressing that issue, but by either -- but especially by ignoring that issue, it then sends a message also to the other students that you can do these things and have no punishment, in addition, to perhaps wanting to notice the nature of what dangers may be in that environment for the other students.  You know everybody loses with this kind of a policy.</p><p>RANTZ:  They do and I mean think about the fact that, why are these students acting out and why are they being willfully defiant?</p><p>BRUCE:  Right, exactly.</p><p>RANTZ:  Maybe there's something going on in the home.  So let's say you decide we're no longer going to do the suspensions, we're going to do some alternative form of punishment, okay fine, but that's still not addressing that root cause of what maybe is going on in the home and while you're dealing with this to your point, you've got students who are just there trying to learn who are constantly being interrupted.</p><p>BRUCE:  Beyond punishment, but just even inquiry.  All right, well, Jason that's all the time we've got.  Obviously this will continue on.  I appreciate you bringing it to us.  Thank you, dear.</p><p>RANTZ:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BRUCE:  All righty, in 2014, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio had nothing but good things to say as most of us do about hotdogs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY), MAYOR:  A great New York tradition, the annual Nathan's Famous Hotdog Eating Contest in Coney Island, something that is quintessentially New York, a place I love to visit.</p><p>I just personally loved Nathan's Hotdogs and look for every opportunity to have one.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE:  Now though, de Blasio has flip-flopped.  He sure looked like he was enjoying that dog though, didn't he? Hotdogs are evil now.  The mayor has put his name to New York's version of the Green New Deal and as part of that policy, New York will aim to remove processed meats including hotdogs from all city property including hospitals and schools.</p><p>Melissa Francis co-host \"After the Bell\" on Fox Business.  She joins us now.  Melissa, what the heck is going on?</p><p>MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS CO-HOST:  Yes, no and \"Outnumbered\" on Fox News Channel, don't forget, but yes there is a war on Hotdogs.  Mayor de Blasio has loved his last hotdog and now he feels like we don't need them any longer.  It's always a money grab when you look at these things.  That's what you have to understand and this is part of as you said, the Green New Deal.  We're going to do away with processed meats because you've heard about cows and animals and they're little bit gassy and we've got to get rid of them to have a livable planet.</p><p>So this is part of his plan where he's going to take away buildings with lots of windows, no one is going to drive and we're going to get rid of plastic and paper bags in spots, but if you look closely, these things are never bans.  What it really is, is you can do it for a price.</p><p>So for example, with the glass buildings, you can still do it if you want to do it.  You know, people who want to live in huge lovely towers, but he's going to charge you millions of dollars and it's the exact same thing with the bags.  It's the same thing with the congestion pricing, the problem is that taxes in New York are too high already and people are fleeing because we can't do the salt deduction any longer, so they came up $3.4 billion short due to personal income taxes from people who fled the state and didn't pay.  In a panic did they decide to spend less?  Oh no, Tammy Bruce, why would they do that?</p><p>No, they're going to dream up new ways to tax the rest of us and those few idiots like myself who are left here.  They're going to drive us out by taking away our hotdogs and taxing us for living in a house with windows.</p><p>BRUCE:  I live here as well, which means they're going to make --</p><p>FRANCIS:  Oh, I thought you are in California.</p><p>BRUCE:  It is going to look like -- I think \"The Post\" had him as Fred Flintstone.  We're going to have stone based homes and I would suggest maybe that maybe the mayor might have a Hotdog or two in the privacy of his own mansion.  It'd just be poor us who won't be able to eat the processed meats.  I mean, Spam -- people enjoy Spam and bologna.  Who doesn't like a bologna sandwich?  It's ridiculous.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I'm not a huge fan of bologna, but I love bacon.  I've never seen a strip of bacon that I didn't want to eat.  The irony is, is that he's supposed to be a man of the people, but what he's doing is he is depriving all these things to people who can't afford them.</p><p>BRUCE:  Correct.</p><p>FRANCIS:  And he's just putting them off to the side to the big real estate developers and saying you're going to have to pay few extra million dollars to have your glass windows.  If you want to drive in New York, you're going to have to pay more money and you're just hurting the people he claims he is for and it's all under the guise of A Green New Deal.  They make it about the environment.</p><p>BRUCE:  So it's an excuse.</p><p>FRANCIS:  But, it's just about money.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, it is -- it's always, you know, you never want to let a good crisis go to waste, right?  They're not going to solve any of the problems we have, but they're going to make regular people miserable as they get all the benefits.  All right, Melissa thank, you so much.  Great seeing you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You, too.  Have a hotdog.  I'm going to go have one right now while I can.</p><p>BRUCE:  Indeed.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Street meat in front of the box right now.</p><p>BRUCE:  Good, perfect.  All right, you guys, that's about it for us tonight.  It's great to be with you here.  Tune in each night at 8:00 p.m. to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.  Also, don't forget to DVR the show if you haven't already set that up.  Have a great night.  Sean Hannity is next.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2215214731</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYF-7TV1-JBHT-D12J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7917\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Anonymity offered.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. Joe Biden's campaign is demanding that Facebookmore proactively police its social network for misinformation and falsehoods in the runup to the 2020 US presidential election.;Facebook says no.On Thursday, Biden's campaign published an open letter on its website to Facebook and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg[2], asking it to \"proactively stem the tide of false information\" about elections and politics on its platform.The social network promptly responded \u2014 issuing a statement saying that \"we will protect political speech, even when we strongly disagree with it.\"The back-and-forth highlights just how intensely Facebook is now being attacked by both sides of the political aisle. </p><p>Trump and the Republican Party continue to peddle the unproven claim that Facebook (and other big tech companies) are deliberately censoring conservative voices online. (In fact, right-wing news outlets and public figures are routinely some of the most popular pages on Facebook[3].)Meanwhile, liberal-minded critics charge that Facebook routinely gives a pass to conservatives, in part by not fact-checking political advertising, allowing for lies to spread with impunity.Biden's open letter calls on Facebook to fact-check all political ads prior to running them in the two weeks leading up to election day, and to stop \"amplifying untrustworthy content.\" It's unclear what the Biden campaign means by \"untrustworthy,\" and Facebook already reduces the reach of content that has been fact-checked).\"Anything less will render Facebook a tool of misinformation that corrodes our democracy. Facebook has promised better. And American voters deserve better,\" the letter reads. \"Right now, we're less than 150 days to the election. The time for setting, testing, and implementing meaningful policy to protect our elections is running out.\"In Facebook's response, it drew a line between the attacks from Republicans and Democrats, and argued that regulation of political ads is a question for legislators, not Facebook, to decide. \"We live in a democracy, where the elected officials decide the rules around campaigns,\" it wrote.\"Two weeks ago the President of the United States issued an executive order directing Federal agencies to prevent social media sites from engaging in activities like fact-checking political statements. This week, the Democratic candidate for President started a petition calling on us to do the exact opposite. Just as they have done with broadcast networks \u2014 where the US government prohibits rejecting politicians' campaign ads \u2014 the people's elected representatives should set the rules, and we will follow them. There is an election coming in November and we will protect political speech, even when we strongly disagree with it.\"Contact Business Insider reporter Rob Price via encrypted messaging app Signal (+1 650-636-6268), encrypted email (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:robaeprice@protonmail.com\">robaeprice@protonmail.com</email> ), standard email (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:rprice@businessinsider.com\">rprice@businessinsider.com</email> ),Telegram/Wickr/WeChat (robaeprice), or Twitter DM (@robaeprice[4]).

The scammers took control[1] of several high profile Twitter accounts and got away with close to $120,000 worth of Bitcoin.Addressing his supporters, Biden tweeted[2]he does not have Bitcoin and would not ask anyone to send him any. He instead directed his followers to a website where they can donate in US Dollar.Responses to Biden's post were varied. </p><p>While some had shown support, some appeared to not have read the news about the Twitter hack. 'Your memory really is gone. You asked last night,' a Twitter usercommented[3] along with the picture of the tweet sent by hackers on Biden's account.Cryptocurrency analyst Nic Carterasked[4] everyone on the Crypto Twitter community to 'favorite' his reply so that it would become the top reply on Biden's tweet to drown out the regular political replies. Twitter user 'Croesus' said Biden supporting Bitcoincould be good for his campaign because the Bitcoin community would vote for the candidate who understands cryptocurrency.Apart from the tweet, Biden has not yet said anything about cryptocurrency or blockchain in any previous speeches or interviews. This is in contrast with President Donald Trump who publicly denounced[5] Bitcoin and asked[6] Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to clamp down on it.However, analysts are assured that Biden is aware of developments in technology and understands cybersecurity. In an interview with Coindesk[7] , Dr. Michael Carpenter, managing director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, said Biden would receive the Presidential Daily Briefing every day for eight years during his time as vice president. The Briefing is a top secret document given to the president that contained classified information from the U.S. Intelligence Community, produced by the director of national intelligence. Carpenter said many of the threats in the document are cyberthreats which the public does not see the full extent of.Other former candidates to the top posts in the United States had allowed Bitcoin donations to their campaign. Sen.Rand Paul,R-KY,accepted[8] Bitcoin donations in 2016. Former Democratic candidate Andrew Yang alsoaccepted[9] Bitcoin for his 2020 bid. While not entirely his initiative, fouryears ago, the super PAC 'Draft Biden 2016' began[10] accepting Bitcoin donations to support the candidacy of then-Vice President Biden, who, at the time, had not yet announced if he would be running for president. The super PAC limited the Bitcoin donations to just $100 per person in light of unclear regulations about Bitcoin in 2016. The group also required those who donate to reveal their identities through a form.Twitter recentlyrevealed[11] that the hackcompromised 45 accounts, eight of which [12]had their entire data downloaded. The company said it would not reveal the identity of the eight accounts and would only disclose it to the owners. Twitter added[13]none of the eight accounts were verified accounts.

Joe Biden isn't a fan of Facebook, and likely not a fan of fake campaign sites[1] that troll and garner more attention than his actual campaign. The Democratic front-runner told the New York Times during an 80-minute interview[2] that to him, the Facebook CEO is \"a real problem. </p><p>[...] He knows better.\"Biden alluded to the fact that Facebook, like other social giants and owners of big digital platforms don't want to take full editorial responsibilities and enforce a strict filter on what can be posted on them. In the case of Facebook, Zuckerberg says[3] he wants it to be a tool that gives the little guys a powerful voice, and as such he will prioritize free speech over policing content.This means that Facebook can find excuses that all stem from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which offers special protections for internet companies. However, Biden thinks Facebook is not just an internet company and that Section 230 should be revoked to make it easy to hold such companies responsible for \"propagating falsehoods they know to be false.\"Biden also advocates for setting similar privacy standards to those imposed by the EU. But his eyes are set on the 20-year-old Communications Decency Act, and Republicans have expressed similar criticisms[4] and proposed several changes to the law. Meanwhile, other political figures are proposing even more extreme measures against executives of companies that currently pay a relatively small price for their privacy violations and their inaction on misinformation campaigns. One notable example is the \"Mind Your Own Business[5]\" act proposed by Senator Ron Wyden, which could punish those like Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg directly.In any case, Biden is the only presidential candidate that has asked for Section 230 to be repealed. Last year, President Donald Trump said he had a \"constructive meeting[6]\" with Mark Zuckerberg about internet regulation and preventing the dissemination of harmful content, but only discussed those issues in more general lines.

Others approach power as pragmatists whose goal is to subtly shape the political and economic forces they inherit. Joe Biden is firmly in the second camp. He is a lifelong centrist whose most enduring economic belief is his admiration for hard-working Americans and who has shifted with the centre of gravity in his party. But Mr Biden's ability to go with the flow means that, at the moment, both the left and the right are anxious about the prospect of Bidenomics. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Indeed, if Mr Biden wins the election in November and enters the Oval Office in January 2021 he will confront an extraordinary set of circumstances that will put a huge amount of pressure on him. The economy is clawing its way back from the sharpest slump in living memory following covid-19. The legacy of the pandemic will include millions of long-term unemployed, public debts that will soon exceed their all-time high of 106% of GDP, more bankruptcies and accelerated digital disruption in many industries. </p><p>At the same time Mr Biden will head up a party that has indeed shifted more to the left and that has a more radical wing that, while not dominant, is influential and thinks America's economic model is broken and that the answer is a vastly bigger state. Combined with this, the public is bitterly divided and many people are wary of globalisation. Under President Donald Trump, America's standing in the world has slumped. </p><p>Because of this chaotic backdrop and Mr Biden's own lack of a fixed economic doctrine, the range of outcomes attributed to a Biden presidency is bewildering and not always benign. To some Republicans on Wall Street and in boardrooms he would enable a hostile takeover by the radical left. \"The country is running the risk of structural changes under the guise of social justice which would take the US into a place where it won't know how to function,\" claims one. To the left Mr Biden is a timid figure whose moderation means he would be crushed by an obstructive Congress and conservative courts. </p><p>Neither view is especially convincing once you consider Mr Biden's goals. He says he will seek to tilt the balance of American capitalism in favour of workers, not the rich. He will offer competent administration; he is no fan of social experiments or trampling on institutions. His priority would be a stimulus bill to revive growth, though he is likely to pull America somewhat further to the left than either of his Democratic predecessors, Barack Obama or Bill Clinton (see chart 1 on next page). He would leave the economy greener, with a more active industrial policy, somewhat higher public spending and borders open to skilled migrants. He would not reverse America's new protectionism, nor does he have a plan to resolve the country's long-term fiscal problems.</p><p>Mr Biden's long career does not exactly suggest much enthusiasm for economics. During his 36 years in the Senate his main passions were the justice system and foreign policy. By instinct he is an admirer of the middle-class more than the country's glittering plutocratic elite or its downtrodden. He grew up in, and later represented, Delaware, a diminutive state which relies on big business to make its crust. Over two-thirds of Fortune 500 firms are legally registered there thanks to its shareholder-friendly laws and tax rules. The Diamond State is home to the headquarters of some icons of 20th-century industry, including DuPont, some of whose workers lived in the suburb Mr Biden spent his teens in. His exposure to such folk may help explain his fondness for manufacturing and a more paternalistic capitalism. </p><p>As vice-president in 2009-17 Mr Biden helped implement the stimulus package of 2009 and strike budget deals. But his strength was as a negotiator with Congress, not as a visionary. Allies from his Senate and White House years make up a big share of his advisers and entourage now, with additional advice coming from centre-left economists such as Jared Bernstein, Heather Boushey and Ben Harris. Unlike Mr Obama, he has not appointed a dominant economic figure to his team so far.</p><p>As a result, in order to understand where a Biden presidency might take the economy it is necessary to consider the three external forces that he will have to deal with, each of which could in theory push him down a more radical path. The first is the covid-19-induced recession. America has bounced back faster than was originally feared. GDP is now expected to shrink by 4% this year; at one point a decline of 7% had seemed likely. But the recovery could stumble, not least because Congress has so far failed to agree on a further stimulus bill. </p><p>What is already clear, however, is that the slump has hit the poor worst, amplifying inequality. Many business figures warn of a surge in defaults among small firms which have found it hard to secure government help: less than 1% of the misfiring $600bn Main Street lending scheme backed by the Federal Reserve and Treasury has been dispersed. State and local governments face a funding crunch. The disruption is not simply a matter of a temporary downturn. Whole industries, including travel and retail, will be transformed. </p><p>And the normal laws of economics have been upended. Interest rates are at rock-bottom levels, making borrowing almost free for now. America will run a fiscal deficit of 16% of GDP this year. Asset prices, meanwhile, are sky-high with the stockmarket at its most expensive level since the dotcom bubble of 2000, based on its ratio of price to cyclically adjusted profits.</p><p>As he grapples with this topsy-turvy economy, Mr Biden will have to deal with a second force in the form of the left wing of his party. Over a third of voters in the Democratic primaries supported Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, whose plans involved a giant expansion in annual government spending. Since then Mr Biden has skillfully flattered the more radical left while ignoring their more ambitious proposals, such as nationalised health care and the \"Green New Deal\", a package promoted by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a congresswomen, among others, which includes a guaranteed job for all. In July a joint Biden-Sanders task force agreed on watered-down policy recommendations. Some of these Mr Biden then further diluted into his own proposals. Even so, the left will still demand jobs in any administration. And the centre of the party remains to the left of public opinion. Opinion polls suggest the typical American is more worried about climate change and China than they used to be, and more relaxed about government borrowing (see chart 2). But 87% of them still believe in free enterprise. </p><p>The final external force Mr Biden would face is Congress. The Economist's election model gives the Democrats a 98% chance of holding control of the House of Representatives and 69% chance of winning the Senate, with any swing bringing new moderate Democrats in. Assuming the normal rules are in play the Senate will limit what can be done. If Mr Biden's party ends up with between 50 and 59 seats and sticks to normal Senate protocol over the use of the filibuster, it will only be able to get through tax and spending legislation that either has bipartisan support or can be passed using a process known as reconciliation. This typically limits the number of bills to three a year (one each on spending, tax and debt-limits), does not permit changes to social security and normally requires that the impact on the deficit is neutral within ten years, either because the spending measures expire or are balanced by tax rises. But the Democrats could ditch procedural rules over the filibuster so that they can pass major bills with only 50 votes (plus one from the vice-president who can cast a deciding vote). This might also allow them to pursue other goals including expanding the number of Supreme Court judges.</p><p>Faced with these external influences, what would Mr Biden do? He would have three main ways to exercise power: through legislation, job appointments and executive action including regulation. Start with legislation, where Mr Biden has proposals that would raise spending by $7trn over a decade. Congress will almost certainly act as a constraint on this. The Democratic Party's centre of gravity in the House is still centrist: the largest caucus, with over 100 members, is the moderate New Democrat Coalition. Most new seats won would probably be occupied by moderates, and they also hold key jobs, including the head of the Ways and Means committee, which controls tax legislation. </p><p>In the Senate, meanwhile, even if the Democrats won a big enough majority to try to ditch the filibuster, which is unlikely (a rough yardstick is they would need 55 seats), Mr Biden might well resist: his affection for the institution is such that he kept a Senate gym locker when he was vice-president, and any change in the filibuster rules would be a dramatic constitutional escalation in the war between the two parties. Any Democratic swing will see moderates win seats. </p><p>All this means Mr Biden will have to compromise and might only get two big priorities passed through Congress. That suggests that any increase in the size of the state would be limited. Ms Warren and Mr Sanders proposed spending increases equivalent to 16-23% of GDP, taking it towards Swedish levels seen in the 1970s. Mr Biden's formal proposals amount to just a 3% increase and in all probability he might get only half of that passed: so a spending increase of $3trn-4trn over ten years, worth 1-2% of GDP. </p><p>The burning priority will be a jumbo \"recovery\" bill of perhaps $2trn-3trn aimed at revving up the economy and meeting a key strategic priority, more green-tinged infrastructure spending (see chart 3 on next page). The latter could command some Republican support because it creates jobs, while also pleasing Mr Biden's more climate-aware base. Short-term stimulus measures may include cash for state and local governments, a boost to unemployment benefits, a rise in the minimum wage to $15 an hour and further support for small companies. </p><p>The green infrastructure element might include upgrades to electricity grids and charging stations for electric cars. In order to cut emissions Mr Biden's plan aims for power generation to be carbon neutral by the mid-2030s. He is keen to spend tens of billions of dollars a year on research and development into renewable-energy technologies and other areas such as 5G, with the aim of establishing an American edge to rival China's. </p><p>If the jumbo recovery bill goes well, there may be room for a Biden administration to pursue one other big legislative priority. One possibility is immigration reform. Another candidate is boosting middle-class social mobility, where Mr Biden proposes universal pre-school education, tax-credits for child care and free public-university education for families earning less than $125,000 a year. In total spending on an ambitious social-mobility agenda might amount to another $1trn over a decade.</p><p>Congress has only limited capacity so Mr Biden will also need to decide what not to do. He does not seem to have a burning appetite to reinvent Obamacare, which was not his first priority when vice-president (although like most politicians he wants to push down drug prices). He will have to hope that the Supreme Court does not force his hand: on November 10th it will begin considering the legality of Obamacare, which could unwind a system millions of people use. Were this to happen Mr Biden might be forced to try to legislate for a replacement. A push to modernise America's decrepit antitrust apparatus, meanwhile, is on the backburner. Without new legislation, it will be hard to do much about the rising concentration of business or the big tech monopolies, given the courts are reluctant to take action. Kamala Harris, Mr Biden's running-mate, was friendly towards tech as California's attorney-general in 2011-17.</p><p>Mr Biden's proposals suggest that roughly half of his spending might be covered by tax rises. Once again the formal plan points to tax hikes of $4trn, but as with spending, in reality a figure half that size or less, of $1.5trn-2trn, is more likely. Big changes to social-security levies are probably off the cards since they are not eligible for the reconciliation process in the Senate. Many Democrats in Congress are wary of raising capital-gains tax too high. So business-tax rises will do much of the work with a partial reversal of the 2017 Trump tax cuts. </p><p>Mr Biden would raise the headline rate on corporate income from 21% to up to 28%, levy minimum taxes on foreign earnings and remove tax perks for real-estate and private-equity firms. Individuals earning more than $400,000 would see the top band of income tax rise to up to 39.6%, and those earning more than $1m might have to pay a capital-gains rate that is nearer the one they pay on their income.</p><p>A second way Mr Biden could influence the economy, and give licence to his party's more radical impulses, is through job appointments. Yet it seems unlikely that he will appoint Ms Warren as treasury secretary, or even attorney-general. That would send an alarming signal to the business community when the economy is fragile. It would also trigger a special election to fill her Senate seat in Massachusetts. Instead the front-runners to become treasury secretary are centrists. They include Lael Brainard, a centre-left member of the Federal Reserve Board; Jeff Zients, a co-head of Mr Biden's transition team; Sylvia Mathews Burwell, a former Obama official and Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former Fed governor and treasury official. If a business figure is needed then Ruth Porat, the finance chief of Alphabet, a tech giant, is also thought to be a contender. </p><p>Based on Mr Biden's own experience as vice-president, in which he acted as a key counsellor to Mr Obama, Ms Harris would have an important voice in his administration. She sits to the left of him on tax and spending, although she is within the mainstream. And having rejected its signature policies and outmanoeuvred its star figures, Mr Biden might try to placate the left of his party by giving it lots of jobs in the regulatory apparatus where they would emit a cacophony of left-sounding signals.</p><p>The final tool Mr Biden has to get his way is executive orders, which Mr Trump and Mr Obama both used. Yet here, too, Mr Biden will be restricted by the courts which have become substantially more conservative than they were in the Obama era. Mr Biden would try to use this power to reverse some of Mr Trump's own executive orders. Top of this list is probably the ban on some migrants and the president's clampdown on refugees and undocumented workers that has intensified this year. The rules for visas for skilled workers would be eased. Yet despite his support for immigration, his stance on protectionism is more ambiguous, and here the president has sway and discretion. Mr Biden has been a free trader in the past and would certainly be politer to China than Mr Trump has been. He would rally America's allies to put in place a co-ordinated response to deal with China's economic model under Xi Jinping in which even notionally private Chinese firms are often acting under the strategic direction of the Communist Party.</p><p>But he will only go so far. This reflects a shift in public opinion. According to the Pew Research Centre, fully 73% of Americans now have an unfavourable view of China, a new high. Mr Biden would not quickly withdraw the tariffs that are now in place (the average tariff on goods imported from China is about 19%). While he has been critical of the Trump administration's botched effort to rein in TikTok, a Chinese social-media app, he would probably stick with the embargo on Huawei and be wary of high-tech trade with China. </p><p>Similarly, new trade deals will not be a priority even though Mr Biden supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership and USMCA, the revised US-Mexico-Canada deal passed in 2020. (Ms Harris was opposed to both.) Mr Biden's industrial strategy is laced with soft protectionism, including promises to bring supply chains back to home, adopt a \"buy American\" government-procurement policy, tighten rules on the labelling of products, use American steel for transport projects and singing the praises of the Jones Act which requires that only American-flagged ships carry goods between domestic ports. </p><p>A Biden presidency therefore promises moderately higher taxes and more spending, especially on green infrastructure, more industrial policy and not much change to trade policy. Who would benefit? In terms of individuals his policies are aimed squarely at the middle classes and lower paid who would benefit from a raft of measures such as cheaper education, perks to get on the housing ladder and a higher minimum wage. Mr Biden's tax rises are squarely levied on the richest Americans: if fully enacted they would mean the income of the top 1% of earners would drop by 14%, and the income of the top 0.1% by 18%, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. In reality these proposals will not be passed in their entirety. Either way, the impact of the tax changes on the 99% would be minimal (see chart 4).</p><p>What about business? Which firms would gain and which would suffer? One estimate suggests corporate profits would fall by about 12% because of the tax rises. Investors have already begun to discount this and to bid up the shares of renewable-energy firms and construction and infrastructure companies which might benefit from a Biden presidency. The shares of fossil-fuel energy firms which might suffer under a Biden presidency have dropped. Tech stocks have soared this year even as the odds of a Biden win have risen, suggesting investors don't worry about antitrust action against Silicon Valley. The stockmarket has risen by 4.5% this year despite the recession; hardly a sign of an imminent lurch towards big-state socialism.</p><p>Even so, there would be risks to the economy from a Biden presidency. One is that he loses control of the party and there is a lurch even further to the left, spooking the business world. Were the Democrats to abandon the Senate filibuster, a path might be open to an expansion in the size of the Supreme Court or, some bosses fear, more radical legislation. But Mr Biden would probably resist this.</p><p>More likely is that a regulatory apparatus stuffed with left-wing appointees ends up damaging his relationship with business. Many of the Trump administration's most reckless regulatory decisions, for example its push since 2017 to stop the Environmental Protection Agency from limiting the use of coal, need to be reversed. The danger is that new rules are churned out in unco-ordinated fashion on unions, inequality and the like, accompanied by volleys of confrontational rhetoric. Democrats tend to think that business is just crying wolf. But small firms consistently complain about regulation, and badly designed rules after the financial crisis of 2008-09 helped cause serious problems in the mortgage market.</p><p>The second danger is fading dynamism. Some of Mr Biden's agenda, including infrastructure and more research and development, will boost America's long-term competitiveness. But a lack of antitrust policy and more red tape could continue to give too much power to large, incumbent companies, which have seen their market share rise in two-thirds of industries over the past two decades, creating oligopolies in industries from mobile telecoms to credit cards. The undercurrent of protectionism in Mr Biden's plans could insulate the economy from competition abroad, sapping its vitality. Ultimately there exists a tension between Mr Biden's desire to build new infrastructure quickly and cheaply and his plan to favour domestic workers and supply chains, that is likely to become far more acute over time. </p><p>The final risk is America's long-term fiscal position (see chart 5). Even after the covid-19 stimulus fades, and before any deficit-widening steps that the next president makes, America's deficit was projected to soar above 5% of GDP in perpetuity, with public debt reaching about 200% of GDP by 2050. Today the Federal Reserve is buying much of the net new debt issuance by the government, as fiscal and monetary policy begin to merge. </p><p>For now this strange new fiscal regime seems sustainable. But over time the risk of the politicisation of the Fed will increase. And the economy and financial system will become vulnerable to any eventual rise in inflation. A debate over these risks looks likely to occur when the first term of Jay Powell, the Fed's chairman, finishes in early 2022. But so far Mr Biden has no major plan for redesigning the macroeconomic architecture or for getting America's long-term finances on a stable footing.</p><p>Mr Biden, a life-long pragmatist, looks likely to govern as one. Stylistically that means getting sensible advice, behaving consistently and working with America's institutions. While he may lack a formal economic doctrine, his goal will be to get the economy out of its covid-19 slump, improve social mobility and build a better safety net. He will place his biggest bet on giving a long-term boost in infrastructure and climate policy, and then try to moderate the wilder forces swirling around America's electorate and polity, including the more socialist ideas of the hard left, chauvinistic protectionism and the indifference of the right towards America's social fabric. The claim that a Biden presidency would destroy American capitalism is silly. If he can restore competent management and make the economy work better for ordinary people Mr Biden's last job in politics will be done. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-OS8PU1O</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YS-DVG1-DY2R-2013-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3650\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

You know, if you look at all the history of technology evolution, it's really about the people, the creativity, the brains behind it, and the venture money. And so, I'm, you know, I don't see that being monopolistic in any way that we should reform.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  John, how does some of these business models that are incredibly profitable, is this adds model just dependent on personal data? Do you see that model being threatened with the events of the last year?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHEN</emphasis>:  Yes. I think you've a little too far, that's my personal opinion. You know, at BlackBerry we don't monetize data. And, you know, certainly not against, you know, the customer who provided the data. So that I believe that needs to be looked at.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  In the epicenter, your company, John, is data security. And I just wonder whether you can see your company being a solution to what is quickly being identified as a problem?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHEN</emphasis>:  You know, depending on how the regulation moves, I believe there's a good praise for a company like ourselves, whose number one mission is provide a privacy of our customers and not to monetize their data. So I believe that we serve a good purpose.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Where does opportunities right now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHEN</emphasis>:  I'm sorry, say it again?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Where does opportunities right now to do that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHEN</emphasis>:  Well, opportunities obviously with, you know, industries, we participated in governments, with the regulator industry, the banking and the financial industries, and health care. And, you know, there's a lot of opportunities there to protect the privacy of our customers, of their customers, and do cybersecure their environment.  </p><p>      And we did -- you know, I know we're going to get to that other side of the equation, you know, this is what we did for or what we are attempting to do with JaguarLand Rover. And, you know, it's a great partnership on security.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Well, that's what we're going to talk about right now, that new relationship. And I just wonder how you balance that use of technology with the balance of making sure people's private data is actually (inaudible), is private?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHEN</emphasis>:  Yes. Well, we have one very simple mandate. You know, we protect the privacy of our customers and their customers. So there is no real debate in our company about, should we monetize this, should we not, and all of that.  </p><p>      So -- I so that's not a really good debate for me because, you know, we set out site in making sure (in someone secure and data private. And we've been truthful to that mission for the last 30 years.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  John, looking at your recent pay package, you get a recent bump and the stocks hit $30. Now, with some distance from $30, it's quite a big jump. And to some people, it's just an indication that actually, John, what you need to do is clean up the company and get it. And get it sold and then you get the $30. What you say back to that, John?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHEN</emphasis>:  Well, that's not my mission. And it could be that outcome down the road. And it's really, you know, the shareholder has to do with that. But I'm not. I never got into a company -- look at my track records. I never got into a company whose number one mandate is to sell the company.  </p><p>      I always go to the company and created value. And this value was being recognized by others in the industry, and they are willing to pay my shareholder a big bunch of money. And, of course, we as, you know, have the fiduciary responsibility to take it seriously.  </p><p>      But my mission in life everyday is to create value for companies. You know, like building the views we talked about, having a strategy that, you know, we talk about earlier, and that's the only thing that that I focus on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  John, was that a takeover, I'm wondering how you get up to $30? Get me to $30 with the deals that you've done with Microsoft, with the deals that you with JaguarLand Rover? How do you get there?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHEN</emphasis>:  Oh, you get there by growing revenue in a relevant area. I mean, we are securing IOT endpoints business and that business is huge. I mean, it will be huge, and literally tens and billions of endpoints being connected. And we could create services and good software around it, and people embed it and use it. You never know.  </p><p>      I mean, you know, one day, maybe one of your TV is powered by BlackBerry or at least secured by BlackBerry. You know, we won't let your voice recognition for example be tapped by other people. And so, I think there's a lot of opportunities and that, you know, but that of course remain to be seen.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Hey, John, it's great to catch up with you. John Chen, the BlackBerry Chairman and CEO on the latest deal between BlackBerry and JaguarLand Rover.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RY2-8DD1-JDPT-T182-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

John, it's great to catch up with you. As always, the news dictates where we start and we will get to that agreement very briefly in a moment. But I want to begin with technology and big tech in Silicon Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are some calls that big tech should be broken up. And, John, as someone on the industry, I want you to weigh in on that debate. Should big tech broken up?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOHN CHEN, CEO, BLACKBERRY: No, I don't believe so, because there are -- as you can probably tell, you know, 10 years ago, the name of big tech and the 10 years of today, the name big techs are quite different. So, you know, technology has a way to the market, has a way to reinvent itself. And so, I'm not a big proponent of breaking up.</p><p>FERRO: Well, John, to reinvent itself you need innovation. And I'm wondering whether these big technology firms foster innovation across the competition, what's your view on that, John?</p><p>CHEN: No, it can really. You know, this is the great thing about, you know, technology markets. I remember when Google first started out Yahoo! was dominant. When Yahoo! first started, Netscape was dominant. You know, if you look at all the history of technology evolution, it's really about the people, the creativity, the brains behind it, and the venture money. And so, I'm, you know, I don't see that being monopolistic in any way that we should reform.</p><p>FERRO: John, how does some of these business models that are incredibly profitable, is this adds model just dependent on personal data? Do you see that model being threatened with the events of the last year?</p><p>CHEN: Yes. I think you've a little too far, that's my personal opinion. You know, at BlackBerry we don't monetize data. And, you know, certainly not against, you know, the customer who provided the data. So that I believe that needs to be looked at.</p><p>FERRO: In the epicenter, your company, John, is data security. And I just wonder whether you can see your company being a solution to what is quickly being identified as a problem?</p><p>CHEN: You know, depending on how the regulation moves, I believe there's a good praise for a company like ourselves, whose number one mission is provide a privacy of our customers and not to monetize their data. So I believe that we serve a good purpose.</p><p>FERRO: Where does opportunities right now?</p><p>CHEN: I'm sorry, say it again?</p><p>FERRO: Where does opportunities right now to do that?</p><p>CHEN: Well, opportunities obviously with, you know, industries, we participated in governments, with the regulator industry, the banking and the financial industries, and health care. And, you know, there's a lot of opportunities there to protect the privacy of our customers, of their customers, and do cybersecure their environment.</p><p>And we did -- you know, I know we're going to get to that other side of the equation, you know, this is what we did for or what we are attempting to do with Jaguar Land Rover. And, you know, it's a great partnership on security.</p><p>FERRO: Well, that's what we're going to talk about right now, that new relationship. And I just wonder how you balance that use of technology with the balance of making sure people's private data is actually (inaudible), is private?</p><p>CHEN: Yes. Well, we have one very simple mandate. You know, we protect the privacy of our customers and their customers. So there is no real debate in our company about, should we monetize this, should we not, and all of that.</p><p>So -- I so that's not a really good debate for me because, you know, we set out site in making sure (in someone secure and data private. And we've been truthful to that mission for the last 30 years.</p><p>FERRO: John, looking at your recent pay package, you get a recent bump and the stocks hit $30. Now, with some distance from $30, it's quite a big jump. And to some people, it's just an indication that actually, John, what you need to do is clean up the company and get it. And get it sold and then you get the $30. What you say back to that, John?</p><p>CHEN: Well, that's not my mission. And it could be that outcome down the road. And it's really, you know, the shareholder has to do with that. But I'm not. I never got into a company -- look at my track records. I never got into a company whose number one mandate is to sell the company.</p><p>I always go to the company and created value. And this value was being recognized by others in the industry, and they are willing to pay my shareholder a big bunch of money. And, of course, we as, you know, have the fiduciary responsibility to take it seriously.</p><p>But my mission in life everyday is to create value for companies. You know, like building the views we talked about, having a strategy that, you know, we talk about earlier, and that's the only thing that that I focus on.</p><p>FERRO: John, was that a takeover, I'm wondering how you get up to $30? Get me to $30 with the deals that you've done with Microsoft, with the deals that you with Jaguar Land Rover? How do you get there?</p><p>CHEN: Oh, you get there by growing revenue in a relevant area. I mean, we are securing IOT endpoints business and that business is huge. I mean, it will be huge, and literally tens and billions of endpoints being connected. And we could create services and good software around it, and people embed it and use it. You never know.</p><p>I mean, you know, one day, maybe one of your TV is powered by BlackBerry or at least secured by BlackBerry. You know, we won't let your voice recognition for example be tapped by other people. And so, I think there's a lot of opportunities and that, you know, but that of course remain to be seen.</p><p>FERRO: Hey, John, it's great to catch up with you. John Chen, the BlackBerry Chairman and CEO on the latest deal between BlackBerry and Jaguar Land Rover.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

John, it's great to catch up with you.  As always, the  news dictates where we start and we will get to that agreement very briefly  in a moment.  But I want to begin with technology and big tech in Silicon  Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are some calls that big tech should be broken up.  And, John, as  someone on the industry, I want you to weigh in on that debate.  Should big  tech broken up?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOHN CHEN, CEO, BLACKBERRY:  No, I don't believe so, because there are --  as you can probably tell, you know, 10 years ago, the name of big tech and  the 10 years of today, the name big techs are quite different.  So, you  know, technology has a way to the market, has a way to reinvent itself.   And so, I'm not a big proponent of breaking up.</p><p>FERRO:  Well, John, to reinvent itself you need innovation.  And I'm  wondering whether these big technology firms foster innovation across the  competition, what's your view on that, John?</p><p>CHEN:  No, it can really.  You know, this is the great thing about, you  know, technology markets.  I remember when Google first started out Yahoo!  was dominant.  When Yahoo! first started, Netscape was dominant.  You know,  if you look at all the history of technology evolution, it's really about  the people, the creativity, the brains behind it, and the venture money.   And so, I'm, you know, I don't see that being monopolistic in any way that  we should reform.</p><p>FERRO:  John, how does some of these business models that are incredibly  profitable, is this adds model just dependent on personal data?  Do you see  that model being threatened with the events of the last year?</p><p>CHEN:  Yes.  I think you've a little too far, that's my personal opinion.   You know, at BlackBerry we don't monetize data.  And, you know, certainly  not against, you know, the customer who provided the data.  So that I  believe that needs to be looked at.</p><p>FERRO:  In the epicenter, your company, John, is data security.  And I just  wonder whether you can see your company being a solution to what is quickly  being identified as a problem?</p><p>CHEN:  You know, depending on how the regulation moves, I believe there's a  good praise for a company like ourselves, whose number one mission is  provide a privacy of our customers and not to monetize their data.  So I  believe that we serve a good purpose.</p><p>FERRO:  Where does opportunities right now?</p><p>CHEN:  I'm sorry, say it again?</p><p>FERRO:  Where does opportunities right now to do that?</p><p>CHEN:  Well, opportunities obviously with, you know, industries, we  participated in governments, with the regulator industry, the banking and  the financial industries, and health care.  And, you know, there's a lot of  opportunities there to protect the privacy of our customers, of their  customers, and do cybersecure their environment.</p><p>And we did -- you know, I know we're going to get to that other side of the  equation, you know, this is what we did for or what we are attempting to do  with JaguarLand Rover.  And, you know, it's a great partnership on  security.</p><p>FERRO:  Well, that's what we're going to talk about right now, that new  relationship.  And I just wonder how you balance that use of technology  with the balance of making sure people's private data is actually  (inaudible), is private?</p><p>CHEN:  Yes.  Well, we have one very simple mandate.  You know, we protect  the privacy of our customers and their customers.  So there is no real  debate in our company about, should we monetize this, should we not, and  all of that.</p><p>So -- I so that's not a really good debate for me because, you know, we set  out site in making sure (in someone secure and data private.  And we've  been truthful to that mission for the last 30 years.</p><p>FERRO:  John, looking at your recent pay package, you get a recent bump and  the stocks hit $30.  Now, with some distance from $30, it's quite a big  jump.  And to some people, it's just an indication that actually, John,  what you need to do is clean up the company and get it.  And get it sold  and then you get the $30.  What you say back to that, John?</p><p>CHEN:  Well, that's not my mission.  And it could be that outcome down the  road.  And it's really, you know, the shareholder has to do with that.  But  I'm not.  I never got into a company -- look at my track records.  I never  got into a company whose number one mandate is to sell the company.</p><p>I always go to the company and created value.  And this value was being  recognized by others in the industry, and they are willing to pay my  shareholder a big bunch of money. And, of course, we as, you know, have the  fiduciary responsibility to take it seriously.</p><p>But my mission in life everyday is to create value for companies.  You  know, like building the views we talked about, having a strategy that, you  know, we talk about earlier, and that's the only thing that that I focus  on.</p><p>FERRO:  John, was that a takeover, I'm wondering how you get up to $30?   Get me to $30 with the deals that you've done with Microsoft, with the  deals that you with JaguarLand Rover?   How do you get there?</p><p>CHEN:  Oh, you get there by growing revenue in a relevant area.  I mean, we  are securing IOT endpoints business and that business is huge.  I mean, it  will be huge, and literally tens and billions of endpoints being connected.   And we could create services and good software around it, and people embed  it and use it.  You never know.</p><p>I mean, you know, one day, maybe one of your TV is powered by BlackBerry or  at least secured by BlackBerry.  You know, we won't let your voice  recognition for example be tapped by other people.  And so, I think there's  a lot of opportunities and that, you know, but that of course remain to be  seen.</p><p>FERRO:  Hey, John, it's great to catch up with you.  John Chen, the  BlackBerry Chairman and CEO on the latest deal between BlackBerry and  JaguarLand Rover.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

But investor confidence is slowly returning, just look at the stock performance of Facebook, Google and Amazon in the last month, and one thing all three have in common, they saw early interest from longtime investors, John Doerr. He starts at Intel in 1974, he has worn the hats of engineer, venture capitalist and most recently chair of Kleiner Perkins.  </p><p>      The ventures he has backed have created hundreds of thousands of jobs and become three of the wold's most viable companies. And now he has written a book about the goal sitting techniques that have help tech giants like Google and Intel tribe. It is called \"Measure What Matters:  How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs.\" He joins me now here in the studio.  </p><p>      John, welcome.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  OKRs, Objectives and Key Results, this is a slideshow presentation you've been doing for many, many years, companies talk about it all the time like it's their religion. It is about setting objectives and key results. Ideas don't matter so much as execution.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  Executions, everything.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  What is so radical about this idea?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  Well, it is not practice in almost every company and what I mean by that is take one feature, just the notion that everybody in an organization would write down their goals and publish them and share them transparently, that's radical in most businesses or nonprofits. And that's just one of five things that set it apart.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  And you say that it's not just goals being set at the top, but employees sitting their own goal, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  Everyone transparently, top to bottom. So, when Larry and Sergey Google were 24 years old, I took them in this goal setting system. And I'd like to tell you that Sergey said, yes, John, we'll enthusiastically adopt this. The truth is, he said, we don't have any better way to manage the company's. So we'll give this one a try.  </p><p>      And Emily, every quarter since then, every Googler has written down her results and key results, publish them internally, graded them and then toss them aside because they don't count for bonuses, they don't count for promotions. They serve a higher purpose, a kind of collective calling and commitment to getting people focus in the line and tracking on stretching for the things that really matter the most.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So you've presented this to Google, where you had just place your biggest butt of all time in 1999 $11.8 million for 12 percent of the company. And Larry Page who (ph) at the forward to your book and he called it a gift. So, I'm curious what would OKRs be for Google today? They are grappling with artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, fake news. There's a lot of change that's happening in the last two decades.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  Well, they have a very clear and crypt side of OKRs. And if I told you what they were, I'd be leaking. So, but everyone has them and this quarter, Sundar will stand up in front of 70,000 employees on a web cast and say these are our Googles objectives and key results and here are mine personally. And they won't get them all done. They'll maybe achieve 70 percent of them and that's considered a great, great.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Now, one of the things you say about ORK is they're not a silver bullet. They don't take the place of values or culture.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  Or strong management.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Exactly. And so --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  Can't substitute for those.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  How -- the book is called Measure What Matters, how do you measure something so intangible culture?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  Well, culture answers the question why. Objectives answer the question what, key results answer the question how. Your question to me was how do you measure culture? In fact, you do culture survey. You drop a definition of what your culture is and you periodically pulls your organization to say, do you feel we're not just saying but living up to these values with a transparency or aggressiveness or accountability. And I've seen this Emily, there's no one right culture. Every organization has its own and different ones can succeed in different ways.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So, I want to ask you about Facebook and I know you're on the board of Google so you can't say so much about Google but you can opine about Facebook and incliner was an early investor. We've seen Facebook go through election meddling, also fake news problems, data privacy issues, data being mishandled. What would your ORKs be for Facebook? Or what would you recommend that they do in this situation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  Well, it's a little hard being outside the organization to be prescriptive about that. So forgive me for saying that, but I think this is an incredibly well-run company with really good people in it. And I would expect that there are internal goals, I have no way of knowing this, to achieve a certain measure of growth and engagement together with, paired with, a measure of trust and user satisfaction. And the book talks about the importance of pairing goals.  </p><p>      You go all the way back to Lee Lacocca and the Pinto he had with an iron fist, goals to make the least expensive car he could. And the failure was, he didn't pair that with the goal in and around quality. So, for one of a part that cost less than a buck when someone ran into the back of a Pinto, the gas tank exploded, 100 people died, one of the largest recalls I ever had.  </p><p>      So, if you just let your goals be one-dimensional, you're going to miss the mark.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  You went to the White House, you met with President Trump. This as, you know, questions of tech regulation are looming, a potential trade war, what are your biggest concerns about sort of the economic and business consequences of this administration?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  So, I'm a red-blooded patriotic capitalist who believes in free markets, but also in putting a safety net in our economy. And I believe technology fundamentally advantages the rich, not the poor, and education is the counter bailing force that provides for upward mobility.  </p><p>      I've said then, I believe now that we should invest more in research and development, a lot more across the board that we should take data which has been bottled up and siloed and liberated, especially in the health care system. And this administration is moving very smartly on that front.  </p><p>      I'm a believer in free trade. I have differences with the administration on that, but I think this is a really good time for entrepreneurs to start new companies and to be working in the field of technology.  </p><p>      I do hold maybe the debatable view that every company, either is there is going to become a tech company. That you can't really compete in the new connected world without understanding what artificial intelligence or machine learning can mean to the products and services you offer your customers.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  What is your view on artificial intelligence? Elon Musk has said it's apocalyptic. We were just talking about that, it could be --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  It'll turn us all in the house pets.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Absolutely. I mean, that is certainly one view, could it get that dark?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  I don't think so. But I want to put it in context. It seems every dozen years or so there is Tsunami like transformation to the innovation economy. Starting in 1980, it was the microchip in the P.C. right. That takes us forward to about one dozen years, '93, '94, the next big wave was the web browser.  </p><p>      Remember Mosaic and that's keep (ph) on all those internet companies including all the way up to and through Google. Then in 2006, Steve jobs introduced the iPhone. And at the same time, the cloud came along. So, that was the third great wave to right about today.  </p><p>      So, fair question is what is it now John? And I think this field has been overhyped, but now I think it's underappreciated, and that field is artificial intelligence. Its programs that learn as they go along, its deep reinforcement learning, neural networks that mimic in some ways the ways humans think. And the effects of this are going to be profound. We can't have self-driving cars without artificial intelligence.  </p><p>      What we can do with health care is incredibly exciting to me. Right now, you can take an image of a retina and not only predict the likelihood that that person will develop diabetes, but also the likelihood of hard incident in advance and you can apply artificial intelligence today to all kinds of imaging in health care and get better diagnosis that humans can give. We're just getting started.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  As our lives become more tech infused, do you worry about tech addiction or the negative impact of technology? I mean Chamath Palihapitiya who worked at Facebook for a long time has talked about the guilt he feels and how he believes it -- Facebook could be destroying the very fabric of our society.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  Yes. But good parenting can deal with this handedly. When my girls were growing up, I had a personal objective to have a healthy family and a key result that's --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Right. And OKRs can be applied to family life as you talk about in the book.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  In fact, before we end I want to talk about that. But my key result was to get home from dinner 20 nights a month by 6:00 p.m., and the period quality result was to be fully present.  </p><p>      So, I pulled the plug on the router. Nobody could get anything on the internet. And, you know, I got that it was hard. I got it done maybe 70 percent of the time which was a pretty good grade.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So, you're not worried?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  No.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  About the negative potential of all of these amazing things that are -- that you've done.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  Not when there's at least one and preferably two diligent parents in a household. I do think we want to be concerned about the families and kids or that's not the case.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Let's talk about leadership, you know, I mentioned Elon Musk, he's obviously going through production issues at Tesla. There was just an analyst call where he referred to questions as boring and bone headed. He's got another company, SpaceX. Id t know, what would you recommend to a leader in that position running two really companies that are really pushing the limits of technology?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  Well, the same thing I recommend to others disruptive entrepreneurs. I mean make sure you have a strategic focus on a large unserved market need. Bring to it a proprietary technology and a commitment to assemble an outstanding management team, raise of reasonable amount of money. You can raise too much money as well as too little. Above all, never lose your sense of urgency which allows Tesla to move far faster than the rest of the automotive players. And I recommend you use objectives and key results.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  All right. John Doerr, we are going to continue this conversation.  </p><p>      Coming up, more of our exclusive conversation with John Doerr, Chairman of Kleiner Perk, and including his thoughts on a road map to diversity using OKRs and the best opportunities in D.C. right now.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  This is \"Bloomberg Technology\", I'm Emily Chang in San Francisco. Over the course of his career, Kleiner Perkins chair John Doerr has pretty much seen it all, making early investments in Google, Amazon, and Facebook. His popularized a management philosophy, objectives and key results with top tech companies. And now, we're going to apply that to something else, techs massive diversity problem, John Doerr with me here now.  </p><p>      I do want to mention, you say this is much more than a book. In fact, it's a handbook.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  I'd like to say it's a handbook. It's not a business book. Because it's full of dozens of stories of real entrepreneurs and leaders, struggling, succeeding to set goals that matter. But my hope is that this isn't just for businesses. I think we can take OKR's certainly to our nonprofits, but even to our families, our schools, and our government.  </p><p>      We're really at a critical moment in time where I think many of our leaders and some of our great institutions have failed us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  What should Trump's OKR's be?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  I don't know. I haven't given that thought. I mean, that's a really very good question. But I would imagine they're grow the economy, have the country be respected in and around the world. His objective would probably be \"Make America Great Again\" right?  </p><p>      The objectives are very important to get, so too are the key results. And so I can see us using -- well, let me say this. Sylvia Mathews Burwell used OKRs to manage the Ebola crisis. Government is to be transparent and accountable. So, why not have a city council adopt the system of goal setting? I think we can and we must measure what really matters.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So, let's talk about diversity in Silicon Valley because we are increasingly holding Silicon Valley to account when it comes to diversity, and I know that you are very aware of this problem. You know, as you're advising young companies, how do you tell them how to approach setting goals and results for something that is so important but so easily is lost sight of?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  So, the first thing I ask them to do is answer the question why. The answer to the question why we do this work, why we're on this is all important. And it'll reflect and be expressed in both our values and a mission statement.  </p><p>      And you ought to have a powerful, inspiring mission. Because that's going to help you get the people together to do it. Something like organize all the world's information and make it available to everybody for free anywhere at any time. That's pretty timeless something like connect everybody in the world.  </p><p>      So, you've got to get the mission and the values right, and then this goal system, these objectives and key results. I think of those as kind of transparent vessels, the what and how into which we pour these values.  </p><p>      Because it's very clear that the transformational teams have managed to combine passion with purpose in a way that says they clearly know how to answer the question why we do the work that matters the most.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So, I just wrote a story in \"Business Week\" with my colleagues challenging Amazon to build its new headquarters -- they're starting from scratch , 50,000 new workers to shoot for 50/50. Is that a fair proposal?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  I think that's a great goal. And not so much for social equality or for social progress, but because we know that diverse groups make better business decisions. The data shows it. And so, you know, until we, the tech industry, the venture industry and Kleiner Perkins, get to a 50/50 world that reflects the customers we're trying to serve the society we work in, we're making less good decisions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So, I have to ask you about your reflections on Ellen Powell in light of the MeToo movement and obviously, you know, she sued your firm for a gender discrimination, lost in court, but public opinion maybe had mixed feelings. In this new world as we have this national conversation, what are your sort of reflections on that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  So, it's hard to add much to what's been said or written, or in fact you and I have discussed before about Ellen Powell. I'm human. The whole situation made me very sad, I think she's doing goof work now and I really do wish her well.  </p><p>      I think the more important -- sorry, not the more important question. I think the other dimension to this is I and we should have zero tolerance for a workplace that makes anyone in that workplace uncomfortable. And on the particular question of diversity, I think you know, we've been a leader in this field and we don't think we've gone far enough.  </p><p>      So, there's three areas in which I've been fighting really hard to make more progress at Kleiner. One of which is in our own people, our partnership, the second is out portfolio and then the third is the pipeline.  </p><p>      In our own partnership, 21 percent of our investing professionals are female. The average for the venture industry is pathetic. It's nine percent as you know. Within our portfolio, nine percent of our CEOs are founders are female, the average in the tech industry is 2.7 percent. That's outrageous.  </p><p>      And with respect to the pipeline in 20 -- I guess it was in 2015, 10 percent of the participants in Kleiner fellows program which is harder to get into then are getting the harder for a female. This year, it's 50-50 and 11 percent of them are African-American.  </p><p>      So, I'm not satisfied with where we are. I think we all have to do more, but we just have to put women and minorities in positions of power if we're going to right this wrong.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So, you've brought in some new blood, Mamoon Hamid joined the firm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  Ilya Fushman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Ilya.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  We've got a wonderful in town.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  We've heard he sort of your era parent, Mamoon is. Talk to us a little bit about the transition that's to come and how you expect the firm to change over the next few years.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOERR</emphasis>:  Sure. So Kleiner's in very good shape. I'm really excited about it. One of my key results when I took on this new role is to help the team attract and grow more talent.

But investor confidence is slowly returning, just look at the stock performance of Facebook, Google and Amazon in the last month, and one thing all three have in common, they saw early interest from longtime investors, John Doerr. He starts at Intel in 1974, he has worn the hats of engineer, venture capitalist and most recently chair of Kleiner Perkins.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ventures he has backed have created hundreds of thousands of jobs and become three of the wold's most viable companies. And now he has written a book about the goal sitting techniques that have help tech giants like Google and Intel tribe. It is called \"Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs.\" He joins me now here in the studio.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">John, welcome.</p><p>JOHN DOERR, CHAIRMAN, KLEINER PERKINS: Thank you.</p><p>CHANG: OKRs, Objectives and Key Results, this is a slideshow presentation you've been doing for many, many years, companies talk about it all the time like it's their religion. It is about setting objectives and key results. Ideas don't matter so much as execution.</p><p>DOERR: Executions, everything.</p><p>CHANG: What is so radical about this idea?</p><p>DOERR: Well, it is not practice in almost every company and what I mean by that is take one feature, just the notion that everybody in an organization would write down their goals and publish them and share them transparently, that's radical in most businesses or nonprofits. And that's just one of five things that set it apart.</p><p>CHANG: And you say that it's not just goals being set at the top, but employees sitting their own goal, right?</p><p>DOERR: Everyone transparently, top to bottom. So, when Larry and Sergey Google were 24 years old, I took them in this goal setting system. And I'd like to tell you that Sergey said, yes, John, we'll enthusiastically adopt this. The truth is, he said, we don't have any better way to manage the company's. So we'll give this one a try.</p><p>And Emily, every quarter since then, every Googler has written down her results and key results, publish them internally, graded them and then toss them aside because they don't count for bonuses, they don't count for promotions. They serve a higher purpose, a kind of collective calling and commitment to getting people focus in the line and tracking on stretching for the things that really matter the most.</p><p>CHANG: So you've presented this to Google, where you had just place your biggest butt of all time in 1999 $11.8 million for 12 percent of the company. And Larry Page who (ph) at the forward to your book and he called it a gift. So, I'm curious what would OKRs be for Google today? They are grappling with artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, fake news. There's a lot of change that's happening in the last two decades.</p><p>DOERR: Well, they have a very clear and crypt side of OKRs. And if I told you what they were, I'd be leaking. So, but everyone has them and this quarter, Sundar will stand up in front of 70,000 employees on a web cast and say these are our Googles objectives and key results and here are mine personally. And they won't get them all done. They'll maybe achieve 70 percent of them and that's considered a great, great.</p><p>CHANG: Now, one of the things you say about ORK is they're not a silver bullet. They don't take the place of values or culture.</p><p>DOERR: Or strong management.</p><p>CHANG: Exactly. And so --</p><p>DOERR: Can't substitute for those.</p><p>CHANG: How -- the book is called Measure What Matters, how do you measure something so intangible culture?</p><p>DOERR: Well, culture answers the question why. Objectives answer the question what, key results answer the question how. Your question to me was how do you measure culture? In fact, you do culture survey. You drop a definition of what your culture is and you periodically pulls your organization to say, do you feel we're not just saying but living up to these values with a transparency or aggressiveness or accountability. And I've seen this Emily, there's no one right culture. Every organization has its own and different ones can succeed in different ways.</p><p>CHANG: So, I want to ask you about Facebook and I know you're on the board of Google so you can't say so much about Google but you can opine about Facebook and incliner was an early investor. We've seen Facebook go through election meddling, also fake news problems, data privacy issues, data being mishandled. What would your ORKs be for Facebook? Or what would you recommend that they do in this situation?</p><p>DOERR: Well, it's a little hard being outside the organization to be prescriptive about that. So forgive me for saying that, but I think this is an incredibly well-run company with really good people in it. And I would expect that there are internal goals, I have no way of knowing this, to achieve a certain measure of growth and engagement together with, paired with, a measure of trust and user satisfaction. And the book talks about the importance of pairing goals.</p><p>You go all the way back to Lee Lacocca and the Pinto he had with an iron fist, goals to make the least expensive car he could. And the failure was, he didn't pair that with the goal in and around quality. So, for one of a part that cost less than a buck when someone ran into the back of a Pinto, the gas tank exploded, 100 people died, one of the largest recalls I ever had.</p><p>So, if you just let your goals be one-dimensional, you're going to miss the mark.</p><p>CHANG: You went to the White House, you met with President Trump. This as, you know, questions of tech regulation are looming, a potential trade war, what are your biggest concerns about sort of the economic and business consequences of this administration?</p><p>DOERR: So, I'm a red-blooded patriotic capitalist who believes in free markets, but also in putting a safety net in our economy. And I believe technology fundamentally advantages the rich, not the poor, and education is the counter bailing force that provides for upward mobility.</p><p>I've said then, I believe now that we should invest more in research and development, a lot more across the board that we should take data which has been bottled up and siloed and liberated, especially in the health care system. And this administration is moving very smartly on that front.</p><p>I'm a believer in free trade. I have differences with the administration on that, but I think this is a really good time for entrepreneurs to start new companies and to be working in the field of technology.</p><p>I do hold maybe the debatable view that every company, either is there is going to become a tech company. That you can't really compete in the new connected world without understanding what artificial intelligence or machine learning can mean to the products and services you offer your customers.</p><p>CHANG: What is your view on artificial intelligence? Elon Musk has said it's apocalyptic. We were just talking about that, it could be --</p><p>DOERR: It'll turn us all in the house pets.</p><p>CHANG: Absolutely. I mean, that is certainly one view, could it get that dark?</p><p>DOERR: I don't think so. But I want to put it in context. It seems every dozen years or so there is Tsunami like transformation to the innovation economy. Starting in 1980, it was the microchip in the P.C. right. That takes us forward to about one dozen years, '93, '94, the next big wave was the web browser.</p><p>Remember Mosaic and that's keep (ph) on all those internet companies including all the way up to and through Google. Then in 2006, Steve jobs introduced the iPhone. And at the same time, the cloud came along. So, that was the third great wave to right about today.</p><p>So, fair question is what is it now John? And I think this field has been overhyped, but now I think it's underappreciated, and that field is artificial intelligence. Its programs that learn as they go along, its deep reinforcement learning, neural networks that mimic in some ways the ways humans think. And the effects of this are going to be profound. We can't have self-driving cars without artificial intelligence.</p><p>What we can do with health care is incredibly exciting to me. Right now, you can take an image of a retina and not only predict the likelihood that that person will develop diabetes, but also the likelihood of hard incident in advance and you can apply artificial intelligence today to all kinds of imaging in health care and get better diagnosis that humans can give. We're just getting started.</p><p>CHANG: As our lives become more tech infused, do you worry about tech addiction or the negative impact of technology? I mean Chamath Palihapitiya who worked at Facebook for a long time has talked about the guilt he feels and how he believes it -- Facebook could be destroying the very fabric of our society.</p><p>DOERR: Yes. But good parenting can deal with this handedly. When my girls were growing up, I had a personal objective to have a healthy family and a key result that's --</p><p>CHANG: Right. And OKRs can be applied to family life as you talk about in the book.</p><p>DOERR: In fact, before we end I want to talk about that. But my key result was to get home from dinner 20 nights a month by 6:00 p.m., and the period quality result was to be fully present.</p><p>So, I pulled the plug on the router. Nobody could get anything on the internet. And, you know, I got that it was hard. I got it done maybe 70 percent of the time which was a pretty good grade.</p><p>CHANG: So, you're not worried?</p><p>DOERR: No.</p><p>CHANG: About the negative potential of all of these amazing things that are -- that you've done.</p><p>DOERR: Not when there's at least one and preferably two diligent parents in a household. I do think we want to be concerned about the families and kids or that's not the case.</p><p>CHANG: Let's talk about leadership, you know, I mentioned Elon Musk, he's obviously going through production issues at Tesla. There was just an analyst call where he referred to questions as boring and bone headed. He's got another company, SpaceX. Id t know, what would you recommend to a leader in that position running two really companies that are really pushing the limits of technology?</p><p>DOERR: Well, the same thing I recommend to others disruptive entrepreneurs. I mean make sure you have a strategic focus on a large unserved market need. Bring to it a proprietary technology and a commitment to assemble an outstanding management team, raise of reasonable amount of money. You can raise too much money as well as too little. Above all, never lose your sense of urgency which allows Tesla to move far faster than the rest of the automotive players. And I recommend you use objectives and key results.</p><p>CHANG: All right. John Doerr, we are going to continue this conversation.</p><p>Coming up, more of our exclusive conversation with John Doerr, Chairman of Kleiner Perk, and including his thoughts on a road map to diversity using OKRs and the best opportunities in D.C. right now.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHANG: This is \"Bloomberg Technology\", I'm Emily Chang in San Francisco. Over the course of his career, Kleiner Perkins chair John Doerr has pretty much seen it all, making early investments in Google, Amazon, and Facebook. His popularized a management philosophy, objectives and key results with top tech companies. And now, we're going to apply that to something else, techs massive diversity problem, John Doerr with me here now.</p><p>I do want to mention, you say this is much more than a book. In fact, it's a handbook.</p><p>DOERR: I'd like to say it's a handbook. It's not a business book. Because it's full of dozens of stories of real entrepreneurs and leaders, struggling, succeeding to set goals that matter. But my hope is that this isn't just for businesses. I think we can take OKR's certainly to our nonprofits, but even to our families, our schools, and our government.</p><p>We're really at a critical moment in time where I think many of our leaders and some of our great institutions have failed us.</p><p>CHANG: What should Trump's OKR's be?</p><p>DOERR: I don't know. I haven't given that thought. I mean, that's a really very good question. But I would imagine they're grow the economy, have the country be respected in and around the world. His objective would probably be \"Make America Great Again\" right?</p><p>The objectives are very important to get, so too are the key results. And so I can see us using -- well, let me say this. Sylvia Mathews Burwell used OKRs to manage the Ebola crisis. Government is to be transparent and accountable. So, why not have a city council adopt the system of goal setting? I think we can and we must measure what really matters.</p><p>CHANG: So, let's talk about diversity in Silicon Valley because we are increasingly holding Silicon Valley to account when it comes to diversity, and I know that you are very aware of this problem. You know, as you're advising young companies, how do you tell them how to approach setting goals and results for something that is so important but so easily is lost sight of?</p><p>DOERR: So, the first thing I ask them to do is answer the question why. The answer to the question why we do this work, why we're on this is all important. And it'll reflect and be expressed in both our values and a mission statement.</p><p>And you ought to have a powerful, inspiring mission. Because that's going to help you get the people together to do it. Something like organize all the world's information and make it available to everybody for free anywhere at any time. That's pretty timeless something like connect everybody in the world.</p><p>So, you've got to get the mission and the values right, and then this goal system, these objectives and key results. I think of those as kind of transparent vessels, the what and how into which we pour these values.</p><p>Because it's very clear that the transformational teams have managed to combine passion with purpose in a way that says they clearly know how to answer the question why we do the work that matters the most.</p><p>CHANG: So, I just wrote a story in \"Business Week\" with my colleagues challenging Amazon to build its new headquarters -- they're starting from scratch , 50,000 new workers to shoot for 50/50. Is that a fair proposal?</p><p>DOERR: I think that's a great goal. And not so much for social equality or for social progress, but because we know that diverse groups make better business decisions. The data shows it. And so, you know, until we, the tech industry, the venture industry and Kleiner Perkins, get to a 50/50 world that reflects the customers we're trying to serve the society we work in, we're making less good decisions.</p><p>CHANG: So, I have to ask you about your reflections on Ellen Powell in light of the MeToo movement and obviously, you know, she sued your firm for a gender discrimination, lost in court, but public opinion maybe had mixed feelings. In this new world as we have this national conversation, what are your sort of reflections on that?</p><p>DOERR: So, it's hard to add much to what's been said or written, or in fact you and I have discussed before about Ellen Powell. I'm human. The whole situation made me very sad, I think she's doing goof work now and I really do wish her well.</p><p>I think the more important -- sorry, not the more important question. I think the other dimension to this is I and we should have zero tolerance for a workplace that makes anyone in that workplace uncomfortable. And on the particular question of diversity, I think you know, we've been a leader in this field and we don't think we've gone far enough.</p><p>So, there's three areas in which I've been fighting really hard to make more progress at Kleiner. One of which is in our own people, our partnership, the second is out portfolio and then the third is the pipeline.</p><p>In our own partnership, 21 percent of our investing professionals are female. The average for the venture industry is pathetic. It's nine percent as you know. Within our portfolio, nine percent of our CEOs are founders are female, the average in the tech industry is 2.7 percent. That's outrageous.</p><p>And with respect to the pipeline in 20 -- I guess it was in 2015, 10 percent of the participants in Kleiner fellows program which is harder to get into then are getting the harder for a female. This year, it's 50-50 and 11 percent of them are African-American.</p><p>So, I'm not satisfied with where we are. I think we all have to do more, but we just have to put women and minorities in positions of power if we're going to right this wrong.</p><p>CHANG: So, you've brought in some new blood, Mamoon Hamid joined the firm.</p><p>DOERR: Ilya Fushman.</p><p>CHANG: Ilya.</p><p>DOERR: We've got a wonderful in town.</p><p>CHANG: We've heard he sort of your era parent, Mamoon is. Talk to us a little bit about the transition that's to come and how you expect the firm to change over the next few years.</p><p>DOERR: Sure. So Kleiner's in very good shape. I'm really excited about it. One of my key results when I took on this new role is to help the team attract and grow more talent. It's important to note though that Kleiner ha always been in transition.</p><p>Since I joined in 1980, we had partners who were in there 60s, 50s, 40s, and 30s. And so, I've had kind of an outsized presence maybe externally. But this is a very natural process that I think is going well.</p><p>CHANG: Where do you see the biggest opportunities indenture capital right now? Crypto? More in buffet just called in rap poisoned squared if that's any context.</p><p>DOERR: Sure. And I think Charlie Munger said he was transferring thirds.</p><p>CHANG: Right. Do you think that coin is a good investment or crypto in general?</p><p>DOERR: I think that blockchain is a very powerful new technology. It's not as bigger deal as mobility when I talk about these Tsunamis. And I don't think it's as big as A.I. But we've invested both in blockchain and the use of blockchain to facilitate international and cross boarder transactions.</p><p>I'd love to see blockchain applied in a powerful way to the healthcare system. So that you have fine grain control over where do you have -- where your health information goes. So that you can automatically at any time have a longitudinal record of all your healthcare experiences.</p><p>CHANG: What else? What's next?</p><p>DOERR: We invested in NICO, we'll --</p><p>CHANG: But in tech more broadly. I mean where do you see the opportunities in the next ten years?</p><p>DOERR: I think there are, you know, artificial intelligence. I remain convinced that selectively they are in the areas of innovations around energy and energy technologies. I'd -- I'm quite convinced we'll see a lot more disruption in systems for enterprises.</p><p>I want to say this though. The big tech giants especially those with strong positions in consumer markets, they're a lot more competitive than their predecessors were. And so, I think it's harder to start a new consumer internet based metric.</p><p>CHANG: All right, John Doerr, Chair of Kleiner Perkins out with a new book \"Measure What Matters\" or handbook did you say?</p><p>DOERR: A new handbook it's whatmatters.com.</p><p>CHANG: All right.

But investor confidence is slowly returning, just look  at the stock performance of Facebook, Google and Amazon in the last month,  and one thing all three have in common, they saw early interest from  longtime investors, John Doerr.  He starts at Intel in 1974, he has worn  the hats of engineer, venture capitalist and most recently chair of Kleiner  Perkins.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ventures he has backed have created hundreds of thousands of jobs and  become three of the wold's most viable companies.  And now he has written a  book about the goal sitting techniques that have help tech giants like  Google and Intel tribe.  It is called \"Measure What Matters: How Google,  Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs.\"  He joins me now  here in the studio.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">John, welcome.</p><p>JOHN DOERR, CHAIRMAN, KLEINER PERKINS:  Thank you.</p><p>CHANG:  OKRs, Objectives and Key Results, this is a slideshow presentation  you've been doing for many, many years, companies talk about it all the  time like it's their religion.  It is about setting objectives and key  results.  Ideas don't matter so much as execution.</p><p>DOERR:  Executions, everything.</p><p>CHANG:  What is so radical about this idea?</p><p>DOERR:  Well, it is not practice in almost every company and what I mean by  that is take one feature, just the notion that everybody in an organization  would write down their goals and publish them and share them transparently,  that's radical in most businesses or nonprofits.  And that's just one of  five things that set it apart.</p><p>CHANG:  And you say that it's not just goals being set at the top, but  employees sitting their own goal, right?</p><p>DOERR:  Everyone transparently, top to bottom.  So, when Larry and Sergey  Google were 24 years old, I took them in this goal setting system.  And I'd  like to tell you that Sergey said, yes, John, we'll enthusiastically adopt  this.  The truth is, he said, we don't have any better way to manage the  company's.  So we'll give this one a try.</p><p>And Emily, every quarter since then, every Googler has written down her  results and key results, publish them internally, graded them and then toss  them aside because they don't count for bonuses, they don't count for  promotions.  They serve a higher purpose, a kind of collective calling and  commitment to getting people focus in the line and tracking on stretching  for the things that really matter the most.</p><p>CHANG:  So you've presented this to Google, where you had just place your  biggest butt of all time in 1999 $11.8 million for 12 percent of the  company.  And Larry Page who (ph) at the forward to your book and he called  it a gift.  So, I'm curious what would OKRs be for Google today?  They are  grappling with artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, fake news.   There's a lot of change that's happening in the last two decades.</p><p>DOERR:  Well, they have a very clear and crypt side of OKRs.  And if I told  you what they were, I'd be leaking.  So, but everyone has them and this  quarter, Sundar will stand up in front of 70,000 employees on a web cast  and say these are our Googles objectives and key results and here are mine  personally.  And they won't get them all done.  They'll maybe achieve 70  percent of them and that's considered a great, great.</p><p>CHANG:  Now, one of the things you say about ORK is they're not a silver  bullet.  They don't take the place of values or culture.</p><p>DOERR:  Or strong management.</p><p>CHANG:  Exactly.  And so --</p><p>DOERR:  Can't substitute for those.</p><p>CHANG:  How -- the book is called Measure What Matters, how do you measure  something so intangible culture?</p><p>DOERR:  Well, culture answers the question why.  Objectives answer the  question what, key results answer the question how.  Your question to me  was how do you measure culture?  In fact, you do culture survey.  You drop  a definition of what your culture is and you periodically pulls your  organization to say, do you feel we're not just saying but living up to  these values with a transparency or aggressiveness or accountability.  And  I've seen this Emily, there's no one right culture.  Every organization has  its own and different ones can succeed in different ways.</p><p>CHANG:  So, I want to ask you about Facebook and I know you're on the board  of Google so you can't say so much about Google but you can opine about  Facebook and incliner was an early investor.  We've seen Facebook go  through election meddling, also fake news problems, data privacy issues,  data being mishandled.  What would your ORKs be for Facebook?  Or what  would you recommend that they do in this situation?</p><p>DOERR:  Well, it's a little hard being outside the organization to be  prescriptive about that.  So forgive me for saying that, but I think this  is an incredibly well-run company with really good people in it.  And I  would expect that there are internal goals, I have no way of knowing this,  to achieve a certain measure of growth and engagement together with, paired  with, a measure of trust and user satisfaction.  And the book talks about  the importance of pairing goals.</p><p>You go all the way back to Lee Lacocca and the Pinto he had with an iron  fist, goals to make the least expensive car he could.  And the failure was,  he didn't pair that with the goal in and around quality.  So, for one of a  part that cost less than a buck when someone ran into the back of a Pinto,  the gas tank exploded, 100 people died, one of the largest recalls I ever  had.</p><p>So, if you just let your goals be one-dimensional, you're going to miss the  mark.</p><p>CHANG:  You went to the White House, you met with President Trump.  This  as, you know, questions of tech regulation are looming, a potential trade  war, what are your biggest concerns about sort of the economic and business  consequences of this administration?</p><p>DOERR:  So, I'm a red-blooded patriotic capitalist who believes in free  markets, but also in putting a safety net in our economy.  And I believe  technology fundamentally advantages the rich, not the poor, and education  is the counter bailing force that provides for upward mobility.</p><p>I've said then, I believe now that we should invest more in research and  development, a lot more across the board that we should take data which has  been bottled up and siloed and liberated, especially in the health care  system.  And this administration is moving very smartly on that front.</p><p>I'm a believer in free trade.  I have differences with the administration  on that, but I think this is a really good time for entrepreneurs to start  new companies and to be working in the field of technology.</p><p>I do hold maybe the debatable view that every company, either is there is  going to become a tech company.  That you can't really compete in the new  connected world without understanding what artificial intelligence or  machine learning can mean to the products and services you offer your  customers.</p><p>CHANG:  What is your view on artificial intelligence?  Elon Musk has said  it's apocalyptic.  We were just talking about that, it could be --</p><p>DOERR:  It'll turn us all in the house pets.</p><p>CHANG:  Absolutely.  I mean, that is certainly one view, could it get that  dark?</p><p>DOERR:  I don't think so.  But I want to put it in context.  It seems every  dozen years or so there is Tsunami like transformation to the innovation  economy.  Starting in 1980, it was the microchip in the P.C. right.  That  takes us forward to about one dozen years, '93, '94, the next big wave was  the web browser.</p><p>Remember Mosaic and that's keep (ph) on all those internet companies  including all the way up to and through Google.  Then in 2006, Steve jobs  introduced the iPhone.  And at the same time, the cloud came along.  So,  that was the third great wave to right about today.</p><p>So, fair question is what is it now John?  And I think this field has been  overhyped, but now I think it's underappreciated, and that field is  artificial intelligence.  Its programs that learn as they go along, its  deep reinforcement learning, neural networks that mimic in some ways the  ways humans think.  And the effects of this are going to be profound.  We  can't have self-driving cars without artificial intelligence.</p><p>What we can do with health care is incredibly exciting to me.  Right now,  you can take an image of a retina and not only predict the likelihood that  that person will develop diabetes, but also the likelihood of hard incident  in advance and you can apply artificial intelligence today to all kinds of  imaging in health care and get better diagnosis that humans can give.   We're just getting started.</p><p>CHANG:  As our lives become more tech infused, do you worry about tech  addiction or the negative impact of technology?  I mean Chamath  Palihapitiya who worked at Facebook for a long time has talked about the  guilt he feels and how he believes it -- Facebook could be destroying the  very fabric of our society.</p><p>DOERR:  Yes.  But good parenting can deal with this handedly.  When my  girls were growing up, I had a personal objective to have a healthy family  and a key result that's --</p><p>CHANG:  Right.  And OKRs can be applied to family life as you talk about in  the book.</p><p>DOERR:  In fact, before we end I want to talk about that.  But my key  result was to get home from dinner 20 nights a month by 6:00 p.m., and the  period quality result was to be fully present.</p><p>So, I pulled the plug on the router.  Nobody could get anything on the  internet.  And, you know, I got that it was hard.  I got it done maybe 70  percent of the time which was a pretty good grade.</p><p>CHANG:  So, you're not worried?</p><p>DOERR:  No.</p><p>CHANG:  About the negative potential of all of these amazing things that  are -- that you've done.</p><p>DOERR: Not when there's at least one and preferably two diligent parents in  a household.  I do think we want to be concerned about the families and  kids or that's not the case.</p><p>CHANG:  Let's talk about leadership, you know, I mentioned Elon Musk, he's  obviously going through production issues at Tesla.  There was just an  analyst call where he referred to questions as boring and bone headed.   He's got another company, SpaceX.  Id t know, what would you recommend to a  leader in that position running two really companies that are really  pushing the limits of technology?</p><p>DOERR:  Well, the same thing I recommend to others disruptive  entrepreneurs.  I mean make sure you have a strategic focus on a large  unserved market need.  Bring to it a proprietary technology and a  commitment to assemble an outstanding management team, raise of reasonable  amount of money.  You can raise too much money as well as too little.   Above all, never lose your sense of urgency which allows Tesla to move far  faster than the rest of the automotive players.  And I recommend you use  objectives and key results.</p><p>CHANG:  All right.  John Doerr, we are going to continue this conversation.</p><p>Coming up, more of our exclusive conversation with John Doerr, Chairman of  Kleiner Perk, and including his thoughts on a road map to diversity using  OKRs and the best opportunities in D.C. right now.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHANG:  This is \"Bloomberg Technology\", I'm Emily Chang in San Francisco.   Over the course of his career, Kleiner Perkins chair John Doerr has pretty  much seen it all, making early investments in Google, Amazon, and Facebook.   His popularized a management philosophy, objectives and key results with  top tech companies.  And now, we're going to apply that to something else,  techs massive diversity problem, John Doerr with me here now.</p><p>I do want to mention, you say this is much more than a book.  In fact, it's  a handbook.</p><p>DOERR:  I'd like to say it's a handbook.  It's not a business book.   Because it's full of dozens of stories of real entrepreneurs and leaders,  struggling, succeeding to set goals that matter.  But my hope is that this  isn't just for businesses.  I think we can take OKR's certainly to our  nonprofits, but even to our families, our schools, and our government.</p><p>We're really at a critical moment in time where I think many of our leaders  and some of our great institutions have failed us.</p><p>CHANG:  What should Trump's OKR's be?</p><p>DOERR:  I don't know.  I haven't given that thought.  I mean, that's a  really very good question.  But I would imagine they're grow the economy,  have the country be respected in and around the world.  His objective would  probably be \"Make America Great Again\" right?</p><p>The objectives are very important to get, so too are the key results.  And  so I can see us using -- well, let me say this.  Sylvia Mathews Burwell  used OKRs to manage the Ebola crisis.  Government is to be transparent and  accountable.  So, why not have a city council adopt the system of goal  setting?  I think we can and we must measure what really matters.</p><p>CHANG:  So, let's talk about diversity in Silicon Valley because we are  increasingly holding Silicon Valley to account when it comes to diversity,  and I know that you are very aware of this problem.  You know, as you're  advising young companies, how do you tell them how to approach setting  goals and results for something that is so important but so easily is lost  sight of?</p><p>DOERR:  So, the first thing I ask them to do is answer the question why.   The answer to the question why we do this work, why we're on this is all  important.  And it'll reflect and be expressed in both our values and a  mission statement.</p><p>And you ought to have a powerful, inspiring mission.  Because that's going  to help you get the people together to do it.  Something like organize all  the world's information and make it available to everybody for free  anywhere at any time.  That's pretty timeless something like connect  everybody in the world.</p><p>So, you've got to get the mission and the values right, and then this goal  system, these objectives and key results.  I think of those as kind of  transparent vessels, the what and how into which we pour these values.</p><p>Because it's very clear that the transformational teams have managed to  combine passion with purpose in a way that says they clearly know how to  answer the question why we do the work that matters the most.</p><p>CHANG:  So, I just wrote a story in \"Business Week\" with my colleagues  challenging Amazon to build its new headquarters -- they're starting from  scratch , 50,000 new workers to shoot for 50/50.  Is that a fair proposal?</p><p>DOERR:  I think that's a great goal.  And not so much for social equality  or for social progress, but because we know that diverse groups make better  business decisions.  The data shows it.  And so, you know, until we, the  tech industry, the venture industry and Kleiner Perkins, get to a 50/50  world that reflects the customers we're trying to serve the society we work  in, we're making less good decisions.</p><p>CHANG:  So, I have to ask you about your reflections on Ellen Powell in  light of the MeToo movement and obviously, you know, she sued your firm for  a gender discrimination, lost in court, but public opinion maybe had mixed  feelings.  In this new world as we have this national conversation, what  are your sort of reflections on that?</p><p>DOERR:  So, it's hard to add much to what's been said or written, or in  fact you and I have discussed before about Ellen Powell.  I'm human.  The  whole situation made me very sad, I think she's doing goof work now and I  really do wish her well.</p><p>I think the more important -- sorry, not the more important question.  I  think the other dimension to this is I and we should have zero tolerance  for a workplace that makes anyone in that workplace uncomfortable.  And on  the particular question of diversity, I think you know, we've been a leader  in this field and we don't think we've gone far enough.</p><p>So, there's three areas in which I've been fighting really hard to make  more progress at Kleiner.  One of which is in our own people, our  partnership, the second is out portfolio and then the third is the  pipeline.</p><p>In our own partnership, 21 percent of our investing professionals are  female.  The average for the venture industry is pathetic.  It's nine  percent as you know.  Within our portfolio, nine percent of our CEOs are  founders are female, the average in the tech industry is 2.7 percent.   That's outrageous.</p><p>And with respect to the pipeline in 20 -- I guess it was in 2015, 10  percent of the participants in Kleiner fellows program which is harder to  get into then are getting the harder for a female.  This year, it's 50-50  and 11 percent of them are African-American.</p><p>So, I'm not satisfied with where we are.  I think we all have to do more,  but we just have to put women and minorities in positions of power if we're  going to right this wrong.</p><p>CHANG:  So, you've brought in some new blood, Mamoon Hamid joined the firm.</p><p>DOERR:  Ilya Fushman.</p><p>CHANG:  Ilya.</p><p>DOERR:  We've got a wonderful in town.</p><p>CHANG:  We've heard he sort of your era parent, Mamoon is.  Talk to us a  little bit about the transition that's to come and how you expect the firm  to change over the next few years.</p><p>DOERR:  Sure.  So Kleiner's in very good shape.  I'm really excited about  it.  One of my key results when I took on this new role is to help the team  attract and grow more talent.  It's important to note though that Kleiner  ha always been in transition.</p><p>Since I joined in 1980, we had partners who were in there 60s, 50s, 40s,  and 30s.  And so, I've had kind of an outsized presence maybe externally.   But this is a very natural process that I think is going well.</p><p>CHANG:  Where do you see the biggest opportunities indenture capital right  now?  Crypto?  More in buffet just called in rap poisoned squared if that's  any context.</p><p>DOERR:  Sure.  And I think Charlie Munger said he was transferring thirds.</p><p>CHANG:  Right.  Do you think that coin is a good investment or crypto in  general?</p><p>DOERR:  I think that blockchain is a very powerful new technology.  It's  not as bigger deal as mobility when I talk about these Tsunamis.  And I  don't think it's as big as A.I.  But we've invested both in blockchain and  the use of blockchain to facilitate international and cross boarder  transactions.</p><p>I'd love to see blockchain applied in a powerful way to the healthcare  system.

But investor confidence is slowly returning, just look  at the stock performance of Facebook, Google and Amazon in the last month,  and one thing all three have in common, they saw early interest from  longtime investors, John Doerr.  He starts at Intel in 1974, he has worn  the hats of engineer, venture capitalist and most recently chair of Kleiner  Perkins.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ventures he has backed have created hundreds of thousands of jobs and  become three of the wold's most viable companies.  And now he has written a  book about the goal sitting techniques that have help tech giants like  Google and Intel tribe.  It is called \"Measure What Matters: How Google,  Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs.\"  He joins me now  here in the studio.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">John, welcome.</p><p>JOHN DOERR, CHAIRMAN, KLEINER PERKINS:  Thank you.</p><p>CHANG:  OKRs, Objectives and Key Results, this is a slideshow presentation  you've been doing for many, many years, companies talk about it all the  time like it's their religion.  It is about setting objectives and key  results.  Ideas don't matter so much as execution.</p><p>DOERR:  Executions, everything.</p><p>CHANG:  What is so radical about this idea?</p><p>DOERR:  Well, it is not practice in almost every company and what I mean by  that is take one feature, just the notion that everybody in an organization  would write down their goals and publish them and share them transparently,  that's radical in most businesses or nonprofits.  And that's just one of  five things that set it apart.</p><p>CHANG:  And you say that it's not just goals being set at the top, but  employees sitting their own goal, right?</p><p>DOERR:  Everyone transparently, top to bottom.  So, when Larry and Sergey  Google were 24 years old, I took them in this goal setting system.  And I'd  like to tell you that Sergey said, yes, John, we'll enthusiastically adopt  this.  The truth is, he said, we don't have any better way to manage the  company's.  So we'll give this one a try.</p><p>And Emily, every quarter since then, every Googler has written down her  results and key results, publish them internally, graded them and then toss  them aside because they don't count for bonuses, they don't count for  promotions.  They serve a higher purpose, a kind of collective calling and  commitment to getting people focus in the line and tracking on stretching  for the things that really matter the most.</p><p>CHANG:  So you've presented this to Google, where you had just place your  biggest butt of all time in 1999 $11.8 million for 12 percent of the  company.  And Larry Page who (ph) at the forward to your book and he called  it a gift.  So, I'm curious what would OKRs be for Google today?  They are  grappling with artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, fake news.   There's a lot of change that's happening in the last two decades.</p><p>DOERR:  Well, they have a very clear and crypt side of OKRs.  And if I told  you what they were, I'd be leaking.  So, but everyone has them and this  quarter, Sundar will stand up in front of 70,000 employees on a web cast  and say these are our Googles objectives and key results and here are mine  personally.  And they won't get them all done.  They'll maybe achieve 70  percent of them and that's considered a great, great.</p><p>CHANG:  Now, one of the things you say about ORK is they're not a silver  bullet.  They don't take the place of values or culture.</p><p>DOERR:  Or strong management.</p><p>CHANG:  Exactly.  And so --</p><p>DOERR:  Can't substitute for those.</p><p>CHANG:  How -- the book is called Measure What Matters, how do you measure  something so intangible culture?</p><p>DOERR:  Well, culture answers the question why.  Objectives answer the  question what, key results answer the question how.  Your question to me  was how do you measure culture?  In fact, you do culture survey.  You drop  a definition of what your culture is and you periodically pulls your  organization to say, do you feel we're not just saying but living up to  these values with a transparency or aggressiveness or accountability.  And  I've seen this Emily, there's no one right culture.  Every organization has  its own and different ones can succeed in different ways.</p><p>CHANG:  So, I want to ask you about Facebook and I know you're on the board  of Google so you can't say so much about Google but you can opine about  Facebook and incliner was an early investor.  We've seen Facebook go  through election meddling, also fake news problems, data privacy issues,  data being mishandled.  What would your ORKs be for Facebook?  Or what  would you recommend that they do in this situation?</p><p>DOERR:  Well, it's a little hard being outside the organization to be  prescriptive about that.  So forgive me for saying that, but I think this  is an incredibly well-run company with really good people in it.  And I  would expect that there are internal goals, I have no way of knowing this,  to achieve a certain measure of growth and engagement together with, paired  with, a measure of trust and user satisfaction.  And the book talks about  the importance of pairing goals.</p><p>You go all the way back to Lee Lacocca and the Pinto he had with an iron  fist, goals to make the least expensive car he could.  And the failure was,  he didn't pair that with the goal in and around quality.  So, for one of a  part that cost less than a buck when someone ran into the back of a Pinto,  the gas tank exploded, 100 people died, one of the largest recalls I ever  had.</p><p>So, if you just let your goals be one-dimensional, you're going to miss the  mark.</p><p>CHANG:  You went to the White House, you met with President Trump.  This  as, you know, questions of tech regulation are looming, a potential trade  war, what are your biggest concerns about sort of the economic and business  consequences of this administration?</p><p>DOERR:  So, I'm a red-blooded patriotic capitalist who believes in free  markets, but also in putting a safety net in our economy.  And I believe  technology fundamentally advantages the rich, not the poor, and education  is the counter bailing force that provides for upward mobility.</p><p>I've said then, I believe now that we should invest more in research and  development, a lot more across the board that we should take data which has  been bottled up and siloed and liberated, especially in the health care  system.  And this administration is moving very smartly on that front.</p><p>I'm a believer in free trade.  I have differences with the administration  on that, but I think this is a really good time for entrepreneurs to start  new companies and to be working in the field of technology.</p><p>I do hold maybe the debatable view that every company, either is there is  going to become a tech company.  That you can't really compete in the new  connected world without understanding what artificial intelligence or  machine learning can mean to the products and services you offer your  customers.</p><p>CHANG:  What is your view on artificial intelligence?  Elon Musk has said  it's apocalyptic.  We were just talking about that, it could be --</p><p>DOERR:  It'll turn us all in the house pets.</p><p>CHANG:  Absolutely.  I mean, that is certainly one view, could it get that  dark?</p><p>DOERR:  I don't think so.  But I want to put it in context.  It seems every  dozen years or so there is Tsunami like transformation to the innovation  economy.  Starting in 1980, it was the microchip in the P.C. right.  That  takes us forward to about one dozen years, '93, '94, the next big wave was  the web browser.</p><p>Remember Mosaic and that's keep (ph) on all those internet companies  including all the way up to and through Google.  Then in 2006, Steve jobs  introduced the iPhone.  And at the same time, the cloud came along.  So,  that was the third great wave to right about today.</p><p>So, fair question is what is it now John?  And I think this field has been  overhyped, but now I think it's underappreciated, and that field is  artificial intelligence.  Its programs that learn as they go along, its  deep reinforcement learning, neural networks that mimic in some ways the  ways humans think.  And the effects of this are going to be profound.  We  can't have self-driving cars without artificial intelligence.</p><p>What we can do with health care is incredibly exciting to me.  Right now,  you can take an image of a retina and not only predict the likelihood that  that person will develop diabetes, but also the likelihood of hard incident  in advance and you can apply artificial intelligence today to all kinds of  imaging in health care and get better diagnosis that humans can give.   We're just getting started.</p><p>CHANG:  As our lives become more tech infused, do you worry about tech  addiction or the negative impact of technology?  I mean Chamath  Palihapitiya who worked at Facebook for a long time has talked about the  guilt he feels and how he believes it -- Facebook could be destroying the  very fabric of our society.</p><p>DOERR:  Yes.  But good parenting can deal with this handedly.  When my  girls were growing up, I had a personal objective to have a healthy family  and a key result that's --</p><p>CHANG:  Right.  And OKRs can be applied to family life as you talk about in  the book.</p><p>DOERR:  In fact, before we end I want to talk about that.  But my key  result was to get home from dinner 20 nights a month by 6:00 p.m., and the  period quality result was to be fully present.</p><p>So, I pulled the plug on the router.  Nobody could get anything on the  internet.  And, you know, I got that it was hard.  I got it done maybe 70  percent of the time which was a pretty good grade.</p><p>CHANG:  So, you're not worried?</p><p>DOERR:  No.</p><p>CHANG:  About the negative potential of all of these amazing things that  are -- that you've done.</p><p>DOERR: Not when there's at least one and preferably two diligent parents in  a household.  I do think we want to be concerned about the families and  kids or that's not the case.</p><p>CHANG:  Let's talk about leadership, you know, I mentioned Elon Musk, he's  obviously going through production issues at Tesla.  There was just an  analyst call where he referred to questions as boring and bone headed.   He's got another company, SpaceX.  Id t know, what would you recommend to a  leader in that position running two really companies that are really  pushing the limits of technology?</p><p>DOERR:  Well, the same thing I recommend to others disruptive  entrepreneurs.  I mean make sure you have a strategic focus on a large  unserved market need.  Bring to it a proprietary technology and a  commitment to assemble an outstanding management team, raise of reasonable  amount of money.  You can raise too much money as well as too little.   Above all, never lose your sense of urgency which allows Tesla to move far  faster than the rest of the automotive players.  And I recommend you use  objectives and key results.</p><p>CHANG:  All right.  John Doerr, we are going to continue this conversation.</p><p>Coming up, more of our exclusive conversation with John Doerr, Chairman of  Kleiner Perk, and including his thoughts on a road map to diversity using  OKRs and the best opportunities in D.C. right now.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHANG:  This is \"Bloomberg Technology\", I'm Emily Chang in San Francisco.   Over the course of his career, Kleiner Perkins chair John Doerr has pretty  much seen it all, making early investments in Google, Amazon, and Facebook.   His popularized a management philosophy, objectives and key results with  top tech companies.  And now, we're going to apply that to something else,  techs massive diversity problem, John Doerr with me here now.</p><p>I do want to mention, you say this is much more than a book.  In fact, it's  a handbook.</p><p>DOERR:  I'd like to say it's a handbook.  It's not a business book.   Because it's full of dozens of stories of real entrepreneurs and leaders,  struggling, succeeding to set goals that matter.  But my hope is that this  isn't just for businesses.  I think we can take OKR's certainly to our  nonprofits, but even to our families, our schools, and our government.</p><p>We're really at a critical moment in time where I think many of our leaders  and some of our great institutions have failed us.</p><p>CHANG:  What should Trump's OKR's be?</p><p>DOERR:  I don't know.  I haven't given that thought.  I mean, that's a  really very good question.  But I would imagine they're grow the economy,  have the country be respected in and around the world.  His objective would  probably be \"Make America Great Again\" right?</p><p>The objectives are very important to get, so too are the key results.  And  so I can see us using -- well, let me say this.  Sylvia Mathews Burwell  used OKRs to manage the Ebola crisis.  Government is to be transparent and  accountable.  So, why not have a city council adopt the system of goal  setting?  I think we can and we must measure what really matters.</p><p>CHANG:  So, let's talk about diversity in Silicon Valley because we are  increasingly holding Silicon Valley to account when it comes to diversity,  and I know that you are very aware of this problem.  You know, as you're  advising young companies, how do you tell them how to approach setting  goals and results for something that is so important but so easily is lost  sight of?</p><p>DOERR:  So, the first thing I ask them to do is answer the question why.   The answer to the question why we do this work, why we're on this is all  important.  And it'll reflect and be expressed in both our values and a  mission statement.</p><p>And you ought to have a powerful, inspiring mission.  Because that's going  to help you get the people together to do it.  Something like organize all  the world's information and make it available to everybody for free  anywhere at any time.  That's pretty timeless something like connect  everybody in the world.</p><p>So, you've got to get the mission and the values right, and then this goal  system, these objectives and key results.  I think of those as kind of  transparent vessels, the what and how into which we pour these values.</p><p>Because it's very clear that the transformational teams have managed to  combine passion with purpose in a way that says they clearly know how to  answer the question why we do the work that matters the most.</p><p>CHANG:  So, I just wrote a story in \"Business Week\" with my colleagues  challenging Amazon to build its new headquarters -- they're starting from  scratch , 50,000 new workers to shoot for 50/50.  Is that a fair proposal?</p><p>DOERR:  I think that's a great goal.  And not so much for social equality  or for social progress, but because we know that diverse groups make better  business decisions.  The data shows it.  And so, you know, until we, the  tech industry, the venture industry and Kleiner Perkins, get to a 50/50  world that reflects the customers we're trying to serve the society we work  in, we're making less good decisions.</p><p>CHANG:  So, I have to ask you about your reflections on Ellen Powell in  light of the MeToo movement and obviously, you know, she sued your firm for  a gender discrimination, lost in court, but public opinion maybe had mixed  feelings.  In this new world as we have this national conversation, what  are your sort of reflections on that?</p><p>DOERR:  So, it's hard to add much to what's been said or written, or in  fact you and I have discussed before about Ellen Powell.  I'm human.  The  whole situation made me very sad, I think she's doing goof work now and I  really do wish her well.</p><p>I think the more important -- sorry, not the more important question.  I  think the other dimension to this is I and we should have zero tolerance  for a workplace that makes anyone in that workplace uncomfortable.  And on  the particular question of diversity, I think you know, we've been a leader  in this field and we don't think we've gone far enough.</p><p>So, there's three areas in which I've been fighting really hard to make  more progress at Kleiner.  One of which is in our own people, our  partnership, the second is out portfolio and then the third is the  pipeline.</p><p>In our own partnership, 21 percent of our investing professionals are  female.  The average for the venture industry is pathetic.  It's nine  percent as you know.  Within our portfolio, nine percent of our CEOs are  founders are female, the average in the tech industry is 2.7 percent.   That's outrageous.</p><p>And with respect to the pipeline in 20 -- I guess it was in 2015, 10  percent of the participants in Kleiner fellows program which is harder to  get into then are getting the harder for a female.  This year, it's 50-50  and 11 percent of them are African-American.</p><p>So, I'm not satisfied with where we are.  I think we all have to do more,  but we just have to put women and minorities in positions of power if we're  going to right this wrong.</p><p>CHANG:  So, you've brought in some new blood, Mamoon Hamid joined the firm.</p><p>DOERR:  Ilya Fushman.</p><p>CHANG:  Ilya.</p><p>DOERR:  We've got a wonderful in town.</p><p>CHANG:  We've heard he sort of your era parent, Mamoon is.  Talk to us a  little bit about the transition that's to come and how you expect the firm  to change over the next few years.</p><p>DOERR:  Sure.  So Kleiner's in very good shape.  I'm really excited about  it.  One of my key results when I took on this new role is to help the team  attract and grow more talent.  It's important to note though that Kleiner  ha always been in transition.</p><p>Since I joined in 1980, we had partners who were in there 60s, 50s, 40s,  and 30s.  And so, I've had kind of an outsized presence maybe externally.   But this is a very natural process that I think is going well.</p><p>CHANG:  Where do you see the biggest opportunities indenture capital right  now?  Crypto?  More in buffet just called in rap poisoned squared if that's  any context.</p><p>DOERR:  Sure.  And I think Charlie Munger said he was transferring thirds.</p><p>CHANG:  Right.  Do you think that coin is a good investment or crypto in  general?</p><p>DOERR:  I think that blockchain is a very powerful new technology.  It's  not as bigger deal as mobility when I talk about these Tsunamis.  And I  don't think it's as big as A.I.  But we've invested both in blockchain and  the use of blockchain to facilitate international and cross boarder  transactions.</p><p>I'd love to see blockchain applied in a powerful way to the healthcare  system.  So that you have fine grain control over where do you have --  where your health information goes.  So that you can automatically at any  time have a longitudinal record of all your healthcare experiences.</p><p>CHANG:  What else?  What's next?</p><p>DOERR:  We invested in NICO, we'll --</p><p>CHANG:  But in tech more broadly.  I mean where do you see the  opportunities in the next ten years?</p><p>DOERR:  I think there are, you know, artificial intelligence.  I remain  convinced that selectively they are in the areas of innovations around  energy and energy technologies.  I'd -- I'm quite convinced we'll see a lot  more disruption in systems for enterprises.</p><p>I want to say this though.  The big tech giants especially those with  strong positions in consumer markets, they're a lot more competitive than  their predecessors were.  And so, I think it's harder to start a new  consumer internet based metric.</p><p>CHANG:  All right, John Doerr, Chair of Kleiner Perkins out with a new book  \"Measure What Matters\" or handbook did you say?</p><p>DOERR:  A new handbook it's whatmatters.com.</p><p>CHANG:  All right.  Thank you so much John for joining us, great to have  you.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

But investor confidence is slowly returning, just look at the stock performance of Facebook, Google and Amazon in the last month, and one thing all three have in common, they saw early interest from longtime investors, John Doerr. He starts at Intel in 1974, he has worn the hats of engineer, venture capitalist and most recently chair of Kleiner Perkins.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ventures he has backed have created hundreds of thousands of jobs and become three of the wold's most viable companies. And now he has written a book about the goal sitting techniques that have help tech giants like Google and Intel tribe. It is called \"Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs.\" He joins me now here in the studio.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">John, welcome.</p><p>JOHN DOERR, CHAIRMAN, KLEINER PERKINS: Thank you.</p><p>CHANG: OKRs, Objectives and Key Results, this is a slideshow presentation you've been doing for many, many years, companies talk about it all the time like it's their religion. It is about setting objectives and key results. Ideas don't matter so much as execution.</p><p>DOERR: Executions, everything.</p><p>CHANG: What is so radical about this idea?</p><p>DOERR: Well, it is not practice in almost every company and what I mean by that is take one feature, just the notion that everybody in an organization would write down their goals and publish them and share them transparently, that's radical in most businesses or nonprofits. And that's just one of five things that set it apart.</p><p>CHANG: And you say that it's not just goals being set at the top, but employees sitting their own goal, right?</p><p>DOERR: Everyone transparently, top to bottom. So, when Larry and Sergey Google were 24 years old, I took them in this goal setting system. And I'd like to tell you that Sergey said, yes, John, we'll enthusiastically adopt this. The truth is, he said, we don't have any better way to manage the company's. So we'll give this one a try.</p><p>And Emily, every quarter since then, every Googler has written down her results and key results, publish them internally, graded them and then toss them aside because they don't count for bonuses, they don't count for promotions. They serve a higher purpose, a kind of collective calling and commitment to getting people focus in the line and tracking on stretching for the things that really matter the most.</p><p>CHANG: So you've presented this to Google, where you had just place your biggest butt of all time in 1999 $11.8 million for 12 percent of the company. And Larry Page who (ph) at the forward to your book and he called it a gift. So, I'm curious what would OKRs be for Google today? They are grappling with artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, fake news. There's a lot of change that's happening in the last two decades.</p><p>DOERR: Well, they have a very clear and crypt side of OKRs. And if I told you what they were, I'd be leaking. So, but everyone has them and this quarter, Sundar will stand up in front of 70,000 employees on a web cast and say these are our Googles objectives and key results and here are mine personally. And they won't get them all done. They'll maybe achieve 70 percent of them and that's considered a great, great.</p><p>CHANG: Now, one of the things you say about ORK is they're not a silver bullet. They don't take the place of values or culture.</p><p>DOERR: Or strong management.</p><p>CHANG: Exactly. And so --</p><p>DOERR: Can't substitute for those.</p><p>CHANG: How -- the book is called Measure What Matters, how do you measure something so intangible culture?</p><p>DOERR: Well, culture answers the question why. Objectives answer the question what, key results answer the question how. Your question to me was how do you measure culture? In fact, you do culture survey. You drop a definition of what your culture is and you periodically pulls your organization to say, do you feel we're not just saying but living up to these values with a transparency or aggressiveness or accountability. And I've seen this Emily, there's no one right culture. Every organization has its own and different ones can succeed in different ways.</p><p>CHANG: So, I want to ask you about Facebook and I know you're on the board of Google so you can't say so much about Google but you can opine about Facebook and incliner was an early investor. We've seen Facebook go through election meddling, also fake news problems, data privacy issues, data being mishandled. What would your ORKs be for Facebook? Or what would you recommend that they do in this situation?</p><p>DOERR: Well, it's a little hard being outside the organization to be prescriptive about that. So forgive me for saying that, but I think this is an incredibly well-run company with really good people in it. And I would expect that there are internal goals, I have no way of knowing this, to achieve a certain measure of growth and engagement together with, paired with, a measure of trust and user satisfaction. And the book talks about the importance of pairing goals.</p><p>You go all the way back to Lee Lacocca and the Pinto he had with an iron fist, goals to make the least expensive car he could. And the failure was, he didn't pair that with the goal in and around quality. So, for one of a part that cost less than a buck when someone ran into the back of a Pinto, the gas tank exploded, 100 people died, one of the largest recalls I ever had.</p><p>So, if you just let your goals be one-dimensional, you're going to miss the mark.</p><p>CHANG: You went to the White House, you met with President Trump. This as, you know, questions of tech regulation are looming, a potential trade war, what are your biggest concerns about sort of the economic and business consequences of this administration?</p><p>DOERR: So, I'm a red-blooded patriotic capitalist who believes in free markets, but also in putting a safety net in our economy. And I believe technology fundamentally advantages the rich, not the poor, and education is the counter bailing force that provides for upward mobility.</p><p>I've said then, I believe now that we should invest more in research and development, a lot more across the board that we should take data which has been bottled up and siloed and liberated, especially in the health care system. And this administration is moving very smartly on that front.</p><p>I'm a believer in free trade. I have differences with the administration on that, but I think this is a really good time for entrepreneurs to start new companies and to be working in the field of technology.</p><p>I do hold maybe the debatable view that every company, either is there is going to become a tech company. That you can't really compete in the new connected world without understanding what artificial intelligence or machine learning can mean to the products and services you offer your customers.</p><p>CHANG: What is your view on artificial intelligence? Elon Musk has said it's apocalyptic. We were just talking about that, it could be --</p><p>DOERR: It'll turn us all in the house pets.</p><p>CHANG: Absolutely. I mean, that is certainly one view, could it get that dark?</p><p>DOERR: I don't think so. But I want to put it in context. It seems every dozen years or so there is Tsunami like transformation to the innovation economy. Starting in 1980, it was the microchip in the P.C. right. That takes us forward to about one dozen years, '93, '94, the next big wave was the web browser.</p><p>Remember Mosaic and that's keep (ph) on all those internet companies including all the way up to and through Google. Then in 2006, Steve jobs introduced the iPhone. And at the same time, the cloud came along. So, that was the third great wave to right about today.</p><p>So, fair question is what is it now John? And I think this field has been overhyped, but now I think it's underappreciated, and that field is artificial intelligence. Its programs that learn as they go along, its deep reinforcement learning, neural networks that mimic in some ways the ways humans think. And the effects of this are going to be profound. We can't have self-driving cars without artificial intelligence.</p><p>What we can do with health care is incredibly exciting to me. Right now, you can take an image of a retina and not only predict the likelihood that that person will develop diabetes, but also the likelihood of hard incident in advance and you can apply artificial intelligence today to all kinds of imaging in health care and get better diagnosis that humans can give. We're just getting started.</p><p>CHANG: As our lives become more tech infused, do you worry about tech addiction or the negative impact of technology? I mean Chamath Palihapitiya who worked at Facebook for a long time has talked about the guilt he feels and how he believes it -- Facebook could be destroying the very fabric of our society.</p><p>DOERR: Yes. But good parenting can deal with this handedly. When my girls were growing up, I had a personal objective to have a healthy family and a key result that's --</p><p>CHANG: Right. And OKRs can be applied to family life as you talk about in the book.</p><p>DOERR: In fact, before we end I want to talk about that. But my key result was to get home from dinner 20 nights a month by 6:00 p.m., and the period quality result was to be fully present.</p><p>So, I pulled the plug on the router. Nobody could get anything on the internet. And, you know, I got that it was hard. I got it done maybe 70 percent of the time which was a pretty good grade.</p><p>CHANG: So, you're not worried?</p><p>DOERR: No.</p><p>CHANG: About the negative potential of all of these amazing things that are -- that you've done.</p><p>DOERR: Not when there's at least one and preferably two diligent parents in a household. I do think we want to be concerned about the families and kids or that's not the case.</p><p>CHANG: Let's talk about leadership, you know, I mentioned Elon Musk, he's obviously going through production issues at Tesla. There was just an analyst call where he referred to questions as boring and bone headed. He's got another company, SpaceX. Id t know, what would you recommend to a leader in that position running two really companies that are really pushing the limits of technology?</p><p>DOERR: Well, the same thing I recommend to others disruptive entrepreneurs. I mean make sure you have a strategic focus on a large unserved market need. Bring to it a proprietary technology and a commitment to assemble an outstanding management team, raise of reasonable amount of money. You can raise too much money as well as too little. Above all, never lose your sense of urgency which allows Tesla to move far faster than the rest of the automotive players. And I recommend you use objectives and key results.</p><p>CHANG: All right. John Doerr, we are going to continue this conversation.</p><p>Coming up, more of our exclusive conversation with John Doerr, Chairman of Kleiner Perk, and including his thoughts on a road map to diversity using OKRs and the best opportunities in D.C. right now.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHANG: This is \"Bloomberg Technology\", I'm Emily Chang in San Francisco. Over the course of his career, Kleiner Perkins chair John Doerr has pretty much seen it all, making early investments in Google, Amazon, and Facebook. His popularized a management philosophy, objectives and key results with top tech companies. And now, we're going to apply that to something else, techs massive diversity problem, John Doerr with me here now.</p><p>I do want to mention, you say this is much more than a book. In fact, it's a handbook.</p><p>DOERR: I'd like to say it's a handbook. It's not a business book. Because it's full of dozens of stories of real entrepreneurs and leaders, struggling, succeeding to set goals that matter. But my hope is that this isn't just for businesses. I think we can take OKR's certainly to our nonprofits, but even to our families, our schools, and our government.</p><p>We're really at a critical moment in time where I think many of our leaders and some of our great institutions have failed us.</p><p>CHANG: What should Trump's OKR's be?</p><p>DOERR: I don't know. I haven't given that thought. I mean, that's a really very good question. But I would imagine they're grow the economy, have the country be respected in and around the world. His objective would probably be \"Make America Great Again\" right?</p><p>The objectives are very important to get, so too are the key results. And so I can see us using -- well, let me say this. Sylvia Mathews Burwell used OKRs to manage the Ebola crisis. Government is to be transparent and accountable. So, why not have a city council adopt the system of goal setting? I think we can and we must measure what really matters.</p><p>CHANG: So, let's talk about diversity in Silicon Valley because we are increasingly holding Silicon Valley to account when it comes to diversity, and I know that you are very aware of this problem. You know, as you're advising young companies, how do you tell them how to approach setting goals and results for something that is so important but so easily is lost sight of?</p><p>DOERR: So, the first thing I ask them to do is answer the question why. The answer to the question why we do this work, why we're on this is all important. And it'll reflect and be expressed in both our values and a mission statement.</p><p>And you ought to have a powerful, inspiring mission. Because that's going to help you get the people together to do it. Something like organize all the world's information and make it available to everybody for free anywhere at any time. That's pretty timeless something like connect everybody in the world.</p><p>So, you've got to get the mission and the values right, and then this goal system, these objectives and key results. I think of those as kind of transparent vessels, the what and how into which we pour these values.</p><p>Because it's very clear that the transformational teams have managed to combine passion with purpose in a way that says they clearly know how to answer the question why we do the work that matters the most.</p><p>CHANG: So, I just wrote a story in \"Business Week\" with my colleagues challenging Amazon to build its new headquarters -- they're starting from scratch , 50,000 new workers to shoot for 50/50. Is that a fair proposal?</p><p>DOERR: I think that's a great goal. And not so much for social equality or for social progress, but because we know that diverse groups make better business decisions. The data shows it. And so, you know, until we, the tech industry, the venture industry and Kleiner Perkins, get to a 50/50 world that reflects the customers we're trying to serve the society we work in, we're making less good decisions.</p><p>CHANG: So, I have to ask you about your reflections on Ellen Powell in light of the MeToo movement and obviously, you know, she sued your firm for a gender discrimination, lost in court, but public opinion maybe had mixed feelings. In this new world as we have this national conversation, what are your sort of reflections on that?</p><p>DOERR: So, it's hard to add much to what's been said or written, or in fact you and I have discussed before about Ellen Powell. I'm human. The whole situation made me very sad, I think she's doing goof work now and I really do wish her well.</p><p>I think the more important -- sorry, not the more important question. I think the other dimension to this is I and we should have zero tolerance for a workplace that makes anyone in that workplace uncomfortable. And on the particular question of diversity, I think you know, we've been a leader in this field and we don't think we've gone far enough.</p><p>So, there's three areas in which I've been fighting really hard to make more progress at Kleiner. One of which is in our own people, our partnership, the second is out portfolio and then the third is the pipeline.</p><p>In our own partnership, 21 percent of our investing professionals are female. The average for the venture industry is pathetic. It's nine percent as you know. Within our portfolio, nine percent of our CEOs are founders are female, the average in the tech industry is 2.7 percent. That's outrageous.</p><p>And with respect to the pipeline in 20 -- I guess it was in 2015, 10 percent of the participants in Kleiner fellows program which is harder to get into then are getting the harder for a female. This year, it's 50-50 and 11 percent of them are African-American.</p><p>So, I'm not satisfied with where we are. I think we all have to do more, but we just have to put women and minorities in positions of power if we're going to right this wrong.</p><p>CHANG: So, you've brought in some new blood, Mamoon Hamid joined the firm.</p><p>DOERR: Ilya Fushman.</p><p>CHANG: Ilya.</p><p>DOERR: We've got a wonderful in town.</p><p>CHANG: We've heard he sort of your era parent, Mamoon is. Talk to us a little bit about the transition that's to come and how you expect the firm to change over the next few years.</p><p>DOERR: Sure. So Kleiner's in very good shape. I'm really excited about it. One of my key results when I took on this new role is to help the team attract and grow more talent. It's important to note though that Kleiner ha always been in transition.</p><p>Since I joined in 1980, we had partners who were in there 60s, 50s, 40s, and 30s. And so, I've had kind of an outsized presence maybe externally. But this is a very natural process that I think is going well.</p><p>CHANG: Where do you see the biggest opportunities indenture capital right now? Crypto? More in buffet just called in rap poisoned squared if that's any context.</p><p>DOERR: Sure. And I think Charlie Munger said he was transferring thirds.</p><p>CHANG: Right. Do you think that coin is a good investment or crypto in general?</p><p>DOERR: I think that blockchain is a very powerful new technology. It's not as bigger deal as mobility when I talk about these Tsunamis. And I don't think it's as big as A.I. But we've invested both in blockchain and the use of blockchain to facilitate international and cross boarder transactions.</p><p>I'd love to see blockchain applied in a powerful way to the healthcare system. So that you have fine grain control over where do you have -- where your health information goes. So that you can automatically at any time have a longitudinal record of all your healthcare experiences.</p><p>CHANG: What else? What's next?</p><p>DOERR: We invested in NICO, we'll --</p><p>CHANG: But in tech more broadly. I mean where do you see the opportunities in the next ten years?</p><p>DOERR: I think there are, you know, artificial intelligence. I remain convinced that selectively they are in the areas of innovations around energy and energy technologies. I'd -- I'm quite convinced we'll see a lot more disruption in systems for enterprises.</p><p>I want to say this though. The big tech giants especially those with strong positions in consumer markets, they're a lot more competitive than their predecessors were. And so, I think it's harder to start a new consumer internet based metric.</p><p>CHANG: All right, John Doerr, Chair of Kleiner Perkins out with a new book \"Measure What Matters\" or handbook did you say?</p><p>DOERR: A new handbook it's whatmatters.com.</p><p>CHANG: All right. Thank you so much John for joining us, great to have you.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

He's the Chief Equity Strategist at Wells Fargo Funds.  And, John, great to have you with us here in the middle of earning seasons, squarely in the middle of the second quarter earning season.  </p><p>      Let's take stock of where we are as the big tech companies reporting last week, some financial companies reporting as well.  Just give us the lay of the land as you see it as these results to continue to come in.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  All the way from benign to good.  I think the numbers are coming in pretty well.  The revenue numbers are starting to surprise, which is sort of interesting.  And this is giving large to something that a lot of people thought that profits were so high, they couldn't go higher even if the economy got better.  </p><p>      Well, the revenues, Tom, we were seeing a better economy and the profit numbers are just what they.  They're saying things are getting better.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Yes.  But, John, at the same, a lot of these aren't cost cuts.  I know the revenue is a strong kind of indication that things are getting better.  But what if we were loved in a false sense of security because it's all cost cuts and not actual growth?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  Any sense of security in the stock market is a false sense of security.  Of course, we have done this long this long enough.  But ultimately, it will prove me false.  </p><p>      However, what you're seeing are just early stages.  Ideally, what corporation should do is make themselves into very, very efficient machines.  And that's what they've done.  And then build it that way and the economy will come.  This is the United States over here.  We still have -- I wouldn't call pens up to me.  We have natural exam.  </p><p>      People came to the United States.  Our ancestors came from the United States to have more.  We're willing to work for it in most cases.  And I think what happens is we put the problems 10 years ago further and further behind us.  And yes, a little bit of stimulation from the fed.  You get yourself a pretty decent economy.  And if that happens that just poured over an efficient machine, I mean, profits come out of it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Is it really only a little bit of stimulus from the fed? What happens if they actually move too quickly?  I mean, they telegraphed, right, that they are starting to normalize.  But what happens if companies are not ready for it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  They'll stop -- they'll stop doing it.  One of the things that I have a chat (ph), you know, says a few weeks ago was that she gets -- she's aware.  She knows there's a risk in stimulating too quickly or not stimulating enough.  She knows there's a risk in how they unwind the balance sheet.  She knows the risk of inflation. She knows the risk of deflation.  </p><p>      Now, she may not know exactly the road or the path to follow down on the way to recovery, but she knows to look for any misstep on her part.  Anything she's done that possibly could derail.  So, I guess what I can say about Janet Yellen is sure, she may be wrong but she won't be wrong for long and that's really what matters to the markets.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  John, what's your sense of the degree to which this Fed Reserve, this Federal Open Market Committee is paying attention to the market?  How big a concern is that for them?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  I think they read the papers and, obviously, they listen to some very good radio broadcast from time to time.  They have to be aware.  I mean, you know, it's like asking your doctor did he read the thermometer after he test you.  </p><p>      We're pretty didn't care to what's going on.  We're not perfect. We bounce around in awful lot.  But we're pretty good in here.  </p><p>      And now, I think it's also important to remember, the fed and the capital markets and the economy are linked, because when the fed wants to push money at the economy, it goes through us first.  So then let's think of it as a pipe carrying out, in or out of the economy.  They sort of look at us, they get an obvious sign as money headed the right direction  And, you know, they see a meltdown in stock market a little bit, they know that's can't be good for the rest of the real world.  </p><p>      The same thing is true for housing and a few others things.  Look at what wealth is doing.  If wealth is being created or at least maintained, they've got to feel reasonably comfortable.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  And look at the soft data, you look the surveys, how businesses feel, their willingness to hire, their willingness to expand.  And it seems like there is still a gap between the soft data and the hard data.  </p><p>      As you look at these earnings reports, what's the sense that you have of when the two are going to meet?  Where we're going to see companies try to invest more in CAPEX?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  I think you're starting to see -- I think what you have to realize too is that when -- it probably happen quickly because we're still on a fairly competitive landscape.  And so far, it's been better for corporations who are competing against other corporations to buyback shares, to reinvest in their businesses by buying into their businesses.  That doesn't have capacity obviously.  </p><p>      But at some point in time, it's not because the companies want to do it, it's because their consumers are demanding more of their products.  If you and I are competing and I see you beginning to pick up share because you expand a little bit, watch out quickly, I would start my CAPEX of them.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  John, are market merger is good for evaluations or bad?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  Well, it depends on merger it has.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  I know, in the industry, but -- because, you know, in general, just full of desperation. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  I think that merge is to create synergy without being tremendously destructive to jobs, to create more efficient, more logical corporations are generally good.  You don't want restraining the trade.  I don't want restraining the trade.  You do want efficiencies.  You do want logical structures to a degree they foster that, I think it's fine.  You just always keep your eyes open. There's nothing wrong with regulation.  It's just got to be done, you know, a fair, even-handed way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  John, you know, we went into 2017, looking at Brexit, looking at President Trump.  And there was this wave of anti-populism of -- or populism anti-globalization.  Should that do anything to stock markets?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  Well, it hasn't.  I mean, there's an old saying, expect the worse and you'll never be disappointed.  And the things to market has not been disappointed this year.  </p><p>      People talk about the lack of downside volatility.  The only explanation for that is there have been non-negative surprises or any consequence.  Well, so many negative things that come out of Washington or (inaudible) or even Berlin or Paris, how can one say there aren't negative surprises?  Of course, there are negative.  </p><p>      Well, the thing is it's not a surprise.  I think investors have a fairly low expectation, maybe a very low expectation of what comes out of Washington or Berlin or Britain.  And I think in that respect, it's going to be pretty hard to disappoint us.]  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Let me ask about financials in particular.  A number of banks have reported already.  How enthusiastic are you about financial stocks at this point?  And how radically have they sort of trigged around from where we're a few years back?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  Well, 40 years ago, I made choices from my life amongst them, so --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  -- we're very intimate with financial stocks and financial corporations and all the big -- it can be the best business and the worst business in the world.  And believe me, I've seen both.  </p><p>      I think what you have to look for is reasonable regulation. There is no way that banks or financial institutions should be wide open.  On the other hand, regulation go too far.  You look for just the amount of regulation that seems to be moving in the right direction.  </p><p>      Interest rates also have corporations when they're facing very, very low rates, have a very difficult time placing fees on things that should have fees on them.  If that's the case, their earnings power is being starved.  Higher rates to a degree, it doesn't represent real fed tightening allows financial corporations to charge those fees, right adjustable fees that tends to improve their profitability.  I think that part still in front of them. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Let me ask you how much personality matters.  We spent some time this morning on television talking about Stuart Gulliver who is outgoing head of HSBC.  You look at who's heading up these banks now.  You can say few more years left and a lot of these guys who are running these banks.  And how worried are you about transition?  How much do you associate performances, the big bangs in particular with the men, largely men who are running those companies?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  That's really good question.  I don't know the straight answer I can give you.  I think a character.  When I invest my money over the long term, I know I can't possibly know what's going to happen in 5, 10 years.  But I can look at the corporate culture, I guess that's where giving else.  A good corporate culture should have depth, strong managers, truly strong managers, shouldn't be afraid of having people alongside them from replacing.  That's the whole idea.  </p><p>      And I think that's a good way to buy stocks.  You might want to find a good industry.  But find a good industry that's being run by good men and women, who bring up good men and women internally.  And I think you have -- it could be a fair of good investment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  And so, you have that in financials done or are you just talking about another industry?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  We're talking industries in general and some financials --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  I'm not assuming bad that I don't believe you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK.  So which industries do you think are doing better in terms of succession but also, you know, having fewer legacy issues?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  Well, the fundamentals were -- I think the fundamentals will come through.  I think health care is a great sort of hard (ph) parts had collision between an Asian population like myself, improving health care, technology, and representative markers that can vote the money towards the people who need it.  </p><p>      I think technology, which we've been talking about, business to business technology, I think you're going to see wage pressures in the next few years.  And the only way to cheapskates around corporations are going to let that go through is that they can prove productivity somehow, and that means spending on technology.  </p><p>      We mentioned financials, and for sure down in our value, I still think, well it was pretty good place to be.  I'm focused on the big high quality large paying dividend stocks in the oil industry.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  And those are mainly, which ones?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  Well, I can't name them.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  No, I know you can't.  But is it -- on which end, is it refinery or is it actually downstream? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  Well, the ones that are integrated, say a little bit of both.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  We'll leave it there, John Manley.  We'll come back with John Manley here in a just a moment.  Maybe talk a bit more about Washington, its effects on policy, a little bit more on central banking as well.  John Manley, Chief Equities Strategist at Wells Fargo joining us here on Bloomberg 1130 studios on Bloomberg Surveillance.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  David Gura and Francine Lacqua, Tom Keene off today.  This is Bloomberg Surveillance on Bloomberg Radio.  Brought to you by Invesco for concise market and economic insights, delivered to your inbox weekly, count on Invesco Global Market Strategist, Kristina Hooper, invesco.com/hooper to learn more.  </p><p>      Continuing our conversation here with John Manley, Chief Equities Strategist at Wells Fargo Funds.  And, John, let me just ask you about what we're seeing play out in Washington, D.C.  The result of this optimism after the election after the inauguration, safe to say, some of that is anticipated.  Why are we not seeing more of a market move as a result of that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  Well, fundamentals are getting better.  I mean that -- ex Washington, you're seeing earnings expectations arise after a long period of time where they really went nowhere.  Also, the fed is being beneficial I guess is the right word.  The fed is being very careful about what they do there.  Shown very, very strong high levels of awareness about what they do.  And the valuations aren't that bad.  </p><p>      I think the -- how shall I put this?  The intricacies of Donald Trump presidency were probably discounted the first 12 hours as president-elect.  And after that, we probably didn't have much expectation.  We may say things but I don't think we really believed or counted on him.  So hence, no negative surprises.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  How about the fed's balance sheet?  We've got more detail from the fed on how that's going to unfold, when it does begin to unfold the last meeting relatively soon.  It was the watch phrase that came out of the statement following it.  How that's that going to play out in your world?  How that's going to play in the equities space in particular?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  Well, it's a risk and therefore I think it proceed slowly.  Jenny Donell (ph) was on recently saying, you know, we don't really know exactly how this is going to play because we've never done something like this before.  What does a wise person, what does a wise man or woman do when they're in an unknown territory?  They move slowly and carefully and they check every step they make.  And I think that's what's going to happen.  I think a lot of lessons from the real world are going to be applied in the financial world. </p><p>      No guarantees right.  Maybe these are undoable but I think a lot of things that were supposedly undoable have gotten done in the last few years.  So, I think this -- it will work.  I'm optimistic.  I think the fed will be very, very careful in how they proceed.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  What do you mean by lessons, John?  So, you're talking about lessons from the real world being transferred in the financial world.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  Well, I mean -- I'm just taking at -- act the way you would in real life.  If you're on a dark path and you don't know where you are, you don't take big steps, you take small steps and check your footing every single step along the way.  That's what Janet Yellen will do the financial code (ph) enough in my opinion.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Right.  But the problem is that then financial stocks are always on notaire, right?  They're going from record high to record high.  What about then pausing and having a look right, left and center?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  Sure.  I mean I think that's possible.  I've learned enough to -- since I can't really predict 5 percent or 10 percent pullbacks with any sort of accuracy, I just sort of assumed they're a part, they're a cost of earning equities for the long term.  I think it's a worthwhile cost which I think equities and the delivers as pure return over a long period of time to very patient investors.  </p><p>      But you cannot expect to know every little wiggle and twist is going to be.  So it could easily be a 5 percent correction because of something that goes slightly wrong, a 10 percent correction.  But I think it will be done right at the end of the day.  And when it's done right, there's a lot of room for these stocks to be meaningfully higher.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  John Manley, we've talked about financials a few minutes ago.  Let me ask about a couple of other sectors.  I'll start with technology.  When you look at tech with large, do you think that it's fairly valued right now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  If I understood half of it, I'd probably say it was fairly -- you know, the really big ones are really expensive ones --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  -- there's a lesson to those.  I learned this back in the late '90s.  The valuations may be frightening.  The valuations maybe frightening but evaluations at the end of the day isn't what's it.  The valuations will not tell you.  They may win you.  </p><p>      Every time I've seen a highly valued, high growth country or company or industry blow up solely because valuation, it was like watching a man fall down and up escalator.  You may fall but you get pulled harder, almost always buying opportunities.  And I saw that to the late '90s.  </p><p>      And it's because the surprise is -- if stock goes down and the earnings expectations go up, you sort of have a correction double click in the stock.  All right, it was ahead of itself is now 30 percent cheaper.  People buy into it.  You go tweet this a few times. People become less ordered by valuations.  </p><p>      So, watch valuations always they can trip you up but I don't think it's more than a trip.  Focus, I would say, on the business to business -- the real spending in tech over the next several years is going to be by business to make their workers more productive so they can pay them more.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  And thank you very much there would be escalated.  Let me ask you lastly about health care.   We're a point where the government -- where the administration is evaluating whether or not to continue with a subsidies on some levels of insurance.  Obviously, had the big debate over health care.  Your keen on health care overall, when you look at this as a sector?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  Right.  You know, falling down and not escalate naturally leads to health care, I would say.  Yes, I think too, it's a great story.  To me, it is a business where you have rising demand, you have rising supply of things that can be done, and you have an electoral process.  Let's people vote themselves into healthcare.  </p><p>      Health care is percent of GDP, I think, must or will have to rise.  That's my opinion.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  John, pretty quickly.  Are you concerned about China? We seem to be in the benign belief that China is fine.  What if it were and what is that do to U.S. stocks?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANLEY</emphasis>:  That's a lot of problems.  And we still want to get too close to the Yellow River.  That happened before I was born.  Nothing good comes with that.  Again, we have some slowly here -- the North Korean/China situation is one of the unknowables out there.  And it is a big disconcerting at this point in time.  It's heating up.  </p><p>      My guess is, is if we do anything, it will be decisive and very quick but you'll never know about these things as it's just the risk that you just have to live with the time being.        </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right.  Thank you so much just for joining us.
