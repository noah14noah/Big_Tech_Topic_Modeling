Facebook, Google and the other digital giants are under substantial pressure after the New Zealand massacre was livestreamed on Facebook and then re-uploaded millions of times. Since then, the Australian government has proposed new legislation, including prison time for executives and billions of dollars in fines, should platforms not rapidly remove \"abhorrent violent material\".</p><p>Mr Walker declined to comment on the legislation, saying he was yet to see it, but acknowledged the reaction globally to the events in Christchurch had been significant.</p><p>\"I think there's no question that the pendulum has swung from the relatively uncritical support of technology to significant concerns about unintended side effects and abuses of technological platforms,\" he said.</p><p>In response to the events in New Zealand, he said the search giant was rethinking some of its technology to stop terrorists online. \"We're working on the question of limits on livestreaming [and] other things we can do to be able to quickly respond to these kinds of attacks on our systems,\" Mr Walker said.</p><p>He admitted that videos of terrorist attacks were \"not a new development\" but said the difference this time was how many people were re-uploading the footage in a co-ordinated way.</p><p>\"That's what created the challenges in removing so much. We saw tens of thousands of uploads, Facebook saw many more than that, which effectively overwhelmed the system, which had effectively been satisfactory up until that point,\" he said. \"We're now trying to build systems that allow us to respond quickly in the event of these kinds of attacks or state-sponsored attacks or other sorts of things on the platform.\" Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims on Sunday welcomed Mr Zuckerberg's \"recognition\" that big tech companies such as Facebook and Google \"have to be accountable for what people see [on their platforms]\".

This might seem uncontroversial, but it flies in the face of a tech sector long obsessed with rapid growth and sometimes on disruption as an end in itself.</p><p>While sweeping digital transformation holds great promise, we have reached an inflection point. The world has turned information technology into both a powerful tool and a formidable weapon, and new approaches are needed to manage an era defined by even more powerful inventions like artificial intelligence. Companies that create technology must accept greater responsibility for the future, and governments will need to regulate technology by moving faster and catching up with the pace of innovation.</p><p>In Tools and Weapons, Brad Smith and Carol Ann Browne bring us a captivating narrative from the cockpit of one of the world's largest and most powerful tech companies as it finds itself in the middle of some of the thorniest emerging issues of our time.</p><p>These are challenges that come with no preexisting playbook, including privacy, cybercrime and cyberwar, social media, the moral conundrums of artificial intelligence, big tech's relationship to inequality, and the challenges for democracy, far and near.</p><p>While in no way a self-glorifying \"Microsoft memoir,\" the book pulls back the curtain remarkably wide onto some of the company's most crucial recent decision points as it strives to protect the hopes technology offers against the very real threats it also presents. There are huge ramifications for communities and countries, and Brad Smith provides a thoughtful and urgent contribution to that effort.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Category: Business | Technology</p><p>Hardcover</p><p>Sep 10, 2019 | 368 Pages</p><p>Ebook</p><p>Sep 10, 2019 | 368 Pages</p><p>Audiobook Download</p><p>Sep 10, 2019 | 672 Minutes</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6848925 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6848925</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1D-FXH1-JC11-11BJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"354\"/><timeReceived>8:50 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

There are now twenty-six millennials in Congress-a fivefold increase gained in the 2018 midterms alone. They are governing Midwestern cities and college towns, running for city councils, and serving in state legislatures. They are acting urgently on climate change (because they are going to live it); they care deeply about student debt (because they have it); they are utilizing big tech but still want to regulate it (because they understand how it works). In The Ones We've Been Waiting For, TIME correspondent Charlotte Alter defines the class of young leaders who are remaking the nation-how grappling with 9/11 as teens, serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, occupying Wall Street and protesting with Black Lives Matter, and shouldering their way into a financially rigged political system has shaped the people who will govern the future.</p><p>Through the experiences of millennial leaders-from progressive firebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg to Republican up-and-comer Elise Stefanik-Charlotte Alter gives the big-picture look at how this generation governs differently than their elders, and how they may drag us out of our current political despair. Millennials have already revolutionized technology, commerce, and media and have powered the major social movements of our time. Now government is ripe for disruption. The Ones We've Been Waiting For is a hopeful glimpse into a bright new generation of political leaders, and what America might look like when they are in charge.</p><p>About the Author</p><p>Charlotte Alter is a national correspondent for TIME, covering the 2016, 2018, and 2020 campaigns, youth social movements, and women in politics.

Professor Larry Backer of Penn State University writes in a 2018 paper that resistance to social credit systems in the West could be dissolved when the masses are 'socialized as a collective' and 'the great culture management machinery of Western society develop a narrative in which such activity is naturalized within Western culture.' </p><p>A 2018 paper written by prominent law professor Larry Backer of Penn State[2] discussed the ways in which a social credit system could be implemented in the West. Backer writes that the shift in law with this system will 'change the focus of public law from Constitution and rule of law to analytics and algorithm' In the paper, titled 'Next Generation Law: Data Driven Governance and Accountability Based Regulatory Systems in the West, and Social Credit Regimes in China[3]', Backer describes moves to social credit in the West as 'fractured', but gives guidance on how societal norms could be steadily pushed to accept this system. Backer proposes that the 'great culture management machinery' of the West normalize the idea of social credit and sharing private data. Backer writes: But is it possible to socialize the masses, or even mass democracy as a collective, to embrace this pattern of data disclosure beyond these immediately self-serving closed loop systems? Would it be possible for the state to develop systems for the enforcement of laws (criminal and regulatory) that depends on intelligence by inducing the masses to serve as positive contributors of data necessary for enforcement or regulation? The answer, in Western liberal democracies, may depend on the ability of the great culture management machinery of Western society- its television, movies and other related media-to develop a narrative in which such activity is naturalized within Western culture. As Big Tech and artificial intelligence creep further into our lives, a grid of high tech surveillance has entangled us. As if to pacify resistance, these systems (Google Home, Apple watches, Amazon Alexa) offer 'convenience' in the form of targeted ads, personalized content and other features. In reality, this system is meant to determine whether or not you will be allowed to function in modern society. The Trump admin is reportedly considering using this surveillance grid to monitor the population[4] for signs of mental illness, triggering authorities to confiscate firearms from 'dangerous individuals'. In 2013, Old-Thinker News asked the question 'Will Insurance Companies Use Smart Appliances to Monitor 'Unhealthy' Habits?[5]' As this 2013 Wall Street Journal[6] article stated, your insurance company: already knows whether you've been taking your meds, getting your teeth cleaned and going for regular medical checkups. Now some employers or their insurance companies are tracking what staffers eat, where they shop and how much weight they're putting on \u2014 and taking action to keep them in line. Artificial intelligence, programmed by power hungry individuals, is steadily taking over our society. It is already censoring political opinions. It will be making medical, education, and financial decisions. Humans are to be sidelined. The social credit system will be watching you closely for any deviant behavior. If you aren't careful, you will become an outcast. Access to food, transportation and medical care will be denied.Also Read from Activist Post: Want Cheaper Insurance Rates?

Authored by Daniel Taylor via OldThinkerNews.com,[3]  A.I. driven social scores to supplant constitution?    Professor Larry Backer of Penn State University writes in a 2018 paper that resistance to social credit systems in the west could be dissolved when the masses are 'socialized as a collective' and 'the great culture management machinery of Western society develop a narrative in which such activity is naturalized within Western culture'  A 2018 paper written by prominent law professorLarry Backer of Penn State[4]discussed the ways in which a social credit system could be implemented in the west. Backer writes that the shift in law with this system will 'change the focus of public law from constitution and rule of law to analytics and algorithm'  In the paper, titled 'Next Generation Law: Data Driven Governance and Accountability Based Regulatory Systems in the West, and Social Credit Regimes in China[5]', Backer describes moves to social credit in the west as 'fractured', but gives guidance on how societal norms could be steadily pushed to accept this system. </p><p> Backer proposes that the 'great culture management machinery' of the west normalize the idea of social credit and sharing private data. Backer writes:  'But is it possible to socialize the masses, or even mass democracy as a collective, to embrace this pattern of data disclosure beyond these immediately self-serving closed loop systems? Would it be possible for the state to develop systems for the enforcement of laws (criminal and regulatory) that depends on intelligence by inducing the masses to serve as positive contributors of data necessary for enforcement or regulation?The answer, in Western liberal democracies, may depend on the ability of the great culture management machinery of Western society - its television, movies and other related media - to develop a narrative in which such activity is naturalized within Western culture'.  As Big Tech and artificial intelligence creep further into our lives, a grid of high tech surveillance has entangled us. As if to pacify resistance, these systems (Google home, Apple watches, Amazon Alexa) offer 'convenience' in the form of targeted ads, personalized content and other features.  In reality, this system is meant to determine whether or not you will be allowed to function in modern society.  The Trump admin is reportedly considering using this surveillance gridto monitor the population[6]for signs of mental illness, triggering authorities to confiscate firearms from 'dangerous individuals'.  In 2013, Old-Thinker News asked the question 'Will Insurance Companies Use Smart Appliances to Monitor 'Unhealthy' Habits?[7]'  As this2013 Wall Street Journal[8]article stated, your insurance company:  'already knows whether you've been taking your meds, getting your teeth cleaned and going for regular medical checkups. Now some employers or their insurance companies are tracking what staffers eat, where they shop and how much weight they're putting on \u2014 and taking action to keep them in line.'  Artificial Intelligence, programmed by power hungry individuals, is steadily taking over our society. It is already censoring political opinions. It will be making medical, education, and financial decisions. Humans are to be sidelined. The social credit system will be watching you closely for any deviant behavior. If you arent careful, you will become an outcast. Access to food, transportation and medical care will be denied.

And now the defense contractors are going public with their displeasure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The counteroffensive began with a blunt rebuke in May by the head of Northrop Grumman, Wes Bush, who said the types of commercial technologies that the Pentagon is eyeing, \"being inherently broadly available, offers no national security advantages by definition.\"</p><p>Defense industry leaders aren't just offended by the implication that small hardware startups and tech giants such as Facebook and Google are outpacing them in ingenuity. More important, they argue, those companies don't have the slightest idea about military needs or understand how to navigate the Pentagon's acquisition system -- in short, to make their ideas reality.</p><p>Carter, a physicist with deep ties to academia who in 2013 advised a Silicon Valley computer data firm called Box, Inc., has established a Pentagon outpost in Mountain View, Calif., where Defense Department personnel will try to strengthen ties between the Defense Department and a roster of cutting-edge tech players.</p><p>He met with a series of them earlier this year on a West Coast trip and last week addressed a conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, that defense officials described as continuation of his outreach to the nontraditional players in private industry.</p><p>Also on POLITICO</p><p>Iran critics are illogical, Obama says </p><p>MICHAEL CROWLEY</p><p>But if Carter and the Pentagon really want to make progress, it's going to take a lot more work, say defense industry leaders, who warn it will be difficult for the Pentagon to buy hardware or software of the caliber it wants with the full support that it needs.</p><p>\"Silicon Valley folks? Their main focus is on speed to market,\" said Michael Daly, chief technology officer for Raytheon Cybersecurity and Special Missions. \"When you're making technology in the defense market, you also have to address other aspects, including mission assurance, acquisition compliance -- these things are important ... there's an overhead to that. That can slow you down if you're not structured to deal with it.\"</p><p>Products built for the military must comply not only with U.S. acquisitions law but international regulations for weapons, Daly said. Defense industry players get that. They also get that having the U.S. government as a customer can require long-term support that can be much more complicated than for commercial or even other government customers.</p><p>As an example, Daly cited a Patriot missile battery -- also built by Raytheon. The Army might own one for 30 years, he said, meaning it could need 30 years' worth of support to protect it from potential new cyber-vulnerabilities.</p><p>The Pentagon press office declined to respond to questions. But a defense official close to Carter argued that industry advocacy groups have publicly reacted favorably to the Silicon Valley proposals and that added competition should be welcomed by the establishment defense industry.</p><p>\"We want to see competition, and we want to be able to tap into the best ideas of industry,\" said the official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly. \"The nation's success is built on competition, and we want to see more of it.\"</p><p>The Pentagon is about to make an award on the new Long Range Strike Bomber to either Northrop Grumman or a Lockheed-Boeing team, the official added, and large contracts for upgrades to platforms are in the pipeline.</p><p>\"No one's saying that the big, industrial-base guys are not innovating,\" the official said. \"But, at the same time, there is no doubt a wealth of innovation in what is known at the cradle of innovation -- Silicon Valley -- that will ultimately have application to\" the Department of Defense.</p><p>Also on POLITICO</p><p>Iran deal: Big oil's mixed bag </p><p>SARA STEFANINI</p><p>No one expects the Pentagon to ask Google to build a new surface-to-air missile, but defense industry leaders chafe at the basic idea they can't deliver software or hardware as well as anyone, especially given the special requirements involved with a customer that can be as difficult as the military.</p><p>The much-hyped Silicon Valley push \"has rubbed a lot of people in the industry the wrong way,\" said one official with a major defense-focused services firm, \"when they decide to go [outside] the Beltway and quote-unquote 'foster new ideas.'\"</p><p>Carter's implication is the Pentagon's current slate of contractors can't come up with new ideas -- which is \"kind of a slap in the face to some of the cool things going on in industry,\" the official said.</p><p>Silicon Valley's startups and established tech companies aren't under the same regulatory constraints that defense industry leaders call a thorn in their sides -- piles of paperwork, audits and restraints on buying commercial, off-the-shelf parts for use on defense contracts. Tech companies won't be receptive to working with the Pentagon unless they're somehow exempted from restrictive regulations, some in the defense industry argue.</p><p>The Pentagon \"would go to Google, and Google would go: 'You want my margins to be what? You want my profit to be what?'\" the official said.</p><p>Carter, however, argues that the government and Big Tech can make it work by doing things in a new way. On a visit to Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., this spring to announce the outreach, Carter even joked about the Pentagon's legacy programs and vendors.</p><p>\"What's in it for Silicon Valley?\" the moderator asked him after his speech. \"Why enter DoD's acquisition system?\"</p><p>\"Well, I hope you don't have to enter DoD's acquisition system,\" Carter quipped, drawing laughter from the audience. One idea behind his outreach to the West Coast, he said, was to make it easier to work with companies on high-tech products, including cyber services and a major effort to create a new system for precision navigation and timing to help offset potential threats to the Global Positioning System.</p><p>The U.S. can't afford to continue buying high technology with old-style Pentagon programs, defense officials argue.</p><p>\"In order to sustain technological superiority, the department must take advantage of the rapid evolution of emerging commercial technologies that, when integrated with military systems and novel concepts of operation, will be a source of battlefield advantage,\" wrote Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work in a memo this month specifying the Mountain View operation.</p><p>The new unit \"will serve as the hub for the department's core initiative to increase DoD's communication with, knowledge of, and access to innovating leading edge technologies from high tech, startup companies and entrepreneurs,\" Work wrote.</p><p>In response, some incumbent defense firms said they've already begun their own Silicon Valley outreach efforts. Raytheon has one, Daly said, and the French defense, aerospace and airline security company Thales is seizing on Carter's push with its own innovation initiative, said Pete Roney, vice president for innovation and technology at ThalesUSA.</p><p>But parochialism in the U.S. defense industry is real, he added.</p><p>\"The primes [are] looking over at the Valley and saying, 'OK guys, just stay in your little box over there and go do Facebook stuff -- we'll work on defense,'\" Roney said. \"I think there is quite a bit of that sentiment.\"</p><p>San Jose, California is undergoing an urban development revolution calculated to keep it as the thriving heart of a region renowned for technological innovation. | AP Photo</p><p>Former Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.), who now represents several defense firms at the Washington law-lobby shop of McDermott Will &amp; Emery, argued that there's a cultural difference between defense firms and Silicon Valley. National security is a priority for the defense-industrial complex, whereas profit is a greater goal for technology companies.</p><p>\"The big defense firms that we work with, they don't commercialize the products that they make for the Pentagon,\" Moran said. \"They are very conscientious of maintaining security, of not letting people usurp the technological prowess that the Defense Department has been able to bring about. And it is kind of a different mindset -- Silicon Valley wants to go public immediately. That's their objective.\"</p><p>The difference in size between the defense market and the global market is one key reason why the historic ties frayed between the Pentagon and some of California's high-tech players. In the past, the U.S. government was the only developer and buyer of electronics or other such equipment. Today, with billions of cellphone and computer users around the world, the U.S. government by itself holds much less sway.</p><p>Despite consternation from the defense industry and skepticism by some tech watchers, there are successful precedents for outreach by the defense and intelligence worlds into the Silicon Valley orbit, said Randy Sabett, vice chairman of the privacy and data protection practice group at Cooley, a major law firm with many tech clients.</p><p>For example, in 2011 then-Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn unveiled his idea for a \"cyber accelerator\" program at the RSA conference in San Francisco. That effort yielded progress, Sabett said, as could Carter's.</p><p>\"These kinds of things take time,\" Sabett said. \"They're looking at broad changes, it seems ... there's more emphasis on changes than has been there in the past.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-120177</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GG3-B861-JDJ6-K2F3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1640\"/><timeReceived>5:12 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2015  Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>July 17, 2015 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC000DF30</classCode><className>BOX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002T15</classCode><className>RAYTHEON CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001U2S</classCode><className>NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>BOX (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>RTN (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NOC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CP</classCode><className>DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTFBQjNDMzE0RjU1NEVDREJERTlFQUU2OTkzN0VCMjk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUZFQjE4NzUwODAyNDUzMzgxQzIxMUNBMTg2RTc5MTI</classCode><className>US Department of Defense</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000461</classCode><className>DEFENSE CONTRACTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001141</classCode><className>MILITARY WEAPONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

AI ethicist: The Pentagon is seeking an ethicist to join its Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is overseeing the military's development of artificial intelligence, in part to address fears that such technologies could lead to fully automated weapons without human supervision. </p><p>2. Ransoming elections: The country's top cybersecurity agency is worried that local election systems could suffer from ransomware attacks and is asking states to take precautions, but the voluntary program could fall short of ensuring adequate security.</p><p>3. The Cloud as a utility: A group of House Democrats is pressing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to designate cloud services offered by top U.S. tech giants as utilities to protect the U.S. financial system from data breaches.  </p><p>4. Driverless directives: Key U.S. agencies are edging closer to drawing up mandatory rules governing the development and use of driverless cars, potentially moving away from a voluntary system that companies follow now.</p><p>FULL BRIEFING</p><p>1. Pentagon seeks an ethicist for its artificial intelligence center</p><p>The Pentagon is seeking an ethicist for the office that's overseeing the military's artificial intelligence technologies to consider the ethical implications of automated weapons systems, Air Force Lt. Gen. John N.T. \"Jack\" Shanahan, director of the Defense Department's Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, told reporters at a news briefing Friday. </p><p>\"In 35-plus years in uniform, I've never spent the amount of time I'm spending now thinking about the ethical employment of artificial intelligence,\" Shanahan told reporters. \"We take it very seriously.\" </p><p>The center will select \"someone who's an ethicist and not just a technical person\" to begin considering moral questions on what is and is not acceptable in the use of such technologies, he said. </p><p>The Pentagon also favors international discussion on norms and future rules of engagement on deploying weapons systems enabled by artificial intelligence, Shanahan said. The Pentagon is in discussions with the State Department on how to engage with allies and partners around the world on developing norms governing the use of artificial intelligence in military applications, Shanahan said.</p><p>Read more from my story here.</p><p>2. Cyber agency wants to help states combat ransomware targeting elections</p><p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency last week said it was worried that voter registration databases and other systems tied to elections could suffer from crippling ransomware ahead of the 2020 elections. </p><p>The agency's concern stems from dozens of ransomware attacks in the past year that already have shutdown city and county governments across the country, forcing many of them to suspend normal services until their computers can be restored. </p><p>\"Recent history has shown that state and county governments and those who support them are targets for ransomware attacks,\" Christopher Krebs, the agency director, said in a statement. \"Voter registration databases could be an attractive target for these attacks. A successful ransomware attack at a critical point before an election could limit access to information and has the potential to undermine public confidence in the election itself.\"</p><p>The agency is working with state officials and private companies to protect election databases and ensure they have a plan to respond to ransomware attacks, Krebs said. </p><p>The agency, part of the Homeland Security Department, has a checklist of things to do to prevent a ransomware attack and to recover from one. They include backing up data in devices that are not connected to the internet, updating and patching software in a timely manner, reviewing security procedures and plans to recover if attacked, and doing drills based on other ransomware attacks. </p><p>But the effort is entirely voluntary, and it's up to states to choose to work with CISA or not. </p><p>Leaving it up to the states to choose means the potential dangers of a ransomware attack on elections could remain unaddressed, Jake Williams, a former National Security Agency hacker and founder of cybersecurity firm Rendition InfoSec, wrote on Twitter. </p><p>\"The federal government won't be able to fix this and that's part of the problem,\" Williams wrote. \"I want to respect state's rights, but this might be the time to create mandatory federal standards around voting safety.\"   </p><p>3. Democrats ask Mnuchin to oversee Big Tech cloud products</p><p>Two Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee are pressing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to designate cloud services offered by three tech giants -- Google, Microsoft and Amazon -- as important utilities crucial to financial markets to protect the United States from data breaches.</p><p>The Democrats, Reps. Nydia M. Velazquez of New York and Katie Porter of California, asked Mnuchin in an Aug. 22 letter to convene a meeting of the department's Financial Stability Oversight Council to consider deeming Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services as \"systemically important financial market utilities,\" known as SIFMUs.</p><p>Velazquez and Porter said their letter was precipitated by the recent breach of Capital One Bank, which uses Amazon Web Services. The breach is estimated to have affected 100 million individuals in the United States. In 2018, Amazon Web Services was estimated to power roughly 40 percent of the internet, according to the Verge, including services such as Netflix and Slack.</p><p>\"While it has been determined that an error by Capital One enabled the breach, the incident raises new and serious questions about banks' and financial institutions' dependence on cloud services for their data needs -- and the risks these systems pose to the safety and stability of the financial system,\" the Democrats wrote.</p><p>Designating various cloud services as SIFMUs would \"subject the tech firms to enhanced oversight by the Federal Reserve to ensure a cloud failure of a leading financial institution would not create a catastrophic risk to the nation's financial system,\" the Democrats said.</p><p>The letter from Velazquez and Porter is available here.</p><p>-- Dean DeChiaro</p><p>4. Driverless car makers may face mandatory rules </p><p>The federal government has so far relied primarily on voluntary guidance to oversee the development of driverless cars and trucks, but that could change soon. </p><p>Last week was the deadline for sending public comments to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration about how they should regulate the industry.</p><p>Cars and truck have been developing varying levels of autonomy over the years, starting decades back with cruise control and today using an array of crash avoidance systems. </p><p>Read more from Jessica Wehrman's story here.</p><p>SCHEDULES</p><p>Check out CQ's daily schedule of congressional hearings and more.

Perhaps most importantly, programs operating under 804 authority are allowed to bypass the Joint Requirements Oversight Council and the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System, oversight bodies that critics say slow the acquisition process.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Air Force acquisition chief Will Roper, the former director of the Strategic Capabilities Office, has positioned his service as the leading user of the new authority, earlier this month employing 804 to launch development of the Air-Launched Rapid Response weapon and the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared satellite constellation.</p><p>In a promotional video for Defense Acquisition University, Roper said Air Force program managers are well aware of his affinity for section 804.</p><p>\"They have quickly realized that I love 804, and I do not like traditional acquisition plans that I'm not going to see complete within the next decade,\" he said. \"They have quickly realized don't bring in traditional acquisition and they have all realigned program plans around 804.\"</p><p>In July, Inside Defense obtained a list of programs the Air Force and the other services told Congress they are considering for 804 authority.</p><p>Along with the two programs begun earlier this month, the Air Force is contemplating using 804 for the B-52 Commercial Engine Replacement Program, the new light-attack aircraft, F-22 modernization and protected tactical enterprise services.</p><p>Roper said in the DAU video that if there is a developmental program that \"doesn't naturally lend itself to this authority, I haven't found it yet.\"</p><p>Bruce Jette, the Army's acquisition chief, also appeared in the DAU video and said his service wants \"product, not process\" and is \"looking very hard\" at using section 804 for the Future Vertical Lift program as well as some systems for directed energy, air defense and small missiles.</p><p>\"Part of this is culture,\" he said. \"Don't get perfect. Where's the good break point? Let's see what we can do in five years.\"</p><p>Critics warn of risks</p><p>But Frank Kendall, the former under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, said the new rapid prototyping authorities won't eliminate the complexities of technology development.</p><p>\"What determines how long a development program takes is the product,\" he told Inside Defense. \"Complexity and technical difficulty drive schedule. That can't be wished away. Requirements set by operators drive both complexity and technical difficulty. You have to begin there.\"</p><p>Kendall said it is possible to build some kinds of prototypes quickly if requirements are reduced and designs are simplified.</p><p>\"Whether an operator will want that product is another question,\" he said. \"It's also possible to set totally unrealistic schedules and get industry to bid on them. There is a great deal of history that teaches us that this is a really bad idea.\"</p><p>Andrew Hunter, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously ran the Pentagon's Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell, said he understands the appeal of section 804.</p><p>\"Section 804 authority clearly provides an alternative path in the acquisition system that exempts programs from many of the existing rules,\" he said. \"For this reason, it is appealing to those looking to streamline acquisition oversight and accelerate the initiation of development programs.\"</p><p>Like Kendall, however, Hunter said 804 authority is unlikely to alter the difficulty of technology development or the inherent need for trade-offs.</p><p>\"Putting the priority on delivering capability faster means compromising to some extent on one or more other traditional acquisition priorities such as unit cost, performance or sustainability,\" he said.</p><p>Hunter added that there aren't clear program oversight rules for section 804.</p><p>\"That is similar to the situation with [other transaction authority] where anything is possible, but the very lack of established rules means only a small cadre of experts currently feel comfortable using them,\" he said. \"I think, over time, the flexibility of section 804 authority will likely prove its particular value for certain kinds of development efforts, and a body of newer oversight mechanisms will develop optimized for those efforts.\"</p><p>Wooing Congress</p><p>Because 804 is such a new tool, it has yet to be tested with one of the most powerful audiences -- Congress.</p><p>Though lawmakers voted to include 804 in the FY-16 NDAA and have frequently pushed for faster defense acquisition, the Pentagon has yet to use 804 it in a meaningful way that leads to what most technology developers say is inevitable and, in many cases, desirable: failure.</p><p>\"Let's see what happens when they go before Congress with a $500 million failure and say, 'Boy, we sure learned a lot,'\" said one former senior DOD official.</p><p>Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee, said last week on the Senate floor the Pentagon needs to be more \"upfront\" with Congress about the costs of developmental weapon systems.</p><p>\"Right now, every weapon system -- every single one of them -- is sold to Congress with a rosy scenario: technological breakthroughs at a modest cost,\" he said Aug 21. \"There is no difference between the sales pitch on a program that is easy to develop and one that is a giant risk.\"</p><p>Durbin said he has been told by Michael Griffin, who operates as the Pentagon's chief innovation officer, DOD officials are risk-averse because they fear bad headlines and testy congressional hearings.</p><p>\"He said that many members of the Department of Defense are afraid to be the last to say 'yes' to a program that may not succeed,\" Durbin said. \"If something goes wrong, failures are the subject of heated congressional hearings. We have seen that over and over -- from $20,000 toilet seats and similar scandals in the past.\"</p><p>Durbin, however, pointed out that congressional appropriators approved a record $95 billion for defense research and development in fiscal year 2019 -- the highest level in history, even when adjusted for inflation.</p><p>\"Very often, the contentious hearings that Dr. Griffin spoke about are not the result of a failed test, but a broken promise,\" Durbin said.</p><p>Philip Anton, a RAND Corp. analyst who previously served as deputy director of DOD's Acquisition Policy Analysis Center, said lawmakers will be \"tested\" as to whether they truly want the Pentagon to move faster, take bigger risks and pursue leap-ahead technology to offset gains made by China and Russia.</p><p>\"At some point, you can't get it both ways,\" he said. \"It's still acquisition, it's still bleeding edge, there are still going to be issues that crop up.\"</p><p>Still, Anton stressed that many 804 supporters say rapid prototyping will expose and \"burn down\" risk early enough in a program for acquisition executives to terminate it, rather than authorize programs built around unproven technologies that could lead to catastrophic failures, like the Army's Future Combat Systems effort.</p><p>\"Be aggressive about it,\" Anton advised. \"If the technology didn't work in the prototype, kill it. Don't wait. Hopefully, the prudence will be there.\"</p><p>That \"prudence\" involves a data collection and analytics strategy currently being discussed at the Pentagon.</p><p>Alan Shaffer, nominated to be deputy under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in answers to advance policy questions that \"maintaining visibility\" into 804 prototyping would be vital to ensure the authority is properly used.</p><p>\"I understand that USD(A&amp;S) is currently working with the military departments and military services and other users of the 804 authority to develop a data collection and analytic process that will enable the department to have insight into how these projects are being managed and executed,\" he wrote.</p><p>USD A&amp;S Ellen Lord released interim guidance in April encouraging the use of section 804, and military services have followed suit. Final implementation guidance is expected in January that may contain additional details on DOD's 804 oversight structure.</p><p>'Cultural change' required</p><p>Maryann Watson, an administrator at DAU, has begun efforts to train and educate DOD's acquisition program managers on how to use section 804.</p><p>She said the video Roper and Jette made \"really shows that senior leaders have given a lot of thought to the value of this and how they approach it so they don't lose the authority.\"</p><p>Watson said she would be interested to see how \"creative\" program managers are able to be in applying 804.</p><p>\"There's a great deal of potential,\" she said. \"Hopefully, it will free up people to think differently about what they're allowed to do and, more importantly, what they're encouraged to do.\"</p><p>Lynne Giordano, professor of acquisition management at DAU, said one of the key features of the authority is that it allows program managers to start with a \"blank sheet of paper\" and add existing aspects of federal acquisition regulation as needed, rather than start with DOD's massive set of regulations and tailor them down.</p><p>Giordano said, however, that successful use of 804 would require \"cultural change\" in the department and Congress.</p><p>\"It's what happens when there is that first failure,\" she said. \"Because they are saying they are trying to move to the left and do the hard things first.\"</p><p>Shaffer told the Senate Armed Services Committee that, if confirmed to be Lord's deputy, he would encourage \"speed to field,\" while practicing proper risk management through rapid prototyping.</p><p>\"One thing that I believe is that advanced technology adds cost, schedule, and performance risk,\" he wrote. \"The bigger the technology advancement, the greater the risk.

Perhaps most importantly, programs operating under 804 authority are allowed to bypass the Joint Requirements Oversight Council and the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System, oversight bodies that critics say slow the acquisition process.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Air Force acquisition chief Will Roper, the former director of the Strategic Capabilities Office, has positioned his service as the leading user of the new authority, earlier this month employing 804 to launch development of the Air-Launched Rapid Response weapon and the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared satellite constellation.</p><p>In a promotional video for Defense Acquisition University, Roper said Air Force program managers are well aware of his affinity for section 804.</p><p>\"They have quickly realized that I love 804, and I do not like traditional acquisition plans that I'm not going to see complete within the next decade,\" he said. \"They have quickly realized don't bring in traditional acquisition and they have all realigned program plans around 804.\"</p><p>In July, Inside Defense obtained a list of programs the Air Force and the other services told Congress they are considering for 804 authority.</p><p>Along with the two programs begun earlier this month, the Air Force is contemplating using 804 for the B-52 Commercial Engine Replacement Program, the new light-attack aircraft, F-22 modernization and protected tactical enterprise services.</p><p>Roper said in the DAU video that if there is a developmental program that \"doesn't naturally lend itself to this authority, I haven't found it yet.\"</p><p>Bruce Jette, the Army's acquisition chief, also appeared in the DAU video and said his service wants \"product, not process\" and is \"looking very hard\" at using section 804 for the Future Vertical Lift program as well as some systems for directed energy, air defense and small missiles.</p><p>\"Part of this is culture,\" he said. \"Don't get perfect. Where's the good break point? Let's see what we can do in five years.\"</p><p>Critics warn of risks</p><p>But Frank Kendall, the former under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, said the new rapid prototyping authorities won't eliminate the complexities of technology development.</p><p>\"What determines how long a development program takes is the product,\" he told Inside Defense. \"Complexity and technical difficulty drive schedule. That can't be wished away. Requirements set by operators drive both complexity and technical difficulty. You have to begin there.\"</p><p>Kendall said it is possible to build some kinds of prototypes quickly if requirements are reduced and designs are simplified.</p><p>\"Whether an operator will want that product is another question,\" he said. \"It's also possible to set totally unrealistic schedules and get industry to bid on them. There is a great deal of history that teaches us that this is a really bad idea.\"</p><p>Andrew Hunter, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously ran the Pentagon's Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell, said he understands the appeal of section 804.</p><p>\"Section 804 authority clearly provides an alternative path in the acquisition system that exempts programs from many of the existing rules,\" he said. \"For this reason, it is appealing to those looking to streamline acquisition oversight and accelerate the initiation of development programs.\"</p><p>Like Kendall, however, Hunter said 804 authority is unlikely to alter the difficulty of technology development or the inherent need for trade-offs.</p><p>\"Putting the priority on delivering capability faster means compromising to some extent on one or more other traditional acquisition priorities such as unit cost, performance or sustainability,\" he said.</p><p>Hunter added that there aren't clear program oversight rules for section 804.</p><p>\"That is similar to the situation with [other transaction authority] where anything is possible, but the very lack of established rules means only a small cadre of experts currently feel comfortable using them,\" he said. \"I think, over time, the flexibility of section 804 authority will likely prove its particular value for certain kinds of development efforts, and a body of newer oversight mechanisms will develop optimized for those efforts.\"</p><p>Wooing Congress</p><p>Because 804 is such a new tool, it has yet to be tested with one of the most powerful audiences -- Congress.</p><p>Though lawmakers voted to include 804 in the FY-16 NDAA and have frequently pushed for faster defense acquisition, the Pentagon has yet to use 804 it in a meaningful way that leads to what most technology developers say is inevitable and, in many cases, desirable: failure.</p><p>\"Let's see what happens when they go before Congress with a $500 million failure and say, 'Boy, we sure learned a lot,'\" said one former senior DOD official.</p><p>Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee, said last week on the Senate floor the Pentagon needs to be more \"upfront\" with Congress about the costs of developmental weapon systems.</p><p>\"Right now, every weapon system -- every single one of them -- is sold to Congress with a rosy scenario: technological breakthroughs at a modest cost,\" he said Aug 21. \"There is no difference between the sales pitch on a program that is easy to develop and one that is a giant risk.\"</p><p>Durbin said he has been told by Michael Griffin, who operates as the Pentagon's chief innovation officer, DOD officials are risk-averse because they fear bad headlines and testy congressional hearings.</p><p>\"He said that many members of the Department of Defense are afraid to be the last to say 'yes' to a program that may not succeed,\" Durbin said. \"If something goes wrong, failures are the subject of heated congressional hearings. We have seen that over and over -- from $20,000 toilet seats and similar scandals in the past.\"</p><p>Durbin, however, pointed out that congressional appropriators approved a record $95 billion for defense research and development in fiscal year 2019 -- the highest level in history, even when adjusted for inflation.</p><p>\"Very often, the contentious hearings that Dr. Griffin spoke about are not the result of a failed test, but a broken promise,\" Durbin said.</p><p>Philip Anton, a RAND Corp. analyst who previously served as deputy director of DOD's Acquisition Policy Analysis Center, said lawmakers will be \"tested\" as to whether they truly want the Pentagon to move faster, take bigger risks and pursue leap-ahead technology to offset gains made by China and Russia.</p><p>\"At some point, you can't get it both ways,\" he said. \"It's still acquisition, it's still bleeding edge, there are still going to be issues that crop up.\"</p><p>Still, Anton stressed that many 804 supporters say rapid prototyping will expose and \"burn down\" risk early enough in a program for acquisition executives to terminate it, rather than authorize programs built around unproven technologies that could lead to catastrophic failures, like the Army's Future Combat Systems effort.</p><p>\"Be aggressive about it,\" Anton advised. \"If the technology didn't work in the prototype, kill it. Don't wait. Hopefully, the prudence will be there.\"</p><p>That \"prudence\" involves a data collection and analytics strategy currently being discussed at the Pentagon.</p><p>Alan Shaffer, nominated to be deputy under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in answers to advance policy questions that \"maintaining visibility\" into 804 prototyping would be vital to ensure the authority is properly used.</p><p>\"I understand that USD(A&amp;S) is currently working with the military departments and military services and other users of the 804 authority to develop a data collection and analytic process that will enable the department to have insight into how these projects are being managed and executed,\" he wrote.</p><p>USD A&amp;S Ellen Lord released interim guidance in April encouraging the use of section 804, and military services have followed suit. Final implementation guidance is expected in January that may contain additional details on DOD's 804 oversight structure.</p><p>'Cultural change' required</p><p>Maryann Watson, an administrator at DAU, has begun efforts to train and educate DOD's acquisition program managers on how to use section 804.</p><p>She said the video Roper and Jette made \"really shows that senior leaders have given a lot of thought to the value of this and how they approach it so they don't lose the authority.\"</p><p>Watson said she would be interested to see how \"creative\" program managers are able to be in applying 804.</p><p>\"There's a great deal of potential,\" she said. \"Hopefully, it will free up people to think differently about what they're allowed to do and, more importantly, what they're encouraged to do.\"</p><p>Lynne Giordano, professor of acquisition management at DAU, said one of the key features of the authority is that it allows program managers to start with a \"blank sheet of paper\" and add existing aspects of federal acquisition regulation as needed, rather than start with DOD's massive set of regulations and tailor them down.</p><p>Giordano said, however, that successful use of 804 would require \"cultural change\" in the department and Congress.</p><p>\"It's what happens when there is that first failure,\" she said. \"Because they are saying they are trying to move to the left and do the hard things first.\"</p><p>Shaffer told the Senate Armed Services Committee that, if confirmed to be Lord's deputy, he would encourage \"speed to field,\" while practicing proper risk management through rapid prototyping.</p><p>\"One thing that I believe is that advanced technology adds cost, schedule, and performance risk,\" he wrote. \"The bigger the technology advancement, the greater the risk. The crux of this question, I believe, is how should defense senior leaders think about and accept risk to allow greater technological advancement. This would represent a cultural change. However, I believe that more use of prototyping allow[s] greater technology advancement while retiring risk. If confirmed, I will advocate for more prototypes to support both introducing advanced technology into future weapons systems while reducing risk.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SITREP-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SITREP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T4H-RR41-DY0P-G298-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">391121</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1786\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inside Defense SITREP</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 27, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

He is not pretending. That was his body double in the car. He may die. The illness is a fake to win Christian sympathy.</p><p>To QAnon's followers, Covid is a deep-state Democrat trick to enslave the US and Trump's \"illness\" is tactical. So don't trust anything any more. We are in a maelstrom of information, spin and lies. No wonder there are six explanations for every apparently simple development.</p><p>Doctors have never known how to handle sick leaders. They said Britain's Boris Johnson was just fine and cheerful. When this proved untrue he was said to be dying. Bulletins merged into bullshit. Nothing was believed. Johnson had to bitterly protest his health  only this weekend.</p><p>When doctors lie about the fitness of leaders it matters to the security of the state. Woodrow Wilson's 1919 flu was critical to the outcome of Versailles. Churchill was ill as prime minister in the 1950s. The tendency now is to reveal all, but as Johnson and Trump show, any crisis is a gift to spin.</p><p>Viewers of the Netflix docudrama The Social Dilemma, by the Silicon Valley ethicist Tristan Harris, are appalled at the manipulative behaviour of the big tech giants, and at the billions susceptible to it. Social media is crafted as a colossal edifice of confirmation bias. It is institutionally mendacious.</p><p>No holder of liberal values - however defined - can defend the cruel anarchy of the web. We have been taken back to the time of the Salem witches, when an anonymous lie pinned to a church door was known to a whole village in minutes. True, the management of information became the privilege of ecclesiastical, political and commercial power. The profession of journalism evolved into one of mediating, editing, checking, censoring that dissemination. It sought, and to a degree succeeded, in creating trust in news.</p><p>That trust has all but collapsed under the barrage of unregulated \"platforms\". Their capacity for good has failed to match their evil. Even now they are undermining trust in any Covid vaccine. No politician dares curb them. It would be paradoxical if it took the illness of a president to finally subject internet \"news\" to the same regulation as has long disciplined the mainstream media. This must happen. The great editor in the sky must prevail. But how many witches will die first?</p><p>An old maxim holds that news is only as valid as its source. The advent of instant digital communication was supposed to free the conduits of information to a new age of objective reality, of incorruptible truth. This was rubbish. The internet turned information into something infinitely flexible and made its sources more powerful than ever before. The idea of instant validation and fact-checking defaulted to one of agency - who was checking the checkers? Mark Twain is still right. A lie is halfway round the world when truth is still putting on its boots.</p><p> Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-66539702</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610K-8KN1-DY4H-K0X1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"492\"/><timeReceived>2:43 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

He is a 28-year-old Australian. Officials say he announced his intentions in a long manifesto sent to the New Zealand Prime Minister's office just minutes before his killing spree. And this is how that suspect was taken down by police in Christchurch, 36 minutes after the shots rang out in the city on Friday.</p><p>Let's go live to New Zealand with CNN International Correspondent Alexandra Field. Alexandra, tell us about this suspect believed to have killed 50 people. Was he on any radar before this happened?</p><p>ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: He wasn't. He wasn't known to police, Ana. He wasn't on any watch list. That goes for authorities in New Zealand and also in Australia, where the 28- year-old man was from. Certainly, they know his name now, so does all of Christchurch. He is the only one arrested and charged in relation to the deadly attacks that unfolded on Friday around prayer time in the middle of the afternoon at two separate mosques.</p><p>So far, he has been charged with just one count of murder, which brings with a maximum sentence of life in prison. But certainly, authorities say he will face further charges. They brought three other people into custody in the immediate aftermath of the attack there, saying that they no longer believe that any of those three people have links to this attack, so all of their focus on the one suspect right now.</p><p>At the same time though, we're being told that security does remains high in Christchurch. People are still being told to be vigilant. And particularly, we know that security is high around mosques. Police say they need to be certain that there is no remaining threat here. Ana?</p><p>CABRERA: All right. Alexandra Field, thank you for the latest on the investigation. And so with the prime suspect in custody, New Zealand remains on edge. Security has increased at religious sights and much of the focus is now on the victims and their families.</p><p>One survivor posted a message on Facebook to his friends and loved ones.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WASSEIM ALSATI, MOSQUE ATTACK SURVIVOR: Hi, guys, how are you? I'm very sorry to miss your calls and text messages. I will not be able to answer anyone of you now. I am really tired, okay, guys? Please pray for myself, for me and for daughter [ph]. Of course, we all [INAUDIBLE] feel so much better, okay?</p><p>I'm just posting this video to show you that I am fully okay. Okay, guys? It's been a pleasure to know you all, guys. Thank you for all your support and all your help that you have given me so far. God bless you all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: The face of strength and courage. Aliya Danzeisen is the Muslim community leader and she is the lead coordinator for the Women's Organization of the Waikato Muslim Association. She is joining us now from Christchurch, New Zealand. Aliya, thank you for being here. My condolences to you, your entire community and all the people there in Christchurch. Give us a sense of how the Muslim community is coping with the aftermath of this tragedy.</p><p>ALIYA DANZEISEN, MUSLIM COMMUNITY LEADER: The Muslim community in Christchurch is surviving. We are taking a deep breath after getting the news last night of the list of the dead. And this morning, we're coordinating to begin releasing the bodies to be prepared for burial.</p><p>And so, there's been a breath this morning. People have been able to sleep a few hours. And now, we are preparing for what will be a very tough day.</p><p>CABRERA: I can imagine that. We have seen leaders and, really, people from all around the world, showing solidarity, condemning this attack and the anti-Muslim hate behind it. And yet, you have some far-right leaders who have used this as an opportunity to attack Muslims. What's your reaction to that?</p><p>DANZEISEN: Our reaction is more asking the leaders who are leading nations and are leading the communities to stand up and be the examples of what quality leadership is and to do the right thing.</p><p>[18:05:06]</p><p>And to not condone and support -- they will not support people like this, but also to put action to their words. It's good to say the right words, but it's more important to do the right thing. And when you see somebody doing something wrong, whether it's on the street, whether it's in a classroom or whether it's in your own parliament, you need to stand up and say, no, it's not acceptable. And you need to tell everybody in your community how a good person behaves because this is not what a good person does.</p><p>CABRERA: I love what you just said. It's as simple as that, standing up for what is right, treating others how you want to be treated. Given that there is anti-Muslim sentiment and attitudes out there, what do you think needs to happen? What do you want beyond people standing up against this type of thing? How do you break this?</p><p>DANZEISEN: Well, you start recognizing that Muslims are no different than any other person. We love, we care, we work, we support. And there are 1.7 billion Muslims in the world who have been working very hard for many years with little support from other communities. And you need to start with recognizing we're your neighbors, we're your doctors, we're educated, we support you. And instead of creating us into some other, we argue [ph].</p><p>And so we should treat us just like your brothers and sisters and look again at the good we have been doing and recognize, just like this person clearly had some mental problem, you know, we have been ostracized by a few in our community. And you wouldn't want that to happen here. And that's the same thing that we would ask you haven't done to us, but this has occurred.</p><p>And we are now becoming, in my opinion, what happened in the 1930s, in Europe, to the Jews, we are now that new hated community, and we shouldn't be.</p><p>CABRERA: Sorry you feel that way. Are you afraid?</p><p>DANZEISEN: No, I'm not afraid because New Zealand actually has been one of the most peaceful countries in the whole world, it's the most transparent country in the world, and ironically, the most Islamic country in the world.</p><p>In 2010, going forward, research was done on high compliant New Zealand is to Islamic values. We have been a very settled Muslim community here. And I am very safe here. And you will see people walking by me. I just came to this spot for this interview and people have been hugging me and tapping me on the shoulder, supporting me. And that's New Zealand. And I'm not afraid of New Zealand. I'm afraid of hate mongers who are in other places who are bringing that hate here.</p><p>CABRERA: Aliya Danzseisen, your voice is powerful, it's important and thank you for sharing your thoughts and your presence with us.</p><p>DANZSEISEN: [INAUDIBLE]. Thank you.</p><p>CABRERA: Thank you. Houses of worship are supposed to be scared places of reflection, of spiritual restoration where you can let your guard down. It's supposed to be peaceful, no matter what religion you are, or are not. No one really goes to a church or a synagogue or a mosque expecting to be terrorized, to see dozens of their fellow worshippers gunned down. And yet, this week, 50 people were massacred at two New Zealand mosques.</p><p>The suspect accused of executing them described as extremist and linked to a white supremacist manifesto. Dozens of people are hospitalized, including young children with gunshot wounds. I want to repeat that, young children with gunshot wounds. The Anti-Defamation League calls the shootings, quote, the latest indication that violent white supremacists pose an international terrorist threat. And extremists around the world can inspire others like never before.</p><p>Here in the U.S., the FBI says hate crimes are on the rise. Of the religious hate crimes in 2017, nearly 20 percent were anti-Muslim. Also a recent uptick in domestic terror arrest, nearly 25 in just the last three months of 2018. A senior FBI official calls it one of the highest arrest quarters in the last few years related to domestic terrorism. The FBI source adding that those domestic terror arrests include but are not limited to far-right white nationalists.</p><p>Now, terror striking a Pittsburgh late last year believed to be the deadliest attack ever on a Jewish community inside the U.S.</p><p>[18:10:01]</p><p>The suspect, a 46-year-old white man shouting anti-Semitic slurs, opening fire, killing 11 people, that was in October. Authorities say he had no criminal history.</p><p>And according to the Global Terrorism Index between 2013 and 2017, there were 113 attacks and 66 people killed by far-right groups and individuals in Western Europe and North America. In 2013, there was one death related to right wing extremism. In 2017, there were 17 deaths.</p><p>And I want to read you this. This was posted Friday by a high profile former FBI special agent by the name of Ali Soufan, who investigated events surrounding 9/11, the USS Cole attack and other international terrorism cases. Soufan says, by every metric, right wing extremism is the most serious terrorist threat facing the U.S. and the west.</p><p>President Trump clearly condemned the New Zealand mosque shootings with his Oval Office remarks and on Twitter, but the President punted when a reporter asked about white supremacist. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REPORTER: Do you see today white nationalism as a rising threat around the world?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT: I don't really. I think it's a small group of people that have very, very serious problems. I guess if you look at what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that's a case. I don't know enough about it yet. They are just learning about the person and the people involved. But, it's certainly a terrible thing, terrible thing. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: With me now, CNN National Correspondent Sara Sidner, who has reported extensively on hate in America and CNN.com Contributor Dean Obeidalah, host of SiriusXM Radio, The Dean Obeidalah Show.</p><p>Dean, we've talked a lot about hate and anti-Muslim sentiment. I'm curious to get your reaction to the President really downplaying white nationalism.</p><p>DEAN OBEIDALAH, CNN.COM OPINION CONTRIBUTOR: You know, the only thing here that he did was downplay white nationalism, that would be something else. But the fact he has ginned up hate against the Muslim community in this country during the campaign, early in the campaign, saying Muslims cheered on 9/11 in New Jersey, which even Rudy Giuliani said it was not true to saying Islam hates us, so, of course, calling for a complete ban on Muslims. And as President, he re-Tweeted U.K. anti-Muslim hate groups. So he has made our lives more difficult.</p><p>And look at his Tweets about this. He said, we stand with New Zealand, great sentiment. He didn't say, we stand with Muslims. He didn't say, I stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Muslim community. He won't. He did not say, I denounce white supremacists terrorism. He won't, because, politically, it doesn't help him. Trump is about what helps him personally and politically. He needs white supremacists. This is a man who re-Tweeted, white supremacists, join the campaign, including one who had a Twitter handle, white genocide. This is a man who came on this network when Jake Tapper asked, will you denounce David Duke, he refused to denounce David Duke and played games.</p><p>So see an uptick that is qualified, that's subjective of white supremacist terrorism. And Donald Trump's words are playing a role and inspiring some of that. Ultimately, the person who does the act is responsible, but we don't live in a vacuum. Words matter. The words of the President matter a lot, they go around the world. So it's worse than him not condemning it, he has ginned in this country.</p><p>CABRERA: Words do matter, Sara. You have done a lot of reporting. You have talked to so many people on all sides of this topic, including white supremacists. What do they hear in the words from this president?</p><p>SARA SIDNER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's pretty clear. What they hear is support. Even though every now and then, the President will condemn the actions of white nationalists, neo-Nazis, white supremacists. There is always a hesitation there when you talked about both sides during the Charlottesville argument. People saw that as, look, we know he can't overtly support us, but we feel supported by some of the things he says, some of the people he re-Tweets, some of the word choice that he used, which is very similar or exactly the same as what some white nationalist and the way they put things and talking about white genocide, right? And you re-Tweet someone that has white genocide in their handle. It is a message.</p><p>And white nationalists, neo-Nazis, KKK members, they're all looking for signs because they know that being overt about it, you will get condemned. But being covert about it and trying to send signals, and that's kind of how they feel, that they have been sent a signal from the President who talks in terms of invaders when he's talking about immigrants, when he's talking about immigration, he uses the word, invaders.</p><p>What we see in this so-called manifesto, 67 times, I counted the word invade or invaders or invasion was used. This is someone whose certainly been hearing those words. And they do translate. People start using those. What happened in Pittsburgh? I was there. I talked to those who suffered the most, people who saw their friends killed, people who had family members killed. And the word that was used by the person who did this, he used the word, invaders.</p><p>So you can see the words being used. You can see people reacting to what the President of the United States is saying. And he's not the only one, to be fair. There are other leaders.</p><p>[18:15:00]</p><p>There are other politicians who are saying some of these same kinds of things, making everyone else the other and saying, look, we are worried about our white counter parts, we're worried about white people. We are being killed, which is simply false.</p><p>CABRERA: Here is something else the President said yesterday in response to this attack specifically.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Today, I spoke with Prime Minister Ardern of New Zealand to express the sorrow of our entire nation following the monstrous terror attacks at two mosques. These sacred places of worship were turned into scenes of evil killing. You have been all seeing what went on. It's a horrible, horrible thing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: So, Dean, I wanted to play that because I know you've been very critical of this president. He does call out where these attacks happened. He called them terrorist attacks, monstrous terrorist attacks. He talked about the evil that was involved here. Did he say what he needed to say in that statement?</p><p>OBEIDALAH: I would like him to say, I stand with Muslims and I despise white supremacist terrorism. You know what, during his campaign, he said, we must say radical Islamic terrorism. If you don't say it, you can't solve it. Well, he has not said the words, white supremacist terrorism, and Donald Trump watches the news all the day. So if he's watching, I'll hope he will have the courage to Tweet, I denounce white supremacist terrorism, but he won't. And that's the political game that he plays.</p><p>And here's the truth. White supremacy isn't just academic discussion to me. They have come after me. In May 2017, I wrote an article saying, before Charlottesville, saying, Trump, call out the white supremacist terrorism because we had two incidents on our soil in the first few months of his administration. What happened, The Daily Stormer, the biggest neo-Nazis website and a website that loves this guy, fabricated Tweeting, I was involved in the bombing in Manchester, England that has just happened, wrote an article of these Tweets, and then said, confront me.</p><p>And I got death threats from Trump-loving white supremacists. And now, I'm suing them in federal court because I'm not a minority that's going to back down. This Muslim is not going to back down. No minority should back down to the white supremacists who love Donald Trump. We have to push against them any way that we can legally, of course.</p><p>CABRERA: And, Sara, as you know, the facts show, the data is there that this ideology is growing. These hate crimes, these terrorist attacks are growing. It's increasing.</p><p>SIDNER: They are growing. The President, in response to the question he was asked, whether he thought that white supremacist terrorism was a growing problem or white nationalist terrorism was a growing problem, he says, I don't think so. Look at your own statistics from your government agencies. I'm going to look at them. Here they are. This is from the Government Accountability Office. They took a look at all the attacks. And they said, look, after September 11th, September 12, 2001 to 2016, look at those numbers. Far-right extremists were responsible for 73 percent of deadly extremism.</p><p>Now, the numbers though are interesting because Islamist extremists responsible for far fewer attacks, but there were more people killed, so larger numbers of people killed. But if you were to look at the number of people killed by people who are Caucasian, who have white nationalist views, who have far-right views, who would like other everybody else but themselves by sort of white European people who look and sound like them, those numbers, 73 percent of the attacks are linked with that kind of ideology. It's dangerous. It's terrorism. I think a lot of times you hear people say, that was a hate crime. But if you really look at what's really happening with the ideology, it's terrorism. What happened in New Zealand was terrorism. And what has happened here in many instances on a smaller scale is terrorism.</p><p>CABRERA: Sara Sidner, Dean Obeidalah, thank you both for this important conversation.</p><p>As we continue to cover the investigation into the Christchurch attack, I want to take just a moment to remember the victims, the 50 people who were murdered as they gathered for Friday prayers.</p><p>This is Nain Rasheed [ph]. He was 50 years old. He had lived in New Zealand seven years and taught at a university. Both he and his 21- year-old son, Talha Rasheed [ph], were killed in this attack.</p><p>Khalid Mustafa [ph] came to New Zealand last year as a refugee from Syria. He went to the mosque Friday with his two sons, one of them just underwent a six-hour operation in the hospital.</p><p>And Jahi Dahud Nadi [ph] was born in Afghanistan, but moved to New Zealand more than 40 years ago seeking asylum. He had five children, four sons and a daughter.</p><p>[18:20:00]</p><p>[18:23:32] CABRERA: Of all the nauseating things that this killer did in New Zealand, this horrific massacre was broadcast, live as it happened, across the internet from a live streaming camera the shooter wore on his head. The nearly 17-minute video not only went out live but copies of it went viral, popping up all over the web as fast as service providers could take it down.</p><p>I want to talk to our Media Correspondent and Anchor of Reliable Sources, Brian Stelter, about all of this. So, Brian, what more do we know about this video, how it was streamed, who may have seen it and how it eventually was removed?</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Initially on Facebook live. That's the tool that anybody who has Facebook has. You open up your cell phone, click the live button and you can be streaming live on Facebook. In this case, this individual used that tool to stream as he was preparing to enter the mosque. And then as he entered, there was essentially a body camera type footage.</p><p>This was only seen by a small number of people live, usually people in his friends circle on the internet. But then it was shared and reposted and reposted all across the web in the hours afterwards. And this is the world's worst game of whack-a-mole. We have seen this before. Sadly, I'm afraid we'll see it again. It's the worst game of whack-a-mole because as soon as you post a video like this, I'm going to post it Facebook tries to take it down, then it gets reposted somewhere else. And it's a very difficult situation for these tech companies.</p><p>So you have to wonder why was it allowed up in the first place. Why Facebook's algorithms didn't catch this as it was happening.</p><p>CABRERA: And that's what I was going to ask, because you think about all of this. Facebook makes billions of dollars.</p><p>[18:25:01]</p><p>They say they are policing themselves. They're saying they're cracking down on sort of this -- this kind of regulation. And yet, they didn't catch a 17-minute killing spree. Why?</p><p>STELTER: That's right. And you would think that just based on the content of the video, including gunshots and gory imagery, wouldn't be algorithms have known what was going on. Well, in this case, the algorithms didn't. It wasn't until the New Zealand police contacted Facebook and said, look at this video, you've got to take this time. Then Facebook eventually took action.</p><p>Now, you could say that this might have been relatively quick by the standards of these tech companies. Sometimes YouTube and other sites leave it up for days that are troubling. Facebook has had a track record about this as well.</p><p>So you could argue this was quick by Facebook standards. But you still have to wonder, you know, on television, you're on live TV, you know, if there's something ugly happening in the world, it will be on a seven-second delay. Why isn't Facebook, in some way, incorporating some sort of system to detect this kind of violence and try to ensure people can't see it? Because the unfortunate result of Facebook not catching this in real-time live, it was then reposted and re-shared all around the world. Part of the problem, of course, it's a supply and demand problem. Millions of people seem to want to see this, and that's part of the problem.</p><p>CABRERA: Well -- and that's part of the criticism Facebook is also receiving and other social media sites, not just about how it responded or failed in this particular instance but, really, about how social media is being used to propagate other hatred.</p><p>STELTER: Right. That is the bigger story here. The best way I saw it described today was that, in the past, if some hateful person wanted to join up with others, they have to go in person to a KKK rally. Well, now, the rally comes to you. Now, you can live inside a KKK rally on the internet, 24/7. That's the real change. It's not that extremism hasn't existed before. Of course, it has. But the internet has supercharged extremism and these forms of hate.</p><p>Now, I would argue as a child of the internet, there's a thousand great things the internet has provided to our world. And, yes, there are 100 or 200 or 300 really ugly things.</p><p>And I think what people are feeling in the wake of this massacre is, what is Google, what is Facebook, what is -- what are these companies going to try to eliminate as much of the ugliness as possible while still providing all the benefits that we gain from these websites? That is the tension inside these Silicon Valley giants.</p><p>CABRERA: You have the more mainstream social media sites, like the Facebook, like the Twitter. But then there are dark, unmonitored places on the internet like 8chan that we're learning may have played a part in this massacre. No regulations, no rules, no restrictions. What more can you tell us about this?</p><p>STELTER: Yes. When you read the alleged killer's manifesto, you see a lot of references to online memes, online ideas, sometimes these are really dark jokes, the kinds of things that spread in these online communities, 4chan, 8chan. There are lots of message boards that people can log into. In some cases, just chat with friends, but in other cases, get radicalized by insane ideas that can make that person feel like they are part of a community.</p><p>Unfortunately, in this distributed world that we live in, pretty much anybody can put up a website. And yet I say unfortunately, but that's also the miracle of the internet. Again, the good --</p><p>CABRERA: And the beauty of democracy, which is the free speech that we all have. STELTER: I think this is the tension inherent in a situation like this. Sadly, we have seen live streamed murders before. We will likely see these again. What can the big companies, the big tech companies do to make sure that this is limited and this is controlled?</p><p>And then there's a broader issue about why people are seeking out these dark corners of the web in the first place. And that's an issue Facebook and Google can't solve. That's an issue for the society at large.</p><p>CABRERA: All right. Brian Stelter, as always, thank you very much. And make sure you tune in to Brian's show tomorrow morning at 11:00 Eastern here on CNN Reliable Sources.</p><p>Beto O'Rourke is the newest 2020 contender and his initials aren't the only reasons.

Save it a little longer, I may need it in a few weeks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: Biden is the featured speaker at a Delaware Democratic Party fundraiser this evening. Delaware being his home state. CNN Political Reporter Arlette Saenz is joining us now from Dover where Biden is set to speak. It looks like a full house there, Arlette. What are you hearing? Will Biden announce in his home state tonight?</p><p>ARLETTE SAENZ, POLITICAL REPORTER, CNN: Well, you can never say never with the former Vice President, but he's going to be here speaking on his home turf in just a short while as everyone wants to know the answer to that question, is he going to run in 2020, and you've heard his comments earlier in the week when he teased the firefighters, a very supportive group, say hang tight just a little bit longer. We'll see if he offers any further clues here in Delaware back in his home state.</p><p>But the current thinking right now is that the former Vice President would potentially announce his plans as soon as April. So the announcement may not be coming tonight, but we know that Joe Biden is in that final decision-making process as he gets closer and closer to a 2020 bid.</p><p>[18:35:03]</p><p>CABRERA: All right, Arlette Saenz, thank you. You will keep us posted if he makes any exciting news and we will bring that to our viewers. Now, the latest Democrat to enter the race for president is Beto O'Rourke. He's drawn comparisons to another Democrat, Barack Obama. And while there are ways that O'Rourke can claim to be like the former President, there are also a number of reasons he cannot.</p><p>And Harry Enten is CNN's Politics Senior Writer and Analyst, he's with us now. And Harry first let's stick through the ways you say they are similar starting with the ability to raise money.</p><p>HARRY ENTEN, POLITICS SENIOR WRITER AND ANALYST, CNN: I mean, look, Beto O'Rourke raised $80 million from individual contributors during his 2018 Senate bid and if you remember back to Barack Obama's presidential bid, the first sign that he was going to be a truly serious challenger to Hilary Clinton was back in the first quarter of 2007 where he basically matched her fundraising ability and then was able to out raise her the rest of the campaign. So raising money is one way in which they're very similar.</p><p>CABRERA: OK, so similarity number two, energizing young people and you have the data to back this up.</p><p>ENTEN: Yes. I mean if you look at the 2018 Senate bid of Beto O'Rourke, what you saw was he won a larger share of the pie among 18 to 44 year olds. A larger share of his vote was among them than the national average for democrats. Most Democrats nationally many more of their support was coming from those 45 and older but with Beto O'Rourke it was basically split evenly. Remember Barack Obama won that primary in 2008 because he was able to win young voters overwhelmingly despite losing overwhelmingly among older voters.</p><p>CABRERA: Similarity number three, ability to drive turnout.</p><p>ENTEN: Yes. I mean, look, Texas turnout is traditionally very, very poor. But if you look at 2018, you saw a much less of a drop-off from the presidential year versus the national average Texas saw much less of a drop-off. But if you look back at 2014 and you compare that midterm election to 2012, you actually saw, Texas saw a much larger drop-off than the national average. So O'Rourke was the mark he race in that year in 2018, so we think he's responsible for that.</p><p>And if you remember all the way back in 2008, one of the reasons pollsters got it wrong in Iowa, the 2008 Iowa caucuses was because they underestimated the turnout surge and Barack Obama was able to drive that up.</p><p>CABRERA: OK. So let's talk about how they differ now. First you point to polling position this early in the race.</p><p>ENTEN: Yes. I mean, look, if you look at the polls right now where Beto O'Rourke is, he is in fourth or fifth in Iowa and nationally. And I think if you go back to 2008, there's this idea that Barack Obama came out of nowhere but that simply put not true. Yes, he was behind Hillary Clinton in the early polls, but he was a very strong second place even when he entered at this point in the campaign he was polling about 20%. Beto O'Rourke at this point only around 5%.</p><p>CABRERA: Difference number two, having a signature issue. What do you mean?</p><p>ENTEN: Yes. What I mean by that is can someone tell me what Beto O'Rourke's signature issue is? I really can't tell. But Barack Obama back in 2008, right, yes, it was hope and change but he had meat on the bones. He was talking about the Iraq war. He was the only candidate, the only major candidate who opposed that war from the very beginning. If you look back at the exit polls, that was one of the main reasons he won. In fact without that issue, I think he would have lost that nomination fight to Hillary Clinton.</p><p>CABRERA: This one was really interesting, difference number three. Minority voter support. It was Obama's strength, but you say it may be a weakness for O'Rourke.</p><p>ENTEN: Yes. I mean if you look at Beto O'Rourke's primary performance in 2018, he performed worse than the southern counties in Texas. Those are the most counties that have the highest percentage of Hispanics in them. And if you look at his 2018 general election against Ted Cruz, the reason he came so close was he outperformed Hillary Clinton among white voters.</p><p>If you look at the exit polls that's true, if you look at where his support really came from in the counties, it was Dallas, it was Houston and he in fact - although he saw some outperformance in the Southern part of the State, it wasn't overwhelming versus, of course, Barack Obama. One of the big reasons he won that primary was because he had the overwhelming support of African-Americans.</p><p>CABRERA: Harry Enten, you always have good information on all things politics.</p><p>ENTEN: Well, I try. I spent my day at the computer typing in a spreadsheet, something comes, I get to spend some time with you on a Saturday night.</p><p>CABRERA: You're always so articulate. I wish I could just go off on stats like that off the top my head. Thank you so much.</p><p>ENTEN: Thank you, very kind.</p><p>CABRERA: All right, he took a stand once against President Trump and now Jeb Bush says Republicans ought to be given a choice arguing someone should challenge Trump in 2020. What he thinks it'll take to beat Trump? You're live in the CNN Newsroom.</p><p>[18:40:00]</p><p>More than a dozen Democrats have already thrown their hats in the ring to challenge President Trump in 2020, but in his own party can the President expect a challenger? CNN Senior Political Commentator David Axelrod talked about it with former Florida Governor and former presidential candidate Jeb Bush for a new episode of The Axe Files, watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID AXELROD, SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, CNN: You spoke at Governor Hogan's inauguration in Maryland.</p><p>JEB BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, I didn't realize I was a part of his pre campaign well.</p><p>AXELROD: Well, have you talked to him about it? Have you given him advice? And if not, this is a great opportunity, what advice would you give him?</p><p>BUSH: I don't know. I don't know.</p><p>AXELROD: It seems like a suicide mission, doesn't it?</p><p>BUSH: It does seem like a pill struggle, but I loved his inaugural speech because it talked about having to make tough choices and paying the price. His dad did it. He talked about John McCain. He talked about my dad and the civility and the courage to go against the tide at the right time, that integrity really mattered. It was a beautiful --</p><p>AXELROD: Does it sound to you like a prelude to a --</p><p>BUSH: When I heard it, I started to think, \"Oh, I guess I'm here.\" I was introducing him and I was honored to be there and I kind of got a sense that maybe this was an opening at least for him to consider it.</p><p>AXELROD: Do you think he should run?</p><p>BUSH: I think someone should run just because Republicans ought to be given a choice, but I think you're probably right based on the premise you had that he has a strong loyal base and it'd be hard to beat him. It's hard to beat a sitting President. But to have a conversation about what it is to be a conservative, I think it's important and our country needs to have competing ideologies that people - that are dynamic that focus on the world we're in and the world we're moving towards rather than revert back to the nostalgic time.</p><p>[18:45:06]</p><p>The Democrats now are proposing new ideas, some of which I think are way out there and if Republicans think they can just say that's bad and not offer a compelling alternative, that could be bad for us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: David Axelrod is with us now. David, we just heard Jeb Bush say someone should challenge Trump in 2020.</p><p>AXELROD: Yes.</p><p>CABRERA: You called it a potential suicide mission. So do you think someone actually will? AXELROD: Well, governor Larry Hogan of Maryland was the person we were talking about. He has openly discussed the possibility of challenging President Trump and it sounded very much like Jeb Bush was urging him forward in that race. Ana, I have been trying to get Jeb Bush to sit down with me for quite a while to reflect on his family and his campaign on where the country is and where he thinks it's going. And he was reluctant and then he changed his thinking and said, \"I want to sit down.\"</p><p>And he clearly have things on his mind and one of them was that he believes there ought to be a contest for the Republican nomination knowing that President Trump probably would win. But as he said, airing conservative views because he said he doesn't view Trump as a conservative. He doesn't view him as an ideologue. He thinks he's self-interested.</p><p>And while Bush said that he agreed with some of the things that Trump did, he had very strong disagreements and he aired them in this discussion.</p><p>CABRERA: And I've talked to a number of Trump supporters who will say, \"I don't agree with everything that he does, but I like his policies. I believe that he is doing what's best for the country in that realm.\" In fact, we have a lot of Trump's earliest critics up on Capitol Hill say Senator Lindsey Graham or Senator Ted Cruz who have come around and become some of his staunchest supporters. Will we ever see that from Jeb Bush?</p><p>AXELROD: Yes, Jeb, I asked him about this because I hear that a lot from Republican friends. Well, we got tax cuts, we got deregulation, we've got the Conservative judges. So if we have to put up a little incivility perhaps some skirting of the rules and the laws, that's OK.</p><p>He was very tough in response to that and offered a real admonition to those who subscribe to that theory that the price is too high to accept even for the things that he agrees with, the price is too high to accept this incivility, to accept this shredding of democratic norms. It seemed to me that was one of the things that he wanted to get off his chest.</p><p>CABRERA: Interesting. David Axelrod as always, thank you for being with us.</p><p>AXELROD: Good to be with you.</p><p>CABRERA: Don't miss The Axe Files tonight at 7:00 Eastern right here on CNN.</p><p>[18:50:00]</p><p>Parts of the Midwest are dealing with record flooding and bracing for more in the wake of the powerful Bomb Cyclone in addition to the seasonal snow melt. In Nebraska at least 37 people have had to be rescued from floodwaters and many communities across the region remain under flood warnings. The Missouri River is more than two feet above its flooding stage and continues to rise. The new four-part CNN Original Series Tricky Dick explores Richard Nixon's rise, fall, incredible comeback and political destruction featuring never before seen footage. Here's a preview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD NIXON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When I first met Kennedy was a Congressman. He was very intelligent. He was very personable. However, I sensed that he was very shy and frankly as I was. I rather thought that we were alike in that respect but we were very different in many ways.</p><p>He, of course, had all of the money he needed for personal purposes. He'd never had to fight his way up. You never had to worry about losing in a campaign or fear that he wouldn't have a job.</p><p>JOHN KENNEDY, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It is time, in short, for a new generation of leadership.</p><p>NIXON: He was one that attracted the people who wanted a young, courageous man in the presidency and yet one who is suave, smooth, and a debonair and graceful. Basically, that's the mark of royalty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: Richard Nixon on John F. Kennedy. Make sure you don't miss the premiere of Tricky Dick. It's tomorrow at 9PM Eastern right here on CNN. That does it for me. I'm back in one hour with more today's top stories in the CNN Newsroom. Thanks for being here.

What he was likely referring to this quote from New York congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez who said this about her position on migrants rights back in March. I think all these things sound radical compared to where we are, but where we are is not a good thing. This idea of 10 percent better from garbage shouldn't be what we settle for.</p><p>Today Ocasio-Cortez spoke out about the President's rhetoric at a town hall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK: Once you start telling American citizens to quote \"go back to your countries,\" this tells you that this president are not about immigration, it is about ethnicity and racism. He know that he has been thinking this the entire time but he has been keeping it in here and this week it went out here when he started telling American citizens, where are we going to go? We are going to stay right here. That's where we are going to go. We're not going anywhere.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: Our White House Correspondent, Boris Sanchez is Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, not far from where the President is spending the weekend.</p><p>All right, Boris. So President Trump's new position as of today at least is that the people chanting, send her back. This past week were just part of a patriotic crowd. Have there been any other changes since this morning?</p><p>BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Not yet, Ana. But clearly, the President sort of wants this both ways. Just a couple of days ago the President indicated that he tried to cut off these supporters and respond quickly when they started chanting \"send her back\" at this rally he was holding in North Carolina. The video obviously proves otherwise.</p><p>Now the President after having heard from sources inside the White House telling us that they have spoken to the President saying that this political battle could end poorly, the President now re-engaging saying that these supporters are actually great patriots. And in that re-tweet, we should point out, he's re-tweeting somebody who is actually praising these chants saying that \"send her back\" is the new lock her up, taking us back to 2016 and those chant against Hillary Clinton.</p><p>The President here clearly wants to make these Democrats appear extreme and to make them the face of the Democratic Party going into 2020, Ana.</p><p>CABRERA: All right, Boris Sanchez. Boris, thank you.</p><p>Joining us now CNN Contributor and National Reporter for \"The Washington Post\" Wes Lowery and Lynn Sweet, Washington bureau chief the \"Chicago sun-Times.\"</p><p>Wes, the President doesn't know if he's attacks are good for him politically and he says he's not focused on the politics of it. Do you buy that?</p><p>WESLEY LOWERY, NATIONAL REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, it's just not true. He did do this for political reasons. My colleagues at the Post have a great piece out today kind of breaking down the tick-tock of these last few days in the White House.</p><p>And the President told his advisers the reason he jumped in to this inner-party fight, we have to remember, before the President's racist tweets this was a fight between Nancy Pelosi and some of her moderates and some of these new young freshmen congresswomen. He jumped in because he thought it would be a good thing politically to further elevate these young women as the face of the Democratic Party. So he clearly did it for political reasons.</p><p>It's not surprising that he has been on every side of these issues. He is someone that's very reactive to the cable news coverage. And so when there was coverage and outrage, he was reactive to that. But then all of a sudden when there was coverage of walking back those statements, the President doesn't like those (INAUDIBLE) either.</p><p>And so clearly, this was a political move. Whether or not this was actually a shrewd move or something that would undermine him, I think we all have to wait and see. I think there is a lot of punditry around that. But it is unclear. There have been times when these clearly kind of racist and racially incendiary political place from the President have helped stoke his support, his entire career built of it. There are other times like before the 2018 midterm elections where it didn't help and the caravan had closing arguments and the Democrats swept into power and the house after that.</p><p>[16:05:52] CABRERA: Lynn, let's not forget the President himself has been critical of the country. Here are just a few of the examples.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: How stupid is our country?</p><p>We are so far behind the time. And by the way, the world is laughing at us because they can't believe these policies.</p><p>How stupid are the people of Iowa? How stupid are the people of the country?</p><p>Putin's a killer.</p><p>A lot of killers. We have a lot of killers. What? You think our country is so innocent?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: Lynn, he keeps saying these women hate the country. That's why he is, you know, on the attack against them. But we just showed you he has been very critical of what's happening in the country. He can do it, but others can't?</p><p>LYNN SWEET, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, CHICAGO SUN-TIMES: Well, don't look for consistency. Yes, he is a hypocrite on this issue. And the real damage that he's doing here is that he is not really walking it back. And I don't think we should be kidding ourselves just because he says some words and his lips were moving.</p><p>He still was sending a signal, a dog whistle. If you put it together between what he said and unsaid and said again and the tweets there is really no real reason to believe that he is not letting his supporters who want to chant a send her back chant that they wouldn't do it again. Nothing he has done since then shows you that he firmly wants to tell his followers this is wrong. This is not so.</p><p>No one gets sent back. And the criticism that you just showed in those clips that he is allowed to be critical and no one is to send him back to Scotland where his mother is from is just something they hope that the next person who interviews him asks, you were critical of the United States, Mr. President. Should you have gone to Scotland?</p><p>CABRERA: Well, he was asked about his double standard. Our Abby Phillip asked him essentially the same question I asked. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ABBY PHILLIP, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Why is it OK for you to criticize America, but not Democrats?</p><p>TRUMP: I believe all people are great people. I believe everyone is great, but I love our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: All people are great people, but he doesn't seem to feel that way about these four democratic women of color. Wes?</p><p>LOWERY: Well, sure. I mean, I think that when you understand the President's comments and the context of American history and the way that these types of -- not just chant, but this precise argument that if people of color aren't grateful for being here, if they are not glad that you got to come to America, that we are letting you in now, that you have these rights then you should go somewhere else.</p><p>It speaks to this historical grapple over who gets to be an American, who has full citizenship, who is fully enfranchise. You have to remember we are a nation where it's only been 50 or 60 votes where people like me even get to vote in our election or people look like Lynn or you get to vote in our elections, right.</p><p>This isn't a country that has historically has fully enfranchised all its people and that for generations there has been an ideology that says people who are different, people who aren't white should just be grateful to be here and they shouldn't complain. They shouldn't complain about the police shooting them. They shouldn't complain about the lynchings. They shouldn't complain about the lack of education. And if they do do that they don't love America and they should go. And so, do I think the President who certainly is no scholar of American history is sitting here thinking about all of this, no. But his reaction to these women, these outspoken women who have been critical of the country, but who serve their country as elected officials is the same response that outspoken people of color have always gotten in this country when they have the audacity that things here are unfair or things here should be better.</p><p>CABRERA: Such a good point.</p><p>Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh offered his take on all of this. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, CONSERVATIVE RADIO HOST: And yet some people at a Trump rally make some innocent chant borne of fun and Washington comes to a halt, and give her like oh, my God! Oh, my God! Did you hear -- it's nothing. That's why I hope Omar keeps talking. I hope Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, I hope they keep talking. I hope that Trump continues to succeed in making all of these people the face of the Democrat party. That would be great.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: Lynn, does Limbaugh's opinion represent the majority of Trump's supporters and how they feel about it, do you think?</p><p>[16:10:04] SWEET: I'm not sure if he represents the majority of Trump supporters, but certainly he speaks for his following and his following is part of the Trump base because they want to hear the kinds of things that they're saying.</p><p>But again, everybody see through it. Take it for what it is. Just a short time ago, the wicked face of the Democrat party was Nancy Pelosi. That seems like days gone by when you would say Nancy Pelosi, San Francisco liberal. And they are just finding people to demagogue.</p><p>So I just think in the analysis, Rush Limbaugh thought he was minimizing it, but it's don't be fooled. He actually was doing the opposite. He was calling attention to it and condoning it. It wasn't just a little fun. It was -- it's political. He knows it. And he is letting his listeners know that all this is OK.</p><p>CABRERA: All right. Lynn Sweet, Wes Lowery, good to have you both with us. Thank you.</p><p>SWEET: And thank you.</p><p>CABRERA: Fifty years since one giant leap. Coming up, the nation remembers the moment we all came together to watch man land on the moon. Here's how the mission is captured in the award-w new CNN film \"Apollo 11\".</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Turn back right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We copy you down, eagle.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Houston, the eagle has landed.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Roger. We copy you on the ground. We've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We are breathing again. Thanks a lot.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[16:16:09] CABRERA: How amazing that it has been 50 years since the whole world held its breath as Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins made history with Apollo 11. And today the Johnson Space Center in Houston is commemorating that one small step that was actually millions of intricate steps orchestrated by thousands of people to pull off a successful moon landing and a successful return to planet earth.</p><p>There are exhibit, music and notable speakers, but the marquee event is a live, interactive countdown to 9:56 p.m. central time, the exact moment that Neil Armstrong's boots first touched the lunar surface.</p><p>CNN's Rachel Crane is our business innovation and space correspondent.</p><p>And Rachel, you are at that space center. And it is so interesting to me that a lot of the people there today probably weren't even born when we landed on the moon? Why do you think this moment is so significant no matter your age?</p><p>RACHEL CRANE, CNN BUSINESS INNOVATION AND SPACE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Ana, I want to point out it is 17 minutes past the hour. This is the exact moment that 50 years ago Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were making that harrowing landing on the moon in the eagle, nearly running out of fuel. Their computers were having all kind of alarms. And so it was that moment 50 years ago that that landing occurred.</p><p>And here at the Johnson space center in the viewing room of the Saturn 5, it's filled with young people, people who like myself were not alive when we made that landing, when Neil and Buzz took those first steps. I think it speaks to the fact that this journey, it stands the test of time. I mean, it still remains to be the most ambitious and inspiring journey that mankind has ever made. We had a chance to speak to some of the people in the room. Take a listen to what they had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JANETTE GARCIA, MARKING MOON LANDING ANNIVERSARY: Because I feel this is an important day to celebrate. Not every day you come to celebrate the man landing on the moon, so I think this is very exciting. And I am so happy that they are doing this and that they are doing this for people so they know what NASA has been doing since 1969.</p><p>RICHARD DELEON, MARKING MOON LANDING ANNIVERSARY: This is just amazing. It's just -- we have to -- we have more technology in our cell phones than what that huge rocket had and look at the size of it and now we have more technology now and to have something like that into space and said landing a man on the moon is a beg deal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CRANE: Now Ana, if all goes to plan, NASA hopes to put boots once again on the moon in 2024. So hopefully, people like myself who were not part of the Apollo generation, we will n ow be the Artemis generation.</p><p>And Ana, NASA hopes not just to put a man on the moon this time, they also hope to put a woman on the moon. So hopefully that will inspire young women all around the globe to reach for the stars -- Ana.</p><p>CABRERA: Absolutely. And not only to put them on the moon, but to make it so man or a woman can stay on the moon. That is part of this next goal.</p><p>Rachel Crane, thank you for that report.</p><p>You can relive all of the moment of that incredible mission by tuning in tonight for the CNN film \"Apollo 11\" at 9:00 eastern on CNN.</p><p>Coming up, 150 million Americans across 30 states sweating it out amid what's become a deadly heat wave. A look at the impact of the triple digit temperatures next.</p><p>[16:23:10] CABRERA: It is a brutal heat wave scorching major parts of the nation threatening more than 150 million people. Highways are buckling in Oklahoma due to the scorching heat.</p><p>Today's heat index in Tulsa, up to 110 degrees.</p><p>In Omaha, Nebraska, it is so hot people are baking biscuits in the car. Don't even need an oven. Today's heat index feels up to 112 degrees outside.</p><p>In Chicago today an excessive heat warning is in effect until 8:00 tonight and people there are cooling off in local fountains.</p><p>This blistering heat extremely dangerous for animals outside so ice is being fed to animals to stay cool in Chicago and as far north as Boston.</p><p>In Detroit, a power outage means no air conditions for tens of thousands of people right now struggling under today's excessive heat warming there.</p><p>So let's get to Louisville, Kentucky, also under an excessive heat advisory today. I want to bring in Louisville's mayor, Greg Fischer.</p><p>Mayor, we just checked, it's 95 where you are. Feels like 105 degrees. I know you just had a press conference. What's your message to residents?</p><p>MAYOR GREG FISCHER (D), LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY: Ana, I can confirm it is very hot here in Louisville and we have been communicating that. I mean, so much of it is just these basic messages that we want to tell people about stay hydrated, remember your loved ones or your neighbor, elderly folks and check in with them. And if they don't have air- conditioning, be hospitable, show some hospitality. Tell them to come over and stay at your place.</p><p>So the challenge is, you know, this is the second day of three days when we were looking at heat index of 105 or so. So it's pretty tough outside, but so far we're in good shape.</p><p>CABRERA: I'm glad to hear that. I know you have spearheaded the Louisville urban cape island project. So is what is the city of Louisville helping residents stay safe in this brutal heat wave?</p><p>FISCHER: Well, right now it is just messaging. You know, our libraries are open. Community centers are open where people can go on and get cool, passing out water.</p><p>All of our spray grounds are open having open swims so people can just get out and stay cool if they want to get out. But we are encouraging people to stay inside. It will start cooling off this evening but wee are going to have another really hot day tomorrow. Expect some storm tomorrow night and then get into the 80s on Monday.</p><p>So we are just trying to get through. We have had about a 30 percent increase in our 911 heat-related calls. So you know, things are happening here and people are being affected, but I feel good about how we are communicating about it and just the main thing is take care of each other and that's what we're supposed to be doing every day.</p><p>[16:25:35] CABRERA: Yes. Unfortunately, places are having power outages, places like Michigan. I'm in New York City. The mayor here has required office buildings to set their thermostats to 78 degrees as a precaution.</p><p>FISCHER: Yes.</p><p>CABRERA: Animal care takers, as we mentioned, at zoos around the country are using extra ice to help keep the animals safe and healthy. What's your biggest concern?</p><p>FISCHER: Well, just that people forget and do silly things, you know. They leave a car and have a kid in the back or an animal in the back that they forget about. So, you know, a lot of people are saying, why do you keep saying the same things over and over. It is because that's how accidents happen, right?</p><p>CABRERA: Yes. FISCHER: When people do things that they didn't mean to do. So that's going on. But at the same time too we take this as an opportunity just to talk about climate change and the need to forest your communities more and the need to decarbonize your cities more and you are covering the 50th lunar anniversary here today.</p><p>And you know, just imagine as a country if we said we want to put as much energy into having a carbon neutral society as we did put the man on the moon. That would certainly help our weather and the heat waves that we are having here for the future.</p><p>CABRERA: Mayor, you said you have lived there and you have never or can't remember three days stretch that hot, is that right?</p><p>FISCHER: Yes. And we have a lot of hot weather. I mean, we are kind of in upper south here. So heat and humidity is not unusual, but to have a three-day stretch of it is tough. And when you take a look at the last couple of decades compared to the decades before that, you know, we are having a dozen additional heat days like this. So clearly, things are happening in our city so we have got to be prepared to be hotter and not just right now, but in the future, as well.</p><p>CABRERA: Mayor Greg Fischer, good to have you with us. Thank you. And hope your whole community stays safe.</p><p>FISCHER: OK. Thanks, Ana.</p><p>CABRERA: Coming up, an international murder mystery. An American woman and her Australian boyfriend set out in a Canadian adventure but ends with both of them dead on a remote highway. The investigation now underway into what happened.</p><p>[16:31:08] CABRERA: Welcome back.</p><p>We are monitoring escalating tensions in the Persian Gulf.

A young American woman and her Australian boyfriend found shot to death in Canada. The pair were on a road trip to explore British Columbia. Their bodies were discovered on a remote Canadian highway in extreme north of the province. But so far, there are few clues into what happened and why. I want to bring in CNN National Correspondent, Natasha Chen.</p><p>Natasha, what are you learning about this couple and the investigation into how they were killed?</p><p>NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Ana, Lucas Fowler was the Australian living in British Columbia at this time, working on a ranch, when his girlfriend, Chynna Deese, from North Carolina, came to visit him.</p><p>And the two of them were found on the morning of July 15th on the side of Alaska Highway toward the north part of British Columbia. And a blue 1986 Chevrolet van with Alberta plates was also found on the scene.</p><p>Our affiliate, WSOC, in Charlotte, North Carolina, spoke with Deese's mother and the station reported that the couple was found shot to death.</p><p>But I checked with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police this afternoon and RCMP says they're not releasing the specifics of how these two were killed. And they're also not specifying exactly on scene where they were found, whether they were inside or outside the van.</p><p>Now they do say that the double homicide happened sometime between Sunday evening and Monday morning.</p><p>Deese's mother told WSOC that her daughter was going to travel with Fowler throughout that part of Canada. They were going to visit national parks and had mapped out their route.</p><p>She says that the two of them, it was a love story. They had the same personality.</p><p>And that's what she's holding on to. She believes that the van might have broken down when this tragedy happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHEILA DEESE, MOTHER OF CYNNA DEESE (voice-over): This is what makes me really happy. Their story is just something you would read in a novel. They had plans for the future. I mean, they were meant to be. She loved him so much.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHEN: And Fowler's family in Australia released a statement as well.</p><p>They say, \"We have lost our dear Lucas Fowler, son, brother, grandson and friend, in the most terrible of circumstances. To lose someone so young and vibrant who was traveling the world and just enjoying life to the full is devastating.</p><p>To know his beautiful girlfriend, Chynna Deese, of Charlotte, North Carolina, also lost her life in this violent end is too cruel. All our love and best wishes go to Chynna's family and friends. And we are all traveling to Canada to be with our boy and to bring him home.\"</p><p>Fowler's father is chief inspector of the New South Wales Police Force in Australia. And they'll have members of that police force going to Canada as well. But RCMP makes it clear that they are there to support Fowler's family and not to participate in this investigation.</p><p>However, RCMP is working with the FBI here in the United States. They have to figure out whether these two people were driving that van at the time.</p><p>They are still also investigating whether they were targeted or whether this was a crime of opportunity -- Ana?</p><p>CABRERA: What a mystery.</p><p>Natasha Chen, thank you.</p><p>Up next, what do voters who back Trump in 2016 think of his racist attack on congresswomen of color?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[16:35:05] KERRI KRUMENAUER, 2016 WISCONSIN TRUMP VOTER: How is it racist?

I would not define that as a racist tweet, but it is a hatred tweet for sure.</p><p>[16:40:03] KAYE: His co-worker at this Eau Claire plumbing company, Kerri Krumenauer, also voted for Trump in 2016, and she sees it differently.</p><p>KRUMENAUER: How is it racist. If you don't like this country, get out. Leave. That's all he said. He didn't use any names. They stood up and so that's all they did. They made themselves look like idiots.</p><p>KAYE: Unlike her co-worker, Dave, Kerri has no regrets about voting for Trump.</p><p>KRUMENAUER: He takes no crap from anybody and that's why I love him.

So I am embarrassed by him.</p><p>KAYE (on camera): What don't you like about the president?</p><p>SOBOROWICZ: He doesn't act like a president should, in my eyes. He, in a way, I think spreads hatred. He's like a little kid having a temper tantrum the way he talks about, blah, blah, blah, whatever he says it comes across. It's, to me, is childish.</p><p>KAYE (voice-over): He says Trump should start taking credit for things like the economy.</p><p>(on camera): You don't think he's been good for business?</p><p>SOBOROWICZ: I can't say he alone is the reason why everything is booming at this time. It didn't happen as soon as he took office. It was already starting to improve.</p><p>KAYE (voice-over): Kerry sees it differently. KRUMENAUER: I have thought this country needs to be run like a business. It was ran into the ground for eight years and it's time to bring it back and he's done it.</p><p>KAYE: Kerry also thinks Trump is right to build a wall and limit immigration.</p><p>Dave argues this country needs immigrants.</p><p>SOBOROWICZ: Dairy products would be so much more expensive, vegetables that are grown around here. Anywhere in the United States, everything would be much more expensive if it wasn't for the immigrants.</p><p>KAYE (on camera): But he ran on that pretty much when you voted for him in 2016, right?</p><p>SOBOROWICZ: Once again, I thought he was a better option than Hillary.</p><p>KAYE: So it wasn't necessarily a vote for Trump in 2016.</p><p>SOBOROWICZ: No, it wasn't.</p><p>KAYE; It was a vote against Hillary Clinton.</p><p>SOBOROWICZ: Exactly.</p><p>KAYE: Is there anything that Trump can do that would change your mind or you are dug in?</p><p>KRUMENAUER: No, I am dug in.

She's a technologist at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, also known as STOP.</p><p>I know, Liz, you also call yourself an artificial intelligence activist.</p><p>Thank you for coming on.</p><p>LIZ O'SULLIVAN, RESIDENT TECHNOLOGIST, SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOOGY OVERSIGHT PROJECT: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CABRERA: A lot of people are seeing this and they're thinking, oh, my gosh, what did I do already? You say it's been a shock to see so many people do this without thinking through the potential of where this information could land. Tell me more about your concerns?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Well, I think it's a scandal, not because of any one particular company, but because this is actually evidence of the complete lack of regulation governing what companies can do to harvest, mine, and sometimes abuse consumer data. It's a threat to privacy but it's also a threat to our national security.</p><p>CABRERA: We heard in Tom Foreman's report that FaceApp isn't any worse than Facebook, Twitter or Instagram than any other social platform. Do you agree?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: I don't know. It's hard to tell. We don't want to have knee-jerk reactions to Russia and China. But they're authoritarian states and they do tend to have a tendency to oppress populations. And this is in Shenzhen in China where they're using facial recognition to sequester millions of Uighur population.</p><p>CABRERA: Do you use social media?</p><p>[16:50:09] O'SULLIVAN: I do use social media but I'm very careful about what privacy settings I have in place. And I make very sure to ensure it's not ubiquitous and surveillancy.</p><p>CABRERA: CNN has reported that the Democratic National Committee has warned 2020 campaigners and staffers not to download this app. They fear the artificial intelligence technology could spur a repeat of Russia's 2016 hacking campaign against the party.</p><p>You think this knee-jerk reaction is fascinating. Is this a partisan issue or not?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: It's absolutely not a partisan issue because hacking can occur on either side of the road. And I think that people are starting to see now the impact that facial recognition can have.</p><p>This data is very valuable and people want access to it so people can sell it to governments, military and police.</p><p>CABRERA: So many times we download an app and we sign up for a service and we are asked to agree to the terms of service. Here's a look at what you have to agree to if you use FaceApp. It includes this wonky sentence that says, in part, you grant them \"perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free rights to anything you upload. Believe me, I just cut down that sentence by roughly 95 percent.</p><p>Who really reads this stuff?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Not a single person. I can guarantee you that.</p><p>I'm a privacy activist and I never read the end user agreements either because, at the end of the day, we don't have a choice. If we have to use a product, if we need to use it for work or home or for anything we do in our days, then it becomes a mandatory expression of consent.</p><p>CABRERA: What will you say to people who say this is an overreaction?</p><p>O'SULLVAN: I would say that they're not paying very closely to the news and how big tech companies are reacting to the pressure against their invasion of our privacy.</p><p>We've been pushing to try to have more significant protections for consumers in lots of different cases, but every turn, we see Microsoft, Amazon, and other companies opposing that push for privacy.</p><p>CABRERA: Your group, STOP, sees digital privacy as a civil rights issue. Explain.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: It's absolutely a civil rights issue. It's about the balance of power between self-determination and law enforcement.</p><p>CABRERA: That was a quick answer.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You are saying big tech is quietly opposing legislation that activists want? Do you have examples?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Absolutely. In Washington State, there was a really well-supported bill for banning facial recognition in the city, in the state. And ACLU had a very well-supported bill. And Microsoft and Amazon went on record to oppose that bill.</p><p>We work state and local in New York City and we'd very much like to mount something similar to protect consumer rights. But we're having trouble even getting a very simple request of privacy the policy off the ground.</p><p>CABRERA: What would you say to people in the meantime.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Be careful. If it looks dubious, it might be and, in fact, it probably is. I'm not asking you to read every single privacy clause for every piece of software that you use. That would be impossible.</p><p>But I would ask you to, instead, write to your city council people, to your state Senators, tell them that you care about privacy and that you don't want your data mined.</p><p>CABRERA: Liz O'Sullivan, great to have you with us. Very informative.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Thank you.</p><p>CABRERA: Thank you.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Thanks.</p><p>CABRERA: The president says -- we'll be right back.</p><p>[16:57:02] CABRERA: The president says immigrants who don't like the U.S. should go back where they came from.

Coming less than two weeks after a federal judge refused to block Oracle Corp.'s hostile takeover bid to buy PeopleSoft, the alliance cheered employees, customers and vendors.</p><p>Craig Conway, PeopleSoft's embattled CEO, took the occasion of the announcement and the conference to speak with defiance about PeopleSoft's future.</p><p>\"We're not slowing down,\" Conway said during his keynote address. \"PeopleSoft has had a year that tested our resolve, stretched our resources and challenged our values,\" he said, referring to the 15-month takeover war with Oracle. \"But we didn't blink. And we won't.\"</p><p>Now, it seems possible that PeopleSoft could offer its customers a vision beyond a war of attrition with Oracle, some analysts said.</p><p>\"It's really positive to have some sense of what sort of alternatives PeopleSoft has to offer,\" said Melinda Baliou, a senior research analyst with Meta Group Inc. \"Coming on the heels of the court decision, it's helpful for PeopleSoft to have its users focus on something else going on. Psychologically, this really helps the PeopleSoft users and customers.\"</p><p>The alliance appears to offer benefits for both PeopleSoft and IBM, said Ray Valdes, an analyst with Gartner Research.</p><p>\"In the chess match with Oracle, this is a move that will strengthen PeopleSoft's position,\" Valdes said. \"For IBM, they are fleshing out their (offerings) against SAP (a business software giant).\"</p><p>Not everyone was convinced of the benefits of the alliance. Charles Di Bona, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, was skeptical that it would make much of a difference for PeopleSoft. \"It's a modest positive, but I don't think it makes much difference.\"</p><p>The real key to PeopleSoft's future, he said, is how the takeover bid plays out. At present, Oracle has offered to buy PeopleSoft for $7.7 billion, or $21 a share. But Di Bona thinks that overvalues PeopleSoft. \"The PeopleSoft shareholders should be jumping up and down for that offer,\" he said.</p><p>PeopleSoft has a poison pill provision that effectively blocks the Oracle purchase. Plus, the federal government may decide to appeal the ruling in its antitrust case, and European regulators are studying the purchase.</p><p>At another conference in San Francisco, Oracle Chairman Jeff Henley predicted his company will win its quest to capture PeopleSoft.</p><p>Ahead of the PeopleSoft conference, speculation surfaced that a \"white knight\" might appear in the form of a big tech company to rescue PeopleSoft from what the Pleasanton company views as an ominous takeover bid by Oracle.</p><p>The IBM-PeopleSoft alliance falls short of that. For example, IBM said it was not taking any sort of equity stake in PeopleSoft. Yet the deal still bolsters PeopleSoft, said M. Lee Geishecker, an analyst with Gartner Research.</p><p>\"Some people are calling IBM a gray knight,\" Geishecker said. \"The bottom line is this lets PeopleSoft gear up so it can go to battle with Oracle and SAP.\"</p><p>What's more, executives from both IBM and PeopleSoft said the alliance is the real deal and not just a grab for quick publicity.</p><p>Steve Mills, a senior vice president for IBM's software group, pointed to the $1 billion in spending on the deal, the formation of special joint laboratories to create software, and the likelihood that hundreds of IBM software developers from Silicon Valley could be working side-by-side with PeopleSoft engineers in Pleasanton.</p><p>\"This is a very important strategic development for IBM,\" Mills said. \"We will back that up with significant resources.\"</p><p>Conway agreed. \"This is not just a press release about a strategic agreement that adds up to nothing.\"</p><p>In an era of fierce competition among software companies that could lead to further mergers and consolidation, software firms have little choice but to undertake substantial moves to strengthen their technological prowess and marketing muscle, maintained Gartner analyst Valdes.</p><p>\"You really have to do things that have an impact, things that deliver,\" Valdes said. \"The time for posturing is past.\"</p><p>Word of the alliance was embraced by some PeopleSoft workers attending the conference.</p><p>\"This is very positive and should benefit PeopleSoft,\" said Glenn Perkins, an employee. \"It's also a morale booster.\"</p><p>George Avalos covers the economy.

The final ruling could be influential in shaping the increasingly competitive, fast-changing market for back-office software.</p><p> The courtroom drama represents the latest chapter in a bitter corporate takeover battle between two of the world's biggest software firms and two of Silicon Valley's most controversial and flamboyant figures.</p><p>Oracle Chief Executive Officer Larry Ellison and PeopleSoft CEO Craig Conway are both scheduled to testify in the monthlong trial, along with executives from big companies such as IBM, Nextel Communications and Microsoft.</p><p> The Justice Department's main contention in this case will be that an Oracle-PeopleSoft merger would reduce competition by eliminating one of three softwaremakers serving big customers who buy entire packages of business software, leaving only Oracle and SAP of Germany.</p><p> Analysts say the government must convince Walker that if the merger goes through, there's nothing to stop Oracle from demanding higher prices from a group of the acquired company's biggest customers, who would have little choice but to pay up.</p><p>Oracle counters that such a group doesn't exist. The case is expected to revolve around that point, said Barry Harris, a principal at Economists Inc., a Washington consulting firm.</p><p> He said the government's argument is flawed because it would be impossible for Oracle to read its customers' minds to figure out who else they're considering as vendors for the software they need.</p><p> Part of the problem is that -- unlike other commodities, such as clothes or cars, which have generally known, fixed prices for all customers -- prices for business software are typically set through confidential negotiations with each customer.</p><p> Analysts say the government must show that Oracle has a way to identify which customers would be at its mercy if the merger took place.</p><p> The Justice Department's witness list includes companies such as Greyhound and Verizon Communications as well as the state of North Dakota. They are expected to testify that a merger would harm customers and lead to higher prices.</p><p> In a pretrial brief, the government said it will present internal Oracle documents and customer testimony that would \"colorfully illustrate how head-to-head competition\" between Oracle and PeopleSoft benefits users by keeping prices down.</p><p> Some analysts say the Justice Department has the upper hand in this case because its witness list includes more customers than Oracle's. Those customers are expected to express their fears that the planned merger would lead to higher prices and products that don't meet their expectations.</p><p> \"I think based on the witness list, I would handicap this in favor of the government,\" said Charles Biggio, an antitrust attorney in New York. \"You'll expect the government to win if the customers are motivated enough to take the stand.\"</p><p>Oracle rejects that assumption, saying that parading customer-witnesses would be monotonous and pointless. Its witness list includes some customers, but mostly relies on industry and economic experts along with executives from the company and its rivals, including Ellison and Conway.</p><p> The company says the government's analysis of the high-end corporate software market doesn't make sense because it offers a narrow view.</p><p> Some analysts like Oracle's chances in the case, referring to a federal court ruling in late 2001 in a case involving an attempt by SunGard, a business software company, to buy Comdisco's disaster services business.</p><p> The Justice Department sued SunGard, saying the purchase would allow it to dominate the market for computer systems that back up company data.</p><p> The court ruled against the government, saying it had failed to consider other vendors offering similar services and products.</p><p>Oracle is raising a similar argument, saying the corporate software market is bigger than the government's definition and that other smaller software companies could easily fill the void that would be created if it buys PeopleSoft.</p><p> \"I think the government has a difficult burden because these markets are so complicated and there are so many different choices,\" said Michael Katz, a professor at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.</p><p> Harris of Economists Inc. said the government might be overestimating Oracle's ability to gouge customers.</p><p> The reasoning goes along these lines: In choosing customers to pay higher prices, Oracle would essentially be making calculated guesses in an undefined market.</p><p> If Oracle guesses correctly, it can pick up an extra 5 to 10 percent in profit, he said. \"If they guess wrong (and the customer picks another vendor), they lose the full profit, and that's a big number,\" Harris said.</p><p> The Justice Department has said that smaller players, such as Lawson, don't have the ability to compete with the major business softwaremakers because they don't offer the broad suite of software needed by major customers.</p><p> It also argues that the high-end corporate software market is so difficult to penetrate that if the merger is approved, Oracle and SAP would have the field to themselves for at least two years afterward.</p><p> Some analysts dispute that contention, saying it wouldn't apply to an industry known to go through major changes within 18 months. \"These markets are much more easily entered than the traditional brick and mortar industries,\" said Hillard Sterling, a Chicago antitrust lawyer.</p><p> Microsoft's entry into the marketplace could play a decisive role in the trial. The government doesn't see it as a near-term competitor. Oracle argues that although Microsoft is a minor player in the high-end business applications software market now, the tech giant is poised to become a major rival soon.</p><p> \"Oracle will argue that a large competitor like Microsoft can penetrate and gain share in a moment's notice,\" Sterling said. \"They don't need to invest extraordinary capital and start from the ground up.\"</p><p> Sterling said that if Oracle can show that PeopleSoft \"feared Microsoft's wrath\" in the business applications software market, that would prove the Redwood City firm's claim that there are more than three major players in that arena.</p><p> Analysts say that could come out in PeopleSoft's internal documents or the testimony of its executives.</p><p> Ultimately, the question of how the merger would affect the corporate software market will be left to Walker, a respected judge known for his independence and interest in economic issues.</p><p> In a sign that he also recognizes the complexity of the issues, Walker agreed to let both sides hold a technology tutorial to help him prepare for the trial.</p><p> \"There have been very few if any decisions delineating software markets,\" Sterling said. \"The judge will be working from a largely blank slate.\"</p><p>-----------------------------</p><p> The lineup</p><p> Here's a partial list of witnesses for both sides:</p><p> The Justice Department</p><p> -- Customers: Cox Communications, Verizon Communications, Pepsi Americas, Nextel Communications, Charles Schwab, Erie County (New York)</p><p> -- Economists, industry experts: Marco Iansiti, Kenneth Elzinga, Preston McAfee</p><p> -- PeopleSoft executives: Rick Bergquist, Phil Wilmington</p><p>Oracle Corp.</p><p> -- Customers: Emerson Electric, Bank of America, Novell</p><p> -- Oracle executives: Larry Ellison, Safra Catz, Ron Wohl, Kevin Fitzgerald, Keith Block, Bob Greene</p><p> -- PeopleSoft executive: Craig Conway</p><p> -- Economists, industry experts: Tom Campbell, Jerry Hausman, Dale Kutnick, David Teece</p><p> -- Rivals: SAP, Lawson, Microsoft, ADP, Fidelity</p><p>---------------------------------------</p><p> Chronology of a merger battle</p><p>Oracle's year-old fight to acquire PeopleSoft now shifts to the courtroom.</p><p> 2003</p><p> June 6: Oracle makes $5.1 billion hostile takeover bid for PeopleSoft.</p><p> June 12: PeopleSoft's board rejects Oracle's offer.</p><p> June 13: PeopleSoft says that it has sued to block Oracle's bid and that it faces six lawsuits from shareholders angry that the board nixed the Oracle offer.</p><p> June 16: PeopleSoft accelerates its merger with J.D.

I had simply forgotten to log last month's cycle properly, and, because I have notifications for that app turned off, I hadn't noticed when I didn't complete the entry.</p><p>But the app had certainly noticed.</p><p>I corrected my cycle, and almost instantly the baby ads just stopped.</p><p>Talia period tracker tweet</p><p>It was then I began to feel uneasy as my mind made the connection between my period tracking app believing I had missed a cycle ten days ago, and my Facebook account that was suddenly trying to sell me pregnancy paraphernalia within days of my period appearing to be 'late'.</p><p>I have used this particular app for so long I don't even remember when I downloaded it, or why I chose that particular brand.</p><p>5 easy and simple ways to protect your privacy online - how to prepare for the next big threat\u00a0</p><p>So I pulled up the app's privacy settings and noticed that while it promised not to share details I 'entered manually' with its third-party partners, the terms and conditions' language cleverly avoided ruling out sharing information about aggregated data - like patterns or trends.</p><p>I have chosen not to name the app here - it is not a well-known one, and appears to have been made by a small developer.</p><p>Unless I have smoking-gun proof that it was selling my data to Facebook advertisers, I am not willing to make the accusation and damage someone's business - they may have meant well, and it is an app I had until now enjoyed and used loyally for years.</p><p>Google boss says you must tell visitors if you have Nest or Alexa in your home\u00a0</p><p>What's more, I wasn't sufficiently troubled by the bizarre ads when I was seeing them to check the 'why am I seeing this' option on Facebook, or even to screenshot them.</p><p>This problem of proof is not just a quandary for journalists - but for any of us who are concerned enough to try to investigate how our personal data is collected and shared online.</p><p>Tech companies have an incentive to use opaque language, and the process to work out which apps are communicating with which websites, how often and why can become a confusing process as a result.\u00a0</p><p>What I experienced has come to be known as 'surveillance capitalism.'</p><p>For lay people like me, big tech has long felt like a wizard behind a curtain - clever, capable of changing how we experience the world in wonderful and spectacular ways - but ultimately powerful without enough accountability.</p><p>This experience has confirmed to me I know too little about how much my social media technology and apps know about me.</p><p>In a world where advertising is no longer restricted to billboards and magazines, I don't want it to become so intrusive it leaves me feeling unnerved.</p><p>Man sues Apple because his 'iPhone made him gay and got him a boyfriend'\u00a0</p><p>How did we get to this point? Humans are naturally fascinated by our own health - many of us love to count our steps, track calories, record our fitness routines in ways that can help us improve our lives immensely.</p><p>It is a no-brainer that developers and social media giants have worked out how to monetise that precious data, and I hadn't lost any sleep over it- yet.</p><p>In many ways, algorithms have made my life better, more convenient, and more efficient.</p><p>Those clever little trend-sniffers have connected me with my new favourite bands, learned my style and promoted dresses and shoes I've dutifully then gone on to purchase.</p><p>Algorithms have uncovered my guilty pleasure and push the juicy 'agony aunt' columns I love to read to the top of my news feeds.</p><p>But algorithms are rather like the body's bacteria - you might not be able to see or understand them - but you can be certain they are not always working for you.</p><p>Yesterday, a sinister thought popped into my mind.</p><p>In future, my social media tech is likely to know I'm pregnant before I do - and I find that deeply unsettling.</p><p>You might have heard about how US retailer Targetwas able to figure out a teenage girl was pregnant before her father did.</p><p>Many people who were disturbed by my story after it went viral on Twitter noted, darkly, the news that Google has acquired Fitbit.</p><p>Any time a company gathers more of your data, you have to wonder how soon the information being collected now to sell things to you now be weaponised against you in future.</p><p>It is clear the dystopia is already here.</p><p>Insurers are already linking customers' premiums to their diet and health tracking apps, rewarding those who lead a healthy lifestyle and penalising those who don't.</p><p>The dark side of period tracking apps has been well covered by tech journalists.</p><p>Priti Patel warns Facebook encryption plans could stop paedophiles being caught\u00a0</p><p>Icky stories have emerged in recent years revealing some companies weresecretly using period tracking calendarsin an attempt to track the moods of their female employees.</p><p>But most upsettingly, an overwhelming volume of responses I received from women who had experienced a similar phenomena on their social media revealed it was happening following pregnancy trauma.</p><p>Multiple women revealed they were still being slammed with 'happy baby' advertisements on their social media feeds after miscarriage or stillbirth.</p><p>This is inappropriate, disturbing, and is something that should be a priority for the human beings behind these algorithms to find a way to address.</p><p>However they do it, surely it must be done without forcing grieving women to give up even more personal information in the process.</p><p>Inevitably, I can imagine that this could lead to yet more sponsored posts hawking things for sale - like happy pills and self-help books.</p><p>Chillingly, as several women who have had miscarriages have claimed to me - they received ads for infertility treatment immediately after their pregnant loss.</p><p>For anyone trying to get pregnant and struggling, the cheerful baby ads must be a galling reminder of their situation, sandwiched callously between pictures of what your old high school friends had for lunch and viral dog videos.</p><p>Many people asked me - somewhat condescendingly from men who have zero experience in this field - 'why don't you just use a paper calendar to track your period'?</p><p>Without revealing more information than I am willing to share with the world (and apparently several of my apps), these trackers can be life-changing.</p><p>Many, many women in your life will not not lucky enough to have an easy, pain-free, cycle that runs like clockwork.</p><p>For many of us, it will be a constant, monthly feature of our lives for the better part of three decades.</p><p>Google faces legal action in UK over claims it collected millions of iPhone users' data\u00a0</p><p>Many women I know track their periods for their clever in-app analysis functions.</p><p>The apps give you knowledge - and knowledge is power. Tracker apps can help us save time, money and prevent embarassment.</p><p>Some women have irregular cycles, and some are struggling to get pregnant.\u00a0</p><p>Some might have corresponding health problems that worsen throughout their cycle, their hormones might affect mental health disorders and medication, or they may be using a natural counting method because they can't use hormonal contraception for health reasons.\u00a0</p><p>On the convenience side - which is really no one else's business but a women's own - knowing their cycle patterns might affect anything from when and how they choose to have sex, to what colour clothing they wear on a due day.</p><p>It might give them a warning to pack sanitary items in advance, rather than avoid an expensive late-night rush to a corner shop for a heavily marked-up box of tampons.\u00a0</p><p>Some using these apps will be trying to get pregnant- many are also using the apps to avoid it.</p><p>Knowing exactly what stage of your cycle you are at when you are most at risk of pregnancy is a great help to many heterosexual women, who are still largely lumped with the responsibility for contraception with all the costs to their health and wallet, and the trial and error that comes with it.</p><p>Amazon is selling 'security' cameras that have massive vulnerabilities in them\u00a0</p><p>The way many of the apps are designed assume the user would be happy to get pregnant - they are often pink-themed, focused on analysing when you are ovulating, and flashing excitable messages when your period is late.</p><p>It lead me to wonder how many of these apps meant for women are designed by men - a quick spot of research confirmed mine was.\u00a0</p><p>If you don't think that matters, author Caroline Criado Perez has recently written a book about how products designed by men - fromill-fitting spacesuitsto car passenger seatbelts designed for men's bodies - can actually end up excluding and even endangering women.</p><p>Since my tweets about my discovery went viral, I've been thinking about my next steps.\u00a0</p><p>The solution doesn't have to be for me to stop using a tool that has improved my life on a monthly basis.</p><p>But this has been is a welcome wake-up call for me.

I had simply forgotten to log last month's cycle properly, and, because I have notifications for that app turned off, I hadn't noticed when I didn't complete the entry.</p><p>But the app had certainly noticed.</p><p>I corrected my cycle, and almost instantly the baby ads just stopped.</p><p>It was then I began to feel uneasy as my mind made the connection between my period tracking app believing I had missed a cycle ten days ago, and my Facebook account that was suddenly trying to sell me pregnancy paraphernalia within days of my period appearing to be 'late'.</p><p>I have used this particular app for so long I don't even remember when I downloaded it, or why I chose that particular brand.</p><p>So I pulled up the app's privacy settings and noticed that while it promised not to share details I 'entered manually' with its third-party partners, the terms and conditions' language cleverly avoided ruling out sharing information about aggregated data -like patterns or trends.</p><p>I have chosen not to name the app here -it is not a well-known one, and appears to have been made by a small developer.</p><p>Unless I have smoking-gun proof that it was selling my data to Facebook advertisers, I am not willing to make the accusation and damage someone's business -they may have meant well, and it is an app I had until now enjoyed and used loyally for years.</p><p>What's more, I wasn't sufficiently troubled by the bizarre ads when I was seeing them to check the 'why am I seeing this' option on Facebook, or even to screenshot them.</p><p>This problem of proof is not just a quandary for journalists -but for any of us who are concerned enough to try to investigate how our personal data is collected and shared online.</p><p>Tech companies have an incentive to use opaque language, and the process to work out which apps are communicating with which websites, how often and why can become a confusing process as a result. </p><p>What I experienced has come to be known as 'surveillance capitalism.'</p><p>For lay people like me, big tech has long felt like a wizard behind a curtain - clever, capable of changing how we experience the world in wonderful and spectacular ways - but ultimately powerful without enough accountability.</p><p>This experience has confirmed to me I know too little about how much my social media technology and apps know about me.</p><p>In a world where advertising is no longer restricted to billboards and magazines, I don't want it to become so intrusive it leaves me feeling unnerved.</p><p>How did we get to this point Humans are naturally fascinated by our own health -many of us love to count our steps, track calories, record our fitness routines in ways that can help us improve our lives immensely.</p><p>It is a no-brainer that developers and social media giants have worked out how to monetise that precious data, and I hadn't lost any sleep over it-yet.</p><p>In many ways, algorithms have made my life better, more convenient, and more efficient.</p><p>Those clever little trend-sniffers have connected me with my new favourite bands, learned my style and promoted dresses and shoes I've dutifully then gone on to purchase.</p><p>Algorithms have uncovered my guilty pleasure and push the juicy 'agony aunt' columns I love to read to the top of my news feeds.</p><p>But algorithms are rather like the body's bacteria -you might not be able to see or understand them -but you can be certain they are not always working for you.</p><p>Yesterday, a sinister thought popped into my mind.</p><p>In future, my social media tech is likely to know I'm pregnant before I do -and I find that deeply unsettling.</p><p>You might have heard about how US retailer Target was able to figure out a teenage girl was pregnant before her father did.</p><p>Many people who were disturbed by my story after it went viral on Twitter noted, darkly, the news that Google has acquired Fitbit.</p><p>Any time a company gathers more of your data, you have to wonder how soon the information being collected now to sell things to you now be weaponised against you in future.</p><p>                     Where does it end                   </p><p>It is clear the dystopia is already here.</p><p>Insurers are already linking customers' premiums to their diet and health tracking apps, rewarding those who lead a healthy lifestyle and penalising those who don't.</p><p>The dark side of period tracking apps has been well covered by tech journalists.</p><p>Icky stories have emerged in recent years revealing some companies were secretly using period tracking calendars in an attempt to track the moods of their female employees.</p><p>But most upsettingly, an overwhelming volume of responses I received from women who had experienced a similar phenomena on their social media revealed it was happening following pregnancy trauma.</p><p>Multiple women revealed they were still being slammed with 'happy baby' advertisements on their social media feeds after miscarriage or stillbirth.</p><p>This is inappropriate, disturbing, and is something that should be a priority for the human beings behind these algorithms to find a way to address.</p><p>However they do it, surely it must be done without forcing grieving women to give up even more personal information in the process.</p><p>Inevitably, I can imagine that this could lead to yet more sponsored posts hawking things for sale -like happy pills and self-help books.</p><p>Chillingly, as several women who have had miscarriages have claimed to me -they received ads for infertility treatment immediately after their pregnant loss.</p><p>For anyone trying to get pregnant and struggling, the cheerful baby ads must be a galling reminder of their situation, sandwiched callously between pictures of what your old high school friends had for lunch and viral dog videos.</p><p>                     &amp;apos;Why don&amp;apos;t you just use a paper calendar&amp;apos;                   </p><p>Many people asked me -somewhat condescendingly from men who have zero experience in this field -'why don&amp;apos;t you just use a paper calendar to track your period'</p><p>Without revealing more information than I am willing to share with the world and apparently several of my apps, these trackers can be life-changing.</p><p>Many, many women in your life will not not lucky enough to have an easy, pain-free, cycle that runs like clockwork.</p><p>For many of us, it will be a constant, monthly feature of our lives for the better part of three decades.</p><p>Many women I know track their periods for their clever in-app analysis functions.</p><p>The apps give you knowledge -and knowledge is power. Tracker apps can help us save time, money and prevent embarassment.</p><p>Some women have irregular cycles, and some are struggling to get pregnant. </p><p>Some might have corresponding health problems that worsen throughout their cycle, their hormones might affect mental health disorders and medication, or they may be using a natural counting method because they can't use hormonal contraception for health reasons. </p><p>On the convenience side -which is really no one else's business but a women's own -knowing their cycle patterns might affect anything from when and how they choose to have sex, to what colour clothing they wear on a due day.</p><p>It might give them a warning to pack sanitary items in advance, rather than avoid an expensive late-night rush to a corner shop for a heavily marked-up box of tampons. </p><p>Some using these apps will be trying to get pregnant-many are also using the apps to avoid it.</p><p>Knowing exactly what stage of your cycle you are at when you are most at risk of pregnancy is a great help to many heterosexual women, who are still largely lumped with the responsibility for contraception with all the costs to their health and wallet, and the trial and error that comes with it.</p><p>The way many of the apps are designed assume the user would be happy to get pregnant -they are often pink-themed, focused on analysing when you are ovulating, and flashing excitable messages when your period is late.</p><p>It lead me to wonder how many of these apps meant for women are designed by men -a quick spot of research confirmed mine was. </p><p>If you don&amp;apos;t think that matters, author Caroline Criado Perez has recently written a book about how products designed by men -from ill-fitting spacesuits to car passenger seatbelts designed for men's bodies -can actually end up excluding and even endangering women.</p><p>                     We are the products for sale                   </p><p>Since my tweets about my discovery went viral, I've been thinking about my next steps. </p><p>The solution doesn't have to be for me to stop using a tool that has improved my life on a monthly basis.</p><p>But this has been is a welcome wake-up call for me. I will be learning more about how to more carefully navigate technology that mines my personal data, and about how to investigate it as a journalist.</p><p>My experience reveals the cynical side to these mysterious algorithms that meticulously analyse my online behaviour to construct a picture of my fears and desires -to then sell on to advertisers.</p><p>When we hand over our data for free in exchange for a small online convenience, we become the product for sale.</p><p>It is up to me to work out now what my boundaries are, and to decide the price of convenience.</p><p>While I might like the algorithms now that direct me to nice dresses and new music now, I can't help but wonder how that data could one day be used to shape my future.</p><p>On that question, Charlie Brooker's brilliant Black Mirror series is already giving me nightmares.</p><p>                     Fight for your privacy                   </p><p>We must not be complacent about intrusive technology-we are in an arms race to regulate before we lose control of our valuable personal data, and our privacy with it.</p><p>It is plainly a a moral issue too.

This is your CQ Cyber newsletter for Monday, August 5, 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Editor's Note: CQ Cyber is changing delivery dates to better serve our readers. Starting September 10, the newsletter will publish Tuesdays and Fridays instead of Mondays and Thursdays. In August, we will publish only on Mondays because of the congressional recess. Our goal is to provide timely news, deep analysis, and a forward look on cyber and technology news.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOPLINES</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. Billion here, billion there: A few 100 million here and a few more millions there and pretty soon you're talking real losses -- online users' data that is. In just the first six months of 2019, as many as 10 billion pieces of data have been lost to leaks, hacks and breaches, according to a new report. </p><p>2. Hurd on the street: Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, a tech-savvy former CIA officer turned lawmaker and the only African American GOP member of the House, said he's hanging up his congressional boots. </p><p>3. Monopoly mitigation: Sen. Amy Klobuchar is proposing legislation that would crack down on monopolies in various sectors across the economy, and not just tech companies. </p><p>4. Foiling facial recognition: The city of Cambridge, Mass., is on its way to becoming the fourth city in the country to ban facial recognition technology from being used by government agencies, including police.  </p><p>5. Roping robocalls: A group of Democratic lawmakers last week proposed legislation that would take away an exemption that allows telecom companies to escape responsibility for automatic calls flooding users around the country.  </p><p>FULL BRIEFING</p><p>1. Billions of global users have lost data in first six months of 2019: Report </p><p>When Capital One announced last week that a hacker had breached its cloud server and exposed data on 100 million people, it might have sounded like \"the big one.\" </p><p>But in just the first six months of 2019, 10 billion pieces of personal data worldwide were either stolen, leaked or breached in some fashion, likely affecting a few billion users at least, according to information compiled by NordVPN, a Panama-based company that provides secure remote network access software. </p><p>A majority of the breaches and leaks targeted U.S. users, the company found. Data leaked or stolen included phone numbers, security logs, student records, medical information, banking and financial data, and other categories of information. </p><p>\"Assume that if you are online, your data has already been leaked,\" Daniel Markuson, a digital privacy expert at NordVPN, said in a statement.  \"Criminals can use that data to lure you into a sophisticated phishing attack or influence your votes with personalized ads.\" </p><p>One of the largest caches of stolen information is known simply as Collections #1-5 and contains about 3 billion users' records that are being traded on the darkweb and in hacking forums, NordVPN said, citing work done by other security researchers. </p><p>Collection #1 includes email addresses and passwords from about 770 million people taken from 2,000 previous data breaches and began appearing on hacker forums in January, and has about 87 gigabytes of information, NordVPN said. </p><p>A few weeks later Collections #2 to #5 began appearing in the same forums and included about 25 billion unique records that were compilations of smaller individual breaches over time, and had about 845 gigabytes, NordVPN said. </p><p>The stolen information came from a variety of sources including Yahoo, LinkedIn, and Dropbox, NordVPN said. </p><p>Facebook and its apps, including Instagram and WhatsApp, accounted for some of the biggest sources of leaks with data from 2.1 billion users either being stolen, leaked or exposed in insecure databases, NordVPN said. </p><p>In April, a cybersecurity firm called UpGuard found and reported that two third-party Facebook app developers -- Mexico-based Cultura Colectiva and an app called At The Pool -- stored a total of about 540 million Facebook user data entries on unsecured Amazon Web Services cloud servers, NordVPN said. This included \"comments, likes, reactions, account names, FB IDs, and more\" from millions of Facebook users.</p><p>In May, WhatsApp was breached when hackers found and exploited a security flaw in the app that left users vulnerable to spyware. \"The exact number of victims is unknown, but the app has 1.5 billion users, all of which could have been affected,\" NordVPN said.</p><p>An Israeli government surveillance agency called the NSO Group designed spyware that could turn on a device's microphone and camera, gain access to emails and messages, and collect location data, NordVPN said. </p><p>Later that same month, the contact details of nearly 50 million Instagram users became \"accessible on a massive unsecured online database,\" NordVPN said. \"The breached data contains the personal information, such as emails and phone numbers, of high-profile influencers, celebrities, and brand accounts. The database itself was on an Amazon server and was not password-protected. It was traced to a Mumbai-based marketing company called Chtrbox.\"</p><p>Leaks of data stored on various cloud services added up to about 2.3 billion files in the first half of the year, NordVPN said. These included personal photographs, patent information, credit card details, medical scans, and others. </p><p>Other companies contributing to the global tally of data breaches include U.S.-based Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp -- both medical testing and diagnostic services -- as well financial institutions around the world. </p><p>The leaks and breaches weren't all in the West. A Chinese company called Orvibo, which runs an internet-of-things management platform, left its online database openly accessible, and security researchers found that 2 billion users' logs including their emails, passwords, geographic location, and even reset codes were accessible, NordVPN said. </p><p>A hacker named Gnosticplayers has stolen about 1 billion credentials from dozens of companies around the world and has posted them on darkweb sites, and has demanded ransom in bitcoins, NordVPN said. The information included emails, passwords, location data and social media pages.</p><p>An Australian company called Canva, an online graphic design company, was the most affected in the Gnosticplayers leak with 139 million users' records being stolen, NordVPN said.  </p><p>2. Rep. Hurd, who backed strong cybersecurity, announces retirement</p><p>Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, a former CIA officer turned lawmaker who routinely advocated for cybersecurity measures and U.S. leadership in advanced technology, announced last week he wouldn't seek another term in Congress. </p><p>\"We're in a geopolitical competition with China,\" Hurd wrote on Twitter, announcing his retirement. \"There is a global race to be the leader in artificial intelligence. We face cyberattacks every day. Extreme poverty, lack of economic opportunity and violence in Central America is placing unbearable pressure on our borders.\" </p><p>Although Congress has a role in addressing those challenges, private sector and civil society also have a role, Hurd wrote on Twitter, suggesting his potential future career. </p><p>In the 115th Congress Hurd was chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on information technology, and also served on the House Intelligence committee, where he continues to serve. </p><p>In 2018, Hurd and Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., then the top Democrat on the information technology panel, issued a report that called on the United States to step up work on artificial intelligence technologies. </p><p>Artificial intelligence \"has the potential to disrupt every sector of society in both anticipated and unanticipated ways,\" Hurd and Kelly wrote. \"In light of that potential for disruption, it's critical that the federal government address the different challenges posed by AI, including its current and future applications.\" </p><p>The federal government must \"increase spending on research and development to maintain American leadership with respect to AI,\" including spending on education and training programs so American workers can gain skills in such technologies, they said. </p><p>The report is the result of a series of hearings that Hurd and Kelly held last year on artificial intelligence technologies. </p><p>Hurd, the only African American Republican in the House, is the third Texan to announce his retirement, after Reps. Pete Olson and K. Michael Conaway announced their intention to leave. In all, nine current Republican House members have said they plan to retire.</p><p>3. Klobuchar bill could mean more antitrust fines for Big Tech firms</p><p>New legislation announced by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat running for the party's 2020 presidential nomination, would allow the federal government to pursue more severe antitrust penalties against companies found to be engaging in anticompetitive behavior.</p><p>The bill, which is being co-sponsored by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, would allow the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to seek fines up to 15 percent of the violator's total U.S. revenues or 30 percent of the violator's U.S. revenues in the affected market, whichever is greater.</p><p>The legislation, should it become law, could have serious implications for Big Tech companies including Amazon, Facebook and Google, which are already contending with antitrust investigations at the Department of Justice and in the House of Representatives. One of Klobuchar's rivals on the campaign trail, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has gone as far as calling for the three companies to be broken up.</p><p>\"We have a major monopoly problem in this country,\" said Klobuchar, ranking member of Judiciary's antitrust subcommittee. \"So when federal enforcers uncover illegal monopolistic conduct, they need to act decisively to make sure it stops. But the threat of an injunction isn't always enough to deter this unlawful conduct from happening in the first place.\"</p><p>She continued: \"Our legislation will increase the ability of the Justice Department and the FTC to deter companies from engaging in monopolistic practices that hurt competition, consumers, and innovation in our economy.\"</p><p> -  Dean DeChiaro </p><p>4. Cambridge, Mass., may be fourth city to ban facial recognition technology</p><p>Following in the footsteps of San Francisco, Oakland and neighboring Somerville, the city of Cambridge, Mass., is on its way to becoming the fourth U.S. city to ban facial recognition software, as efforts in Congress to regulate the technology gain momentum.</p><p>The Cambridge City Council last week unanimously voted to advance legislation that Mayor Marc McGovern said on Twitter is aimed at \"safeguarding the civil liberties of residents and curbing discriminatory surveillance.\"</p><p>The council's decision came days after Rep. Ayanna S. Pressley, the Massachusetts Democrat whose district includes Cambridge, and other House Democrats introduced legislation to ban facial recognition technology in public housing and assisted housing units funded by the federal government.</p><p>The legislation (HR 4008), introduced with Reps. Yvette D. Clarke, D-N.Y., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., would also require the Department of Housing and Urban Development to take on a report \"on any known use of facial recognition technologies in public housing units; the impact of emerging technologies on tenants; the purpose of installing the technologies in the units; demographic information of impacted tenants, and; the impact of emerging technologies on vulnerable communities in public housing, including tenant privacy, civil rights and fair housing, includes HUD federally assisted rental dwelling units.\"</p><p>Of the three lawmakers, Pressley and Tlaib sit on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, which earlier this summer held the first series of congressional hearings on facial recognition technology. Chairman Elijah E. Cummings, D-Md., and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the ranking member, agreed following the hearing to pursue legislation that would ban use of the technology by government agencies.</p><p> -  Dean DeChiaro</p><p>5. Senate bill would empower FTC to combat robocalls</p><p>Legislation introduced by a trio of Senate Democrats last week seeks to help the Federal Trade Commission crack down on robocalls by removing a common carrier exemption that allowed telecom companies to skirt oversight by the agency.</p><p>The bill, (S 2349), sponsored by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., would give the FTC \"the authority it needs to investigate telecom companies that knowingly provide voice-over-IP and short duration call services to illegal robocallers.\"</p><p>Telecom companies were originally exempt from the Federal Trade Commission Act because of other regulations governing them. According to Feinstein, those regulations have been rolled back, creating a loophole allowing companies \"that actively facilitate illegal robocalling to escape FTC enforcement.\"</p><p>\"These calls are more than a nuisance. Robocalls allow scam artists to target their victims and can tie up emergency service numbers, putting people's lives at risk,\" said Feinstein. \"We must do more than go after the people making the robocalls; we need to stop the phone services that make this illegal behavior possible. Our bill will give the FTC the tools it needs to do exactly that.\"</p><p> -  Dean DeChiaro</p><p>SCHEDULES</p><p>Check out CQ's daily schedule of congressional hearings and more.

It's messy, confusing and new laws are set to land right in the backyard of Big Tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Personalisation is in vogue at the expense of mass marketing. It was perhaps a timely and arguably purposeful message to the 3000-strong crowd at last week's Association of National Advertisers Masters of Marketing Conference in the US, as intensity mounts on the controversial privacy regulation the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which is set to take effect on January 1, 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Battle lines have been drawn - personal data, after all, is the elixir which underpins much of the digital economy. There's a lot at stake. America's advertisers want one federal privacy law to pre-empt the emerging patchwork of current and pending state privacy legislation.</p><p>That argument clearly has merit. Big Tech wants the same, or at the very least, a watering down of the CCPA. The clock is ticking. California Governor Gavin Newsom has until Monday to sign into law the final version of the landmark CCPA, and by all accounts he will.</p><p>Modelled on the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the CCPA strikes at Big Tech's homeland and is set to be the de facto consumer privacy law for the US. There will be wide-reaching implications for us all. Not least because the growing \"techlash\" is gathering steam.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, everyone is weighing in. Whilst California's privacy law will probably play out through enforcement much like the EGDPR - and that is taking some time - the looming threat of a fragmented US state-based privacy regulation system kicks data privacy into urgent and sharp focus.</p><p>The \"techlash\" is growing</p><p>Last month, 51 tech CEOs including those from Amazon, AT&amp;T, IBM, Dell and Salesforce sent a letter to Congress on behalf of the Business Roundtable (a non-profit association made up of CEOs from US companies), calling for a comprehensive federal consumer data privacy law. Urgently.</p><p>The catalyst was the CCPA and its instigator Alastair Mactaggart, described as America's most important privacy activist. Mactaggart, a Californian real estate developer, spent $3.1 million of his own money to make the CCPA happen in 2018. In so doing, he has focussed the attention of America's leading companies - many with global reach, and representing every sector of the economy - on the importance of data privacy to the consumer.</p><p>Mactaggart's agenda was simple: First, just do some good. Then: Do something about privacy. And then: Do something about data privacy. Mactaggart wants to give consumers transparency, control and accountability. To have the ability to demand what businesses know about them, as they can from any level of government via a Freedom of Information request.</p><p>Handing consumers control of their data</p><p>Mactaggart wants consumers to be able to tell companies not to sell their personal information and to hold companies accountable to take good care of consumer's personal information. Mactaggart believes Big Tech's data use is out of control.</p><p>Greta Thunberg last month said: \"We are not the ones who are responsible for this, but we are the ones who have to live with these consequences, and that is so incredibly unfair.\" Her words on climate change echo in Mactaggart's purpose.</p><p>Both unlikely activists are on the same hymn sheet. Whilst the drafting and ambiguity of the CCPA remains a contested issue, it is unarguable that Mactaggart has spearheaded action. It's a modern-day David and Goliath story, set in California. And he's not letting up.</p><p>Reshaping data's role in marketing</p><p>Next up he wants consumers to control their \"sensitive personal information\" - race, health, social security number and GPS locations. If ratified into law, consumers would have the right to prevent such data from being sold or used for advertising purposes.</p><p>It's yet another new squeeze for marketers. The complexity of the regulatory and legal framework around online tracking, data mining and privacy shows no respite - indeed it's fragmented for the foreseeable future: GDPR, CCPA, and closer to home, the Notifiable Data Breaches Act and the impending outcomes of the ACCC Digital Platforms Inquiry will continue spinning in their own orbits.</p><p>Meanwhile, customers are demanding greater accountability. A US report by Express VPN found 89 per cent of Americans surveyed think they should be able to choose whether tech companies can share their online personal data.</p><p>Cost, complexity, compliance and customer are shaping as the new Marketing 4Cs. Still, Proctor &amp; Gamble, the world's biggest advertiser, renewed its commitment to personalisation at the ANA conference. Marc Pritchard, P&amp;G'S chief brand officer and chair of the ANA, called for a reinvention of mass media via one-to-one precision through data, analytics and digital technology.</p><p>Ironically, it was Google's President of Brand Solutions, Kirk Perry, who tabled the sobering contradiction for 2020: \"how do we do more with less data?\"</p><p>Is it time to rethink data, because personalisation and privacy seem to be uneasy bedfellows?</p><p>Sunita Gloster is chief customer officer at WPP AUNZ</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520192676</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X87-M651-JBJ7-N3PJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"864\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Just prior to Thanksgiving 2018, The NY Times published a 5,600-word expos\u00e9 about Facebook. The article went behind the scenes, discussing all sorts of unsavory practices stemming from evidence of Russian meddling via Facebook in the U.S. 2016 presidential election. It revealed Facebook's extensive lobbying efforts to cover its guilt, as well as hiring a PR firm to find dirt on rivals. Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg were pilloried. Initially they denied the article's accusations. A few days later they obliquely admitted guilt in several areas.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's little wonder then that many of the 25 people we asked to make predictions for 2019 concentrated on the importance of trust and how PR could help win it back. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While you'll see trust mentioned throughout the 2020 predictions, mostly it is viewed as an underlying value that has long been critical to effective PR.  </p><p>The theme that arises more consistently in the 2020 predictions is personalization. For example, technology's ability to create personalized experiences for stakeholders. Similarly, the importance of personalizing pitches to media is noted.  Our first prediction, from Gene Grabowski of kGlogbal, anticipates more personal service.</p><p>Is this personalization thrust a reaction to the creeping influence of AI on PR? Or the ability through technology to issue millions of pieces of email to media and other stakeholders with several mouse clicks? A push back against social media bots? Perhaps. Does it have anything to do with the recent impeachment inquiry hearings, which made stars of several members of the faceless bureaucracy? We'd not hazard a guess, but we encourage you to do so. Drop our editor a note and let him know your thoughts. In the meantime, we trust you will find this year's predictions is useful and interesting.  </p><p>         Agencies </p><p>         Agencies and the Personal Touch</p><p>Gene Grabowski, Partner, kGlobal</p><p>Corporations are growing weary of millennial and Gen Z consultants \"handling\" them. They will look for more face-to-face interaction and personal service in 2020. Increasingly, even GenX and millennial clients are grousing about how little personal service and interaction they get from PR and management consultants who meet with them once, then seem to disappear as younger, less-experienced colleagues do much of the account work. Advertising and PR pros who show up for in-person meetings and provide high-end strategic counsel and first-rate work increasingly will win the lion's share of business, regardless of their firm's size. </p><p>         Agencies and the Rise of In-house PR </p><p>Steve Cody, Founder/CEO, Peppercomm</p><p>We'll see more corporations expand in-house marketing and communications teams. This will increase pressure on agencies to become strategic counselors as opposed to mere tacticians. In addition, PR firms will be challenged to provide business results to justify their value-add.</p><p>         Artificial Intelligence</p><p>Mark Weiner, Chief Insights Officer, Cision</p><p>Chair, IPR Measurement Commission </p><p>Applications for AI in PR research and evaluation will expand while claims of AI will explode.  Amidst this phenomenon, practitioners may be surprised to learn that rather than freeing them from mundane tasks, the technology requires a serious investment in human resources to train and manage the AI to deliver relevant content, accurate data and actionable insights. 2020 will be a year of discovery as the professional communicators who buy in to AI realize that reliable \"insights engine\" automation is overstated and that no technology replaces human expertise. </p><p>Suzanne Block, Director of Emerging Technology Group</p><p>Manager, West Coast Operations </p><p>Merritt Group</p><p>The hype of AI was \"enough\" to generate attention and newsworthiness. In 2019, use of the word \"AI\" in marketing was ubiquitous, making differentiation hard.</p><p>In 2020, organizations that want to rise to the top of the AI news cycle will be forced to take a stance on how their AI technology not only incorporates privacy, scalability and democratization for non-data minded skillsets, but also paint a picture of how it will change the way business is done. This process will stretch us to tell stories in a more unique way.  </p><p>Andrew Cross, SVP,  PR, Partner</p><p>Walker Sands </p><p>AI will bring practical utility to PR roles. Solutions increasingly are automating the process of content creation, which has big implications for media relations pros as well as corporate communicators. There also are AI-backed tools for real-time crisis monitoring. Several communications-measurement vendors tout AI-embedded solutions. </p><p>In 2020, AI will move from a futuristic technology on the horizon to a component solution incorporating many of the tools PR professionals engage with every day.</p><p>         Crisis </p><p>         Crisis and Employee Activism</p><p>Karen Mateo, CCO, PRSA</p><p>In 2019, we saw a spike in employee activism as workers more frequently (and with better organization) voiced complaints, expressing frustration with company policies and practices. This has resulted in an increased focus on internal communications and employee engagement to ensure a wide variety of opinions is being heard and company values are respected. Employers need to be better prepared for when a crisis like this inevitably arises. </p><p>Communicators will be required to play an even greater role in helping leadership manage through what can be a difficult situation, but one that can also result in positive outcomes and improved business practices.</p><p>Steve Cody</p><p>2020 will see a rise in agency employee activism. More agency employees will insist CEOs resign business because of ethical or moral dilemmas. Case in point: Edelman's recent resignation of The Geo Group, the private prison operator and contractor for ICE.</p><p>         Crisis Growth and Reputation</p><p>Esther-Mireya Tejeda, SVP, Head of Corporate, Communications &amp; PR Entercom</p><p>Crisis communications and reputation management will become increasingly important areas of expertise, likely accompanied by more in-house roles dedicated exclusively to corporate reputation management as part of broader communications teams.  </p><p>We have seen major, global brands across industries experience tremendous disruption due to events that quickly gained notoriety through social media. There is a growing cultural shift toward social media activism, also known as 'cancel culture,' with hashtag campaigns powered by the speed and influence of social media that push for boycotts of brands that have behaved in a way that is misaligned with consumer values and principles.  </p><p>Increasingly, communicators will be tasked with gatekeeping and culture testing to prevent incidents like these, and keep brands true to their mission statements and consumer expectations.</p><p>         Crisis and Regulation </p><p>Gene Grabowski, kGlobal</p><p>Crisis management teams are in for a sizable boost in business. Across the board, state and federal regulatory bodies will be more strictly enforcing legacy regulations and creating new ones to meet challenges. Vocal consumers and activist groups increasingly are concerned with reducing risk and exercising more control over corporations. </p><p>While some agencies that have President Trump's attention - such as the EPA and the Department of Education - will be cutting back on regulation, the FDA, USDA, Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Transportation will be cracking down on companies whose products and services appear to be creating risk for consumers. This will be especially true for the as-yet-unregulated cannabis and CBD oil industries, children's cribs, sleepwear and toys, processed foods and meat, and drugs of all kinds. </p><p>This will mean more companies for the first time will be signing on to create crisis communications and reputation-management plans - many before the end of the first quarter.</p><p>         Crisis and Organizational Structure</p><p>Kevin Elliott, Managing Director</p><p>US Risk+Crisis Communication Practice </p><p>Hill + Knowlton Strategies</p><p>There is a trend to make organizations flatter and less hierarchical. While flattening an organization makes for better collaboration and engagement of the breadth of talent easier, the same instinct will make incident response more difficult in some cases. If an organization is deepening a flattened culture to improve business processes, it will be necessary for leaders in that same organization to be counterintuitive in incident response planning. An effective incident response team is necessarily hierarchical and, to a degree, siloed. Look for the ability of flatter companies to maintain a counterintuitive structure for effective incident response.</p><p>         Crisis and Gen Z</p><p>Kevin Elliott, Hill+Knowlton Strategies</p><p>I've long been anticipating the arrival of Gen Z employees in the workplace. It will create a number of interesting dynamics, not the least of which is that they reportedly are less inclined to take risks. I'm unsure whether that means they will contribute to more safety or fewer incidents. It will be interesting to have more voices in the room with different calculations about risk and reward. We could very well see this new generation of workers have a decidedly more calming influence on the conversation around incident management and mitigation.</p><p>Diversity, Inclusion &amp; equity</p><p>Charlene Wheeless, Principal VP, Global Corporate Affairs, Bechtel Corporation</p><p>Employees will hold their companies more accountable for real, visible, and sustainable change when it comes to diversity, inclusion and equity.  Employees will begin to vote with their feet in companies and industries that just don't get it.  We are in an era of belonging.  Inclusion is no longer enough.  People will begin to demand the freedom to bring their authentic selves to work each day. </p><p>Steve Cody, Peppercomm</p><p>More clients will demand agencies provide full transparency about their diversity and inclusiveness programs. And they will be held far more accountable. Thankfully and, at long last, D&amp;I finally will become table stakes for agencies. And I'd like to believe the PR world will pay more attention to better representing our increasingly diverse country.</p><p>         Ethics and the elections</p><p>Michael Lewellen, VP, Marketing &amp; Communications, University of Portland</p><p>During the 2020 presidential election year there will be a hot market for academically credentialed, media-trained, thoughtful experts on critical topics. And what better place to find that expertise than at our institutions of higher learning? Leading the list of frequent topics will be ethics. Pointed analysis of ethics, honesty and moral formation will be needed in nearly all election coverage. The highest demand will be in the home markets of colleges and universities.</p><p>Neil Foote, President, Natl Black PR Society</p><p>As Bette Davis said in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">All About Eve</emphasis>, \"Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night.\" Well, 2020 is going to have many bumpy nights. Corporations, brands and influencers will find themselves in the midst of a contentious, divisive period...where they will be struggling to get their messages heard above the cacophony of headlines rooted in political strife. PR veterans might look back at the tumultuous times of the late 1960s when politics, race and an anxious mood reigned over the country like a thick morning fog. In 2020, PR pros will have to develop strategies that finetune messaging to reach their targeted audiences in creative and engaging ways. Adding a smart, fun, powerful social media strategy where stills and videos combine to create a compelling story on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube must become essential components to get above the noise - and engage customers who will be looking for relief from the political rhetoric.</p><p>         Finance</p><p>Rick Gould, CPA, J.D., Managing Partner, Gould+Partners </p><p>The PR M&amp;A field shows no sign of slowing in 2020. Expect a surge in new deals...PR firm owners should consider selling sooner rather than later...as it takes up to a year to identify a buyer and facilitate a quality transaction. Buyers are angling for strategic acquisitions ($3mill-$10 mill) as well as bolt-on deals ($1mill-$3mill). Bolt-on acquisitions increasingly are attractive to buyers because they fill a specific and immediate need - such as online analytics and influencer marketing - and can be completed relatively quickly. PR firms specializing in healthcare, financial services, consumer and tech will hold special appeal for buyers, due to their high-growth potential. Ditto for public affairs firms, in light of what's expected to be a furious election. Demand for valuations will grow. PR firms still suffer from too much over-servicing. Look for a much sharper focus on utilization and human capital.</p><p>Healthcare </p><p>Gil Bashe, Managing Partner, Global Health</p><p>Finn Parters</p><p>In the 2020 presidential election candidates will find common ground in attacking the drug-development sector on medication costs. Don't expect one of this nation's great innovators to take continued policy blows lying down. Pundits always seek easy answers to complex healthcare cost issues. Biopharma is an easy mark; however, if healthcare costs are a whopping 18 percent of GDP, drugs make up only 14 percent of that. What's wrong with this picture?</p><p>Along with political campaign sound bites, expect biopharma and medical device trade associations...to be front-and-center in telling how they benefit society and contribute to cost containment. Can we afford Alzheimer's? How about epidemic-level diabetes? Just as patients with unmet medical needs won't be silent, the industry will find its voice.</p><p>         Influencers</p><p>Michael Lamp, SVP, Digital, Hunter</p><p>The saturation point for influencer marketing is somewhere in our collective rear-view mirror. But that doesn't mean the tactic is any less valuable; it just means we've got to be a lot smarter about how we do it. Selfies with overly nebulas '#brandpartner' hash tags are proving less and less effective (not to mention in violation of FTC guidelines on disclosure). We mustn't settle for inauthentic, transactional efforts with influencers and creators. Just like the 'old school' practice of managing relationships with editors, influencer partnerships should be groomed. At the executional level, we need to look for unexpected ways to integrate influencers into brand storytelling vs. simply using them to distribute messages that don't reflect their personal brand(s).</p><p>Allison Fitzpatrick, Partner, Davis &amp; Gilbert, LLP</p><p>Throughout 2020, the FTC will continue to bring actions against fake reviews, sponcon and other fraudulent indicators of social media influence. In response to mounting pressure from Congress, 2020 will see the FTC and the Children's Advertising Review Unit take a closer look at influencer marketing directed to children, including some of the most famous child influencers. Everyone's focus in 2020, however, will be on virtual/CGI influencers - as regulators try to figure out how they fit into the legal landscape and, specifically, how the law applies to them.  </p><p>Internal Communications</p><p>Chris LaPlaca, SVP, Corporate Communications, ESPN</p><p>Companies will increasingly recognize the importance of internal communications.  While we may not always be able to control the external narrative in any given moment, working hard to ensure employee alignment around your organization's mission and vision is absolutely achievable, and critical in turbulent times.</p><p>         Measurement</p><p>Mark Weiner, Cision, IPR Measurement Commission</p><p>The walls between marketing and PR will continue to fall as data-driven campaigns enable more holistic marketing and communication decision-making, planning and evaluation.  For those who seek to optimize marketing's ROI, 2020 will be glorious. And for those who view PR as more than just marketing (it is) and wholly distinct from marketing (it is not), they will need to reinforce and quantify PR's unique contribution to the enterprise to validate the wisdom of management's investment. </p><p>Karen Mateo, Chief Communications Officer, PRSA</p><p>If data isn't your best friend already, you better be prepared to spend a lot more time together in 2020. As the quality of data communications professionals have access to gets more sophisticated, so does our ability to make smarter decisions based on sound analytics. Highly customized campaigns that can be measured more effectively will result in better experiences for consumers and demonstrate the value of PR in driving successful business outcomes. Audiences are becoming harder to reach and I expect to see even more personalization in our messaging using the wealth of data we now have access to.</p><p>         Media and media Relations</p><p>John Conrad, EVP/Partner, Merritt Group </p><p>PR pros will continue to draft press releases, but journalists will push for short, provocative story ideas with supporting content. Press releases won't disappear, but they shouldn't be the metric of a successful PR program.</p><p>I hear this during PR proposal meetings: \"We want to leverage your media contacts to drive awareness for our executives, company, and solutions.\" Wrong. Media relationships are critical, but if you have nothing interesting to say, you will be talking to yourself. Your media \"friendlies\" may take a briefing, but if there isn't a story, they won't write. Leverage PR to help build compelling storylines and then provide the right validation. That's what the media wants. Creativity and validation are critical. That will be true in 2020.</p><p>Michael Smart, Principal, SmartPR</p><p>In 2020, sophisticated media relations teams will give up fighting in the crowded mosh pit for fleeting coverage from the usual suspects in the old media. Instead, they'll carefully cultivate relationships with unlikely content partners, such as associations, prominent individuals, and even PR teams and other organizations with complementary audiences. They'll abandon chasing one-time impression boosts, recognizing that for PR, trust is the new reach. </p><p>John Walls, Director, Brand PRNeiman Marcus Group</p><p>Personalization continues to be a key business focus. This extends to the way PR pros interact with media. Yes, spray-and-pray sometimes yields success. But with publishers downsizing and outsourcing editorial, it's important to reach out to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">right</emphasis> contacts. Personalizing doesn't mean changing the reporter's name and publication in a mail merge. It's developing meaningful relationships  and approaching media contacts with individual pitches and angles that will inspire quality coverage.</p><p>Andrew Bowins, SVP, Communications and Public Affairs, Entertainment Software Association </p><p>To quote an old favorite, \"You have two ears and one mouth, so you should listen twice as hard before you speak.\" In 2020, communicators will return to basics to make the biggest impact. They'll put in the time and deploy tools to really understand what stakeholders care about and whom they listen to. Don't rush to communicate, don't pollute your channels with content for the sake of content. In fact, maybe pause a little and try to be more relevant to reporters who follow your industry. Ultimately, advocacy through a third party, like the press, is still the gold standard. Understand this new age of always-on content, but don't forget above the fold and front-page still carry weight.  </p><p>         Media Relations and Ethics</p><p>Chris La Placa, ESPN</p><p>Information, and more specifically, misinformation that can damage your brand, originates and travels rapidly and in a variety of directions. We already live in a 24-7 environment, but somehow we have to continue to find the energy to be vigilant and act with even more speed in stopping inaccurate, harmful information in its tracks.</p><p>Mark Weiner, Cisco, IPR Measurement Commission</p><p>Given the current discourse, society's generally accepted definition of \"the truth\" will continue to blur and facts will become more important than ever. While the truth is malleable, dependent upon one's ability to persuade another person of what is true, facts hold up better under scrutiny.  How the PR community adapts the science of persuasion to this reality will be one of 2020's great challenges.</p><p>         Purpose</p><p>Steve Cody, Peppercomm </p><p>As more companies declare their higher purpose, we'll see a corresponding increase in purpose-washing missteps. Many companies forget to stress-test purpose with every stakeholder audience to assure they are, in fact, living up to their higher purpose. Not doing so is asking for trouble. </p><p>There's been such a gold rush to put a higher purpose in place that many companies completely miss the mark when it comes to aligning their purpose with their business strategy. Some are just not paying close enough attention to how their actions contradict their purpose. An example is The College Board's self-inflicted crisis. Look for more of these disconnects in 2020. </p><p>Roger Bolton, President, Page</p><p>The Business Roundtable restatement of its purpose (PRN, Sept. 2019) is an attempt to catch up with the reality that companies have heard this message: Customers, employers, even investors, want business to build long-term, sustainable, societal value. We will see an acceleration of the trend in 2020, with the most creative and best-led companies making firm commitments and holding themselves accountable for progress against the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals. </p><p>         Relationships</p><p>Michael Lamp, Hunter</p><p>There's been an emphasis on the scale brands can achieve with programmatic solutions that are personal in how they reach consumers and hyper-efficient at scale. But even these tactics lack a human touch, which can trigger a conversion or drive loyalty. </p><p>We've seen Facebook announce that its EdgeRank algorithm is prioritizing what it delivers in News Feed based on quality engagements and more personal, relatable content. For PR pros, this should be a welcome change given our discipline's legacy of relationship building and storytelling. On owned channels, this evolution highlights the pivotal role of community management, which, when done right, is almost peerless in its ability to grow brand advocates.</p><p>         Social Media</p><p>Michael Lewellen, University of Portland</p><p>In 2020, self-curated, high-end digital content will be a must-have again to share across social media platforms. Earned media is increasingly tougher to gain via media release, press conference or interviews alone.  If you secure television cameras to cover your newsworthy event, that's great.  But their failure to attend should not mean zero coverage.  Plan ahead to capture key quotes, b-roll and images, and offer them as post-event content uploads to targeted outlets and journalists.  And use professional cameras and videography support.  The better the quality, the better the chances it gets used. </p><p>John Conrad, Merritt Group </p><p>Invest in a digital experience to augment your PR effort. Your audience wants to consume content online whether they are reading about you on a laptop or mobile device. Make sure you have content that users can click on, such as video, and is readable on mobile devices. If my nine-year-old twins are an indicator, make sure you have lots of video content as part of your digital experience -- more so than blogs. </p><p>Gene Grabowski, kGlobal</p><p>Podcasting is enjoying a huge resurgence. Similar to blogs a decade ago, podcasts will be a popular part of recommended agency PR strategies to create brands or enhance existing ones. PR pros ahead of the curve will seek ways to measure success, but even without quantifiable results, senior executives who are articulate and like attention, will jump at the idea of being podcast stars. The real challenge will be finding topics and guests who can keep audiences interested beyond the second or third podcast episodes; and this is where the cleverest and most imaginative agency professionals will prove their value.</p><p>         Social Media and Niche Messaging</p><p>Erin Flior, Senior Director, Marketing, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation </p><p>2020 will see niche audience messaging and targeting come to the forefront. In what will be an expensive and crowded ad and earned media space during an election year, brands and non-profits will move to more targeted communications, leveraging segmentation and more focused messaging to develop engaged audiences and brand advocates. Amplifying this will be increasing consumer awareness and concern around data privacy and an ongoing shift in social media behavior. Personal content sharing will continue moving toward closed groups. Intentionally public-facing, filtered content will be all that remains on the broader platforms.</p><p>         Social Media and Regulation</p><p>Andrew Cross, Walker Sands </p><p>Regulators will get serious about big tech. Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon have come under increased antitrust scrutiny, which will magnify in an election year. But it's not just congressional probes that could explore a break-up of big tech. Shareholders also may be warming up to the potential value unlocked from a Google spin-out of YouTube or a Facebook spin-out of Instagram. A more competitive environment in social media and search has big implications for PR and marketing pros, who may have to contend with a greater diversity of platforms.</p><p>         Storytelling and Writing</p><p>Larry Parnell, Associate Professor/Program Director Master's in Strategic PR</p><p>The George Washington University</p><p>My training as a journalist compels me to reflect on the number of the year ahead - 2020 - and its use in journalism and copywriting - to recommend a renewed focus on quality writing and storytelling. As educators of PR pros, we must be vigilant and stress that clear, succinct writing is a critical skill for all communications professionals. Too often we see examples - online, in the traditional media, politics and government - of poor or, even worse, unethical writing. It is our responsibility to combat this trend every day in class and in the workplace. Nothing is more important than getting your copy right - and doing the right thing in the process - in all of our communications work products. </p><p>Michael Smart, Smart PR</p><p>In 2020, content marketers and PR pros will stop pointing fingers and bashing each other about declining shares, backlinks, impressions and placements. Instead, they'll collaborate to create and distribute a vital few pieces of amazing content. They'll be willing to sacrifice quantity for quality, because they recognize that nobody is paying attention to the daily/weekly/monthly output dictated by the calendar and not newsworthiness. No more fighting over who gets to go first - true integration means storytelling is the premium, and channels are secondary. </p><p>John Walls, Neiman Marcus</p><p>PR pros need to better understand the demands of media in order to be more valuable resources. Reporters aren't simply writing stories. They've evolved into content engines, writing blogs, live tweeting events, and streaming interviews, to name a few. This will continue in 2020. While our pitches need to be more succinct and straightforward, they must be diverse in the offer. We should be offering a second interview for Facebook Live or IGTV, or pitching an additional exclusive image to be revealed on the outlet's Instagram page, or suggesting LinkedIn or Twitter posts once the outlet commits to the story. PR success is about being a trusted resource for content.</p><p>Technology and Ethics</p><p>Sophie Scott, Global MD, Technology, FleishmanHillard </p><p>The need for the technology sector to display strong ethics and a clear moral compass will (continue to) extend beyond the realms of AI. Around the world, we hear ever-louder cries for increased tech sector regulation and legislation. In fact, according to our research, 31 percent of consumers think tech companies are regulated too little. And beyond the rule of law, I anticipate conversation and debate around numerous techlash topics, from privacy to anti-trust, and geopolitics to shared responsibility. In 2020, the best remedy to techlash will be tech companies' internal and external commitments to working with government, academia and each other, and to behaving in ethical, socially responsible ways. To not only do the most profitable thing, but the right thing, on behalf of all stakeholders. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CONTACT:</emphasis><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:abowins@theesa.com\">abowins@theesa.com</email><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:afitzpatrick@dglaw.com\">afitzpatrick@dglaw.com</email><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:footecomm@gmail.com\">footecomm@gmail.com</email> rick@ gould-partners.com <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:rod.granger@prsa.org\">rod.granger@prsa.org</email><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:lparnell@email.gwu.edu\">lparnell@email.gwu.edu</email><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:gene.grabowski@kglobal.com\">gene.grabowski@kglobal.com</email><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:shelcie.kalinowski@hkstrategies.com\">shelcie.kalinowski@hkstrategies.com</email><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:michael@michaelsmartpr.com\">michael@michaelsmartpr.com</email><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:scody@peppercomm.com\">scody@peppercomm.com</email><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kiley.ribordy@walkersands.com\">kiley.ribordy@walkersands.com</email><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Esther-Mireya.Tejeda@entercom.com\">Esther-Mireya.Tejeda@entercom.com</email><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:rmercedes@univision.net\">rmercedes@univision.net</email><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:lewellen@up.edu\">lewellen@up.edu</email><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:john_walls@neimanmarcus.com\">john_walls@neimanmarcus.com</email><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:chelsey.watts@fleishman.com\">chelsey.watts@fleishman.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRN-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPC-FSK1-JCB9-8358-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156304</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4815\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Access Intelligence, LLC.

In practice, there are as many candidates in the 2020 presidential race as there are voters with online access in the United States. Every candidate is a customized persona created specifically for us by a complex set of algorithms that very few people fully understand. </p><p>This means we are all test subjects in an unprecedented sociopolitical experiment that, quite frankly, scares the hell out of me. AI is empowering each candidate to present themselves as if that candidate were speaking to us one-on-one. This has always been possible in small groups or at political rallies. But no politician in history has had the ability to speak to every individual voter one-on-one. Human politicians still can't, but their AI-generated political avatars can. And frighteningly, these AI-generated political avatars know more about our real hopes and dreams than any human candidate ever could. Where does XYZ Candidate stand on universal healthcare, reproductive rights, tax reform, the environment, gun violence prevention? Ask 100 million people, and you'll get a 100 million answers informed by customized messaging. This is truly new. Here's how it's done.Data You Don't Even Know You GenerateWhenever you interact with an app (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google) or website or any other online data aggregator (Nest, Alexa, Waze, your smartphone), you are creating two sets of data. The first set of data is the data required to enable the technology you are using to work. This might include the location of your device, if you're using Waze or your smartphone. Or the current temperature of your home, if you're using a Nest thermostat. Or what you are interested in at the moment, if you are using Facebook, Amazon, Google, Instagram, Twitter, etc. But you also create a second set of data. Sometimes referred to as 'surplus data,' these data are not specifically required to achieve your immediate objective - for example, your location when you tap a like button, or the time of day you are usually in your home when you adjust your thermostat, or the kinds of images that get your attention when you stop scrolling on a social network.  Surplus data are collected with the explicit purpose of improving the engineering of bespoke online environments and messaging that you will find irresistible. Said differently, these are the data used by algorithms to feed your social media addiction.Personalizing Your PoliticsThe goal of all targeted messaging (in fact, the goal of all advertising ever created) is simple: put the right message in front of the right person in the right place at the right time. This is not new, and it is not news.  But AI has changed the game. The amount of data (big data) that is available about each and every one of us is simply staggering. Using data we willingly contribute to data-rich organizations such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, any candidate can appear to you to be a champion for the causes or issues you are most passionate about. Convincing a single-issue voter that a candidate believes what that voter believes is truly child's play. But life is not that simple. Most voters are not single-issue. Most voters are nuanced and passionate about lots of issues.Pandering at ScaleTo customize messaging for multi-issue voters, behavioral data are fed into algorithms designed to score those behaviors and then predict what attributes should be crafted into the customized persona of the particular candidate. You can call it 'pandering at scale.' While this technology is table stakes in best practices digital advertising, dynamic apps, and websites, it is relatively new for politicians. They may be late to the game, but they are now using the schooling they received in 2016, and we're about to get an up close and personal view of the unintended consequences of the lessons learned.What's to Be Done about It?We all love to be blanketed in the comfort of the information we want to hear. But for the 2020 elections, we're going to have to get out of our comfort zones[1]. If you feel strongly about an issue, go visit some politician's website in incognito mode. No cookie? No personalization. Don't rely on inbound messaging; formulate questions and go seek the answers. The 2020 elections are going to be politically, technically, and physically hacked, and there is almost nothing any of us can do about it. But they are also going to be socially hacked. On that front, critical thinking, Socratic debate, and dogged pursuit of the truth are our best weapons - we need to use them. Lastly, it is dangerously naive to believe that breaking up Facebook or Google (or any other big tech company) will somehow magically solve the societal issues we are facing due to the insane use and misuse of big data. Breaking up big tech will certainly not have an impact on AI-generated political avatars or customized campaigning for 2020.  We are going to have to figure out some thoughtful, future-focused way to frame the conversation around data regulation. And while I do not think our current elected officials are the right people for the job, we do get to make a choice every Election Day. That is what truly makes America great.

On the centenary of Armistice, a new war may have just begun. Trade conflict is a small part of a larger battle.America's 'Tariff man' should better know that his tantrums can trample Mexico or Canada, but it's difficult to trump China. Remember, China and India accounted for over half of global GDP two centuries ago. It is not the West's sunset time yet, but the clock is reversing. </p><p>US hegemony is challenged as China gradually regains its polar position.Yes, China is ascending a great wall of debt, but its will to dominate is taller. Arrest a CFO, impose tariffs, block investments or play military games; nothing would cut the Middle Kingdom's ambitions. The boundaries of artificial intelligence and natural wisdom will be tested. Stan Lee's words of advice for both: With great power, comes great responsibility. Kim crossed the border to break bread with Trump in Singapore, and nibbled on noodles with Moon Jae-in. North Korea stole the limelight briefly, but West Asia remains the biggest geopolitical flashpoint. Khashoggi's murder tainted The Crown of MBS. The Game of Thrones between Saudis and Iran is taking a toll on Yemen. ISIS horror is back in Syria and Iraq. The US moving its embassy to sacred Jerusalem led to bloody games in Gaza. Markets, don't ignore crude realities.Harry and Markle United, and the Kingdom celebrated. Britain's Great divorce with the EU may not go smoothly. After creating a 'brief history of time' on earth, Stephen Hawking moved 'beyond the horizon'. EU didn't allow an extended budget for an Italian opera. Time will tell how the tale ends. Italian markets lost favour with investors, but Juventus FC rose with Ronaldo. Merkel-Macron turned less popular but deserve kudos as the flagbearers of liberalism and plurality.Russians had a 'ball' of a time. FIFA threw surprises like a Russian Roulette. Mbappe led La Football en Marche! A star is born: Croatia's Modric (Lady Gaga can wait).Abenomics' arrows missed the target, but Naomi Osaka's racket got Japan its first grand slam.Messi's country is a messy affair for investors.

The result may be the biggest political crisis the internet companies have faced since their creation -- and it's mostly their own fault.</p><p>The most likely outcome, no matter how the November election turns out, is that Congress will repeal the 1996 law that protects the platforms from liability for almost anything their users post.</p><p>Removing that law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, could throw their business model into chaos and make it difficult for Twitter and Facebook to survive.</p><p>Trump and the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, have both said the provision should be repealed -- although for different reasons.</p><p>Republicans claim Twitter and the other platforms are deliberately targeting conservatives and unfairly applying rules against hate speech, incitement and harassment.</p><p>Democrats have the opposite complaint: They charge that the platforms don't enforce the rules often enough. They complain that Trump and others have been allowed to get away with flagrant falsehoods and calumnies -- which is true.</p><p>Last week's crisis focused on Twitter, which enforced its internal rules on Trump for the first time. First the company attached warnings, labeled \"get the facts,\" to two presidential tweets that had called mail-in ballots \"fraudulent\" and predicted a \"rigged election\" in November.</p><p>Then Twitter added an anti-violence warning to a Trump tweet about riot-torn Minneapolis. \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" he wrote.</p><p>Trump and his allies said those disclaimers amounted to censorship. They didn't. Twitter still published all the president's words; now his readers will see the warnings as well.</p><p>Until recently, Facebook was also a target of conservative complaints because it sometimes enforced standards against right-wing extremists. But last week, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said he no longer thinks the company should try to be \"arbiters of truth.\"</p><p>Politicians' resentment against the increasingly powerful platforms has been building for a long time.</p><p>When Section 230 passed in 1996, it was intended to shield fragile startup companies when the internet was young. In the ensuing 24 years, the social media firms have become big and wealthy; it's no longer clear that they need protection.</p><p>The law not only shielded the companies from liability; it empowered them to restrict access to material that is \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.\"</p><p>That clause granted the platforms almost unlimited control over content. They developed rules and procedures for applying them in-house, with little or no visibility to anyone outside.</p><p>Twitter's standards, for example, list multiple categories of prohibited content, including child exploitation, targeted harassment, hateful conduct, encouraging suicide, nonconsensual nudity, posting other people's private information, manipulated media, promoting terrorism, threats or glorification of violence, and \"manipulating or interfering in elections.\"</p><p>The company ruled that Trump's tweets last week violated the last two rules.</p><p>The problem is it's not clear how the rules are applied, who applies them and how to get redress if you think you've been treated unfairly.</p><p>\"It's easier to get information out of the [National Security Agency] than one of these big tech companies,\" said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law professor and author of \"The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet,\" a book about Section 230.</p><p>In Trump's case, the company bungled the process. Its actions against the president seemed to come out of nowhere, with little warning or explanation.</p><p>Did Trump's claim, five months in advance, of a \"rigged election\" really constitute manipulation or interference?</p><p>And it seemed odd that while the president was tagged for falsely claiming that mail-in ballots produce fraud, he was not for repeatedly suggesting that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough had murdered a staff aide in 2001. (Authorities say there is no basis for Trump's allegation; Scarborough was 800 miles away when the woman died.)</p><p>Trump's response to Twitter's actions was a colorfully worded executive order that threatened to sic two regulatory agencies on the tech company. It asked the Federal Communications Commission to draft new rules to make social media companies liable for more content, and asked the Federal Trade Commission to examine whether the companies are enforcing their standards fairly.</p><p>The president's order appeared mostly symbolic, tailored for an election year. The FCC routinely takes months or years to draft new regulations, even on simple issues, and Trump's order was almost certain to be challenged in court.</p><p>In the longer run, though, Section 230 remains vulnerable in Congress -- if only because both Trump and Biden say they want to see it repealed.</p><p>What happens then?</p><p>Theoretically, eliminating the law could prompt social media platforms to crack down on more content to eliminate anything that could lead to a lawsuit. That could make Trump vulnerable to even more pesky warning labels.</p><p>But repeal could also perversely lead to the elimination of almost all standards -- because if there are no rules, the platforms can argue that they aren't responsible for enforcing any.</p><p>And that could produce an internet where pornography and extremist political content, both protected by the 1st Amendment, flood into platforms that were in-tended to be family friendly.</p><p>There was a more sensible solution available. The companies could have reformed their standards and practices, made them far more transparent and allowed the public to see how they were implemented.</p><p>But it may be too late for that kind of self-improvement. The companies moved too slowly. They resisted letting anyone see inside.</p><p>As a result, a law that was a foundation of their business is now in danger of repeal. That's not all Trump's fault. It's their fault too.</p><p>--</p><p>McManus' column appears on Sunday and Wednesday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: A MOBILE BILLBOARD passing in front of the White House comments on President Trump's threats to punish Twitter for fact-checking his tweets.

Apr\u00e8s l'autorisation donn\u00e9e aux femmes de conduire et de fr\u00e9quenter quelques stades, le prince h\u00e9ritier Mohammed Ben Salman, alias \" \u00a0MBS \u00a0\", va lever un autre tabou \u00a0: l'interdiction des \u00e9quipes mixtes de vendeurs dans les magasins. Chez Apple, en tout cas. La \" \u00a0firme \u00e0 la pomme \u00a0\" souhaite ouvrir, en 2019, un Apple Store dans la capitale de l'Arabie saoudite, Riyad, puis dans d'autres villes.</p><p>Cette information, r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e par le Financial Times, tombe au lendemain de la visite du jeune prince dans la Silicon Valley, vendredi 6 avril, o\u00f9 il a rencontr\u00e9 des dirigeants d'Amazon, de Facebook, d'Alphabet-Google et de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de capital-investissement. Avec l'objectif de les convaincre d'investir dans son pays pour l'aider \u00e0 diversifier une \u00e9conomie trop d\u00e9pendante du p\u00e9trole et cr\u00e9er des emplois pour la jeunesse. Il y a aussi rencontr\u00e9 Tim Cook, le patron d'Apple, et Angela Ahrendts, la vice-pr\u00e9sidente charg\u00e9e des Apple Store.</p><p>C'est peu dire que l'image du royaume est mauvaise aux Etats-Unis. Notamment dans une partie des milieux d'affaires les plus progressistes incarn\u00e9s par les \" \u00a0Big tech \u00a0\" et leur volont\u00e9 de promouvoir la diversit\u00e9 et de d\u00e9fendre les droits de l'homme. \" \u00a0Nous pensons que ce sont les \u00e9quipes les plus diversifi\u00e9es qui cr\u00e9ent le meilleur produit \u00a0\", professait M.

Certains patrons de la tech rechignent \u00e0 confirmer la signature de contrats, d'autres \u00e0 s'afficher avec les dirigeants saoudiens sur les photos. Et pourtant les g\u00e9ants d'Internet ont besoin de se d\u00e9velopper dans ce pays et, au-del\u00e0, dans tout le Moyen-Orient.</p><p>Ouverture politique</p><p>La population y est jeune (70 \u00a0% des Saoudiens ont moins de 30 ans), l'app\u00e9tit pour les nouvelles technologies tr\u00e8s fort, et le march\u00e9 loin d'\u00eatre satur\u00e9. Apple n'y est encore pr\u00e9sent qu'\u00e0 travers des interm\u00e9diaires et ne poss\u00e8de que trois magasins en propre, ouverts \u00e0 Abou Dhabi et Duba\u00ef en 2015. Ses iPhones n'occupent que la seconde place, derri\u00e8re les smartphones du cor\u00e9en Samsung.</p><p>Les autres groupes de la high-tech am\u00e9ricaine suivent avec le m\u00eame int\u00e9r\u00eat l'ouverture politique du prince h\u00e9ritier saoudien. Alphabet-Google avance ses pions. Le groupe a sign\u00e9 un accord sur le cloud computing (l'informatique d\u00e9mat\u00e9rialis\u00e9e) durant la tourn\u00e9e am\u00e9ricaine de \" \u00a0MBS \u00a0\" et tous les participants ont remarqu\u00e9 son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour la voiture autonome Waymo de la firme de Mountain View. Uber, un temps critiqu\u00e9 pour ses liens capitalistiques et ses activit\u00e9s avec ce pays, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 un pr\u00e9curseur. Au point qu'un fonds public saoudien avait investi 3,5 milliards de dollars en 2015 dans la plate-forme de r\u00e9servation. Autre temps, autres moeurs : il cherche aujourd'hui \u00e0 recruter des chauffeures.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Toujours aussi d\u00e9jant\u00e9, le patron du constructeur de voitures \u00e9lectriques haut de gamme (et de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a\u00e9rospatiale SpaceX) a voulu faire son \" poisson \", lundi 1er \u00a0avril. Il a post\u00e9 ce Tweet : \" Malgr\u00e9 d'intenses efforts pour trouver de l'argent, y compris une tentative d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9e de vente massive d'oeufs de P\u00e2ques, Tesla a fait totalement et compl\u00e8tement faillite. Une faillite telle que vous ne pouvez m\u00eame pas l'imaginer \". Il a aussi publi\u00e9 une photo de lui, un \u00e9criteau sur la poitrine, barr\u00e9 du mot \" bankwupt \" (\" ruin\u00e9 \"), assorti de ce commentaire : \" Elon a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 \u00e9vanoui contre une Tesla Model 3, entour\u00e9 de bouteilles \" Teslaquilla \", des traces de larmes s\u00e9ch\u00e9es encore visibles sur ses joues. \"</p><p>Ce n'\u00e9tait vraiment pas le moment, m\u00eame si M. Musk est agac\u00e9 par la chute de 20 \u00a0% de l'action Tesla \u00e0 Wall Street depuis un mois. Le titre a encore plong\u00e9 de 5,1 \u00a0%, lundi, \u00e0 la Bourse de New York. Le constructeur traverse une passe industrielle et financi\u00e8re difficile : retards dans la production du dernier-n\u00e9 de sa gamme, le Model 3, et baisse annonc\u00e9e de ses objectifs de ventes ; rappel de 123 000 Tesla S avant le week-end ; enqu\u00eate du r\u00e9gulateur am\u00e9ricain des transports apr\u00e8s un r\u00e9cent accident mortel impliquant un de ses v\u00e9hicules autonomes, m\u00eame si Tesla assure que le conducteur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment averti qu'il lui fallait reprendre le volant.</p><p>Presque toutes les Big Tech sont sous surveillance des march\u00e9s, certains investisseurs estimant avoir trop de valeurs technologiques dans leur portefeuille. Et dans le collimateur des hommes politiques, aux Etats-Unis et en Europe : Amazon, clou\u00e9 au pilori de Twitter par un Donald Trump accusant le g\u00e9ant du e-commerce de mettre la Poste am\u00e9ricaine sous tension et de d\u00e9truire le commerce traditionnel, y compris des enseignes historiques comme Toys'R'Us ; Facebook, \u00e9branl\u00e9 par le scandale Cambridge Analytica, un pillage de 50 \u00a0millions de profils d'internautes au profit d'hommes politiques ; Uber, lui aussi mis en cause apr\u00e8s l'accident mortel caus\u00e9 par un de ses v\u00e9hicules autonomes en Arizona. Nombre de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ont ainsi vu fondre leur capitalisation ces derni\u00e8res semaines.</p><p>Une lourde dette</p><p>Mais peu de titans de la Silicon Valley sont aussi fragiles que Tesla. Depuis sa cr\u00e9ation en \u00a02003, il n'a pas d\u00e9gag\u00e9 de b\u00e9n\u00e9fices annuels. Sa dette est lourde et co\u00fbteuse, et il va encore devoir faire appel au march\u00e9 pour se refinancer. L'avenir de la \" maison Musk \" repose donc sur la confiance d'investisseurs pr\u00eats \u00e0 mettre ou remettre au pot pour continuer ce qui ressemble bien \u00e0 une aventure. Et sans esp\u00e9rer que l'entreprise fasse des profits dans l'imm\u00e9diat. Apr\u00e8s tout, les actionnaires fid\u00e8les n'ont pas eu \u00e0 se plaindre : l'action a gagn\u00e9 515 \u00a0% en cinq ans. Ils attendent n\u00e9anmoins avec impatience \u2013 et inqui\u00e9tude \u2013 la publication du nouveau rythme de production du Model 3 dans quelques jours. Et l\u00e0, le fantasque patron de Tesla n'aura pas droit au poisson d'avril.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Once you are sensitized to these factors, you see them everywhere. A good example is in the business section of today's print version of the New York Times, August 1, 2019. There are at least five stories in this section that reflect the consequences of organizational and regulatory failure. </p><p>The first and most obvious story[1] is one that has received frequent mention in Understanding Society, the Boeing 737 Max disaster. In a story titled 'FAA oversight of Boeing scrutinized\", the reporters give information about a Senate hearing on FAA oversight earlier this week. Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee questioned the process of certification of new aircraft currently in use by the FAA. Citing the Times story, Ms. Collins raised concerns over 'instances in which FAA managers appeared to be more concerned with Boeing's production timeline, rather than the safety recommendations of its own engineers.' Senator Jack Reed referred to the need for a culture change to rebalance the relationship between regulator and industry. Agency officials continued to defend the certification process, which delegates 96% of the work of certification to the manufacturer. This story highlights two common sources of organizational and regulatory failure. There is first the fact of 'production pressure' coming from the owner of a risky process, involving timing, supply of product, and profitability. This pressure leads the owner to push the organization hard in an effort to achieve goals -- often leading to safety and design failures. The second factor identified here is the structural imbalance that exists between powerful companies running complex and costly processes, and the safety agencies tasked to oversee and regulate their behavior. The regulatory agency, in this case the FAA, is under-resourced and lacks the expert staff needed to carry out in depth a serious process of technical oversight. The article does not identify the third factor which has been noted in prior posts on the Boeing disaster, the influence which Boeing has on legislators, government officials, and the executive branch.A second relevant story[2] (on the same page as the Boeing story) refers to charges filed in Germany against the former CEO of Audi who has been charged concerning his role in the vehicle emissions scandal. This is part of the long-standing deliberate effort by Volkswagen to deceive regulators about the emissions characteristics of their diesel engine and exhaust systems. The charges against the Audi executive involved ordering the development of software designed to cheat diesel emissions testing for their vehicles. This ongoing story is primarily a story about corporate dysfunction, in which corporate leaders were involved in unethical and dishonest activities on behalf of the company. Regulatory failure is not a prominent part of this story, because the efforts at deception were so carefully calculated that it is difficult to see how normal standards of regulatory testing could have defeated them. Here the pressing problem is to understand how professional, experienced executives could have been led to undertake such actions, and how the corporation was vulnerable to this kind of improper behavior at multiple levels within the corporation. Presumably there were staff at multiple levels within these automobile companies who were aware of improper behavior. The story quotes a mid-level staff person who writes in an email that 'we won't make it without a few dirty tricks.' So the difficult question for these corporations is how their internal systems were inadequate to take note of dangerously improper behavior. The costs to Volkswagen and Audi in liability judgments and government penalties are truly vast, and surely outweigh the possible gains of the deception. These costs in the United States alone exceed $22 billion.A similar story[3], this time from the tech industry, concerns a settlement of civil claims against Cisco Systems to settle claims 'that it sold video surveillance technology that it knew had a significant security flaw to federal, state and local government agencies.' Here again we find a case of corporate dishonesty concerning some of its central products, leading to a public finding of malfeasance. The hard question is, what systems are in place for companies like Cisco that ensure ethical and honest presentation of the characteristics and potential defects of the products that they sell? The imperatives of working always to maximize profits and reduce costs lead to many kinds of dysfunctions within organizations, but this is a well understood hazard. So profit-based companies need to have active and effective programs in place that encourage and enforce honest and safe practices by managers, executives, and frontline workers. Plainly those programs broke down at Cisco, Volkswagen, and Audi. (One of the very useful features of Tom Beauchamp's book Case Studies in Business, Society, and Ethics[4] is the light Beauchamp sheds through case studies on the genesis of unethical and dishonest behavior within a corporate setting.)Now we go on to Christopher Flavelle's story[5] about home-building in flood zones. From a social point of view, it makes no sense to continue to build homes, hotels, and resorts in flood zones. The increasing destruction of violent storms and extreme weather events has been evident at least since the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. Flavelle writes: There is overwhelming scientific consensus that rising temperatures will increase the frequency and severity of coastal flooding caused by hurricanes, storm surges, heavy rain and tidal floods. At the same time there is the long-term threat of rising seas pushing the high-tide line inexorably inland. However, Flavelle reports research by Climate Central[6] that shows that the rate of home-building in flood zones since 2010 exceeds the rate of home-building in non-flood zones in eight states. So what are the institutional and behavioral factors that produce this amazingly perverse outcome? The article refers to incentives of local municipalities in generating property-tax revenues and of potential homeowners subject to urban sprawl and desires for second-home properties on the water. Here is a tragically short-sighted development official in Galveston who finds that \"the city has been able to deal with the encroaching water, through the installation of pumps and other infrastructure upgrades\": \"You can build around it, at least for the circumstances today. It's really not affected the vitality of things here on the island at all.\" The factor that is not emphasized in this article is the role played by the National Flood Insurance Program in the problem of coastal (and riverine) development. If flood insurance rates were calculated in terms of the true riskiness of the proposed residence, hotel, or resort, then it would no longer be economically attractive to do the development. But, as the article makes clear, local officials do not like that answer because it interferes with \"development\" and property tax growth. ProPublica has an excellent 2013 story on the perverse incentives created by the National Flood Insurance Program, and its inequitable impact on wealthier home-owners and developers (link[7]). Here is an article by Christine Klein and Sandra Zellmer in the SMU Law Review on the dysfunctions of Federal flood policy (link[8]):Taken together, the stories reveal important lessons, including the inadequacy of engineered flood control structures such as levees and dams, the perverse incentives created by the national flood insurance program, and the need to reform federal leadership over flood hazard control, particularly as delegated to the Army Corps of Engineers. Here is a final story[9] from the business section of the New York Times illustrating organizational and regulatory dysfunctions -- this time from the interface between the health industry and big tech. The story here is an effort that is being made by DeepMind researchers to use artificial intelligence techniques to provide early diagnosis of otherwise mysterious medical conditions like \"acute kidney injury\" (AKI). The approach proceeds by analyzing large numbers of patient medical records and attempting to identify precursor conditions that would predict the occurrence of AKI. The primary analytical tool mentioned in the article is the set of algorithms associated with neural networks. In this instance the organizational / regulatory dysfunction is latent rather than explicit and has to do with patient privacy. DeepMind is a business unit within the Google empire of businesses, Alphabet. DeepMind researchers gained access to large volumes of patient data from the UK National Health Service. There is now regulatory concern in the UK and the US concerning the privacy of patients whose data may wind up in the DeepMind analysis and ultimately in Google's direct control. \"Some critics question whether corporate labs like DeepMind are the right organization to handle the development of technology with such broad implications for the public.\" Here the issue is a complicated one. It is of course a good thing to be able to diagnose disorders like AKI in time to be able to correct them. But the misuse and careless custody of user data by numerous big tech companies, including especially Facebook, suggests that sensitive personal data like medical files need to be carefully secured by effective legislation and regulation. And so far the regulatory system appears to be inadequate for the protection of individual privacy in a world of massive databases and largescale computing capabilities. The recent FTC $5 billion settlement imposed on Facebook, large as it is, may not suffice to change the business practices of Facebook (link[10]). (I didn't find anything in the sports section today that illustrates organizational and regulatory dysfunction, but of course these kinds of failures occur in professional and college sports as well. Think of doping scandals in baseball, cycling, and track and field, sexual abuse scandals in gymnastics and swimming, and efforts by top college football programs to evade NCAA regulations on practice time and academic performance.)

Who you were communicating with was actually a law enforcement officer but that does not diminish your offending. You are 57 years old and are of previous good character and, apart from this, have been an upstanding husband and father.\"</p><p>Sarah Slater, prosecuting, said the offending took place on the same day - June 25, 2019 - beginning at 9am, from his home in Hardwick Avenue.</p><p>She said Griffiths made contact with \"Kylie\" over a free text chat room called Chatiw. \"Kylie\" told him she was 13.</p><p>Miss Slater said: \"Almost immediately he turned the chat sexual. He told her to think about him being naked and in bed with her and repeatedly asked her if he could see her body. He asked for photos of her and asked if she wanted to see his private parts. He then sent a video of a naked female lying on a bed. He told her 'you must keep it secret.'\" .\"</p><p>Miss Slater said the officer handed over details to police who went to Griffiths' home on November 28 and arrested him. He pleaded guilty to attempting sexual communication with a child aged under 16, attempting to incite a child aged under 16 to engage in sexual activity and attempting to cause a child aged under 16 to watch a sexual act.</p><p>Griffiths has no previous convictions. Simon Blakebrough, mitigating, said his client suffered a \"mini breakdown\" when his guilty plea was reported in January. He said: \"The defendant expresses regret and says he lost his way and feels disgusted. His wife is in court and supports him saying he has been an upstanding husband and father. He has two children and they support him also.\"</p><p>As well as the suspended jail sentence, Judge Warburton handed Griffiths a 10-year sexual harm prevention order and placed him on the sex offenders' register, also for 10 years.

A month earlier, the former Supervisor and Board president from 2001 to 2009 had re-emerged from private life. He defeated Mayor Ed Lee's handpicked incumbent, Julie Christensen, batting away a candidate backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars from the tech and real estate industries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Join the conversation: Follow <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/SFBusinessTimes\">@SFBusinessTimes</url> on Twitter, \"Like\" us on       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.facebook.com/SFBusinessTimes/\">Facebook</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/newsletter/\">sign up for our free email newsletters.</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Peskin said at his first Board meeting that he had no intention of returning to politics, but the city's affordability crisis had become so severe that he felt compelled to act.</p><p>\"The message of this election is clear: City government hasn't been doing enough to ease this crisis, and there's much more we can and should do. We have a mandate to take bold action on affordable housing,\" said Peskin.</p><p>And then he voted to kill an $80 million public land deal where a 600-unit residential tower was proposed at 30 Van Ness.</p><p>It was a dramatic arrival, and Peskin's impact and influence have only grown in the past six months. As the critical sixth vote for the previously outnumbered progressive bloc of the Board of Supervisors, Peskin has created a new majority and a sharp policy shift.</p><p>To some, Peskin's arrival signifies a a new direction for the city, one that is less deferential to big tech money and real estate developers. Others fear that the return of a polarizing figure from the city's political past presages a return to the fierce battles that marked his first stint in office, many of them over land use and development. Critics of Peskin say that he is a foe of development who delays and kills major projects.</p><p>He has already proposed a flurry of legislation, such as independent audits of city real estate deals and scaling down a density bonus program so it would not apply to market-rate projects. Peskin has also proposed a November ballot measure to remove mayoral control of three major city real estate departments. Supervisor Jane Kim, with Peskin's support, also successfully convinced voters to pass Prop. C this month, which doubled the city's affordable housing requirement to 25 percent, the most sweeping housing policy change in years.</p><p>At the same time, Peskin appears to be cultivating a calmer, less combative tone. The politician once nicknamed the \"Napoleon of North Beach,\" and known for his late night abusive phone calls to city officials and others who displeased him is older now, with a whiter beard, seven years after he was last in power. \"I promise not to call you in the middle of the night,\" Peskin told his colleagues at his first board meeting.</p><p>Sitting outside his favorite coffee spot, Caffe Trieste in North Beach in May, he told the Business Times he's approaching the job differently now.</p><p>\"When I was first elected I was 35 years old. I wanted to save the world in eight years,\" he said. \"I'm turning 52 next month. I see the world with more perspective.\" Friends and allies say they've seen a calmer, more introspective Peskin as well. Part of that is circumstances. \"When he was president of the Board, the pressure was immense,\" said Jon Golinger, a member of the Telegraph Hill Dwellers who managed Peskin's first campaign in 2000.</p><p>The best deal for the city</p><p>After the city's economy roared back from the recession, issues like affordability, homelessness and transit have only intensified. And the stakes may be even higher, as one of the city's most valuable assets - the very air where new buildings can rise or not rise - has become more valuable.</p><p>\"Our fundamental job is to get as much for our shareholders, the people of the City and County of San Francisco, as we can,\" said Peskin at his first hearing.</p><p>And Peskin is a veteran dealmaker who can recall tiny details from the city's arcane planning code or hundred-page purchase agreements, according to colleagues and real estate sources.</p><p>Peskin is progressive on many issues like social services, affordable housing and LGBT rights. But on many economic issues, longtime ally Golinger describes Peskin as \"almost fiscally conservative,\" citing his disdain for wasting city money.</p><p>\"Aaron is clearly one of the best minds on housing and land use that the city has seen in some time,\" said Tim Colen, executive director of the San Francisco Housing Action Coalition, which has disagreed with Peskin on some housing policies. \"He's a nuts-and-bolts pragmatist who can get things done.\"</p><p>Peskin's skills have won him surprising support from some real estate groups. The San Francisco Apartment Association, which represents landlords, endorsed Peskin in last year's campaign, despite his support of expanding rent control to post-1979 buildings, which the Association opposes.</p><p>\"I want someone who will fight for the best deal,\" said Janan New, executive director of the Association. \"He has a vision for San Francisco. What I think we're really lacking in this town right now is a vision.\"</p><p>The obstructionist?</p><p>Foes, few of whom will speak on the record for fear of risking his ire, paint Peskin as an obstructionist who blocks all development. An examination of his voting record offers a more nuanced portrait. In 2009, he helped pass the Eastern Neighborhoods plan, which has led to the transformation of vast swathes of South of Market and the southeastern waterfront in one of the city's biggest development booms.</p><p>\"I remind people when they hurl accusations of being 'anti-growth' or 'anti-real estate' that I was the president of the Board that presided over the rezoning of over 20 percent of the city and was an integral force in greenlighting the largest single housing development that the city has built since World War II at the Hunters Point Shipyard,\" said Peskin.</p><p>At the same time, Peskin can be brutally effective at shutting down projects that he hates. The rejection of a citywide ballot measure that would have raised height limits on the waterfront in 2013 essentially killed developer Simon Snellgrove's 8 Washington tower proposal.</p><p>Kilroy's Flower Mart proposal in South of Market agreed to additional concessions last year that would preserve the existing market after Peskin and groups threatened a ballot measure to block the project.</p><p>Peskin also backed a lawsuit to block Lennar Urban and Wilson Meany's Treasure Island plan, despite supporting the project while he was supervisor (see story, page 32). His reasoning was that the developers sought to change the terms of the deal around 2010, following the global recession. But he noted that the initial agreement assumed a 30-year timeline and that meant anticipating downturns in the market.</p><p>Peskin remains unapologetic for supporting the lawsuit, which was ultimately rejected. \"The city made a terrible mistake in walking away from its original deal. And they got taken advantage of,\" said Peskin of Treasure Island.</p><p>As for more market-rate housing development, which economists and the state's Legislative Analyst Office say will alleviate high housing prices eventually, Peskin says it's one piece of the city's toolbox to combat unaffordability.</p><p>\"Supply is definitely part of it. But we also have to remember what kind of supply,\" said Peskin. \"Certainly building market-rate, $2,200-a-square-foot Infinity towers serves a need. But it's not going to house a schoolteacher.\"</p><p>The Supervisor v. the Mayor</p><p>Many of Peskin's proposals seek to shift power away from the Mayor's office and give more oversight to the Board. Peskin stresses that he has a long, productive relationship with Mayor Ed Lee, and they now meet every few weeks for coffee or a meal. But Peskin said he believes there is a leadership vacuum in City Hall, and a wave of cash from the tech industry is seeking to exploit that void. \"I am concerned that a handful of primarily tech billionaires have captured the political hearts and minds of City Hall. Somebody needs to stand up to them,\" said Peskin.</p><p>And Peskin has a particular billionaire in mind, one who has spent millions loudly supporting Mayor Lee's initiatives and candidates: Ron Conway, founder of Angel Investors, an early investor in now gargantuan tech companies including Google, Facebook and Airbnb.</p><p>\"He's a bull in a China shop and throws his weight around and has undue influence in the administration,\" said Peskin. \"But there are many, many tech companies that are very much a part of the ethos of San Francisco.\"</p><p>Conway declined to comment.</p><p>Peskin said that part of growing older was recognizing that no entity was monolithic, whether tech or housing activists.</p><p>\"I don't see tech as the enemy,\" said Peskin.</p><p>Observers say that the differences between Peskin and the Mayor are as much about style, with the understated Lee a sharp contrast to the fiery Peskin. \"The mayor has chosen the approach of seeking consensus. That is, in itself, a form of leadership,\" said Michael Theriault, secretary-treasurer at the San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council.</p><p>Mayor Lee's spokeswoman defends his leadership style, as well as his record.</p><p>\"With all due respect to Supervisor Peskin, who is extremely passionate about this city and its citizens, many will beg to differ about the accomplishments of Mayor Lee,\" said Deirdre Hussey, a spokeswoman for the mayor. She noted that unemployment in San Francisco has dropped to 3.1 percent in June, and the city has more housing constructed and in the pipeline than any other California city. \"Some politicians measure accomplishments by how many fights they pick and how many headlines they garner, and Mayor Lee has a different style. He measures success by how much he gets done and how many people he gets involved in solving some of the city's most challenging issues,\" said Hussey.</p><p>Reacting to the housing crisis</p><p>One of the biggest deals that Peskin and colleague Jane Kim have made is Prop. C, which raised the affordable housing requirement for new projects to 25 percent. Developers initially were shocked by the new requirements and said the new threshold would kill new housing. But a series of marathon negotiations led to virtually no opposition to the ballot measure, which passed this month.</p><p>Eric Tao, CEO of developer AGI Avant, the main negotiator on Prop C for the business community, said he, Kim, Peskin and Mayor Lee met multiple times earlier this year. \"I felt that there was a lot of mutual respect,\" said Tao.</p><p>They ultimately agreed to allow projects proposed in the last few years to pay lower requirements. The 25 percent change may also change following a study by July.</p><p>\"If Prop. C had passed without a trailing ordinance, the pipeline would have been destroyed. Now the pipeline would be preserved,\" said Tao.</p><p>However, projects proposed this year or in the future are currently subject to the 25 percent requirement, which developers like Oz Erickson have said will kill future plans.</p><p>Having four negotiators essentially deciding sweeping citywide policy with no public input has drawn sharp criticism from the more moderate supervisors. \"The process has been a farce,\" said Supervisor Mark Farrell, a moderate, who described the process as a backroom deal. \"If we're going to create new regulations around affordable housing, we need to make sure we're not changing the rules in the fifth inning in the game and cratering their process.\"</p><p>Supervisor Scott Wiener, another moderate member of the board, is also critical of Prop. C.</p><p>\"I don't like the direction the board is going on housing. We're at risk of going back to the days where we're looking at any excuse to not build housing,\" said Wiener. But he's also complimentary of Peskin as a person.</p><p>\"He's very smart. He's very engaged. He's thorough,\" he said.</p><p>Mayor in the making?</p><p>Peskin will be running virtually unopposed again in November for his board seat, but the 2019 mayoral election also looms on the horizon. Lee will be termed out and a free-for-all is expected. Will it include Peskin, as some observers speculate?</p><p>\"I doubt it. I like where I'm at,\" he said.</p><p>In the meantime, even if there is a downturn in the coming years, the influence of big money on the city is unlikely to waver. And Peskin believes that the tech industry's vast coffers has made it an insidious force in city politics.</p><p>\"It's the Wild West. They're behaving like the railroad barons of the 1850s,\" he said. \"I'm not trying to be the sheriff, and I'm not looking for a fight, but I'm not going to shy away from my responsibility.\"</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

While in 2018 the market showed record levels of optimism regarding growth expectations, today the slowdown in the economy changes the perception of organizational growth and, in virtually all geographic regions, CEOs show a significant decrease in confidence in their companies' revenue prospects in the short term.</p><p><br/>For the first time, more than half of the world's top executives believe global GDP growth will slow, according to PwC's latest CEO survey at the recent Davos Forum (23rd PwC Annual Global CEOs Survey, where they responded to more than 1500 axis 83 countries). Globally, according to the report, those who identified themselves as \"somewhat confident\" or \"very confident\" in this area added 73% (9 points less than the previous year) and in Latin America concentrated 64% (17 points less).<br/>The trend deepens in our country where the total of \"very confident\" or \"somewhat confident\" CEOs \u2013 which last year had already experienced a significant decline \u2013 only reached 38%. This means that 6 out of 10 entrepreneurs do not trust their organizations to grow over the next twelve months. Exchange rate volatility, increased tax burden and political uncertainty are the main fears of Argentine CEOs, who are among the most pessimistic in the world in responding to the economic growth prospects.<br/>Source: PwC Global \"23rd Annual Global CEO Survey\"<br/>What is the extent of this record level of mistrust? The economic challenges faced by entrepreneurs are not new, but the speed of changes and adjustments that new technologies demand, coupled with the geopolitical uncertainty of \"trade wars\" and populisms, over-regulation and access to talent, among other concerns, means that leaders must focus on an agile and dynamic strategy that accompanies the changes and lessens the effects of the global economic slowdown.<br/>In particular, business leaders express concerns about over-regulation on their businesses. More than two-thirds of CEOs say governments will introduce new laws to regulate content on both the Internet and social media, helping in turn to reorganize the field of action of the most influential technology companies (Big Tech). With regard to state participation, the debate is about whether it should adapt its regulatory frameworks to emerging standards, or set new limits on data privacy and content moderation.<br/>For the first time, more than half of the world's top executives believe global GDP growth will slow<br/>It also has a negative impact on the scarcity of skilled resources based on the demand for new technologies. While globally only 18% reported significant progress in updating their training programs, the so-called \"Fourth Industrial Revolution\" introduced new business models and ways of working that require renewed technical skills, and this issue must be on the directory agenda.<br/>Climate change is a major factor that CEOs take into account when planning business. There is aincreasing recognition as to the positiveaspects of actively participating in reducing the carbon footprint. Currently, executives argue that investing in climate change-related projects would imply a reputationadvantage (30% in 2020 versus 16% in 2010), and 25% \u2013 compared to 13% in 2010 - say climate change initiatives open up new opportunities to generate products and services for your organization.<br/>The photo shows that the situation is a challenging place for businesses, but the film may have a positive outcome if some of the unknowns that cloud the vision of the world's top executives can be cleared.<br/>The author is a partner of PwC Argentina, in charge of the marketing and communications area<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-10801886</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6F-FMC1-JBJN-M3CC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"626\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>opinion</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

The Mayor from McKinsey is the wrong man to make the case.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A funny debate has been roiling the online left: Do young liberals hate Pete Buttigieg too little, or too much?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the past few months, Buttigieg, the presidential candidate and young mayor of tiny South Bend, Ind., has enjoyed a steady, unlikely rise in early state polls. But with success has come a backlash, and then a backlash to the backlash.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On paper, Buttigieg ticks a lot of presidential-candidate boxes; you can't write about Mayor Pete without mentioning he's a Rhodes scholar, he's a veteran and he has an articulate, cool-tempered decency reminiscent of Barack Obama. And yet the mayor has drawn the ire of the plugged-in progressive left. There's something curious about the disdain, notes Derek Thompson in The Atlantic. In a field of many other milquetoast moderates - including the front-runner Joe Biden - why has Mayor Pete been singled out for special skewering by young radicals?</p><p>I am not so young, but I am one of those crazy radicals who have been concerned about the intractable domination of our society by a small band of wealthy interests. So I'll tell you why I don't like Buttigieg. It's not because I think he'd be an especially bad president. Like Biden, the mayor seems to possess the baseline capacity to run America in a way that isn't an embarrassment or a disgrace, which would certainly be a step up from the current administration.

Today's seemingly rosy climate is the culmination of a political economy that consistently rewards the already wealthy at the expense of everyone else. The only way to reverse the trend toward inequality is to reform the way America does business. A politician who pushes for these reforms needs courage, because the forces arrayed against structural change are powerful. </p><p>But while Mayor Pete has outlined several progressive-sounding ideas for overhauling Americans' economic lives -\u00a0including a call for universal health care (that will still include a hefty role for private corporations), an idea for lowering student debt (but not making college free), a promise to strengthen regulations against monopolies (but a reluctance to break up Big Tech) - he lacks authenticity. Rather than fundamental reform, many of his proposals end up sounding like opportunistic incrementalism, as if he wants to be seen to be doing something without really doing much at all, for fear of arousing the forces arrayed against reform. Even Biden, who has built his brand on common-man folksisms, seems more believable, and he has explicitly promised billionaires that nothing much will change for them.</p><p>My fears about Mayor Pete's easy way with the wealthy were confirmed this week, when he convened a group of big-money donors on a tour through Silicon Valley. I wasn't surprised that he has proved so attractive to the tech set. With his slick, easy optimism, Mayor Pete reminds me of so many techies who promise big, disruptive change while refusing to accept the full costs of achieving their idealism. For them, there's always an easy, slapdash, cost-free revolution: Just use the right hashtag on Instagram and you, too, can spark regime change in the Arab world.</p><p>I suspect we'll need a bolder candidate to take on Trumpism and corporate control.

Thanks to a tax cut that swelled corporate coffers and a frenzy of deregulation that unleashed long-term dangers in exchange for short-term profits, the hits just keep coming: We're now in the longest expansion in history, with little sign of abating. Job growth regularly defies naysayers. The stock market seems to set a record more often than people stream Mariah Carey Christmas hits.</p><p>On CNBC the other day, the anchor Jim Cramer, reflecting the mood of Wall Street, said, \"These are the best numbers of our lives.&amp;#34; </p><p>For the president, the political argument here is straightforward. Like Bill Clinton in 1996 or Ronald Reagan in 1984, Trump is planning to point to an economy doing its best George Costanza: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">We're back, baby, we're back!</emphasis> Every week on Twitter, Trump chef-kisses new economic stats as if he'd personally assembled the national dish. </p><p>That's one way to put it. Here's another way: This economy is stupid.</p><p>As my colleague David Leonhardt writes, headline economic stats are increasingly divorced from more substantive metrics on American well-being. This is a country in which prosperity rains on the rich while hundreds of thousands of people go bankrupt every year for getting sick. This is a country in which it is not unusual to encounter developing-world misery alongside the most obscene collections of wealth ever recorded. There's a lot of job growth, but a lot of the jobs are low-wage, high-toil jobs. It's a country in which every nearly every economic sector trends toward monopoly and oligarchy, and in which regulators let companies call the shots - see the F.A.A. and Boeing or the F.T.C. and Google.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have turned these dismal realities into the central pillars of their campaigns. Both are calling for policies that fundamentally overhaul corporate control of the economy. As their detractors note, it's unlikely that they will be able to achieve many of those goals in our polarized political climate. But what matters to me is that they are making the case. They have articulated both far-reaching, structural policy goals and political strategies that mesh with the spirit of those goals. Not only are they calling for fundamental change that will alter vast sectors of the economy; they are also committed to undoing the influence of corporations and the wealthy in their own path to the White House, underscoring their commitment to their goals.</p><p>I don't see how Mayor Pete can make a similarly compelling case. I don't see how he can take on Trump's economy without at least attempting to fight the C.E.O.s who championed the corporate cash-grab that made it so hot. And I don't see how he can take on those C.E.O.s while holding fund-raisers in Napa Valley \"wine caves.\"</p><p>Mayor Pete seems like a lovely man. That's the problem. He'll get eaten alive by the corporate machine that now runs the world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Office Hours With Farhad Manjoo</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Farhad wants to </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">chat with readers on the phone</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.

The Mayor from McKinsey is the wrong man to make the case.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A funny debate has been roiling the online left: Do young liberals hate Pete Buttigieg too little, or too much?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the past few months, Buttigieg, the presidential candidate and young mayor of tiny South Bend, Ind., has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/21/20974228/pete-buttigieg-surge-explained-2020\">enjoyed a steady, unlikely rise</url> in early state polls. But with success has come       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/21/20974228/pete-buttigieg-surge-explained-2020\">a backlash</url>, and then a backlash to the backlash.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On paper, Buttigieg ticks a lot of presidential-candidate boxes; you can\u2019t write about Mayor Pete without mentioning he\u2019s a Rhodes scholar, he\u2019s a veteran and he has an articulate, cool-tempered decency reminiscent of Barack Obama. And yet the mayor has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/21/20974228/pete-buttigieg-surge-explained-2020\">drawn the ire of the plugged-in progressive left</url>. There\u2019s something curious about the disdain,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/21/20974228/pete-buttigieg-surge-explained-2020\">notes Derek Thompson in The Atlantic</url>. In a field of many other milquetoast moderates \u2014 including the front-runner Joe Biden \u2014 why has Mayor Pete been singled out for special skewering by young radicals?</p><p>I am not so young, but I am one of those crazy radicals who have been concerned about the intractable domination of our society by a small band of wealthy interests. So I\u2019ll tell you why I don\u2019t like Buttigieg. It\u2019s not because I think he\u2019d be an especially bad president. Like Biden, the mayor seems to possess the baseline capacity to run America in a way that isn\u2019t an embarrassment or a disgrace, which would certainly be a step up from the current administration. He has also articulated <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/21/20974228/pete-buttigieg-surge-explained-2020\">some interesting policy ideas</url>, and he has managed to win a lot of hearts online \u2014 a talent, of a sort, in an election measured in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/21/20974228/pete-buttigieg-surge-explained-2020\">cheesy viral hits</url>.</p><p>Yet every time I hear him speak, I get the sense that he\u2019s trying too hard to please everyone and that \u2014 in a way that recalls some of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/21/20974228/pete-buttigieg-surge-explained-2020\">Obama\u2019s worst tendencies toward misguided centrism</url> \u2014 he\u2019ll end up pleasing no one in the process.

Both are calling for policies that fundamentally overhaul corporate control of the economy. As their detractors note, it\u2019s unlikely that they will be able to achieve many of those goals in our polarized political climate. But what matters to me is that they are making the case. They have articulated both far-reaching, structural policy goals and political strategies that mesh with the spirit of those goals. Not only are they calling for fundamental change that will alter vast sectors of the economy; they are also committed to undoing the influence of corporations and the wealthy in their own path to the White House, underscoring their commitment to their goals.</p><p>I don\u2019t see how Mayor Pete can make a similarly compelling case. I don\u2019t see how he can take on Trump\u2019s economy without at least attempting to fight the C.E.O.s who championed the corporate cash-grab that made it so hot. And I don\u2019t see how he can take on those C.E.O.s while <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/21/20974228/pete-buttigieg-surge-explained-2020\">holding fund-raisers in Napa Valley \u201cwine caves.\u201d</url></p><p>Mayor Pete seems like a lovely man.

On Oct. 21, writer and columnist for The Intercept Kate Aronoff sent out a rather strange looking picture of Facebook CEO and possible lizard-man Mark Zuckerberg and presidential candidate Pete Buttegieg doing their best at mimicking human emotions while driving a car, captioned with the statement, \"when you see a peasant being naughty.\" It's a combination of a singularly strange image and a perfect caption for the moment, and I really can't get it out of my head.</p><p>For reference, this photo is from Zuckerberg's incredibly ill-thought out 2017 attempt to wander around America like Forrest Gump, meeting all the small-town people he usually forgets about while ensconced in the bubble of Silicon Valley. One of those lucky country bumpkins blessed with God-King Mark's presence was a small town college mayor who wanted to show the Facebook boss around, none other than his \"new friend, Pete.\" They were not in fact \"new friends,\" and had known each other while both attended Harvard. Sure, only one of them is played by Jesse Eisenberg in an Oscar-winning David Fincher movie about how awful they are, but presenting the Oxford-educated Buttegieg as a simple country mouse is about as honest as Zuckerberg during a Congressional hearing.</p><p>Anyway, the connection between the two goes beyond their overlap at Harvard, where Buttegieg was one of the first several hundred users of \"thefacebook,\" and a poorly thought out promotional car ride. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan sent a detailed list of hiring recommendations of former Facebook staffers to the Buttegieg campaign, which went on to employ at least two of the people mentioned. This kind of direct corporate involvement in a presidential campaign should be raising all sorts of alarm bells.</p><p>Being open to such a nakedly opportunistic relationship is unsurprising, given that Buttegieg's eye-popping fundraising numbers have come in no small part from a healthy relationship with Silicon Valley. The South Bend mayor's campaign has cultivated careful relationships with tech giants, often appearing in person at $5,000-a-head fundraisers populated by employees from Uber, Google and Apple. He has made it clear to his millionaire donors that he doesn't see tech as an \"us vs them\" issue, and is willing to grant them the same leeway the Obama administration did.</p><p>Clearly, there's room for these two Harvard boys to get along, but why is Zuckerberg so urgently boosting Buttegieg as of late? It's got nothing to do with any fond memories of their time spent in Cambridge cafes together or a shared love for blue silk ties, and has instead everything to do with a certain former economics professor residing in Massachusetts.</p><p>Fellow Democratic candidate and current front-runner Senator Elizabeth Warren has all but declared war upon Facebook, promising to use anti-trust regulations to break Facebook into pieces. If it was up to Warren, Facebook would have to spin off its prize aqquisitions like Instagram and WhatsApp into different companies, comply with new privacy and harmful content regulations, and pay its fair share in taxes.</p><p>According to a leaked audio recording released by the Verge on Oct. 1, Zuckerberg isn't taking the news of Warren's marching orders well, telling employees, \"If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\"</p><p>\"Does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. That's not like the position you want to be in. We care about our country and want to work with our government to do good things,\" he added. \"But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg, clearly spooked by the specter of regulation and Warren's increasingly strong position in the Democratic primary, is looking for an out. Besides wining and dining prominent conservative conspiracy theorists and talking heads like Ben Shapiro and Tucker Carlson, who might just help throw the country into another tailspin and take the heat off of corporate America, it appears that Facebook and its friends in the Valley are desperately looking for a presidential candidate to support.</p><p>Either they fully throw their weight behind Donald Trump, who is hardly a friend to Big Tech to begin with and would likely lead to many tech employees quitting their companies overnight, or they try to find a dark horse in order to prevent Warren from running away with the Democratic nomination. Certainly, Bernie Sanders - possibly the only candidate more antagonistic to Silicon Valley than Warren - is not going to be their pick. So who's left?</p><p>Joe Biden is still not entirely sure what a smartphone is, given that his major educational initiative is trying to get parents to leave record players on at night so kids hear more words, and he lacks any sort of connection with the industry's major players. Longtime tech ally Kamala Harris' poll numbers keep on slumping, and her quixotic campaign to get Twitter and Facebook to delete President Trump's social media accounts has used up a lot of the tech goodwill she earned playing footstool to Silicon Valley as California Attorney General. Amy Klobuchar is the kind of pro-business candidate that would put the kid gloves on for big tech, but Democratic voters seem to like the caustic Minnesota senator as much as her staffers, like a binder to the face.</p><p>As for everyone else, it's likely the rest of the Democratic field won't even make the debate stage, let alone have anywhere of a shot at taking down Warren in the critical Iowa caucus or New Hampshire primary. If you really think that Andrew Yang is going to be the Democratic techno-savior, I have some fine real estate to sell you on Elon Musk's Mars colony.</p><p>Unless the corporate set throws out Michael Bloomberg or the skeleton of Hillary Clinton as a last-ditch \"anyone but Bernie or Warren\" candidate, it appears that Buttegieg is the last viable hope in Facebook's ability to influence electoral politics with their money. For the time being, Buttegieg is doing just fine, but he's hardly breaking through to the top tier of candidates. As Warren continues to gain ground on Biden, it'll be interesting to see how Zuckerberg and his pals react. It appears that those naughty peasants might just make life quite a bit harder for the Facebook CEO and his new best friend.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4307160</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCM-Y1Y1-JBSN-30R3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1089\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Justice: Brandeis University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 29, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

You can <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">sign up here</url> to receive it Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just days before the November Democratic debate, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">Pete Buttigieg</url>, the mayor of South Bend, Ind.,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">surged ahead to first place</url> in the Iowa polls  \u2014 which made it all the more surprising that his fellow candidates didn\u2019t collectively heave him under the same front-runner bus that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">Regina-Georged</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">Elizabeth Warren</url> in October. \u201cFor most of the night,\u201d the Times columnist       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">Jamelle Bouie wrote</url>, \u201che escaped serious scrutiny.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So without further ado, some serious scrutiny.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The debate: What would a Buttigieg nomination mean? To his supporters, Mr. Buttigieg promises deliverance from the baseness of the Trump presidency, while his skeptics believe he\u2019s an immaculately groomed Trojan horse for neoliberalism\u2019s greatest failings.   </p><p>WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING</p><p>A political Goldilocks?</p><p>Mr. Buttigieg isn\u2019t a fan of labels, but, when pressed, has identified as a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">\u201ctonally moderate,\u201d</url> \u201cpragmatic\u201d       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">\u201cprogressive.\u201d</url> In practice, this means his policies tend to run somewhere in between the Democratic Party\u2019s center and left lanes. (Some of his ideas, such as his       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">Supreme Court packing</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">national service plans</url>, don\u2019t fall neatly on the ideological spectrum.)</p><p>To the Times columnist <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">Frank Bruni</url>, he\u2019s \u201ca champion of the sensible\u201d: </p><p>He routinely steers clear of extremes \u2014 on health care, on guns, on environmental issues \u2014 not because he lacks conviction or courage, at least not from where I\u2019m sitting, but because extremes aren\u2019t where the most progress is usually made or where healing is likeliest to happen. </p><p>Of course, what\u2019s sensible depends on your sensibilities: Those who favor a public option for health insurance and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">abolishing the Electoral College</url> may like the mayor; those who favor free public college and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">breaking up big tech</url> may not. </p><p>But Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s skeptics argue that what he himself deems sensible has changed over time: As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">Sarah Jones points out</url> in New York magazine, he seemed to back a single-payer health system as recently as last year, only to oppose Senators Bernie Sanders\u2019s and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Medicare for All plans months later. </p><p>This reversal struck many as part of a larger, calculated campaign pivot from fresh-faced progressive to hard-boiled centrist. Nathan J. Robinson, the editor of Current Affairs magazine, after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">plumbing the depths of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s memoir</url>, called him       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">\u201ca con man\u201d who \u201cbelieves in nothing.\u201d</url></p><p>But for Ms. Jones, Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s triangulations are more banal, evidence less of a fraud than of a McKinsey-bred technocrat who might try on a policy for size and then take it off the moment it looks unflattering in the polls:</p><p>In Buttigieg, voters get a candidate <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">who can define neoliberalism</url> in a sentence, who will even say that he thinks it\u2019s a negative force in the world. But he has never explained what alternative he offers. Generational change, in the mayor\u2019s case, doesn\u2019t mean much. Voters will just get a younger version of a Democratic Party they already know.</p><p>The electability question</p><p>If you\u2019ve heard only one adjective applied to Mr. Buttigieg, it\u2019s \u201csmart.\u201d A Harvard graduate and Rhodes scholar <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">who reportedly speaks eight languages</url>, the mayor displays a facility with rhetoric and seriousness in demeanor that would doubtless take Aaron Sorkin several drafts to achieve. </p><p>His appeal, in aesthetic terms, is antithetical to President Trump\u2019s. And part of his persona\u2019s \u201cmagic,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">according to the Times columnist David Brooks</url>, is its potential to unify rather than further divide a deeply polarized country:</p><p>First, he is young and represents the rising generation, but he is also an older person\u2019s idea of what a young person should be. \u2026\u00a0Second, he is gay and personifies the progress made by the L.G.B.T.Q. movement, but he doesn\u2019t do so in a way that feels threatening or transgressive to social conservatives.  \u2026\u00a0Third, he is a localist and a Washington outsider, but he carries no populist resentment and can easily speak the language of the coastal elite.</p><p>Jennifer Rubin, a columnist for The Washington Post, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">writes</url> that his image as a \u201cverbally adept\u201d moderate will serve him well in the presidential race:</p><p>As he shows command of policy and of the debate stage, he is making the case for his viability in the primary. And he implicitly is demonstrating that his cool, deliberate style would be a huge asset against Trump in the general election.</p><p>Not everyone is so convinced. Jay Caspian Kang, a writer at large for The New York Times Magazine, contends that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">his allure may be smaller than it appears</url> in the fun-house mirror of national political commentary, shaped largely as it is by white, educated, upper-middle-class tastes:</p><p>With his air of decency and grab bag of gifted-and-talented party tricks, he doesn\u2019t so much represent the will of the Democratic electorate but rather the aspirations of its educated elite, maybe especially those who see a shrinking market for their erudition. This form of identity politics has its consequences.</p><p>One such consequence may be his anemic support among black voters, which currently hovers at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">2 percent nationwide</url>. (It\u2019s 0 percent in South Carolina.) Last month, an internal campaign memo surfaced claiming that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">\u201cbeing gay was a barrier</url>\u201d for him with black voters, a narrative that the Times columnist Charles Blow in turn       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">criticized as racist.</url></p><p>In any case, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">Janell Ross reports</url> at NBC News, his struggle to connect with black voters most likely has a lot to do with his positions \u2014 Ms. Ross notes that support for a national health care system is far stronger among blacks than whites, for example \u2014 and with his r\u00e9sum\u00e9: Mr. Buttigieg has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">sparked outrage</url> for how he handled the fatal police shooting of Eric Logan, a black man, in South Bend; for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">firing the city\u2019s popular black police chief</url>; and, just this month, for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">falsely claiming</url> that prominent black South Carolinians had endorsed his anti-racism plan, which his website promoted with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">a stock photo of a Kenyan woman</url>. </p><p>In The Nation, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">Dan Simon summed up</url> the bifurcated quality of his candidacy:</p><p>For all his overdetermined virtuosity \u2014 an accomplished pianist! a Rhodes scholar! a polyglot! \u2014 he has demonstrated no political artistry: He did nothing to address the South Bend police department\u2019s longstanding and deep-seated troubles, and ultimately did nothing to prevent the death of Eric Logan.</p><p>Experience</p><p>Mr. Buttigieg would be the youngest president to take office, at 39, by several years. He has so far tried to parlay this potential weakness into a strength, casting himself in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">precociously hopeful mold of Barack Obama</url>. In The Week,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">Noah Millman argues</url> that the mayor\u2019s inexperience may be one of his greatest assets:</p><p>Since the end of the Cold War, the less-experienced candidate has won every time. First-term Sen. Barack Obama trounced veteran Sen. John McCain, and political neophyte Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton, touted as the best-prepared candidate ever to run. \u2026 Moreover, the only challenger to unseat an incumbent president was also the least experienced. </p><p>But whereas Mr. Obama served as a senator before running for president, Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s highest political victory consists of winning just over 8,500 votes in a 100,000-person town that, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">Juli\u00e1n Castro put it</url>, could almost fit inside San Antonio\u2019s Alamodome. Mr. Bruni writes:</p><p>Ugh, that age. My wish for a young candidate didn\u2019t mean a 37-year-old one. There\u2019s much wisdom in this life that\u2019s accrued only with the passage of years, and he\u2019d be better off \u2014 and significantly less vulnerable in a general election \u2014 if he had even five more of them.</p><p>Do you have a point of view we missed?

The social network's founders were friends of friends, and it felt like an insular message board for Harvard classmates, he remembered in an interview in San Francisco last week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I dont think any of us could have guessed what implications that technology would have in the long run,\" Buttigieg said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fifteen years and 2.4 billion users later, as Facebook wrestles with cascading scandals over data privacy, misinformation and election meddling on its platform, Buttigieg has become one of several presidential contenders calling for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/07/big-tech-democratic-presidential-race-2020-silicon-valley/\">tougher regulation</url> of the company and Silicon Valley's other biggest tech firms.</p><p>The debate over Facebook's future took on new resonance last week as one of the company's co-founders, Chris Hughes, published <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html\">a New York Times op-ed</url> calling for the tech giant to be broken up. Buttigieg said Hughes, his former Harvard classmate, \"made a very convincing case\" that no company \"should have the type of power that these tech companies have.\"</p><p>But unlike Sen. Elizabeth Warren, he hasnt endorsed breaking up the tech giants, instead suggesting \"a spectrum\" of regulation that could include fines, blocking new mergers or splitting up companies. That's attracted criticism from some on the left who want the candidates to take a strong stance on issues of corporate power.</p><p>Buttigieg's vaguer position comes as the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has courted support from Silicon Valley, attending a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/7/18527646/pete-buttigieg-silicon-valley-donors-mark-zuckerberg\">packed schedule of fundraisers</url> around the Valley and San Francisco on Friday.</p><p>In the first three months of 2019, Buttigieg received at least $27,250 in donations from employees of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/19/elizabeth-warren-president-tech-campaign-donations-berine-sanders-kamala-harris/\">fifth-highest</url> total among the Democrats running for president. Hughes also gave him $2,700 (while donating to several other 2020 Democrats as well). Meanwhile, his campaign has spent about $181,000 on Facebook ads, less than a fifth of the amount spent by Sens. Kamala Harris or Warren.</p><p>Here in the Bay Area, we've been waiting for a new generation that is going to redefine politics, and I think Pete's going to do it, said Adam Hundt, a tech worker who met Buttigieg in college and co-hosted one of his fundraisers. Tech is all about change, and the way Pete has an open mind and embraces change makes him a natural fit.</p><p>Buttigieg was two years ahead of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at the Ivy League school, and was a senior when Zuckerberg, Hughes and their co-founders launched the site from a dorm room. Buttigieg's account is the 287th on the network (although a few of those before him were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.quora.com/The-first-user-id-on-Facebook-is-4-Mark-Zuckerberg-Who-were-1%E2%80%933\">created as tests</url>)  if you go to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.facebook.com/287\">facebook.com/287</url> while signed into Facebook, the Harvard grad's original page, which he still updates, will pop up.</p><p>At the time, following his friends on Facebook felt like \"a curiosity,\" and an improvement over services like MySpace, Friendster or AIM, Buttigieg said. In recent years, he's used his page to share photos from his deployment to Afghanistan in the Navy Reserve and post pictures and videos of life in South Bend. (He has separate pages for his presidential campaign and mayor's office.)</p><p>When Zuckerberg embarked on a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/technology/zuckerberg-harvard-commencement-road-trip.html\">cross-country trip</url> to see more of the U.S. in 2017  attracting rumors about his own presidential ambitions  he       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/facebook-s-mark-zuckerberg-makes-surprise-stop-in-south-bend/article_ea311442-2d13-11e7-8861-6f7089c08381.html\">stopped by South Bend</url> to meet with Buttigieg, connected by a mutual Harvard friend. The mayor drove the tech mogul on a tour of the city, as Zuckerberg streamed live video from his cell phone on the dashboard of Buttigieg's car.</p><p>Zuckerberg and Buttigieg stayed in touch, and they last spoke earlier this year, his campaign said.</p><p>As Buttigieg explained to Zuckerberg on the tour, hes also worked to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/pete-buttigieg-revived-south-bend-with-tech-up-next-america/\">attract tech investment</url> to his Rust Belt hometown, helping open a data center on the site of an abandoned Studebaker plant and transforming other old factories into glassy work spaces for startups.</p><p>\"What they've done to revitalize the city is pretty remarkable,\" marveled Matt Rogers, the co-founder of the smart home company Nest and an investor who's been to the city multiple times at the mayor's invitation. \"You go out to dinner in South Bend and the streets are full of millennials, and there are great restaurants that feel like you're in San Francisco.\"</p><p>Rogers, whos hosted fundraisers for Buttigieg, said he found the candidate to be \"literate, fluent and deeply knowledgeable\" about tech issues.</p><p>Buttigieg has suggested that that tech know-how is missing in D.C. He criticized the congressional hearings featuring Zuckerberg and other tech executives last year, which he called \"political theater where very little actually got achieved.\"</p><p>\"What we saw was a spectacle of people in charge of regulating a very powerful force demonstrating that they had no concept of what it was they were in charge of overseeing  which is incredibly dangerous,\" Buttigieg said, arguing that political leaders \"need some kind of literacy in these technologies, what they mean and more importantly what they can do, in order to regulate properly.</p><p>\"This is not necessarily an age thing, although I think it helps to have grown up with these technologies at your fingertips, he added.</p><p>Meanwhile, Buttigieg has toed the line between criticizing tech companies and voicing a more sympathetic perspective.</p><p>He said Friday that \"a lot of people here in the tech sector still have a David mentality when they've increasingly turned into Goliath.\" But he added that he believes tech companies are making policy decisions \"perhaps, not necessarily with bad intentions,\" and said he was struck by how many of Silicon Valley's executives have \"become very introspective\" and are \"really reflecting on what they wrought.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/05/09/break-up-facebook-co-founder-calls-for-feds-to-split-company-apart/\">        Break up Facebook: co-founder calls for feds to split company apart     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/05/13/u-s-presidential-contender-kamala-harris-favors-look-at-breaking-up-facebook-2/\">        Kamala Harris favors look at breaking up Facebook     </url></p><p>That more diplomatic approach  and Buttigieg's avoidance so far of calling for breaking up companies like Facebook  \"has been a personal sigh of relief for a lot of people in the tech industry,\" said Jacob Helberg, a tech policy advisor who's hosted fundraisers for the candidate.</p><p>While most of the other top Democrats are also playing coy on the issue, Buttigiegs refusal to be pinned down has frustrated tech critics who see it as a defining debate in the party.</p><p>\"He is going for Silicon Valley money and he wants to express some nod to the problems but he doesn't want to offend anyone powerful,\" said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute and an advocate\u00a0of splitting up the tech giants. \"Take a position.\"</p><p>WHAT OTHER DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES SAY ABOUT BREAKING UP BIG TECH COMPANIES</p><p>Support it:</p><p>Sen. <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">Elizabeth Warren</url>: Today's big tech companies have too much power?-?too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.

The social network's founders were friends of friends, and it felt like an insular message board for Harvard classmates, he remembered in an interview in San Francisco last week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I dont think any of us could have guessed what implications that technology would have in the long run,\" Buttigieg said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fifteen years and 2.4 billion users later, as Facebook wrestles with cascading scandals over data privacy, misinformation and election meddling on its platform, Buttigieg has become one of several presidential contenders calling for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/07/big-tech-democratic-presidential-race-2020-silicon-valley/\">tougher regulation</url> of the company and Silicon Valley's other biggest tech firms.</p><p>The debate over Facebook's future took on new resonance last week as one of the company's co-founders, Chris Hughes, published <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html\">a New York Times op-ed</url> calling for the tech giant to be broken up. Buttigieg said Hughes, his former Harvard classmate, \"made a very convincing case\" that no company \"should have the type of power that these tech companies have.\"</p><p>But unlike Sen. Elizabeth Warren, he hasnt endorsed breaking up the tech giants, instead suggesting \"a spectrum\" of regulation that could include fines, blocking new mergers or splitting up companies. That's attracted criticism from some on the left who want the candidates to take a strong stance on issues of corporate power.</p><p>Buttigieg's vaguer position comes as the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has courted support from Silicon Valley, attending a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/7/18527646/pete-buttigieg-silicon-valley-donors-mark-zuckerberg\">packed schedule of fundraisers</url> around the Valley and San Francisco on Friday.</p><p>In the first three months of 2019, Buttigieg received at least $27,250 in donations from employees of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/19/elizabeth-warren-president-tech-campaign-donations-berine-sanders-kamala-harris/\">fifth-highest</url> total among the Democrats running for president. Hughes also gave him $2,700 (while donating to several other 2020 Democrats as well). Meanwhile, his campaign has spent about $181,000 on Facebook ads, less than a fifth of the amount spent by Sens. Kamala Harris or Warren.</p><p>Here in the Bay Area, we've been waiting for a new generation that is going to redefine politics, and I think Pete's going to do it, said Adam Hundt, a tech worker who met Buttigieg in college and co-hosted one of his fundraisers. Tech is all about change, and the way Pete has an open mind and embraces change makes him a natural fit.</p><p>Buttigieg was two years ahead of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at the Ivy League school, and was a senior when Zuckerberg, Hughes and their co-founders launched the site from a dorm room. Buttigieg's account is the 287th on the network (although a few of those before him were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.quora.com/The-first-user-id-on-Facebook-is-4-Mark-Zuckerberg-Who-were-1%E2%80%933\">created as tests</url>)  if you go to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.facebook.com/287\">facebook.com/287</url> while signed into Facebook, the Harvard grad's original page, which he still updates, will pop up.</p><p>At the time, following his friends on Facebook felt like \"a curiosity,\" and an improvement over services like MySpace, Friendster or AIM, Buttigieg said. In recent years, he's used his page to share photos from his deployment to Afghanistan in the Navy Reserve and post pictures and videos of life in South Bend. (He has separate pages for his presidential campaign and mayor's office.)</p><p>When Zuckerberg embarked on a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/technology/zuckerberg-harvard-commencement-road-trip.html\">cross-country trip</url> to see more of the U.S. in 2017  attracting rumors about his own presidential ambitions  he       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/facebook-s-mark-zuckerberg-makes-surprise-stop-in-south-bend/article_ea311442-2d13-11e7-8861-6f7089c08381.html\">stopped by South Bend</url> to meet with Buttigieg, connected by a mutual Harvard friend. The mayor drove the tech mogul on a tour of the city, as Zuckerberg streamed live video from his cell phone on the dashboard of Buttigieg's car.</p><p>Zuckerberg and Buttigieg stayed in touch, and they last spoke earlier this year, his campaign said.</p><p>As Buttigieg explained to Zuckerberg on the tour, hes also worked to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/pete-buttigieg-revived-south-bend-with-tech-up-next-america/\">attract tech investment</url> to his Rust Belt hometown, helping open a data center on the site of an abandoned Studebaker plant and transforming other old factories into glassy work spaces for startups.</p><p>\"What they've done to revitalize the city is pretty remarkable,\" marveled Matt Rogers, the co-founder of the smart home company Nest and an investor who's been to the city multiple times at the mayor's invitation. \"You go out to dinner in South Bend and the streets are full of millennials, and there are great restaurants that feel like you're in San Francisco.\"</p><p>Rogers, whos hosted fundraisers for Buttigieg, said he found the candidate to be \"literate, fluent and deeply knowledgeable\" about tech issues.</p><p>Buttigieg has suggested that that tech know-how is missing in D.C. He criticized the congressional hearings featuring Zuckerberg and other tech executives last year, which he called \"political theater where very little actually got achieved.\"</p><p>\"What we saw was a spectacle of people in charge of regulating a very powerful force demonstrating that they had no concept of what it was they were in charge of overseeing  which is incredibly dangerous,\" Buttigieg said, arguing that political leaders \"need some kind of literacy in these technologies, what they mean and more importantly what they can do, in order to regulate properly.</p><p>\"This is not necessarily an age thing, although I think it helps to have grown up with these technologies at your fingertips, he added.</p><p>Meanwhile, Buttigieg has toed the line between criticizing tech companies and voicing a more sympathetic perspective.</p><p>He said Friday that \"a lot of people here in the tech sector still have a David mentality when they've increasingly turned into Goliath.\" But he added that he believes tech companies are making policy decisions \"perhaps, not necessarily with bad intentions,\" and said he was struck by how many of Silicon Valley's executives have \"become very introspective\" and are \"really reflecting on what they wrought.\"</p><p>That more diplomatic approach  and Buttigieg's avoidance so far of calling for breaking up companies like Facebook  \"has been a personal sigh of relief for a lot of people in the tech industry,\" said Jacob Helberg, a tech policy advisor who's hosted fundraisers for the candidate.</p><p>While most of the other top Democrats are also playing coy on the issue, Buttigiegs refusal to be pinned down has frustrated tech critics who see it as a defining debate in the party.</p><p>\"He is going for Silicon Valley money and he wants to express some nod to the problems but he doesn't want to offend anyone powerful,\" said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute and an advocate\u00a0of splitting up the tech giants. \"Take a position.\"</p><p>WHAT OTHER DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES SAY ABOUT BREAKING UP BIG TECH COMPANIES</p><p>Support it:</p><p>Sen. <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">Elizabeth Warren</url>: Today's big tech companies have too much power?-?too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.

The New Deal fundamentally shifted power from the states, businesses and private citizens to a sprawling federal bureaucracy. Much of the mainstream media characterizes the contest for the Democratic nomination as a choice between moderate Joe Biden who would tweak free markets and socialists like Bernie Sanders[1] who would rip out capitalism and burn its roots with government takeovers of whole industries [2]and breaking up big tech. That is tougher for me to swallow than the notion that Donald Trump is an illegitimate president. </p><p>Breaking news: Follow the latest developments on the 2020 election.[3]  In a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed[4], Obama White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel argues the problem with Sanders is not his goals but how quickly he wants to accomplish them. Apparently, reformists can succeed in destroying free markets and our constitutional rights if they don't nominate someone so transparently radical that he frightens moderate voters. Instead, gradually hypnotize the electorate with false promises and seize opportunities during crises, and incrementally compel it to embrace socialism rechristened as progressivism. The Affordable Care Act was supposed to make health care less expensive. In fact, it excessively subsidies providers and creates a byzantine regulatory framework that reduced what beneficial competition was left in that sector. The monopolization of markets[5] for hospital services, prescription drugs and physicians and government largess are rapidly making the system too unaffordable to sustain. Now House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants absolute price controls,[6] but Sanders wants to nationalize in health insurers and give us doctors' offices as moribund and swift as the Post Service. With the Green New Deal, Democrats would shut down oil companies and nationalize electric utilities[7] and state-manage the entire automobile and transportation sectors. To get any traction in the Democratic Party these days, politicians must adhere to several basic tenets. [8] \u2022 Capitalism and free markets \u2014 not failed government regulation and poorly-targeted spending \u2014 are responsible for all slow growth and inequality.  \u2022 America was founded and remains controlled by a cynical monopoly of exploitative white males.  \u2022 The climate change crisis is a convenient vehicle to accomplish the revolution. Unfortunately, centrists of neither party\u2014 nor their counterparts in Europe\u2014have governed well. Despite breathtaking technological change, economic growth has been halting and families feel stressed as the cost of health care, university education and resulting student debt service and housing have risen much more rapidly than incomes[9]. That's what made Sanders's and Warren's serious candidacies possible. Fortunately, most Americans don't like socialism.[10] However, they could be persuaded by a Democratic candidate that a little bit more government\u2014like another shot of heroin\u2014will solve kitchen table budget problems when President Barack Obama proved that it doesn't. It's an article of faith among Democrats that the wealthy should pay [11]for all their schemes. They have plans to dramatically raise taxes to finance more government intervention in free health care, universal basic incomes and free college\u2014but as conditions in Europe prove, it's the middle class that will pay.[12] It was narcissistic for billionaire Michael Bloomberg [13]to think he could ride the Donkey Party Express to the Oval Office\u2014or maybe just cynical because he had enough money to monopolize the airways and pay enough Twitter trolls. [14] Donald Trump's oratory gaffs, and inflammatory rhetoric aimed at his blue-collar base, too often distracts more moderate voters, women and minorities from an essential reality\u2014Trump's right-of-center economic policies are making things better than during the Obama years.The post Peter Morici: 2020 election is about freedom, not equality[15] appeared first on Financial Press - Breaking Stock Market News[16].

There's no doubt the company needs them, but as the old adage goes, with friends like these, who needs enemies?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One such ally, Macquarie Research Equities, may actually be hurting Telecom's cause. The stock brokerage last week issued an embarrassing report titled \"Lies and damn lies\" that took shots at the media, labelling coverage of Telecom as \"factually incorrect\", \"misleading\" and \"biased\".</p><p>The brokerage hadn't taken Telecom's negative press seriously before, but now - with the Prime Minister sounding off on the country's poor broadband situation - \"the risks have risen\".</p><p>\"The media attack on Telecom seems to be having the political impact desired by Telecom's competitors,\" the report says.</p><p>It's not the trite line taken by Macquarie that's embarrassing for the brokerage, it's the report's suggestion that all is well in New Zealand broadband. And even more worrying, for investors at least, is the suggestion that all is well with Telecom's stock.</p><p>Neither of these claims has the slightest grounding in reality.</p><p>New Zealand's broadband woes are well documented. We're 22nd out of 30 in OECD uptake, and that's that. Slow speeds, high prices, data limits and access problems have all contributed to Kiwis' low interest in broadband.</p><p>But those problems are just window dressing. The real point is that New Zealand will continue to wallow as long as one company is allowed to control speeds and pricing, and thus the entire market.</p><p>That's not just the sentiment of Telecom's rivals such as TelstraClear or ihug, it's what everyone - from the big tech firms to economists to small businesses to home users - is saying.</p><p>But according to Macquarie, \"apart from a couple of issues (upload speeds and business DSL pricing), NZ in fact compares well to both its closest neighbour Australia and to other similar countries\".</p><p>The average Kiwi consumer, Macquarie says, \"is better off than their Australian counterpart, despite popular claims to the contrary\".</p><p>The comparison with Australia is absurd. It was only a year ago that Australia ranked just as poorly as New Zealand in the OECD uptake statistics, at 21st place.</p><p>The country is in the midst of unbundling incumbent Telstra's network to allow rivals access, and with stronger wholesale regulations than we enjoy, it has since managed to improve its situation somewhat, moving to 17th place.</p><p>But make no mistake - Australia is still as big a loser in the global broadband stakes as New Zealand. And with Telstra playing wholesale hardball as of late, it wouldn't be at all surprising to see the country take a step backward in uptake rankings over the next little while.</p><p>Macquarie's report doesn't make any comparisons with other countries, basically because it can't.</p><p>New Zealand's speeds and prices are laughable when matched to any of the top 10 countries, so comparing ourselves with Australia is not exactly aiming high.</p><p>This is especially true if you compare stock performance. While Telecom's stock has dropped 15 per cent over the past year, Telstra has plummeted 23 per cent, making it one of the worst-performing telco stocks in the world. Given that Telstra is so ingrained in Australia's broadband situation, is this really a company whose lead we want to be following?</p><p>But the brokerage is somehow confident the New Zealand Government will come to its senses, see there really isn't anything wrong with broadband here, and leave regulation alone. Macquarie is thus still bullish on Telecom's stock, with a 12-month price target of $6.40.</p><p>However, with the company's stock trading in the $5.50 range, that's an overly optimistic forecast, especially when non-regulatory issues are taken into account - something the report conveniently omits entirely.</p><p>Incumbent telco stocks are dropping worldwide - Deutsche Telekom is down 16 per cent over the past year, France Telecom 20 per cent, Spain's Telefonica 15 per cent and Bell Canada 7 per cent. Those are just a few examples.</p><p>That's primarily because their traditional revenues are on the decline thanks to lower-cost internet-based calling - a fact Telecom itself has acknowledged. The big telcos are still trying to figure out how to transform their businesses in the face of new and disruptive technologies, and most are struggling to do so.</p><p>Interestingly, the exceptions to the rule seem to be the ones taking proactive measures. British Telecom, which voluntarily agreed to separate its wholesale and retail arms, has seen its stock resist the trend and remain flat over the past year. US telcos have generally seen their stocks improve, largely due to recent merger activity.</p><p>Add this global trend to a possible downturn in the New Zealand economy and a worsening dollar, and it's very hard to be bullish on Telecom's stock.</p><p>The Government's decision on regulation will ultimately come down to Telecom's stock concerns versus the public good. Given the realities, for Macquarie to accuse the media of being misleading seems pretty foolish. The brokerage should be very careful of who it's accusing of lies and damn lies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-10369312</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2006</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4J9N-SBX0-TX4V-S1YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"856\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2006 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2006\"><dateText>February 21, 2006 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000549</classCode><className>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N523120MC</classCode><className>SECURITIES BROKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp; ECONOMIC INDICATORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000214</classCode><className>BROADBAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001693</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001912</classCode><className>RETAIL &amp; WHOLESALE TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N517000CC</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N510000CC</classCode><className>MEDIA &amp; TELECOMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N523120MC</classCode><className>SECURITIES BROKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Thank you for joining us again today at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. I'm Adam Posen, the institute's president. I'm always proud to host events here with distinguished friends and officials. And sometimes people are both friends and officials. </p><p>But I am particularly proud to be hosting today--co-hosting actually--with the Bendheim Center for Finance at Princeton and my friend, and colleague, Markus Brunnermeier. </p><p>We are at the cutting edge, I guess, by having some of the world's leading central bankers and leading monetary thinkers come to speak about money, the future of money, in the digital age.  And of course, we're also joined by a rockstar in the form of Martin Wolf. </p><p>We are delighted to be doing this particularly, obviously, this week when so many senior officials and people and markets are in town, and we're grateful to our friends who joined us today. In particular, I want to thank Frank Brosens who, of Taconic Finance, who is a member of our Board of Directors, and a member of--I want to make sure I get the title right--The Advisory Panel, I believe it is--of The Bendheim--Advisory Counsel of The Bendheim Center for Finance--one of the most brilliant, real minds in finance. </p><p>I'm grateful to Frank, not because he just has such excellent taste in institutions, but because he gave the nudge to Markus and I to actually come together. And so, in many ways we always talked, but we hadn't come to anything. So, we're grateful to Frank which gave fruition to this. </p><p>We are starting on a more timely schedule than usual partly because it's this week, and partly because we are grateful and proud to, once again, welcome back Lael Brainard, a member of the Board of Governors of The Federal Reserve System, to the stage, here, at the Peterson Institute. </p><p>This is the point, with this crowd on this topic, where Governor Brainard needs no introduction.  She has been a member of the Board of Governors with The Fed in--since June of 2014. She previously served as undersecretary at The U.S. Department of Treasury from 2010 to 2013, and Counselor to the Secretary of the Treasury in 2009. </p><p>In short, she has been the leading U.S. official on matters of international finance, from both the Treasury and the Federal Reserve side of the street for many years now--showed extraordinary leadership in--during the crisis, during issues of G7 and G20 management. </p><p>I always cite her--her incredible work in getting the currency piece, which we have enjoyed since late 2012, which I think her leadership played an enormous role in. And obviously, in recent years, as part of her work and public service with The Federal Reserve Board, has been a leading light on innovation and regulation and the growth effects of finance. </p><p>And we are very honored to have her with us today. I will invite her to speak in just a moment.  Just to say again that this is a jam-packed, full, substantive event. We not only have Governor Brainard and then we'll be taking questions from Markus and I, and then from the floor to her, as her schedule allows. </p><p>Then we'll be turning to a new paper presented by Professor Brunnermeier, co-authored with Harold James of Princeton, who I am glad to see is with us today, and Jean-Pierre Landau of Science Po, on how digitalization will transform the role of money. </p><p>We also have--we have available, for everyone on the website, and in print, this new paper, The Digitalization of Money by Brunnermeier, James, Landau.  We also have a number of short pieces written by the usual thousand flowers of thought at the Peterson Institute that I encourage you also to read. </p><p>Finally, we will have a superstar panel moderated by Martin Wolf, the Chief Economics Commentator and Editor of The Financial Times, with Governor Stefan Ingves of the RiksBank, which is on the cutting edge of these technologies, Simon Potter of the Peterson Institute now, formerly of the New York Federal Reserve, who we're delighted to have with us, and probably the most brilliant mind in finance I know, even allowing for Markus, Hyung Song Shin, from the Bank for International Settlements. </p><p>So, this is a spectacular group. Thank you all for joining us. And may I invite Governor Brainard to the stage. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>BRAINARD: Wow!  Thank you to Adam for a very kind introduction. And it's always a pleasure to be here at Peterson. </p><p>There's a long history of technological advances challenging the prevailing notions of money, from the trading of coins to the use of paper currency to the electronic debiting and crediting of funds on the accounts of banks. </p><p>Today, efforts by Stablecoin networks, such as Facebook's Libra, to establish the next chapter in the story of money are raising threshold questions about legal and regulatory safeguards, financial stability, and monetary policy. </p><p>Because of its potential global reach, Facebook's Libra imparts urgency to the debate over what form money can take, who or what can issue it, and how payments can be recorded and settled. </p><p>A decade ago, Bitcoin was heralded as a new kind of digital currency that would provide the three functions of money without the need for centralized governance. Bitcoin's emergence created an entirely new payment instrument, and asset class, exchanged over a set of payment rails supported by distributed ledger technology, a shared tamper-resistant ledger that can be updated by anyone with sufficient compute power. </p><p>But Bitcoin did not achieve widespread acceptance as a means of payment, or unit of account, due to its extreme volatility, as well as limited throughput, unpredictable transactions costs limited-to-no governance and limited transparency. </p><p>Stablecoins were designed specifically to overcome the volatility of the first-generation cryptocurrencies that limited their utility in payments and as a unit of account. As their name is intended to convey, Stablecoin's aim to maintain stable value by tying the digital currency to an asset, or a basket of assets, such as commercial bank deposits or government issued bonds. </p><p>Unlike first generation cryptocurrencies, they may be issued by a central entity and rely on third party institutions for some aspects. Just as any currency's value, as a medium of exchange, increases with the size of the network using it. So, too, the power of the Stablecoin payment system depends on its ability to achieve widespreaded option. </p><p>In light of the 2.7 billion active, monthly users on Facebook's platforms, the Libra Stablecoin Project stands out for the speed with which its network could reach global scale in payments. </p><p>To provide context for assessing Stablecoins, it's useful to understand established arrangements for the Issuance Regulation and transfer of money. </p><p>Central bank money and commercial bank money are the foundations of the modern financial system. Central bank money, physical cash, and money held in deposits at a central bank, represents a safe settlement asset, allowing users to exchange central bank liabilities with confidence in their acceptance and reliability. In addition, central banks play a critical role, as providers of liquidity, at times of stress by lending central bank money. </p><p>Money held in deposits at commercial banks is widely used because people are confident that they can convert it on demand for the liability of another commercial bank, or the central bank, such as physical cash. This is because bank deposits are insured. And commercial banks are subject to supervision, regulation, and deposit insurance requirements. </p><p>Non-bank private money, or assets, can also facilitate transactions among a network of users. In some cases, such as airline miles, such assets may have value only within that network. In other cases, the issuer may guarantee convertibility to a sovereign currency, such that it becomes a liability of the issuer. </p><p>In those cases, customers trust that the company issuing such money will be able to honor those liabilities. Many U.S. consumers experience non-bank private money already in the form of gift cards, loyalty points, and virtual gaming currencies. For instance, Starbucks report it had 1.6 billion in stored-value card liabilities towards the end of last year, which is more than the deposits of many banks. </p><p>As the scale and scope of such private networks grow, so too, do the convenience, and benefit of transacting within the network. These network benefits may be augmented by the active use of network data for a host of purposes from allocating and pricing credit, to sharing reviews to prioritizing information that is pushed to users. </p><p>In China, consumers and businesses participate in two mobile networks, Alipay and WeChat Pay, which by some accounts handled more than 37 trillion in mobile payments last year. These networks operate within China, based on the RMB, as the unit of account and balances are transferable in and out of bank, or credit card accounts. </p><p>Stablecoins may represent private, non-bank liabilities, depending on their design and claim structure. They aspire to achieve the functions of traditional money, without relying on confidence in an issuer, such as a central bank, to stand behind the money. </p><p>Indeed, for some potential Stablecoins, a close assessment suggests users may have no rights with respect to the underlying assets, or the system overall. </p><p>We've already seen the growth of massive payments networks on existing digital platforms, such as Ali--Alibaba and WeChat, and the issuance of Stablecoins on a smaller scale, such as Tether, Gemini, and Pacsis. </p><p>What sets Facebook's Libra apart is the combination of an active user network representing more than a third of the global population with the issuance of a private, digital currency opaquely tied to a basket of sovereign currencies. </p><p>It should be no surprise that Facebook's Libra is attracting a high level of scrutiny from law makers and authorities. Libra, like any global, Stablecoin project, must address a core set of legal and regulatory challenges, before it can facilitate a first payment. </p><p>Let me touch on a few of these. First, compliance with know your customer regulations are essential, if Stablecoins are not to be used for illegal activities and illicit finance. </p><p>Libra's business model is inherently cross-border, and as such, each participant in the system that is a financial institution would need to ensure compliance with each jurisdiction's anti-money laundering laws. Libra's intended global reach would likely necessitate a global--a consistent global anti-money laundering framework, in order to reduce the risk of illicit transactions. </p><p>Second, issuers of Stablecoin's design to facilitate consumer payments must clearly demonstrate how consumers would be protected. Consumers will need to be educated on how their rights differ with respect to digital wallets, compared with bank accounts. </p><p>Statutory and regulatory protections on bank accounts mean that consumers can reasonably expect their deposits to be insured up to a limit, fraudulent transactions to be the liability of the bank, transfers to be available within specified periods, and clear standardized disclosures about account fees and interest payments. </p><p>Not only is it not clear whether comparable protections would be in place in a Stablecoin network, such as Libra, or what recourse consumers would have, but it isn't even clear how much price risk consumers will face since they don't appear to have rights to the underlying assets. </p><p>The large number of cyber breaches in the last few years highlight the importance of getting clarity on what legal entity can be held responsible for the security of personally identifiable information and transactions data, and how personal data will be stored, accessed, and used. </p><p>Third, it'll be necessary to define the financial activities the various players in the ecosystem are conducting, in order for jurisdictions to assess whether existing regulatory and enforcement mechanisms, are adequate. </p><p>Switzerland is the legal domicile of the Labor Associations.  And in Switzerland, there are three new categories to facilitate their approach of regulating by function. </p><p>Payment tokens are cryptocurrencies that are meant for use in payments or value transfers, utility tokens are block-chain based applications, and asset tokens are cryptocurr--crypto assets that are analogous to equities, bonds and derivatives. </p><p>Here in the U.S., regulators are closely examining particular Stablecoins and cryptocurrencies to determine whether, and where, they fit in the regulatory structure, and whether additional authorities, or guidance, is necessary. Our market regulators have authorities for products judged to be securities, or commodity futures, under relevant law. </p><p>At the state level, the New York State Department of Financial Services has established a Bit License for virtual currencies. </p><p>The Federal Reserve, and the other federal banking agencies, have supervisory authority over banks, but the Federal Reserve does not have plenary authority over payment systems operating in the U.S. </p><p>The FSOC does have the authority to designate systemically important non-bank financial companies, financial market utilities, or payment-clearing and settlement activities, based on the facts on the specific situation. </p><p>It isn't clear at this time, whether any cryptocurrency issuer, would meet the statutory requirements for FSOC designation. </p><p>Fourth, the distributed ledger technology underlying many Stablecoins, and cryptocurrencies more generally, have advantages, but they also have risks. While they could offer advantages by enhancing operational resilience, increasing transparency, and simplifying recordkeeping, the public and immutable nature of the transactions ledger, also introduces risks, such as data privacy concerns, and legal complexity. </p><p>Fifth, widespread mitigation to one or more global Stablecoin networks could disintermediate banks, if consumers and businesses reduce their deposits at commercial banks in favor of Stablecoins held in digital wallets. This could shrink bank sources of stable funding, as well as their visibility into transactions data, and thereby hinder their ability to provide credit to businesses and households. </p><p>That said, many banks are likely to adapt by offering alternative methods of pure to pure settlement, and by incorporating Stablecoins into their business models, whether by partnering with Fintech firms who are issuing Stablecoins, or by issuing their own, as some are already doing. </p><p>Sixth, widespread adoption of Stablecoins could have implications for the role of central banks and for monetary policy. Large-scale migration into a new Stablecoin network for purposes of payments may prove to be the leading edge of a broader migration that encompasses the other functions of money. </p><p>If a large share of domestic households and businesses migrate to a global Stablecoin, not only as a means of payment, but also as a store of value, this could shrink demand for physical cash and affect the size of the central bank's balance sheet, and the central bank's approach to implementing monetary policy. </p><p>These effects are likely to be more significant for small, open economies, or those with weak monetary institutions, or the migration away from the sovereign currency to a global Stablecoin could weaken the scope for independent monetary policy through a process that's the digital analog of dollarization. </p><p>Large-scale Stablecoin use could also affect larger, advanced economies with extensive connections to the global financial system, by increasing market volatility and transmitting shocks across borders. </p><p>And finally, a Stablecoin network with global reach raises financial stability considerations. If not managed effectively, liquidity, credit, market, or operational risks, alone or in combination, could trigger a loss of confidence and run behavior. </p><p>This could be exacerbated by a lack of clarity about the management of reserves and the rights and responsibilities of various market participants in the network. The risks and spillovers could be amplified by potential ambiguity surrounding the ability of official authorities to provide oversight, backstop liquidity, and collaborate across borders. </p><p>Even before the advent of Stablecoin to some jurisdictions, a pronounced migration from cash to digital payments had already prompted central banks to explore the merits and risks of moving to digital issuance of their own currencies. </p><p>The potential for global Stablecoin systems has intensified the interest in central bank, digital currencies. Proponents argue that central bank, digital currencies would be a safer alternative to privately issued Stablecoins because they'd be a direct liability of the central bank. </p><p>And you're going to hear later today, from Markus Brunnermeier, about his paper, which provides important arguments in this arena. </p><p>Of course, the Federal Reserve, and other central banks, already provide money digitally in the form of central bank deposits in traditional reserve, or settlement accounts. However, in the current context, central bank digital currency, typically, refers to a new type of central bank liability that could be held directly by households and businesses, without the involvement of a commercial bank intermediary. </p><p>Such central bank digital currencies could differ from traditional reserves along three dimensions. A much broader set of institutions and individuals could access it, some types of balances might not pay interest, and it might entail greater government visibility into end users, or consumer's transactions. </p><p>In the United States, there are compelling advantages to the system that we have today. First, physical cash in circulation for the U.S. dollar continues to rise, suggesting there is robust demand. </p><p>Second, the dollar is an important reserve currency globally, and maintaining public trust in our currency is paramount. </p><p>Third, we have a robust and diverse banking system that meets the needs of consumers. </p><p>And finally, we have a widely available and expanding variety of digital payment options that build on the existing institutional framework, and the applicable safeguards. </p><p>Central bank digital currency for general purpose use, that is for individual consumer use, would raise profound legal policy and operational questions. Let's consider the balance between privacy and guarding against illicit activity. </p><p>If it's designed to provide safeguards against illicit activity, a central bank digital currency for consumer use could conceivably require the central bank to keep a running record of all payments data using the digital currency, a stark difference from cash. </p><p>A system in which individual payments information would be recorded by a government entity would mark a dramatic shift. A related question is whether the Federal Reserve even has the authority to issue currency in digital form, and if necessary, to establish digital wallets for the public. </p><p>There could also be profound monetary implications. Some economists have argued, probably in this room, that a central bank-- digital currency could address the problems posed by the zero-lower bound, by transmitting monetary policy directly to the public. </p><p>Executing monetary policy in such a manner could imply the elimination of all physical cash and the power to impose a negative rate, or a tax, on household's holdings of digital money. Those represent dramatic changes. </p><p>My own strong preference is to address the effective lower-bound by using our existing tool kit vigorously, since I view the cost benefit assessment of negative rates as unattractive for the current U.S. context. </p><p>Financial stability considerations are also important. The ability to convert commercial bank deposits into central bank digital currency with a simple swipe, surely has the potential to be a run accelerant. </p><p>And finally, there could be operational risks to a central bank digital bank currency. For starters, this might require the Federal Reserve to develop the operating capacity to access, or manage, individual accounts which could number in the hundreds of millions. </p><p>A myriad of op--other operational challenges would need to be addressed, including electronic counterfeiting, and cyber risks. </p><p>That said, some jurisdictions may move in this direction faster than others, based on the particular attributes of their payments and currency systems. The Federal Reserve, we will continue to analyze the potential benefits and costs of central bank digital currencies, and look forward to learning from our colleagues. </p><p>While prudence cautions against rushing into untested approaches to central bank digital currencies, we are actively investing in our payments infrastructure so that everyone has access to real-time payments. </p><p>We announced that we'll launch the first new payment system in more than 40 years, to help make real--real-time payments available to everyone. FedNow will provide a platform for consumers and businesses to send and receive payments immediately and securely 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. </p><p>It will provide a platform that's neutral for private sector innovation in new faster payment services for in-users, and we're also exploring enhancements to--FedWire Fund Service and National Settlement Services, including expanding office operating hours. </p><p>As the public and private sectors work to reduce payments frictions, one of the most important use cases is for cross-border payments, such as remittances.  Technology enables ecommerce to transcend national borders, but current cross-border payment solutions are slow, cumbersome, and opaque. </p><p>Authorities in many jurisdictions, including the U.S., recognize the importance of cooperating across borders with each other, and the private sector, to address these con--these considerable cross-border frictions. </p><p>No doubt, technology will continue driving rapid change in the way we make payments and the concept of money. The Federal Reserve remains confident in the power of technology and innovation to transform the financial system and reduce frictions while, also, preserving the important consumer protections, data privacy and security, financial stability, and monetary policy transmission mechanisms that have built up, over many decades. </p><p>Given the stakes, global Stablecoin network should be expected to meet a high threshold of legal and regulatory safeguards, before launching operations. </p><p>We are monitoring new technologies closely, with respect to the implications for our operational responsibilities and broader public policy goals, and we are open to exploring new possibilities. </p><p>We are upgrading our services to support innovation of payments, and we will continue to work to foster a safe and efficient payment system including where money, in all its myriad forms, present and future, is concerned.  Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>POSEN: The middle seat at the table-- </p><p>BRAINARD: Sure. </p><p>POSEN: --or would you rather stand? </p><p>BRAINARD: Either one. </p><p>POSEN: What? </p><p>BRAINARD: Either way.  Which do you prefer? </p><p>POSEN: Why don't you stand? </p><p>BRAINARD: Ok. </p><p>POSEN: If you will. </p><p>Governor Brainard has kindly consented to take questions on the record. I'll play traffic cop, if needed, but I'd like to recognize Professor Brunnermeier to make the first comment or question, as he chooses. </p><p>QUESTION: I'll just ask one question quickly. I was struck, actually, by Starbucks, you mentioned example, that they're 1.6 billion, in terms of liabilities to customers, in terms of credit cards, to let--or in terms of gift cards. </p><p>If Starbucks were to decide to make--to liquefy these liabilities, what requirements do you have any idea, when the Fed would step in, or how would it intervene? At what point would it intervene by saying, \"Ok, you can freely transfer this--cash you have on--for Starbucks liabilities from one customer to next customer, you pay with your friends and all this.\" </p><p>Would the Fed be concerned at this dimension, as well? </p><p>BRAINARD: So, I think in--in the case, in the particular case, it's a--it's a closed network. And I--it's really the liabilities of a particular legal entity to a network of users that have signed up for it. So, in that sense, it's more like a prepaid card. And we do actually have pretty good--even--as of recently, even better guard rails around prepaid cards, but that's conceptually how I would think about it. That's the closest analog. </p><p>POSEN: Just the quick--just the quick ground rules. When you're recognized, please feel free to speak. The more your comment resembles a question, the longer you can go, and vice versa. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Please identify yourself when speaking. Since the Governor's on the record, so should you be. </p><p>There is a traveling mic, which Patricia will bring you and there's a standing mic in the back. </p><p>BRAINARD: I would just amend that to say feel free to filibuster. </p><p>POSEN: Oh! </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>POSEN: Not something I expected her to say. Always surprising. Actually, next in line, though, is Martin Wolf. </p><p>QUESTION: Sir Martin Wolf from the Financial--Financial Times. I am--two questions, very simple, I think. I--but not perhaps to answer. </p><p>The first is, in the U.S. case, how far do you think you need changes in law governing the regulatory structure to actually manage all the problems you indicate with these new players? </p><p>And the second thing is, in particular, do you have the powers to determine whether specific organizations making radical proposals for a transformation of the system?  Let's say Facebook is actually a suitable organization to do any of this, because some of us think that's a pretty big issue. </p><p>BRAINARD: So those are good questions. I laid out a little bit earlier, the regulatory authorities that we do have across different regulatory bodies in the U.S., and the way that they are currently configured, and the extent to which they may be applicable, or they may be potentially, insufficiently broad, in some cases. </p><p>And licensing authority, in particular, you know our authority at the Fed is quite narrow. We really have oversight over certain supervised banks. </p><p>As I said earlier, we do not have plenary authority over payment systems, which I think is a very important point. FSOC authority is a question mark because it is going to depend on the very specific facts and circumstances, and it's really with regard to financial institutions and financial activities. </p><p>So, the reality is that those regulatory authorities may, or may not be adequate, depending on how this entity and other entities decide to constitute themselves legally, which I think is still evolving and a little unclear. </p><p>With regard to your second question, which is also a very important question, we really don't have that kind of authority. And so, it would really lie elsewhere. </p><p>The other point, which I think is implicit in your questions, is any of these entities that start from day one with global scope and global scale require a tremendous amount of cross-border cooperation among various regulatory authorities in different jurisdictions. </p><p>And each jurisdiction has different licensing authorities and different regulatory parameters, and that is one of the reasons that the G7 is spending a lot of time on this. This is something where we are at the FSB working a lot on this. It is inherently going to require a lot of cross-border cooperation with sets of rules that are quite different in different jurisdictions. </p><p>POSEN: Thank you. Next, if there are questions. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you, very much. James Faucette from Morgan Stanley.  I had, I guess, two questions, to a little bit dovetail on your previous response. </p><p>I guess, and maybe the impossible question, but how do you manage and work through the coordination of--of across all the different entities, both internal and internationally, particularly when, for the large technology companies, has become somewhat in vogue as they go to market just to launch without permissions or compliance with regulatory and deal with the consequences later, firstly? </p><p>And then secondly, as it relates to the FedNow project, I guess the question is, why kind of start and build a new network, instead of just taking advantage of a clearinghouse type structure, etcetera?  Thank you. </p><p>BRAINARD: So--let's see. With regard to the--can you reframe the first question? </p><p>QUESTION: Yes, sorry. Desperate questions. The first is just--like, what are the tools that the Fed and other regulators can put in place to coordinate, particularly when many technology-- </p><p>BRAINARD: Across-- </p><p>QUESTION: --companies are happy to launch without--without approvals, etcetera, and just deal with the consequences later? </p><p>BRAINARD: Got it. So--and so, within borders, essentially, when activities have not sought particular licenses, but actually fall within the definitions of certain financial activities that are covered by financial regulations, they will get scoped in by the oversight of the relevant authorities. And that's what the discussions over the past several years, actually, starting with cryptocurrencies, have been about at places like the CFTC and the SEC. </p><p>So, when new activities arise, they may well fall under existing regulatory parameters, according to the legal provisions, whether or not, the---the innovators believe that or designed it in the first place. </p><p>The thing that I think is really important, though, for that question and the previous question, is just the reason the financial system has these safeguards that have been built up over decades is because there have been so many instances, historically, where financial panics have fundamentally disrupted economies, and where consumer's households and businesses, have found that their financial holdings were not as safe as they had anticipated. And that is why we have these very important safeguards in place. </p><p>With regard to FedNow, there are a few reasons. First of all, the Fed is the only entity that actually can facilitate real-time settlement between the accounts of banks, directly. The private sector entity, by necessity, is a private ledger that is a joint account structure. </p><p>And so, if we don't build that capacity, it simply won't exist. And for purposes of resilience and for purposes of kind of future proofing real-time payments, it's a very important function to build. </p><p>Secondly, the Federal Reserve connects to 10,000 institutions, depositories, and other institutions around the country. The clearinghouse and its various payment systems, often sits alongside the Fed, and offers payment solutions in the ACH and electronic funds transfers. So, this would be the norm rather than a departure. </p><p>But it's only the Fed that tends to make connections to the 10,000 institutions that facilitate payments. And we have the existing network and customer service built out, which is a lot of work to go that last mile. So, we're really building on existing infrastructure, in many respects. </p><p>POSEN: Thank you. Next, second one in the back if you'd go to the standing mic, please. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>QUESTION: Dion Rabouin from Axios. My question is just on the, I guess, the state of things, or where we are at the moment.  I just came from a presentation with David Marcus from Libra, and he seems to be putting forth the notion they're ready to go, kick start things as soon as they can kind of get the approval. So, I'm curious where's the Fed with an example of, or with an actual, presentable, U.S. digital currency. </p><p>I've heard from some members of the Swedish Central Bank that they are five years away.  Chinese central bank says they've got something to produce by November. So, I'm just curious where--where do you think we are with regard to actually having a Fed produced, or Fed backed, digital currency. And where do you see the rest of the world? </p><p>BRAINARD: Yeah, so the two jurisdictions that you mentioned, and I think you'll get to hear from one of them on this panel, part of what is present in their payment system is a--there has been a very rapid migration away from cash--to digital payments. </p><p>The reverse has been true in the U.S. We have a lot of movement in individual payments, but we also have a lot of growth in the demand for cash. So, we're in a somewhat different position, and I think we're also in a different position because of the nature of our sovereign currency and the role it plays more broadly. </p><p>With respect to as--as we think about the potential evolution of other jurisdictions and their consideration of central bank digital currencies, I think we will watch those developments very closely, and look forward to learning from them. </p><p>We will make important investments in future technology, for instance, to give the consumers the benefits of real-time digital payments. But we're also going to be exceptionally cautious and mindful of the profound differences a full-on central bank digital currency would imply, along the lines that I outlined earlier, in terms of consumers having accounts directly with the central bank--very profound implications for visibility into individual transactions data, implications for monetary policy transmission, and potentially for financial stability. </p><p>So, all of those things require a lot of careful consideration. </p><p>POSEN: Good question.  Other? </p><p>Really? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>POSEN: Someone back there--who's being pointed to.  No? </p><p>Ok. </p><p>QUESTION: You--you mentioned the speed of cross-border payments, and the opaqueness of that process, and I guess there are--it's also error-prone to some extent with SWIFT. </p><p>Santander seems to be trying to approach it with a partnership with Ripple. Just curious what your thoughts are on that. </p><p>BRAINARD: So, I do think that, of the use cases out there, cross-border is one of the most compelling.  We know that intermediation chains cross-border are long, and quite opaque, and they're slow, and they can be quite costly. </p><p>So, my sense is that technology, with appropriate safeguards, could make a material impact, and likely will. And it may well be through a partnership model. I don't want to pronounce on any particular approach. </p><p>But there are a variety of partnerships out there that are trying to innovate and to reduce frictions and increase transparency for those cross-border transactions. And my sense, I'm fairly optimistic, that there are some good solutions out there that don't necessitate a global Stablecoin. </p><p>POSEN: Thank you.  Other question? </p><p>Please.  Not that one.  Well--here.  Sorry. Here. </p><p>QUESTION: So, following up on that a little bit-- </p><p>POSEN: Say this was from Frank Brosens from Taconic-- </p><p>QUESTION: Julia Coronado, MacroPolicy Perspectives. So, you laid out some of the issues and the challenges, and some of them seem like there are solutions to those. </p><p>So, for example, couldn't the Fed approach the two-tier system with digital currency--with consumers so that there is a--a payment system direct to consumers that the Fed has the reserves, but it's through private sector providers, much as there's a two-tier system in the banking. </p><p>And--and you mentioned that the Fed doesn't, right now, have authority over payments providers. Does anybody have authority payments providers? </p><p>BRAINARD: So, the way that our system works currently, and has for quite a long time actually, is that the Fed has given--has been given authority to operate as a payments provider, rather than to regulate and oversee payments providers, except the authority we have, with respect to bank service providers, in particular. </p><p>So, we do have capacity to provide those payment services. We currently do that through the intermediation of banks through the accounts that depositories and other institutions have with the Fed. One could think of other ways of doing it, but that's the way that we currently operate. </p><p>And in terms of other regulators, FSOC has some authorities in that regard. But these would need to be determined to be systemic--the payments and settlement and clearing systems would need to be determined to be systemic with very particular statutory requirements. </p><p>And again, it's not clear that those would be satisfied, at this time. </p><p>QUESTION: But what about, like, the possibility of a two--the Fed operating a two-tier system through a CBTC, like, using the private sector, not necessarily maintaining all the accounts themselves? </p><p>BRAINARD: So, there are a variety of different ways to think about a potential central bank digital currency. We do, in fact, have a two-tier system in many respects, right now, so that we issue, digitally, central bank money, and the intermediaries are the commercial banks that then provide those services to--to consumers. </p><p>Some of the proposals, in fact, a large majority of the proposals that are out there that are really at the forefront of this discussion really mean moving to direct-to-consumer, direct-to-household account provisions. So, that's a really, quite big leap from where we are, today. </p><p>POSEN: Please, if you could go to the mic. </p><p>QUESTION: Brendan Greeley, also with the Financial Times. One of the chief arguments for Stablecoins, like Libra, is that they improve digital inclusion, or financial inclusion. Is that an argument resonates at the Fed, and should the Fed be doing something in parallel to also increase financial inclusion? </p><p>BRAINARD: So, I think the arguments, with respect to financial inclusion, are also compelling, but it's also important to make sure that, in the process of extending account access, that we don't end up providing accounts with little to no safeguards to those who don't currently have accounts. </p><p>And so, what really matters is whether, in the process of expanding access to accounts and financial inclusion, that all households have the same kinds of safeguards, in terms of their claims, and the competence that they can have that they understand the terms of their accounts and that they have the same kinds of assurances that other consumers have traditionally assumed, with respect to bank accounts. </p><p>So yes, I do believe that the financial inclusion objective is an extremely important one, but I also believe that those kinds of households also need safeguards and protections on their balances, perhaps, even more than the current banked population. </p><p>POSEN: Governor Brainard, if I could, on behalf of the International Economics part of the Peterson Institute, can I pose a couple questions? </p><p>You mentioned, in your very excellent speech, about, in passing, about the huge payment--private payment systems in China, at the moment.  And I was just wondering if, in exchange with discussions with the People's Bank or the IMF, or others, you think that there is any relevance of that experience, any things that would be more reassuring, less reassuring, or if it's unique? </p><p>The second question, which may be more to some of your past roles, but we are--we're currently aware of desires of various governments to get out from the potential leverage point that SWIFT in the U.S. payment systems--presents over them.  Governor Carney sort of came at this in his remarks at Jackson Hole. </p><p>We've seen the Russians recently announce they wish to create an alternative payment system to help the Iranians. At what point do--does the creation of these cybercurrencies run up into those kinds of issues, if at all? </p><p>BRAINARD: Alright, so, let me see. Going back to the first question. So, actually I don't know if you're going to have some discussion of the Chinese experience today on your panel, but I--I really think it's very instructive. I think the two big payments--the two big networks, which turned into massive payment systems in China, really do offer some really important lessons, for the rest of us. </p><p>And what those payment networks were able to do with the data that they have and the access that they have, I think is--you know, is very helpful in thinking about the potential benefits from being inside one of these networks, and how these networks can grow very rapidly, and once those network externalities start to build, how they get somewhat locked in. </p><p>And, of course, they present some challenges to the monetary authority. And so, I think that will be--that's a really important example, certainly in my own thinking, and I hope you'll be able to talk more about that, here, today. </p><p>But the--the inherently global nature of some of these existing networks, I think, does--does explain why, on day one, regulators across borders started speaking to each other. We do, in fact, have some ability to work across borders in regulatory, supervisory colleges, for instance. </p><p>And so, we have developed these kinds of solutions for global, systemic infrastructures before, and those are the kinds of arrangements that will be critical for some of these entities, if they do satisfy the necessary regulatory and legal standards that I think they must. </p><p>Second question--oh, so one of the biggest benefits to many of the users of early generation--first-generation cryptocurrencies was of course, precisely, that it was outside the regulated payment system, and was opaque to money laundering and counter-terrorist financing authorities. </p><p>And that kind of dynamic will remain. Of course, we have a tremendous amount of cooperation across a lot of jurisdictions in this shared objective.  But I do believe that a part of the reason that you see interest in some of the less opaque types of crypto assets is for illicit activity. </p><p>POSEN: Is there a final question for Governor Brainard? </p><p>Yeah--we've now got somebody else who's got a second bite at the apple, first. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask a--a follow up question, here, and--and that was--obviously, the U.S. position, or the U.S. dollar position as a reserve currency, has helped create a lot of demand for cash. </p><p>One of the arguments that we hear, around digital currencies issued by other countries, is that the digital currencies distribution advantage--electronic distribution advantage, could serve as a path to unseating the U.S. dollar, as a key reserve currency. What do you--what's the view, your view, in terms if that's potential and relevant? </p><p>BRAINARD: Yeah, so I think what is--I have to say what I have, and now I've, you know, may just a step out of my Federal Reserve, kind of--perch, for just a second, and say having observed the role of the dollar now, over many decades, it is really notable. We've had massive changes in the international monetary system, in terms of growth of--you know, certain economies, the emergence of other global currencies. </p><p>It is notable how stable, in effect, the reserve currency's role has been. And I think, historically, we also have seen that it requires a very unusual and low frequency set of events to switch from an existing reserve currency to another reserve currency. </p><p>The set of developments that we're witnessing, today, are another wave that raises those questions, yet again. It certainly is something that I'll continue to watch carefully. It's not something, given our statutory and domestic responsibilities, it's not something that would change the considerations that we would bring to bear in thinking about the costs and benefits of moving to an entirely digital central bank currency. </p><p>POSEN: Thank you so much.  If-- </p><p>BRAINARD: Thank you. </p><p>POSEN: --you could please join me in thanking Governor Lael Brainard-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>BRAINARD: Thank you. </p><p>POSEN: --of the Federal Reserve. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>POSEN: We'd like to invite those of you present with us, today, for a 10-minute break to accept our modest hospitality and our ample food for thought--we already have. In 10 minutes, we will reconvene for a presentation by Markus Brunnermeier of the new study--I'll make sure I get the title right, The Digitization of Money by Brunnermeier, James, and Landau.  And then, the panel moderated by Martin Wolf.  Thank you very much. </p><p>(RECESS) </p><p>POSEN: So, thank you all for being disciplined about that break, especially for those of you online.  I hope you pushed pause and restart.  It is my pleasure to continue, we hope, the incredibly high standard that Governor Brainard set for this discussion on substance, and I'm certain we will.  We will now have a presentation by Professor Markus Brunnermeier of Princeton of the Bendheim Center for Finance at Princeton of his new paper with Harold James and Jean-Pierre Landau, The Digitalization of Money.  Markus, please. </p><p>BRUNNERMEIER: I would like to thank the Peterson Institute and especially Adam and Frank for hosting us and organizing this together.  I think it's a pleasure and hope we can do this in the future again. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, as Adam said, it's joint work with Harold James, who is also in the audience and with Jean-Pierre Landau from SciencesPo in Paris.  Oops.  This--oh, that's the wrong way around.  Okay. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>This was the last slide.  So, we would like to rethink money in the digital age.  And, you know, everybody knows that there's evolution going.  There's (INAUDIBLE).  Everybody's talking about it.  But, you might argue that we have digital inside money already.  So, most of our checking accounts--everything is in digital form already.  It's inside money, not outside money.  So, it's a liability for some banks. </p><p>While the new thing, I think, is very much you have digital outside money, so money which is not the liability of somebody, some new currencies.  And the questions which emerge in this discussion are always, you know, will private digital money drive out cash, public tokens essentially?  Will central banks lose their grip on monetary policy.  Do we see digital dollarization as Governor Brainard mentioned?  What are the new digital currency areas that will be new currency areas?  What does (INAUDIBLE) take on?  And will CBDC the answer--be the answer to have (INAUDIBLE) on the monetary sovereignty, in a sense. </p><p>And actual thing you might think is--what's actually new when (INAUDIBLE) technological trends already.  And we have already e-money at this debate about the cashless economy already 20 years ago.  And I would like to make some arguments that this time is different for the following reasons. </p><p>One is that what money now is much more associated with digital platform.  So, you're part of an ecosystem, a digital ecosystem where you do--part of your life is your digital life.  Essentially, you live on this platform.  And this gives this platform some data (INAUDIBLE) they can use for other purposes as well.  That's very different from previous e-monies where it actually it was not part of this digital platform where the data played this crucial role.  I think that's one important point I will come back to over and over again. </p><p>The other important point is that everything is on the smartphone.  So, it's easy to carry around.  It's with tokens.  You can pay--make tokens.  And put this together--makes this much more speedier world.  So, the payments will occur in real time.  People demand to pay in real time.  They can't wait for two days for some payments to be happening.  And that means much less can be netted out within the bank.  So, you have to have much, much less netting.  So, you have much more cost settlement going on.  And when there's a crisis, of course, the crisis will be much faster.  There will be no weekend or anything to deal with that. </p><p>The other thing which will happen is the Internet of things.  There will be payments from machine to machine, not only from person to person.  There will be smart contracts and (INAUDIBLE).  So, a lot of contingent payments whenever something happens.  There will be contingent payments that will be a lot of volume coming from smart contracts' executions. </p><p>And finally, of course, you have tokens instead of account based systems.  So, all of these things might impact money, and we would like to highlight some of the aspects which money might be impacted.  So, the first thing I would like to--so, the currency competition will change, and it will change in one way that it leads to some unbundling to the three roles of money. </p><p>So, typically, we have this unit of account (INAUDIBLE) store value, medium of exchange.  And (INAUDIBLE) already postulated in the 70s that we should actually have some currency competition because this actually keeps the governments in check not to print too much money.  But, the currency competition didn't work so fiercely, in particular with respect to private aspects because whenever you hold some money, you get the bundle of services.  You don't get just one store value service or unit of account or some medium exchange service.  That actually limits competition among the currencies. </p><p>But, in the future you can hold 37 currencies in your wallet or your smartphone.  You can switch from one currency to another one very easily.  You might prefer a particular currency to make payments on that platform or a particular currency to--has a store of value.  So, you can easily switch around.  So, you can see much more fierce competition among the currencies because you have this unbundling of the three roles of currency. </p><p>Of course, it's not new.  We have already convertibility between gold and silver, historically, led to some unbundling where you still have a (INAUDIBLE) for payments as a medium of exchange and gold much more as a store of value and for larger transactions.  So, the (INAUDIBLE) is essentially also a form of unbundling.  But, more generally, it will be the case that switching costs from one currency to another currency is going down.  This reduces network externalities.  And that actually then leads to much lower forms of--much fiercer competition because you have this unbundling. </p><p>And one nice analogy I think is--what often people say that money is--we coordinate on a particular money is like language.  We also coordinate on a particular language.  So, we use certain sounds and communicate with certain sounds.  And we coordinate on these languages.  And it's very hard to switch from one language to the next one to--but, once we have the speech translation software, we'll--you know, Skype or whatever software is it can translate immediately what we're saying in another language. </p><p>Then, it will be the same that we don't really have to coordinate on the same language anymore.  So, everybody (INAUDIBLE) you can have your own private language, and we're just coordinating it very, very easily. We don't have to coordinate on some language.  So, we can switch.  The switching costs will be much more reduced. </p><p>Now, the key thing is that there will be unbundling in the roles of money.  But, there will be rebundling at the same time.  And the rebundling will occur with certain features of the platforms.  So, it will live on the platforms--on the digital platforms, on the digital ecosystem.  And people will provide--or institutions will provide some currencies which are very well suited for this particular platform. So, there will be discounts if you use this particular currency on a particular digital ecosystem.  You can execute smart contracts if you use this currency.  You cannot use the smart contracts otherwise. </p><p>And there will be--in general, there will be institutions providing currencies, offering different features with the money attached to it.  So, there will be a rebundling with other features.  And there will be this--what I call this money product differentiation.  So, there will be some monies which are very good in providing price transparency in this particular platform.  Others will be--more currencies which have more privacy protection. </p><p>So, Apple Pay is actually already going this way.  So, if you want to have particular privacy--if you're very concerned about privacy, you might choose a certain currency.  If you're not concerned about private but much more about how many points you get or miles you get or other things, then actually use a different currency.  Or that will be competition among these various things.  And, of course, this differentiation is designed to reduce competition among the currencies. </p><p>And to a large extent, the private sector will have an incentive to make essentially each ecosystem more closed, to make it less interoperable among the systems in order to get some rents from using this currency.  And this will lead to, then, some digital currency areas.  Okay, that's certain areas, which are not geographically designed but differently designed based on connections to additional platform where you have various different digital currency areas. </p><p>Now, this is already immediately implications for the international monetary system.  So, as you say, there is--this digital currency area--there's complementarities with digital platforms.  As I mentioned, you might get current (INAUDIBLE) discounts.  If you look at China, that's--that's very much advanced in this space.  You can see that the way (INAUDIBLE) got big advantage was because they offer essentially some discounts if you use (INAUDIBLE) for certain shops (INAUDIBLE) to the shops, and I will give you special discounts.  And then, people use immediately Alipay or (INAUDIBLE) and the cash usage went down dramatically. </p><p>Similarly, you can better--better price discovery.  You can have fine-tuned price discovery, depending on the type of consumer you are.  You might get more transparency if you're in this particular platform using this currency (INAUDIBLE).  So, whenever you--if you own unit of account, we call it a different digital currency area or the (INAUDIBLE) can only be used inside the digital currency area. </p><p>And as it came up earlier, there is also digital dollarization in a sense that there will be some vulnerable country.  So, like with additional dollarization that suddenly the country loses its own currency and people suddenly start using dollars or whatever the leading currency is, the same can also happen in a digital space. </p><p>And the question is which countries are most vulnerable to digital dollarization?  And this probably--like for dollarizations--will be small countries.  But, it will also be countries which are relatively open, which don't have their own social media platforms where the citizens already rely on a social media platform for other countries.  And these countries are much more vulnerable to digital dollarization.  And that means they might lose--power of the economy might move to these platforms, and they also might lose the monetary sovereignty over that. </p><p>And the next thing is--of course, the key is that when will you lose unit of account of all of money and with it then the monetary sovereignty.  And as we know from the dollarization literature, this is a highly nonlinear system--a nonlinear phenomenon.  It might not happen for a long time, and suddenly, it happens very quickly.  So, what will you do (INAUDIBLE) that about financial crisis also works here for dollarization. You know, first, it takes much longer than you think.  But, when it happens, it happens very, very--faster than you think. </p><p>And how digital dollarization will happen--it can happen in two ways.  It can happen like traditional dollarization through the medium exchange or that people start invoicing and exchanging services with this digital currency, or it can be with the store of value where the new currency serves as store of value.  And you can see that, for example, if certain countries have capital controls on it, it might not become very dominant player from the store of value because of capital controls.  But, because of the medium exchange role it serves in this platform, it might become a very attractive currency to take over other countries because of the medium of exchange aspects to it. </p><p>And finally, the third implications for the international monetary system is the digital synthetic world currency (INAUDIBLE) they are talking about, you know--some people were arguing, \"Oh, there might be some (INAUDIBLE) on the base of digital currency.\"  But, overall, I think what's important is you would like to have this safe asset people use and symmetric supply--globally symmetrically supplied. </p><p>And the reason for that is whenever there's a crisis and there's flight to safety, it leads actually to flight to safety across borders, and that's further destabilizing because everybody holds, let's say, the U.S. dollar or dollar assets as a safe asset.  And whenever the crisis becomes more severe, even if it started in the U.S., it will lead to an appreciation of dollar and a lot of cross border capital flows. </p><p>If you have a safe asset, which is more symmetrically distributed for across the globe, a truly global safe asset, you will not have the cross border flight to safety flows.  You might still have fight to safety flows.  But, they don't lead to huge exchange rate movements and then destabilize further because of the exchangement movements.  And that's one argument why you can--you should have actually a more symmetrically supplied safe asset. </p><p>Now, the other aspects besides the--the big aspects of the international monetary system is it will also change finance as we know it.  And the question is who is controlling the data?  And there are two worlds out there.  One is a more bank centric world.  The other one is a more payment centric world.  And the bank centric world--that's the world you live in at the moment.  That's much more centered around banks, and banks have access to the customers directly, all the lending, deposit taking, payments--everything is going around the bank side.  And the bank has a lot of information about the customers and can make use of this information, whether they give a loan or don't give a loan and so forth. </p><p>The payment centric world is what we see already in China where the payment platform is at the center, and the information is with this payment platform provider.  And the bank is essentially just feeding information--just feeding funds to the payment platform.  But, all the information--information rent is with the payment platform.  And they provide vendor services with that. </p><p>And then, the question is what is the optimal way of bundling it?  Is the optimal way of bundling is--deposit taking and lending--is this the optimal way of bundling activities for--because they need to have the common information, or is the optimal way bundling payments with some other ecommerce activities or other social network activities.  And that's the key question you have to answer going forward, and it's not clear exactly how the system will play out. Of course, the regulatory framework will play a major role which direction it goes, and probably some countries will go more the bank centric way and other countries will go more the payment centric way. </p><p>Now, let me come back to the currency competition, in particular, the competition between private and public money, so between the sovereign, its own money, and the public.  And the question essentially becomes, very dramatically phrased, is Facebook doing the monetary policy to manage our macroeconomy?  Is Facebook our new central bank is Libra is taking over? </p><p>And you might think--if you think about it, you know, public money is the most national thing.  Each country has its own currency.  But, it's--as Harold told me, it is--national money is a very recent phenomenon.  Harold, of course, thinks in--in--in centuries rather than in decades.  And so, it's a fairly recent phenomenon that we have national money.  For many, many centuries, we have many private currencies competing with each other, and there was no nation behind it because nations is also a fairly recent phenomena. </p><p>And so, the question then is, you know, what makes--what's the advantage of a public money versus private money?  So, of course, one argument is, you know, historically, it does--didn't really matter so much because we didn't really use monetary policies so much, if you look two, three hundred years back to manage the macroeconomy.  Nowadays, we really need monetary policy to manage the macroeconomy.  So, we have to be more concerned about monetary sovereignty. </p><p>But, what--what really makes public money special--there are three arguments, going back to the three roles of money.  One is the store of value focus, and that's because, in order to defend a currency--how do you defend a currency if there's an attack?  You have to tax back, and you have the taxing authority.  You can raise tax revenue in order to fend off any attack.  The question is will Facebook use its balance sheet?  Will it go beyond its balance sheet?  How much capacity is there, and how much willingness is there to defend your currency? </p><p>Of course, there are some examples where there is some public money, which is--then, the government disappeared, and it's still active and was still active for many years.  So, one example, I mentioned, famously (INAUDIBLE) speech at the American Economic Association, the Iraqi dinar, even though Saddam Hussein was--was going down and the Iraqi dinar in north Iraq was still active--acting as money very well, particularly because nobody could print it because there was no government. </p><p>And similarly, in Somalia, the Somali shilling is still actively used even though there is no gove</p><p>rnment anymore and no central bank.  So, you can have money without tax backing.  But, it's more the exception rather than the rule. </p><p>The other thing is--the second aspect is the medium of exchange focus.  Some people argue it is the legal tender aspect and the government can enforce certain payments being made in the national money.  So, that's another focus.  But, I think the key--we think the key aspect is the unit of account role of money.  And as long as you can control the unit of account role--and people denominate (INAUDIBLE) and nominal debt in your own currency, then you can control essentially monetary policy. </p><p>And the argument essentially is what monetary policy does in the world with financial frictions--it can essentially shift risk around.  So, whenever--it can do monetary policy conditional on the risks.  Some might suppose we have a (INAUDIBLE) can be hard or a soft (INAUDIBLE).  It can conduct monetary policy subsequently conditional on that, and this way we can shift risk around to a much broader part of the population than to the guys who (INAUDIBLE) on this particular risk. </p><p>And that's what monetary policy does.  It allows a much better risk sharing across the population in a world we have a nominal debt denominated into national currency or alternatively we have price stickiness in--there's a new Keynesian perspective--price stickiness in this nominal currency, which, if you think about it, is essentially also a form of contract.  You have a wage contract for the next one year.  It's almost the same thing as denomination of former contracts of nominal debt.  So, that's (INAUDIBLE) which matters a lot to--for the unit of account aspect. </p><p>Now, the final point I would like to make is that, you know, as cash becomes a pure substitute for private digital money--why?  Because most normal part of our world is actually in the digital--is executed at the digital platform.  We would like to have some digital money, and cash is not good--is not well suited to use for in a digital platform.  So, cash is going away.  And I think people--as people argued, there's more usage of dollars and Swiss franc.  But, it's mostly used as a store of value.  So--because the interest rate is so low, we all having now suddenly--we want to get around the zero--negative interest rate in Europe or in Switzerland.  So, people hoard, to some extent, some cash.  But, the actual usage of cash--the velocity of cash is probably going down and becoming less prominent as we speak. </p><p>The question is--so, how can we design--offer some alternative?  And I think that's the first order--aspect when you think about central bank digital currency.  Can you offer something in order to maintain monetary sovereignty?  And in order to--you want to maintain monetary sovereignty in order to ensure that you have the power of monetary policy--you're still active. </p><p>And one way this came already up in the previous session (INAUDIBLE) is to have a more indirect way that you have stable coins.  And stable coins--some of them are private.  But, they have to back it with 100 percent of the central bank digital currency.  So, that's 100 percent CBDC.  Or it can go the full way, just saying everybody can have some account with the central bank. </p><p>Many people argue it should be account based but token based.  So, it should be very close to cash, like cash is a token.  So, it should be much more token based.  There's also, in terms of privacy reasons--you (INAUDIBLE) keep this more private when it's token based.  And it's much easier, this way, to keep it similar to cash and (INAUDIBLE) more accepted from the public as well. </p><p>But, of course, the digression, I think, which will probably come up later as well (INAUDIBLE) official CBDC will have this other bundling features with various platforms going on.  And the next question essentially then is--you know, how would you design the central bank digital currency in a way which is neutral to the real economy? </p><p>The argument is always that, if the central bank is introducing CBDC, it will be the case that, you know, you'll drive out essentially deposit taking.  So, the banks can offer fewer deposits, and this way the funding you (INAUDIBLE) some investments because the banks can actually not issue so many deposits.  They have less funding.  They can actually fund less to the real economy. </p><p>And let me just show you with a quick picture a little economy where you have some firms here.  There's some banks here issuing deposits held by the households, there's a central bank, and the government also issuing some money.  And now, let's suppose we increase--let's suppose that CBDC already--instead of a green piece of paper--now, if we increase the amount of money, one way to maintain (INAUDIBLE) is if the central bank would just pass through the funding through the private banks.  So, you can design a system with (INAUDIBLE) funding to make sure that you have still the (INAUDIBLE) even though you introduced CBDC and you drive out some of the deposits if the central bank takes over some of the deposits. </p><p>But then, you might argue, of course, the central bank then becomes a creditor to private banks and is exposed to credit risks.  But--so, you have to some safeguards in here as well and have to adjust the (INAUDIBLE) policy, in particular, to make sure the safeguards are in place. </p><p>So, let me sum up to the main points of the paper.  The main points of the paper is that the world is changing in particular ways.  We have e-money before.  But, what's really the new aspects which drive things are the digital platforms and the digital ecosystems where a lot of our transactions will move to retail is moving with Amazon and many, many other things will be executed at digital platforms other than physically going to a retail store.  And for that, digital money is way more useful than cash is. </p><p>The smartphone is a second element and token based accounts.  These are the three elements which really make this very different from the earlier movements.  And what we will see is essentially some specialization in currencies where the unbundle the three roles--the traditional three roles of money.  And this unbundling itself enhances currency competition.  So--because unbundling leads to competition, each of the functions of the money--so you can have much more currency competition in this dimension. </p><p>But, there will be some rebundling, which reduces currency competition.  And in order to make sure that the private sector doesn't do too much rebundling, you would like to have some interoperability and convertibility.  And so, the big policy issue is how interoperable are the various currencies with each other?  So, typically private sector probably has an incentive that you'll go to the platform, be locked in the platform, and it's not so easy to get out of it.  So, it's easy to get in but not so easy to get out, and that's where the interoperability issue comes in. </p><p>The second point is more with regard to the financial sector.  There will be inversion of the industrial organization of the financial activities.  There will be, you know, the big question of who will have access to the data of customers, the banks or the big tech companies?  And there will be a lot of lobbying activities--who can actually maintain the access to the banking sector--to the customers' data set?  Will it be the banking center, or will it move on the big tax environment.  And, of course, if you want to move to the latter, there will be a huge transition period, and this might also be associated with some discord, and it might make sense not to experiment with the U.S. dollar right away.  But, (INAUDIBLE) experiment with some smaller countries at the forefront of that. </p><p>But, I think the two important concepts are this digital dollarization, which is an issue for smaller countries, but countries which don't have their own social wrap system.  So, while they rely already on current IT and (INAUDIBLE) companies from U.S. or from China, to a large extent.  And then, there will be new digital currency areas popping up.  These digital currency areas will not be based on geographical boundaries.  But, they will be on different dimensions.  There will be some people in different parts of the continents who actually might belong to a similar class of consumers and might have similar currency they're dealing with. </p><p>I should say one final word.  Of course, what we discuss in the paper too--there is specific areas for which there will be a digital currency that would also depend very much on privacy regulation.  Okay, so, if there's particular privacy regulation, then it will be the case that you will also have specific currencies which take advantage of this privacy regulation, and this might introduce some geographical boundaries after all again. </p><p>And finally, I think the most important question is what to do in order to maintain monetary sovereignty to manage the macroeconomy.  And for this, I think the important role is in CBD.  So, it's very important to have this role to give the central bank some access to the public, in particular to ensure that nominal debt will remain to be denominated in your national currency and only this way you can actually maintain an ability to manage your macroeconomy through monetary policy.  Thanks a lot. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So--so, I think we go into the panel.  I don't see Adam.  Okay. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I think the next--I don't think we have a break.  We go on to the panel right away.  And Martin Wolf will actually-- </p><p>UNKNOWN: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>WOLF: Okay.  So, it's a great pleasure to moderate this session.  I agreed to do so because I thought this whole seminar would be a wonderful learning experience.  And it has been.  I have (OFF-MIC).  I see.  I thought this was automatic as it normally is.  Okay.  I'm very happy to moderate this session.  And the--I--I wanted to do so because I thought I'd learn a lot, and I have and expect to learn even more in the panel discussion. </p><p>I have actually read the joint paper that Markus just presented, and I had to read it twice to understand it.  So, if you understood his presentation, you are impressively bright people or impressively well informed.  But, it is incredibly important provocative.  Though, I think it leaves some questions (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>In my own perspective--and it's just sort of the last remark of mine--is all this terrifies the wits out of me.  My basic starting point is that whenever you allow very major innovations in the financial and monetary system, it always ends badly for about a century. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And it--at the end of that, you sort of work out what to do about it.  And by then, civilization is almost gone.  So--I am not being facetious.  I am being absolutely serious.  So, I think that anybody who isn't worried the hell about a world in which Facebook runs the monetary system--or maybe it'll be Amazon--then, they're just not paying attention. </p><p>So, the way we've going--the panel have--oh, we have four people-- </p><p>POSEN: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>WOLF: --Is Mark--are you still in the panel?  Are you going to be participating in the panel?  Do you want to?  Good idea.  But, perhaps at the end.  So--in the Q&amp;A perhaps.  So, we've got, to my left, Stefan Ingves of the Swedish RiksBank, the oldest central bank in the world.  Yes?  So, you know all about the consequences of innovation.  I'm sure you've made mistakes many times. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>To his left is Hyun Song Shin who I've known for a very long time.  He used to be a very, very distinguished, enormously brilliant academic and, for some reason, has become a bureaucrat.  I still don't--can't work this out. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And--and--and third, Simon Potter, who many of you will know from the New York Fed where he was executive director.  Is that your-- </p><p>POTTER: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>WOLF: Head--and the head of the--yeah.  So, the way we're going to do this is we have--we're going to just have a discussion.  It's not going to be a lot of speeches.  I'm proposing that we have--propose that we divide into two segments.  The first segment, we'll discuss how digital technology is set to transform the monetary, and to a lesser degree, financial systems, so taking on from what Markus was just talking about.  And the second section will be about how they expect the public sector, the official sector, particularly central banks, but not exclusively to respond and how they think it should respond.  Each segment will be about 25 minutes, and then, we'll have a discussion. </p><p>Now, some of you might have noticed that we haven't done fantastically well on time keeping.  But, my view is the past is bygone.  So, we are still going to have our full length of seminar, and that means that you're not going to have very much time for drinking afterwards.  But, you might have enough to time to sink a few glasses of wine to get over the horror. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, one the--so, the first session--section then will be on how this could unfold.  Each panelist will speak for about four minutes.  Then, we'll have this discussion among them.  Then, we'll move onto the next thing, and then, there will be lots of brilliant questions from you.  And do start off the first section, Hyun. </p><p>SHIN: Well, thank you, Martin, and thank you to the Peterson Institution for (INAUDIBLE) in this very timely and very interesting event.  It's been an extremely rich discussion so far, and I've certainly learned a lot. </p><p>We've talked a lot about technology.  But, I think it's very important for us to keep in mind the technology in the context of the architecture.  So, the tech is one thing.  But, architecture is about what we do.  Tech is about how we do it.  And I think, of course, clearly, the technology is--is enabling.  That will have to have a--have an influence on the architecture.  But, it doesn't always have to. </p><p>And I think a very good example is account based money.  And I think it's worth thinking about the origin of accounts back in--well, I--I suppose account based money really took off in--in 16th and 17th century Europe where the idea is that there was an intermediary.  Both the sender and the receiver have accounts at this intermediary.  It's typically a bank.  And the sender--and the sender's account is debited, and the receiver's account is credited.  And that's a very elegant solution. </p><p>Now, that architecture is pretty much in place right now.  It's just that the technology has made that functioning much more efficient, very rapid, and very--very much more convenient.  I mean, if you're in Sweden, and you have a bank account, which most people have access to--there is this digital app called Swish.  Extremely convenient.  Just one swipe of the--just, you know, one swipe on the mobile phone, and the payment is made.  It's very much based on the banking sector.  It's very much based on the two tier banking system where the payment goes through one account at one bank and one account at another bank and it's settled on the central bank's balance sheet. </p><p>But, the technology has, of course, made it much more convenient, and the look and feel is extremely sort of seamless.  So, I think that's a very good example of how the--you know, the architecture can remain pretty much constant.  But, the technology enables you to do much more. </p><p>Now, we're here because technology has stirred up a number of other debates.  And I think there were two issues that, I think--which have really been very important in making this topic particularly topical.  One is that we have a way of making payments, which doesn't need the--the account based money, which is based on a decentralized consensus.  We typically call it a token currency.  But, it's not really--that's really a short hand. </p><p>What it does is--it's a list, and the list is shared among everyone in the network.  There's a--there's a--in Bitcoin, it's a completely open system where you can come in and be a member of this network.  But, it's just a list.  It keeps track of where a particular unit of value has been transferred. </p><p>And technologically, I think this is a leap because you don't need to debit one person's account and credit another person's account.  I think this has really occasioned a very stimulating debate.  Now, it doesn't need to be Bitcoin, which is like--you know, which is an open DLT system.  It can be a permissioned DLT system, as many central banks have also experimented with.  But, this tech development has been a very important development. </p><p>The--the second development, I think, is, as Governor Brainard mentioned, the importance of big tech companies that have come into the financial services.  And big tech is characterized by what we in the--in this year's annual government report call a DNA loop, the data network activities loop.  So, big tech firms already have an established base, either in search, in ecommerce, or in social media.  Then, they're leveraging in their network in providing financial services. </p><p>And so, the entry is much easier, and there's a potential where there could be a tipping point where they could become very important players in very short time.  And if so, they will become really, you know, very, very important market participants, even dominant perhaps.  And that could actually change the competitive landscape, in a way, which may be detrimental to--to something which is more competitive transparent system.  I think this has also occasioned a lot of debate. </p><p>Now, in the--so, Martin has been a very tough chairman here.  I did--I do have a slide deck, which has been distributed to you.  And in that slide deck, what you'll find is that--in a--in a--in a typical (INAUDIBLE) and there, you have an example of the member countries of--of the committees on payments and market infrastructure, which is a BIS committee that oversees the payments space.  Typically, wholesale payments are of the order of 50 to 60 times GDP.  That's to say, in a given year, if you just count up the--the--the amount of payments that go through the--the central bank (INAUDIBLE) system, you have quantities that are--are vastly larger than--than GDP itself.  That's wholesale payments. </p><p>The retail payments turns out to be a much smaller--a very much smaller component of that.  And if we were to try and replicate that with a stable coin, for example, where it's prefunded--so, you deposit money into a wallet and then spend only the money that you have, we are thinking of a wallet that would be an enormous wallet where you have very, very large sums.  And in macroeconomics, that's called a cash in advance economy.  If you try to operate the modern financial system as a cash in advance system, you would really come up against big bottlenecks. </p><p>The reason why the central bank system works so well is because people trust the central bank.  And when the central bank offers a deposit as an overdraft, the--you're creating a loan that's backing the deposit.  But, in a daylight overdraft, which is typically what happens in wholesale payment system, that daylight overdraft is granted to a bank, let's say, because the bank can make a large payment even though the balances the bank has at the central bank doesn't cover the full amount of that payment because the--the timing of payments will be such that, at the end of the day, you will have all the accounts being balanced. </p><p>Now, I think this gives us a very useful introduction to the question of, what is the appropriate division of labor between the public sector and the private sector.  To the extent that, as Markus also mentioned, the public sector is very good at providing a backbone to the system, which is trusted, and the private sector can plug into that system in a way that's conducive to competition, in a way that's transparent, and in a way where the private sector can do what it does best, which is the customer oriented activities to unleash its innovative capacity in serving customers well, improving customer experience, and serving the needs to every day users of the financial system.  That will be, I think, a very good benchmark for us to start this discussion. </p><p>There may be a--some scope for CBDCs, and perhaps we can come back to that idea.  But, I think the--I would go back--so, I will sort of finish with my first point, which is it's very important that we distinguish the technology from the architecture.  So, the tech is something that is an instrumental goal.  It's not an end in itself.  And I think it's very much--it--it's incumbent on us to bear that in mind. </p><p>WOLF: Thank you very much, Hyun.  I think the distinction you've drawn is very, very helpful.  And the way you've thought about it presents us with a different perspective.  Let's get back to that very soon.  Simon. </p><p>POTTER: So, I've read your paper four times, and I'm still learning. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Hyun has been fantastic.  His presence in (INAUDIBLE) has really helped central bankers understand some of these issues.  And there are deep issues.  In the wholesale system, which you talked about, the progress of the last 30 years has been massive.  So, Fedwire does payments, securities--that's going to do GDP of the U.S. within a week.  That was your point.  That's $22 trillion.  That--that is an amazing change.  There will be innovation in wholesale markets.  I find it hard to believe that distributed ledgers, except for safety and soundness, will add that much compared to the account based money that we've seen now in the role that central banks have. </p><p>Now, these high value payment systems--there's been a lot of work to make sure, because they are the backbone, that they work under a number of cases.  For example, if there's a terrorist attack, a power outage.  And we understand how to do that well.  That means they've got to be geographically diverse to be able to switch over well. </p><p>There's a different problem.  If there's a cyber-attack on them--this is a really hard problem to deal with.  So, I turned off my phone now.  And suppose the large value payment system is turned off for two hours at most.  Right?  That's what BIS told people.  Can this be turned back on?  And it looks the same to me.  But, instead of it being the Apple operating system, it's an Android one because that's been compromised.  That's a big challenge that we're going to have to deal with over the next few years because we know that these cyber threats are--are--are present.  So, what the world is going to look like might be a lot about how to fight against cyber because we are digital much more than we were before. </p><p>The--cash is not going to be a solution to that, physical cash.  But, in a local sense, it--it certainly can be.  So, if we're all using phones to trade--trade money, better hope the power system is up because, if it's not up, it's going to be a problem.  And one thing I'm pretty sure about, Martin, is in ten years' time, if I go up to any country in the world and I give them this token, most people will know what this token is, for as small a country as they might (INAUDIBLE).  But, it's a $20 bill, if you can't see it.  And this will work reasonably really well because the network effect of the U.S. dollar is going to be very hard to change over time.  The first time people in one of these countries experience their phones not working, they'll want to have a backup of physical currency. </p><p>And the other thing I'd say is I don't see people being able to innovate in any way that's good for society and growth such that taking away cash and having very negative rates will be in (INAUDIBLE) world we live in.  I think mildly negative rates, for certain reasons like Sweden has, you might want to have.  But, the notion of having a minus five percent rate without changing the financial system in a fundamental way, I think, is a pipe dream. </p><p>WOLF: That's very challenging.  And come back to that too.  Stefan. </p><p>INGVES: Thank you.  Last night, when I read my emails, there was one email saying that, \"I'm a CEO in Silicon Valley, and I'm quite deeply involved in planning a pathway for central banks to absorb and use cryptocurrencies.\"  I get these types of emails actually quite--quite often.  So, this happens right now, and it's not theory anymore. </p><p>And that, of course, then raises the question, what is money?  Well, money is actually what's in our heads because money is a convention.  That's what it is.  And it's a convention which can rely on different technologies, using the plural, and that is also exactly the way it's been in the past. </p><p>But, what gets hard for us today when we discuss these things is that everything we have today comes--was created about a hundred or a little more than a hundred years ago, and everything then--back then was based on the assumption that everything is on paper.  Now, we're moving into a world where nothing will be on paper, mostly, and that's when it gets difficult when we start thinking about these structures, thinking about the architecture.  And that's--that's the--that's the hard part. </p><p>Now, part of it is IT technology.  But, the Silicon Valley man is a technology guy.  He talks about this from a technological perspective, which is not really the key to money because you can do this in many different--many different ways because money requires a legal framework.  And parliaments, governments decide what the legal framework is supposed to look like.  You can't really create money out of the blue, even if you tried to, calling it Bitcoin or whatever you like, because it's going to require a legal framework of one form or--or the other.  And that also gets you into the public good aspects of money and what money is good--good for. </p><p>And that takes us into the field of monetary theory, which is actually quite different from monetary policy, which is a completely different topic.  And that means that today, when technology changes, we go through a phase where age old issues resurface.  But, there is almost nothing new under the sun when it comes to money, and most of it has actually been tried and, from time to time, also failed in the past but in a world where technologies were different. </p><p>And I do think that money is too important for the private sector only to deal with, and private initiatives tend to crash sooner or later.  But, having said that, I do think that we on the central banking side have been too complacent, and we certainly have some homework to do.  And I'll get back--get to that during the second--second item.  And that means that it's time to discuss the plumbing.  Most people are not comfortable discussing the plumbing.  Most people just ignore the plumbing until it backs up. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And that's why we have this very, very rare and fascinating seminar and panel here--here today, and I think that that's a good--good--good thing.  Let me give you a few examples dealing with plumbing issues because I'm--I come from the plumbing side when it comes to money.  Today, when it comes to setting up a securities depository system, setting a central clearing organization, or setting up a stock exchange, all of it is IT, and you can buy this stuff off shelf. </p><p>In the future, it will be also possible to buy a monetary system off shelf in terms of the IT parts of it.  And a fairly large number of small countries will actually be forced, more or less, to buy these systems off shelf because they can't produce them themselves.  It's just too hard to do.  And that raises some very fundamental issues like how do we answer the question of, \"Where is my money,\" if the answer is, \"It's in the cloud.\"  What cloud?  Whose cloud? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And that's because IT changes all of this because we are trained to think about money in physical terms, in spatial terms, and in national terms.  And none of that necessarily holds in the future because just--let me give you an example.  We can create the IT system in Country A, we can have the servers located in Country B, and we can actually use the system in Country C.  Now, in that environment, you have to cooperate, you have to standardize, and you have to create trust.  And without these systems, it won't work. </p><p>And what this really means--if you think about money or using the plural monies from a small economy perspective, usually it's about monetary policy, it's about financial stability.  But, we have to add a third aspect to it, which is ease of use.  And you have to have those three at the same time, and that's how you create a product called money, whatever the name of the currency happens to be that produces value--value added. </p><p>And if you mess up on one of them, you'll probably end up with a problem, and people will go and use somebody else's money.  There are probably very large returns to scales when it comes to setting up these systems.  And there is--might be, in the future, an element of the winner takes all or, if not all, a lot.  And that means that nation state will have to make their choices going forward.  But, one thing is for sure: You can't turn back time.  Thanks. </p><p>WOLF: Just let me--since we're discussing what might happen sort of--just got a few minutes to think about that.  And I have two questions.  And you don't all have to respond.  But, I'd like to start with you, Hyun.  I have lots of interest in this idea you--this analogy you have of technology and architecture.  And I was thinking about that, and I was thinking--well, when you're in a building, I'm moderately interested in the architecture.  But, I'm even more interested in the engineering and the building.  It might be beautifully designed.  But, it's not much good if it falls on my head.  Now, we've come to that in a second, in the second part. </p><p>But, there's another question in this world which we might be moving too, which Markus has laid out, in which a large part of what the current monetary system does will shift to completely new players or indeed already has.  What do you think the biggest issues are in managing the stability during this transition which might be long or quick or the existing players who do provide the other services?  And how--how do you think about this--the process by and by banks will lose the payment system?  What would that look like?  And--and what sort of problems might that--just that process create? </p><p>SHIN: So, Martin, these are very big--very big questions.  And, of course, we struggle with this all the time.  Let me address it like this.  Big techs have become very big players in a number of areas.  As I said, they rely on this DNA loop, the data network activities loop, where, as they provide services and social media in ecommerce and in search, that generates a lot of data.  The data is input into a lot of activities.  And that--then that begets more activity with which then generates, you know, even more data. </p><p>And in the annual economic report, we--we saw an example of where, you know, credit assessment becomes--if you then unleash machine learning onto this big data, it just becomes a very different game from the usual credit assessment where you're looking at the balance sheet or the--or the income statement of the borrower because you can actually look at the whole network.  And, as the saying goes, you can judge someone by the character of their friends. </p><p>So, if you look at the whole network, you can actually glean a lot more about the credit worthiness of someone by looking at the transactions that, you know, that particular player does with all the other members.  Now, this does mean that banks, as they--which are still the most important incumbents, will face stiff competition. </p><p>On the other hand, the way that they architecture is evolving is very interesting because, as Governor--as Governor Brainard mentioned, I think the example of China is a very interesting example.  And there what you're seeing is that, although we have these two very large players, who have their own walled garden, as it were, their own network effect, the policy response has been to bring them back into the two tiered system because now they're--they're subject to 100 percent reserve requirements so that they are now plugged into the central bank's balance sheet in a much more secure way than they were before. </p><p>And in some ways, you know, that is--you know, this is coming back to the conventional two tier system even though their business models enable them to--to harness the DNA loop.  So, I think what we're seeing is it's not just a one way street.  I think we are seeing an evolution of the system where--and I think this is a lesson for us where we can aim for a very stable backbone where the public goods are providing publicly.  And public goods can be provided privately as well.  But, I think for the payment system, for the underlying core infrastructure, that's probably best provided publicly by the--you know, by the central bank. </p><p>And then, we allow the full creativity of the private sector with the technology, with the--you know, with the creativity in being able to serve customers to do their stuff. </p><p>WOLF: Thank you very much.  That sort of elucidates some of what you were talking about earlier.  Let's move on, and then, we'll all come back.  I think that's a wonderful opening for you, Stefan, because you're going to--so, we can turn to the question of the appropriate official regulatory and policy response to these developments. </p><p>So, (INAUDIBLE) has presented a rather benign view of happy cooperation between the central banks doing the public good stuff and the private sector doing what it does best, particularly in innovating the payments process in this context.  That's the aspect of money we're mostly focusing on here.  How do you see, from your point of view, the issues and, in that context particularly because we know this is something you're thinking about, the possibility of the provision of central bank, digital money directly to the public? </p><p>INGVES: Well, thank you.  Good question on there because there's--again, as I said, there's nothing new under the sun when it comes to money because one way or the other my institution has made it possible for the public to hold RiksBank money for 350 years.  And now, we're embroiled in a conversation whether one should allow that to disappear because physical money is likely to disappear and that's, at the end of the day, is going to require political judgment.  It's not for central bankers to decide which way that should--should--should--should go. </p><p>But, one way of thinking about this is to say--and--and here I'm--I think I'm--I'm citing (INAUDIBLE) who said same business, same risk, same rules.  That's one way of thinking about it when it comes to these new types of systems that are emerging.  But, let me say a few words about my vision when it comes to where we are heading.  And I'm, of course, talking about this from my own national perspective. </p><p>And I think it's important to keep in mind here that money and payment systems are intertwined.  And that's really, really the key to it.  And so, my vision, when it comes to all of this--and I'm, of course, talking about it from a central bank perspective because my job is to produce Swedish kroner, and my job is to make sure that that's good stuff and that people use it in--in a world where there's a bit of competition. </p><p>So, six bullets that I have in mind.  First, it should be possible to make both large value and retail payments in central bank money in real time, any time, 24/7, all year round.  Second, when it comes to this, it's also important, over time, to make sure that we can make cross currency and cross border payments, at least for low value payments in central bank money in real time and also at any time. </p><p>Third, should be possible--there should be a definition of legal tender that is suited for the digital age.  In our case, digital--legal tender is tied to physical bank notes.  And if bank notes more or less disappear, people don't use them anymore, well then, we don't know what legal tender is anymore, and that becomes an issue that will come back then that we have to deal with. </p><p>Fourth, there should be a digital currency issued by the central bank and that digital currency should be legal tender.  Now, there is a distinction here between wholesale central bank money and retail central bank money.  So, I'm not talking about wholesale because that, we already have and had--have had for a long time.  Sixth issue--fifth issue--sorry.  And this is central, actually to the whole thing.  But, people rarely talk about it.  To make this work in a digital world, it's absolutely crucial for financial inclusion and regulatory purposes to have a government sponsored decided digital identification because, without that, if you can't explain in a digital form who you are, then you can't really run these systems, and you also need this when it comes to know your customer, anti-money laundering, and all the rest of it. </p><p>And then, the sixth issue, which is very, very basic.  And--and--and Simon referred to it already--if the electricity goes out, you still need physical bank notes somewhere in the country, and you need to have a system to distribute them in case you have a problem of--of--of some sort.  Where you hold the cash in between when people don't use cash--that's my job.  And it's nobody else's business to understand where the money is at. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>They only need to understand that it's going to be available.  And it's my job and--to make sure that my--my staff will--will make that happen. </p><p>So, what does this mean?  Well, essentially my vision is listing the same responsibilities that we have today, but in an IT based world where--which is quite--quite different.  But so--in that sense, there's nothing new under the sun, despite the fact that technologies change.  But, everything I said is basically dealing with plumbing issues, but plumbing issues in real time, and that's different compared to what we've had in the past. </p><p>WOLF: Thank you very much.  That's very, very useful and very, very clear.  So, what's the perspective that you have, Simon, from--on the policy issues that this emergence of new digital systems, particularly digital payment systems of enormous scale?  What--what sort of issues does that create for the existing regulators, for the regulators and the challenges they're going to have to revolve? </p><p>POTTER: So, I think you heard today in (INAUDIBLE) speech, one of the concerns is the two tier system we have is very good at doing things central banks aren't good at.  Who--who exactly should get credit?  How do we follow that?  How do we work out how to transfer risk, whether it be locally or across the globe? </p><p>There's no reason banks--the central banks should have any particular skill in that.  I often say to people--I actually know of a central that used to do all of this.  It was the People's Bank of China.  And they decided in the--in the late 70s that that wasn't the best use of the People's Bank of China.  And it seems to have worked out well for them.  They--they do have state run banks.  But, they delegate to them a lot of how to extend credit, how to transfer risk. </p><p>If--if you are going to keep a two tier system and the--you issue a central bank digital currency, whether it's account based or token based, how do you control that from taking away the funding of the traditional system?  You had one version of that.  Let's just think of a version where, of the ten to 11 trillion of deposits in the U.S., the--might move--five--five trillion move.  And the central bank needs to get five trillion on the asset side. </p><p>Does it buy treasuries for that?  If it buys treasuries for that, then the government is going to have to fund someone.  If it loans to banks, then it's going to have to decide, is it happy with that.  The other argument--and I think this is the most critical one is it's unlikely that you would see that much transfer of--of deposits from the private sector to the public sector in normal times. </p><p>We've had postal banks.  Treasury directors is there right now.  You can go and just hold T bills in a direct way.  In a time when you're worried about banks, just at the wrong time, everyone would then take their money out and put it in--into the central bank because that's the individually efficient thing to do, and you shouldn't argue with that.  So, that would make dealing with runs much harder. </p><p>How can you deal with this?  If we're trying to deal with the retail payments, they're not that big.  That was--if--if your slide was there, you could--you can't see them in the--in the U.S. one.  So, you can easily limit the size of--of the account, whether they be token based or account based.  You can have a stable coin or outsource how--how those are run.  The central bank doesn't have to do that.  But, the government does have to regulate them, and it needs to regulate them in some distinct ways. </p><p>The first one is to make sure--and this is not a feature of the current system--that people who are underbanked or unbanked don't get ripped off as much as they do right now with the ATM fees and other things.  That seems pretty easy, and it's low hanging fruit in the U.S.  But, your--Sweden doesn't have that.  It's a much more efficient system.  That seems like a pressing need to fix that in the near term. </p><p>The other one is the data that is being used.  It should be the case that the people are going to use their data pay you for using that data.  And the more that you can construct a system where there's some regulation around that, the better off you'll be.  The one thing you probably want to make clear when you're doing this--and this goes back to my last point--is this is not an attempt to get deeply negative nominal rates.  You're not trying to get to a point you can do that.  That would be--it would destabilize the financial system in the transition. </p><p>WOLF: Yes, your turn. </p><p>SHIN: Just--I mean, just a following up on--on Stefan's six points--I think his fifth one, which was on the importance of a system of digital IT, I think this really, really crucial.  I think--I've described how, in many countries, retail payments using technology is incredibly seamless and--and very easy.  But, cross border payment still is the bottleneck.  And I think this is where we have a lot more work to do.  Partly, the impediments are technological.  And this is where the limits of the account based money come in because typically, if you try and make a cross border payment using account based money, you have to go through several intermediaries.  And the reason is you need an intermediary where both the receiver and the sender have to have deposits so that you can transfer the--the deposits from the payer to the--to the receiver. </p><p>But, more important, they know your customer--know your customer checks where--they can be very onerous.  They can be very time consuming.  And, you know, we come across these figures all the time.  The World Bank has done a study where, if you make a $200 payment, you're spending $14 just as a fee typically.  I think this is one area where, from a financial inclusion perspective, we--we really need to make progress.  I think having a digital ID system where--which allows the payment systems across countries to talk to each other is going to be a very, very important first step.  As for that-- </p><p>POTTER: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>SHIN: No, not a--not a global ID, but at least having the--the--opening up the possibility where the--where payment systems of two different jurisdictions can actually make the (INAUDIBLE) process much more seamless.  And--and I think if we can address this issue, many of the--the arguments one hears for why stable coins--global stable coins are going to be--are, in fact, necessary, are, in fact, going to improve customer experience, I think, will be, you know, much less strong. </p><p>But, this is one area where we have to acknowledge, as policymakers, that the progress has been least satisfactory. </p><p>INGVES: I'll add a couple things to do.  And--and where it gets hard when we're talking about where to draw the line between--between the central bank and--and--and the private sector is we are so accustomed to having central banks.  So, what you really need to think through is what would the system look without a central bank completely?  And that takes you back to the 1800s, in the U.S., for example, and all the issues people worked through back in--back in those days.  And I'm not talking about using somebody else's currency, somebody else's central bank.  I'm talking about the intellectual bank when you think through no central bank at all, none, anywhere--anywhere in the world and what you--what you get. </p><p>And then, usually, people would come up with the conclusion that we need a central bank.  So then, you would reinvent the central bank. </p><p>POTTER: Regulation, you definitely need. </p><p>INGVES: Yeah. </p><p>WOLF: Sorry.  What was that? </p><p>POTTER: Regulation (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>INGVES: One--one issue that-- </p><p>WOLF: --You couldn't--without a central bank, you couldn't have our financial system.  So, the--you'd really be starting from scratch-- </p><p>INGVES: --But, let me add one issue that--referring to Hume's reflection, when it comes to cross border payments and why this is a relevant issue as of--as of today.  We're presently talking to the ECB about using their real time low value gross settlement system that runs 24/7 for euros.  But, starting in 2021, if we can come to an agreement with the ECB, we can use the system for Swedish kroner. </p><p>And what that means that we have two currencies running real time.  You probably don't have to be Einstein's brother to fix--figure out how to do the switch.  And given that we're actually talking about the same computer system and the same servers--and that means that if we can solve that in harmony among--within the central bank community, then I just can't see what the value added of Libra would be in that environment.  But, anyway, that's my view.  It's a competitive business. </p><p>WOLF: It's very important for you that this be closed soon because we started very, very late. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So--and I was proposing to allow them to talk a little bit longer.  But, if you want to close it, I will do so. </p><p>POSEN: Sorry for the--sorry for the logistical interruption.  Point one, if people are content to let the geniuses talk longer, I think you will get value out of it. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I will put a hard deadline at 5:45 because we want people to have a chance to eat and drink.  Second, I thank Martin for stepping in.  I apologize for not having made the seamless transition to Martin.  I was coughing, and I didn't want to distract.  So, I stepped out.  Third, whenever this is done, Markus gets the last word. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>WOLF: You have described perfectly how we intend to proceed.  So, it's what we're going to do.  At this stage, I have many, many further questions, huge number.  But, I--in the next say, ten, 15 minutes, let's have some questions.  And then, we'll allow Markus--I'm going allow each of them to have another 30 seconds or so to summarize the single most important thing you should take away from what they said, and then, we'll have Markus.  So, any questions?  Please--the same rules apply.  Say who you are and stand up.  You will be (INAUDIBLE) will be the next one. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you.  This has been a fantastic panel. Thank you very much.  I've learned a lot.  So, I raised this question to--oh, sorry.  I'm (INAUDIBLE) from the IMF.  So, I've asked this question to Markus earlier at lunchtime.  So, I'm going to ask the same question to the other panelists.  So, in a way, I very much agree with Markus that the unit of account is probably the most important function of money, and, of course, that's what central banks care most about. </p><p>So, why do you think that Libra, as it's proposed, has a different unit of account?  Might it have been much easier if they had proposed a Libra that's backed only to the U.S. dollar?  So, what is the reason?  So, do we have to worry about that platform monies, even if it's not Libra--similar concepts might survive.  Why do they have an incentive to have a different unit of account?  Thank you. </p><p>WOLF: The way I'm going to do this--my normal way--we're not going to--you're not going to answer these questions.  They're going to take three--two or three.  Then, I will decide which of them are going to be asked and in which order. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>This is--this is not a democracy. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Patrick, yes please. </p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) Peterson Institute.  My question about Libra really--and the excitement that this has generated--so, what--why do we think Libra is--you know, could--could be big very quickly?  It's because, I suppose--because they have a large number of affiliates at the moment, you know, members, who trust the brand, and it's credible that this big company can work out (INAUDIBLE) credible payments technology.  So, that explains why they might get a huge portion of the retail payment system. </p><p>But, it's not clear to me why this should attract in any short term scale a large portion of the wholesale payment system or any large scale at all of the store of value and why they should be able to compete with, you know, BlackRock, Vanguard, et cetera, et cetera.  Am I completely wrong about that?  I'm not saying that in 50 years' time it'll be all big tech companies.  But, this particular (INAUDIBLE) seems smaller than the amount of reaction that we're getting from--about it. </p><p>WOLF: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you.  I'm with Bloomberg News.  Can I ask for your broad take on China's push to credits on digital currency, the central bank digital currency?  The design of it certainly differs a lot from what it--what we talked about today, the digital currency for general purpose.  What's your view on their approach, and what would be the implication on either Alipay or WeChat or other monetary authorities overseas trying to look at a similar topic?  Thank you. </p><p>WOLF: So, there are two questions--and we can bring them together--about Libra.  What on earth where they thinking, I think, is the first one, and why.  I'd review, but I'm not a panelist.  And surely there are inherent limits on what it can achieve, particularly beyond the retail system, which I think is a very important point about these platforms.  And in Facebook case, it's not a trusted transaction platform anyway.  So, it would seem to sort of make sense for Amazon because it is a trusted transactions platform.  My own humble view--and I'm on the record--is that anyone who trusts Facebook for anything is a deluded fool. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But, the--anyway, anyone wants to talk specifically about the Libra idea because it's obviously a big issue.  Hyun, are you prepared to say something about it? </p><p>SHIN: Well, to Patrick's question, I alluded earlier to the--to the limits of a cash in advance system for--for wholesale payments.  If you have to top up your--your wallet before you make the payment and you cannot be overdrawn, given the kind of sums we are talking about in the wholesale payment system where you are actually paying the annual GDP in one week, it's not going to be, you know, very--in an efficient way to run the wholesale payment system. </p><p>On the store of value, it's also very interesting just to look at the magnitude for--for Alipay and WeChat pay as well because although they're very important players in the payment system, if you look at their balances, including the money market funds, if you add up the whole of the assets of the--of the payment float together with the money market fund, we only get to about two percent of the total deposits in the banking system in China. </p><p>So, it is a very, very small part of--of the overall financial assets.  So, I think we have to, you know, keep these things in perspective.  I think the--the interest that Libra has generated--I think it's--it goes back to what I'm referring to earlier, which is the idea that you can use the--the installed network base and then exploit that in the payment--in the provision of payment services and the possibility that you could get a walled garden, which is separate from the public backbone.  And I think that's--I think the--I think some of the background to--to the misgivings that some people express. </p><p>WOLF: (INAUDIBLE) do you want to add anything on Libra? </p><p>POTTER: So, I think it's pretty obvious why they wanted a basket given the 2.7 billion people on--all located in this country.  On the other hand, it'd be much easier to tell people it's backed by reserves held at the Federal Reserve.  That would make everyone realize it was actually stable in value.  It gets very hard to explain to people, when it's a basket, that it's stable.  But, you--you don't know whether it's really stable.  People would do a lot of transactions in--in dollars.  That shows you that the politics of this are quite difficult. </p><p>Private actors aren't necessarily perfect at trying to deal with this.  In terms of China, I don't know what the details are there.  I will say that (INAUDIBLE) is an interesting entity there where they use some of this data.  And they expend credit in a very quick way without ever having met people.  They do use a lot of data to extend that credit, and it's not obvious in other countries we'd feel so happy with that.  It's a very interesting way. </p><p>And just to go back to Martin's point, we shouldn't knock Facebook too much here.  There could be tremendous value.  It might not be measured in GDP.  But, there could be some value here of how to connect people that we are missing.  And I--I think you were trying to indicate that in the paper you wrote, that these platforms have told us quite a bit about what--what people value.  It might not be measured in GDP.  But, it could be something that has a lot of social value. </p><p>WOLF: (INAUDIBLE) point very quickly.  I think this cross border aspect of Libra is, if it works, the core unique selling point, and it's a big deal.  That comes out (INAUDIBLE) because cross border payments is an unspeakable mess, particularly for small transactors. </p><p>The second point is I did see the (INAUDIBLE) in some length in March talk about this.  And they very much underlined what Hyun said, that really and truly, if you looked at what the big payment platforms do in monetary terms in China and even in payments, they're not doing all the corporate payments and all the rest of it.  It's very much smaller than the numbers sometimes suggest. </p><p>Finally, Stefan, do you have anything to say on the PBOC (PH)? </p><p>INGVES: Well, it's--I mean, it's too early to tell.  I know I certainly don't know what they're going to come up with and what they're going to do.  But, there's one--one aspect to all of this, which is, again, repeating there's nothing new under the sun.  My understanding is that for these new systems, they're now imposing a 100 percent reserve requirement.  And that's exactly the conversation that we had in the late 1800s in my country, when the banks were issuing physical money and the central bank was issuing physical central bank money. </p><p>And then, there was also a very harsh reserve requirement imposed on the banks, and that ensured that you had an exchange rate one to one between central bank and private bank money.  And without that, the system simply would not--would not have worked.  And this is why I think they have come up with this conclusion.  And--and that's the way it's going to be run presently because that's where you really have to decide whether you want to have a--a sort of (INAUDIBLE) or an exchange rate, which is easy to understand, one to one, in the system. </p><p>And if that goes out the window, then everybody will revert--revert back to central bank money in one form or the other. </p><p>WOLF: We're going to take one or possibly two more questions if they're really quick.  So, this is your first--please say who you are and very, very quick question. </p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) from East High (PH) Media Group.  Very quickly--if we think private investors or state (INAUDIBLE) money like Libra is very dangerous, should we have a global central banking issued kind of (INAUDIBLE) issued kind of ESDR?  It will be safer, or will ESDR dominate the global monetary system if the SDR failed to do that?  And very quickly, for Hyun, you have-- </p><p>WOLF: --I'm sorry.  We're going to have to do one question-- </p><p>QUESTION: --Oh, thank you. </p><p>WOLF: I'm sorry because I'm going to be killed if I let it go on. </p><p>QUESTION: It's okay. </p><p>WOLF: (INAUDIBLE) and that'll be the last one.  Really sorry.  But, you (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>QUESTION: Very simple--a very simple question.  Six years ago, American Express introduced a credit card.  So, it was substituting cash.  It was substituting checks.  It was a way to provide credit, and it provided massive information (INAUDIBLE) credit card and nothing changed.  So, what is different this time. </p><p>WOLF: Okay.  Who wants to talk about central bank (INAUDIBLE) and ESDR.  Could it do substantially better than the original SDR has in being a successful reserve asset, in this case (INAUDIBLE) to successful money?  Simon, you're shaking your head.  So (OFF-MIC). </p><p>POTTER: The dollar works really well, and the network effects are massive.  And you're not going to get people to coordinate in any real time on this.  There are issues to how dominant the dollar is.  That's why (INAUDIBLE) gave the speech he gave at Jackson Hole.  But, he kept on saying, you've got to play the cards you have.  And the notion that this is going to change over the next five years--it's not going to happen.  The dollar is actually growing in importance. </p><p>And the fact--we talked a lot about Facebook Libra.  If you look over the last few weeks, I don't think people's view of the success of that has gone up.  I think it's gone close to zero. </p><p>WOLF: Hyun and Stefan, last--Hyun, it's essentially asking the question, is it really different this time?  And in fact, Markus started this with his discussion of--the money debate was--what--20 years ago?  I can't remember the exact figures.  So, we've had credit cards.  We've had payment cards.  It hasn't really changed anything.  Are we getting much too excited about what a change of technology when it really is not going to change the core architecture?  Markus is putting forward the argument that his coauthors--that it really could change the core architecture.  So, from your perceptions, you two, what do you think, very quickly?  Is it--how different is it this time? </p><p>SHIN: I think the short answer is it remains to be seen. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Because it--I think--it's the only answer because I think it's too early to tell.  There is a lot of excitement about the technology.  But, take even the simple example of decentralized consensus and distributed ledger technology.  That is--so, the technology and the cryptographic way of keeping track of who pays who has been advanced.  But, it remains to be seen how widely that's going to be adopted and--and will make an impact. </p><p>And the initial indications are that it is a very exciting idea.  It goes back to some of the roots of monetary economics, that we have a huge ledger that says who pay who and we can keep tabs rather than having pieces of paper or gold coins.  But--and there's no doubt that technology has enabled us to realize some of these theoretical ideas in practice. </p><p>However, the returns that we've seen so far have been rather meager.  And we'll need to see how far the technology is going to drive the function.  I think this is--I would go back to my very first point.  The technology is an enabler.  It's not the end. </p><p>WOLF: And very briefly. </p><p>INGVES: If central banks adapt and start using new technologies themselves, then central banks will continue to be around for a long, long time to come.  Had we stuck to 45 pound copper coins from the 1600s to today, we probably would not have existed. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>WOLF: That's a nice answer.  So, Markus--and a few minutes of reaction to what you've heard.  But, really make it really brief. </p><p>BRUNNERMEIER: Let me first thank all of you for a great panel and also to the audience for being here until the end.  Let me make a few comments, which I collected, to these different views.  I think one thing which is striking that the age old issues resurface.  And I agree--and it's an exciting time that you can restudy, essentially, old monetary theory. </p><p>But, I think there is one difference, and Simon pointed to it as well.  I think it's connection to platforms and the data connection.  I think it's way more pronounced this time, and I think that's the new element, combined with the token, which really makes this evolution, I think, different.  It's also getting in terms of speed--whenever there's a financial crisis, too much, much faster development. </p><p>The other difference I see is that the danger of dollarization or digital dollarization is probably much more pronounced compared to credit cards.  I don't see that, you know--a credit card is still in your national currency.  It's not--I don't see that suddenly a foreign denominated credit card is taking over this country. </p><p>I don't think it's an issue for the U.S. because the dollar is very dominant and all this.  But, for smaller countries, very open countries, that's, I think, a large--larger issue.  With regard to retail transactions, I agree the retail is small.  But, it might be the most lucrative way.  So, the spreads, you know, you can do on the retail side, you can probably make a lot of money.  That's probably what--not (INAUDIBLE) Facebook and others are looking at so you can have a lot of deposits. And going back to the Starbucks example, they don't get any interest on this money they are lending to Starbucks.  And that's very lucrative, and Facebook probably sees there will be perhaps a billion dollars or some billion dollars you can borrow for free in a high interest environment, a high inflation environment.  That's very, very lucrative.  You won't get this from professional investors because a lot of those financial transactions might be (INAUDIBLE) to a large extent (INAUDIBLE) shows up in this--in these wholesale transactions. </p><p>So, that's why I wouldn't downplay the retail side too much.  I agree the financial inclusion is the big component.  I think that's one--I don't see it with Libra (INAUDIBLE) doing a huge financial inclusion.  But, I think that should be the argument we should put forward. </p><p>I see a big disagreement on the panel with regard to CBDC.  I think Stefan is very in favor of it, and that's--Sweden is going forward with it.  Simon is very against it or that's-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>POTTER: --In some sizes (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>BRUNNERMEIER: --In small size, it's okay.  So, there is a big debate still ongoing.  I don't think we ever solved that.  And finally, I would like to come back--what Martin mentioned in the beginning.  It might be a better way, the whole evolution (INAUDIBLE) might actually lead to a much more efficient system, especially more financial inclusions.  But, we don't know yet how it will look like.  But, even transition is actually very difficult, very risky, and it might take a century and (INAUDIBLE) financial crisis and a great depression to get it--get there.  So, it might be very risky. </p><p>So, coming back to (INAUDIBLE) presentation, why should the U.S. do it?  Why should we risk the whole global financial system with the dollar?  Let's just do it with a small country and hope that Stefan is offering Sweden to be the experimenter. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And I think (INAUDIBLE) we should offer some backup (INAUDIBLE) policy to what Sweden--because we all learn--the whole world will learn from the Swedish experiment or perhaps Israel or some other country, which is very much (INAUDIBLE) driven can move ahead.  And I--I hope that, for human beings and for the innovation itself, that some countries move ahead with some guarantees from other countries to do that.  And we will see how these things will play out. </p><p>WOLF: Okay.  I'm getting queued.  But, I'd just like to end up with--I think somebody mentioned (INAUDIBLE) view on economic processes and the crisis when it happens is quicker than you ever imagined.  My memory now (INAUDIBLE) this about 20 years ago.  And I think it was Bill Gates.  But, it might have been somebody else made essentially the same point about technology.  This was the beginning of the dotcom bubble and all the rest of it. </p><p>And the argument was essentially fundamentally new technologies change the world much more slowly than most people originally expect.  But, in the end, they change it completely.  And I have a pretty strong suspicion that, in this case--though, I wish it weren't the case or, in some ways, I don't--that this is going to be an example, that this is the case.  So, it won't be a completely different financial world five years from now, but 20 years from now, I suspect it will be.  And so, we should prepare for that.  I think it's been a wonderful panel.

It's an actor playing <person><nameText>Peter Thiel. </nameText></person>Thiel was Facebook's first outside investor. He also co-founded PayPal and Palantir Technologies. And through his venture capital firm Founders Fund, he's invested in a number of big-tech companies. He's written a book with Blake Masters. It's called \"Zero To One: Notes On Startups, Or How To Build The Future.\" Welcome, Peter. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>PETER THIEL</nameText></person>:  Thanks for having me on the show. </p><p>WADE GOODWYN:  It's our pleasure. Your first piece of advice seemed to me to be your most important, and that is that Facebook and Microsoft and Google have already been created. So what these guys did in creating those success stories is not your roadmap. Your roadmap will be your roadmap. </p><p><person><nameText>PETER THIEL</nameText></person>:  Yes. I believe that every moment in the history of business only happens once. And so the next Bill Gates will not be building an operating system company. The next Larry Page will not be building a search engine. The next <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>won't be building a social network. And so if you're trying to copy these guys, in some sense you're not really learning from them. And one of the challenges is teaching entrepreneurship or writing about it is that there's no cookie-cutter formula that you can follow. </p><p>WADE GOODWYN:  So if you can't really give them a roadmap, and you say to them, you know, in order to be a success, you have to be original. How do you help students or would-be entrepreneurs? </p><p><person><nameText>PETER THIEL</nameText></person>:  There is still a surprising amount one can say. There's sort of an interview question I like to ask people which is tell me something that is true that very few people agree with you on. The business version of this question is what great business is nobody building? And these questions turn out to be quite hard to answer for two somewhat different reasons. One of them is it's always hard to come up with new truths that people have not yet understood. Secondly, it also requires a bit of courage because you often have to go against social convention in pursuing certain lines of business. People discourage you from doing things that are strange and new. </p><p>WADE GOODWYN:  I think it's a capitalist truism that competition breeds efficiency and innovation. But you believe monopolies are actually better. Talk about that. </p><p><person><nameText>PETER THIEL</nameText></person>:  Well, I think people always say that capitalism and competition are synonyms. But I think they're really antonyms. If we look at the restaurant industry, it's a very competitive industry. But it's very, very hard to make money opening a restaurant because all the profits are competed away, whereas a company like Google has not had any real competition in search since 2002 when it definitively distanced itself from Yahoo and Microsoft, and is therefore a very profitable business. You can debate how much monopoly should be regulated or when is it a good monopoly that's inventing something new and is dynamic? When it is a bad monopoly that becomes more like a rent collector? But I do think the great fortunes are always made in these monopoly-like businesses. </p><p>WADE GOODWYN:  Your book is entitled \"Zero To One.\" What does that mean? </p><p><person><nameText>PETER THIEL</nameText></person>:  The basic idea is if you sort of think about innovations where there's someone who builds a first airplane or first home computer or first smartphone that works like the Apple iPhone, these are what I call zero to one innovations. And I think technology involves intensive, vertical, zero to one progress. Globalization involves horizontal, copying, one to end progress. And we'll need both of these in the 21st century. China is sort of the epitome of globalization. What China does is copy things that work. And it has a very straightforward 20-year plan which is to make itself look more like the U.S. and Western Europe. For the developed world - Japan, Western Europe, the United States - progress is a much trickier thing in 21st-century because to take our civilization to the next level, we need to actually do new things. And so I think the question of how do we develop the developed world is a question that's not often asked but is worth for us to look about a lot more. </p><p>WADE GOODWYN:  You've been publicly skeptical of the value of college. What's not happening there you think should be? </p><p><person><nameText>PETER THIEL</nameText></person>:  Well, if I had to do it over again, I probably would still go to college, but I would think a lot harder about why I went. I think we have often let education become a substitute for thinking about the future. And it's become much more problematic for the younger generation which is amassing enormous amount of student debt. I believe that there is no one-size-fits-all trajectory, and that there is something a little bit unhealthy about the sort of society that says you go to Yale or you go to jail. We need to create a much more diverse array of alternatives. I think the sort of narrowly-tracked system we have is working less and less well. </p><p>WADE GOODWYN:  Are you optimistic or pessimistic about this country's technological future? </p><p><person><nameText>PETER THIEL</nameText></person>:  Well, I've articulated the view that there has been a lot of progress in the world of bits and not so much in the world of atoms. So there's been a lot of progress in computers, not as much in some other areas such as say energy or transportation or even biomedical. And so the hope is that we can re-accelerate progress so that technology's not just synonymous with computers. I never like to frame things, however, in terms of extreme optimism or extreme pessimism because they both end up being reasons not to do anything. If you're extremely optimistic, then the future will take care of itself. If you're extremely pessimistic, then there's nothing they can do. And so they both are mindsets that I think lead to inaction. And so I think the healthier mindset is always somewhere in between - to say that there's some good things and some bad things, and we have to figure out what are the meaningful things we can do in our time. </p><p>WADE GOODWYN:  <person><nameText>Peter Thiel </nameText></person>is the author of \"Zero To One.\" Peter, good talking to you. </p><p><person><nameText>PETER THIEL</nameText></person>:  Thanks for having me. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRWES-201409131205</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRWES2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D4G-FBN1-DY2S-N3R8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1096\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Weekend Edition Saturday</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>September 13, 2014 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DJLY</classCode><className>SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N523910MM</classCode><className>VENTURE CAPITAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N523910MM</classCode><className>VENTURE CAPITAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX000355</classCode><className>COMPUTER OPERATING SYSTEMS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>PE000DHR7</classCode><className>PETER THIEL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>PE000C5PB</classCode><className>MARK ZUCKERBERG</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>PE0009WZX</classCode><className>LARRY PAGE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>PE0009VZ7</classCode><className>BILL GATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

An unpredictable America is no longer committed to advancing a rules-based, liberal world order. China is growing increasingly assertive under President Xi Jinping, while Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is flexing his muscles around the Gulf. The risk of a conflagration on the Korean Peninsula is all too real. Business is grappling with self-inflicted scandals and activist attacks, and a backlash is building against Big Tech\u2019s overweening power.\u201d</p><p>With that as the backdrop, here are a few of Breakingviews\u2019 predictions for 2018:</p><p>In investing</p><p> \u201cFor the first time in years, rich-world bond issuance will outstrip buying by the Fed and friends,\u201d and \u201cbond vigilantes will rise from the dead.\u201d</p><p> \u201cPassive funds will, despite their name, dethrone a chief executive.\u201d</p><p>In tech</p><p> \u201cIn tech, investors can consider a tasty new dish: SLAW, for Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb and WeWork, four prospective candidates for public life.\u201d</p><p>Apple\u2019s position as a privacy-sensitive hardware specialist will give it some shelter from mounting anger at Silicon Valley\u2019s power and lack of accountability.</p><p>\u2014 Stephen Grocer</p><p>Dreaming of an Amazon-Target deal.</p><p>We\u2019re just two days into 2018, and we already have a huge M.&amp;A. prediction, courtesy of the analyst Gene Munster.</p><p>From <url normalizedValue=\"http://loupventures.com/8-tech-predications-for-2018/\">his note yesterday</url>:</p><p>Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy. Amazon believes the future of retail is a mix of mostly online and some offline. Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count.</p><p>It\u2019s a big, if logical, assumption given the ever-expanding empire that Amazon has been assembling \u2014 one that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/22/business/amazon-stocks.html?dlbk\">has put more and more industry incumbents</url> on their back heels.</p><p>Target shares were up nearly 4 percent as of this afternoon.</p><p>Could Amazon afford Target?</p><p>Short answer: Yes.</p><p>Long answer: Yes, but it\u2019d be pretty expensive. Target\u2019s market capitalization as of Tuesday morning was nearly $37 billion. Amazon had about $24.3 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, meaning that the company would have to borrow a hefty amount.</p><p>Assuming a 20 percent takeover premium, Target would be almost $40 billion.</p><p>Amazon could pay in stock as well as cash, but it hasn\u2019t struck a big deal using stock since its takeover of Zappos in 2009. And stock remains an expensive form of currency, though that hasn\u2019t stopped the likes of Disney from stock deals.</p><p>(Mr. Munster asserts that a deal is affordable because the cost of a Target acquisition is just 8 percent of Amazon\u2019s market cap. Obviously, I think it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that.)</p><p>The big caveat (other than price)</p><p>Obviously, it\u2019s antitrust. Mr. Munster notes that a combined Amazon-Target would only have about a 13 percent share of the overall American retail market, compared to Walmart\u2019s 23 percent.</p><p>But it\u2019s hard to determine at the moment what the Trump administration\u2019s yardstick for market concentration is:</p><p>AT&amp;T and Time Warner say that their proposed deal is a vertical deal that falls within the bounds of acceptable deals. The Justice Department <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/business/dealbook/att-time-warner-merger.html?dlbk\">has sued to block that</url>.</p><p>Disney and Fox have announced a deal that would inevitably lead to lots of layoffs. President Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/business/dealbook/disney-fox-takeover.html?dlbk\">has praised that transaction</url> as potentially \u201cgreat for jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs for antitrust, the Trump administration won\u2019t do any favors for Jeff Bezos, but the market share numbers suggest the deal will be approved,\u201d Mr. Munster writes. That\u2019s a potentially big assumption.</p><p>\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced</p><p>Are Amazon and Salesforce moving away from Oracle?</p><p>Kevin McLaughlin of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theinformation.com/in-major-shift-amazon-salesforce-move-away-from-oracle\">The Information reports</url> that the two companies \u201care actively working to replace Oracle software running on critical business systems with open-source database software alternatives, and have made significant progress toward getting off Oracle entirely,\u201d citing people familiar with the matter.</p><p>\u201cA mass exodus from the Oracle database isn\u2019t likely anytime soon. Yet losing Amazon and Salesforce as customers could pose major problems for Oracle, as it could provide a road map for other large companies that also are looking to cut costs by jettisoning Oracle database software in favor of open-source database alternatives.\u201d</p><p>Oracle\u2019s shares are down nearly 2 percent. They had been trading about 1 percent higher before the report.</p><p>\u2014 Stephen Grocer</p><p>Where are stocks heading in 2018?</p><p>The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 25 percent in 2017.

Here's the sign-up.</p><p><person><nameText>Peter Thiel </nameText></person>is betting big on Bitcoin.</p><p>  The value of the digital currency leapt about $1,000 this afternoon. Why? Turns out that the venture capitalist and his firm are believers.</p><p>  From Rob Copeland of the WSJ:</p><p>Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm co-founded by <person><nameText>Peter Thiel, </nameText></person>has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the volatile cryptocurrency, people familiar with the matter said. The bet has been spread across several of the firm's most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments.</p><p>  As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $14,655.</p><p>  Why buy Bitcoin? Founders Fund is, after all, a venture firm rather than a hedge fund. But the firm apparently believes that start-up valuations currently are sky-high, while digital currencies will continue to climb in worth.</p><p>  Has Founders Fund made money? The WSJ reports, citing its unnamed sources, that the firm bought about $15 million in Bitcoin and that its stake is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>  -- Michael J. de la Merced</p><p>   So much for Jack Ma's charm offensive.</p><p>  So much for Jack Ma's charm offensive.</p><p>United States officials have effectively killed Ant Financial's $1.2 billion bid to buy MoneyGram.</p><p>  Ant Financial, the electronic payments company controlled by Mr. Ma, became the latest Chinese firm to have its acquisition of an American company fall apart because it was unable to secure approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius.</p><p>  The deal failed despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese internet. Shortly after <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>won the 2016 election, Mr. Ma famously stood with the president-elect in Trump Tower in New York City and pledged that his e-commerce empire would help create one million American jobs.</p><p>  The attempted purchase of MoneyGram was seen as a test of the <person><nameText>Trump administration's </nameText></person>political and regulatory approach to China, and the deal's failure could spell trouble for other Chinese companies considering major acquisitions.</p><p>  The strong flow of Chinese money into the United States has prompted growing worries. Lawmakers from both parties have introduced legislation calling for greater scrutiny of Chinese investments in the United States. They are pushing for a significant expansion of Cfius, a multiagency panel that reviews foreign deals for potential threats to national security.</p><p>  Of the deal, Richard Beales of Breakingviews writes:</p><p>  ''It would have been seen as something of a watershed for a successful upstart from the People's Republic to get its hands on a piece of Uncle Sam's payments infrastructure.</p><p>  ''For Trump and China critics in his administration, that may have been the wrong message, especially when a similar deal in the other direction would surely come up against Beijing's tight restrictions on foreign ownership in China's financial system. Rather than opening the door -- arguably the old American way of showing how things ought to be done -- CFIUS this time kept it closed. If it's a rebuke, it's one that's conveniently unlikely to provoke great resentment.''</p><p>  MoneyGram's shares are down 6.8 percent after the close.</p><p>  Tech's 2017 rally spilled over into the New Year</p><p>  The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 percent Tuesday to close above 7,000 for the first time.</p><p>  The gain was driven by Netflix, Facebook, Google-parent Alphabet and Apple, which jumped between 18 percent and 4.8 percent.</p><p>  Tuesday's rally follows a 28 percent gain for the Nasdaq last year. That beat the 25 percent gain for the Dow Jones industrial average and the 19 percent rise for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.</p><p>  So how stretched are valuations for the Nasdaq? As of Friday, the index was trading at 27.55 times the last 12 months of earnings, well above the S.&amp;P. 500\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2s level of 18.27 times earnings, according to the WSJ's Ben Eisen. But the Nasdaq's current price-to-earnings ratio remains well below 72.2, which it hit in March 2000.</p><p>  Extra Credit: Yes, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.com drove the Nasdaq's run to 7,000. But Riot Blockchain saw the biggest percentage gain between the Nasdaq's first close above 6,000 in April to its close above 7,000 on Tuesday, writes the WSJ's Chelsey Dulaney. Shares of Riot ''surged more than 640 percent during that period, with the bulk of those gains coming after the company switched its focus to investing in blockchain technology October.''</p><p>  Our thoughts exactly.</p><p>  Shot: Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, won't run for re-election, according to the NYT. That gives Mitt Romney -- former presidential candidate, former Massachusetts governor, former private equity mogul, current (and increasingly frequent) Trump critic -- a chance to run for the seat.</p><p>  Chaser:</p><p>  -- Michael J. de la Merced</p><p>  Expect a ''frothy'' and ''frustrated'' 2018.</p><p>  Money is cheap, the global economy is gaining momentum and markets are at records. ''Yet things look less reassuring close up,'' writes Quentin Webb of Breakingviews.</p><p>  ''The populist anger that enabled Trump and Brexit is still simmering, fueled by inequality, disruption, immigration and the echo chambers of social media. An unpredictable America is no longer committed to advancing a rules-based, liberal world order. China is growing increasingly assertive under President Xi Jinping, while Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is flexing his muscles around the Gulf. The risk of a conflagration on the Korean Peninsula is all too real. Business is grappling with self-inflicted scandals and activist attacks, and a backlash is building against Big Tech's overweening power.''</p><p>  With that as the backdrop, here are a few of Breakingviews' predictions for 2018:</p><p>  In investing</p><p>   ''For the first time in years, rich-world bond issuance will outstrip buying by the Fed and friends,'' and ''bond vigilantes will rise from the dead.''</p><p>   ''Passive funds will, despite their name, dethrone a chief executive.''</p><p>  In tech</p><p>   ''In tech, investors can consider a tasty new dish: SLAW, for Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb and WeWork, four prospective candidates for public life.''</p><p>Apple's position as a privacy-sensitive hardware specialist will give it some shelter from mounting anger at Silicon Valley's power and lack of accountability.</p><p>  -- Stephen Grocer</p><p>  Dreaming of an Amazon-Target deal.</p><p>  We're just two days into 2018, and we already have a huge M.&amp;A. prediction, courtesy of the analyst Gene Munster.</p><p>  From his note yesterday:</p><p>  Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy. Amazon believes the future of retail is a mix of mostly online and some offline. Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count.</p><p>  It's a big, if logical, assumption given the ever-expanding empire that Amazon has been assembling -- one that has put more and more industry incumbents on their back heels.</p><p>  Target shares were up nearly 4 percent as of this afternoon.</p><p>  Could Amazon afford Target?</p><p>  Short answer: Yes.</p><p>  Long answer: Yes, but it'd be pretty expensive. Target's market capitalization as of Tuesday morning was nearly $37 billion. Amazon had about $24.3 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, meaning that the company would have to borrow a hefty amount.</p><p>  Assuming a 20 percent takeover premium, Target would be almost $40 billion.</p><p>Amazon could pay in stock as well as cash, but it hasn't struck a big deal using stock since its takeover of Zappos in 2009. And stock remains an expensive form of currency, though that hasn't stopped the likes of Disney from stock deals.</p><p>  (Mr. Munster asserts that a deal is affordable because the cost of a Target acquisition is just 8 percent of Amazon's market cap. Obviously, I think it's a bit more complicated than that.)</p><p>  The big caveat (other than price)</p><p>  Obviously, it's antitrust. Mr. Munster notes that a combined Amazon-Target would only have about a 13 percent share of the overall American retail market, compared to Walmart's 23 percent.</p><p>  But it's hard to determine at the moment what the <person><nameText>Trump administration's </nameText></person>yardstick for market concentration is:</p><p>AT&amp;T and Time Warner say that their proposed deal is a vertical deal that falls within the bounds of acceptable deals. The Justice Department has sued to block that.</p><p>Disney and Fox have announced a deal that would inevitably lead to lots of layoffs. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has praised that transaction as potentially ''great for jobs.''</p><p>  ''As for antitrust, the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>won't do any favors for Jeff Bezos, but the market share numbers suggest the deal will be approved,'' Mr. Munster writes. That's a potentially big assumption.</p><p>  -- Michael J. de la Merced</p><p>  Are Amazon and Salesforce moving away from Oracle?</p><p>  Kevin McLaughlin of The Information reports that the two companies ''are actively working to replace Oracle software running on critical business systems with open-source database software alternatives, and have made significant progress toward getting off Oracle entirely,'' citing people familiar with the matter.</p><p>  ''A mass exodus from the Oracle database isn't likely anytime soon. Yet losing Amazon and Salesforce as customers could pose major problems for Oracle, as it could provide a road map for other large companies that also are looking to cut costs by jettisoning Oracle database software in favor of open-source database alternatives.''</p><p>Oracle's shares are down nearly 2 percent. They had been trading about 1 percent higher before the report.</p><p>  -- Stephen Grocer</p><p>  Where are stocks heading in 2018?</p><p>  The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 25 percent in 2017. Does that mean investors should turn bearish on stocks this year? The answer is no if history is any indicator, LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick points out.</p><p>  Also, is the first day of trading predictive of the stock market's performance for the full year?</p><p>  -- Stephen Grocer</p><p>  Remembering 2017, and looking ahead to 2018.</p><p>  If you couldn't recall last year's highlights over the recent holidays, Andrew can remind you with his annual year-end column (the humor of which is his and his alone). A sample:</p><p>  The seating chart is, of course, always a bit complicated. We had to keep Jeffrey Bezos of Amazon from the dais to prevent Mr. Trump's Twitter war with him from interrupting the festivities. And we had heard that Mr. Bezos had a practical joke planned: He was going to tell Mr. Trump that he had chosen Mexico City as Amazon's second headquarters.</p><p>  But it's a new year, and here are some important story lines we'll be keeping our eyes on:</p><p>   Now that the tax fight is over, the White House is turning to trade. Will Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin be able to tame <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>hard-line tendencies?</p><p>   Can Congress make progress on the many, many other issues it's facing?</p><p>SoftBank did its Uber deal. Will the ride-hailing giant make further strides toward going public this year? (Maybe not.) And what will Masa Son of SoftBank and his $100 billion Vision Fund get up to?</p><p>   What other industries will Amazon disrupt this year? And how much bigger can Mr. Bezos's behemoth get?</p><p>North Korea is trying to drive a wedge between South Korea and the U.S. And it seems to be working. How will Mr. Trump -- and the global economy -- respond?</p><p>   Stevie Cohen is finding takers for his new hedge fund. But how much presence will he retain in the industry?</p><p>   In the world of M. &amp; A. fights, who will AT&amp;T or the Justice Department prevail? Broadcom or Qualcomm? And will Disney and Fox get their deal done?</p><p>  Businesses are opening their wallets.</p><p>  And the <person><nameText>Trump administration's </nameText></person>deregulatory push looks to be a reason for that -- even if skeptics question whether rolling back government rules stimulates corporate growth.</p><p>  Corporate leaders always cite ''uncertainty'' as a reason to hold back on capital expenditures or transformative acquisitions. And fewer than half of the respondents in the National Association of Manufacturers' most recent survey said they faced an ''unfavorable business climate.''</p><p>  Yet some see a bigger phenomenon at work. This is what Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics told the NYT:</p><p>  ''The fundamental backdrop here is that this is a global synchronized expansion lifting everyone's spirits, from Tokyo to New York.''</p><p>  The tax flyaround</p><p>   Corporate America's great loophole scavenger hunt has begun. (NYT)</p><p>   China has responded to the tax law by temporarily exempting foreign companies from taxes on their earnings in the country -- but there's a catch. (NYT)</p><p>   Democrats in high-tax states are seeking ways to blunt some of the impact of the tax overhaul. (NYT)</p><p>   The gig economy could get a boost. (NYT)</p><p>   Betting on the dollar continuing to strengthen in 2018, thanks to the tax law. (WSJ)</p><p>  The Murdoch family tensions behind the Disney deal.</p><p>  It may have been a brief sales negotiation with Verizon that prompted Rupert Murdoch to consider selling pieces of 21st Century Fox. But the NYT reports that friction between the media mogul and his son James helped push the family toward the Disney transaction.</p><p>  From the article by Brooks Barnes and Sydney Ember:</p><p>   James Murdoch has privately grumbled about the control that his father still exerted at Fox and has chafed at some of the elements of Fox News's coverage.</p><p>   Rupert Murdoch was wary of how Hollywood was being reshaped by digital giants like Netflix, Apple and Amazon, and unsure his empire could compete.</p><p>   Lachlan Murdoch, who is more conservative than his brother, has become the heir apparent at what would remain of Fox, but was initially uneasy about a sell-off.</p><p>  What they gain: Beyond easing family tensions among the trio, the deal could make the Murdochs some of Disney's biggest shareholders.</p><p>  The mutual fund king bucking the low-fee wave.</p><p>  Yes, Ron Baron has lowered fees on some of his smaller funds. But he's unapologetic about charging roughly 54 percent more than the industry average.</p><p>  Here's what he told Landon Thomas Jr. of the NYT:</p><p>  ''Since inception, 98 percent of our funds have beaten their benchmark,'' he said in an interview. ''If you want the lowest fee, you should not invest with us.''</p><p>  How he (and other mutual funds) do it: Chalk it up to a combination of looser oversight, the $10 trillion of investor money still dedicated to actively managed funds and a lack of investor awareness that high fees don't necessarily pay for performance.</p><p>  Can this go on? </p><p>  One fund investor's take in the NYT:</p><p>  ''I won't say performance warrants the fees they charge,'' said Barry Edelman, a Las Vegas retiree and a 20-year Baron shareholder. ''But I appreciate how they differentiate themselves from the competition.''</p><p>  Tragedy strikes Bridgewater.</p><p>  Bruce Steinberg, an executive at the hedge fund, and his family were among the 12 killed when a single-engine plane crashed in Costa Rica on Sunday.</p><p>  Ray Dalio of Bridgewater posted this to Facebook yesterday:</p><p>  Also of note: Richard Cousins, the C.E.O. of Compass Group, the world's biggest catering company, was one of six killed in a plane crash in Sydney on Sunday.</p><p>  Hollywood organizes to fight sexual harassment.</p><p>  What's notable is that Time's Up -- formed by more than 300 women and including a legal-defense fund -- isn't focused only on the entertainment industry. It plans to offer help to janitors, nurses, hotel staff and other blue-collar workers.</p><p>  Here's what Shonda Rhimes, a backer of the initiative, told Cara Buckley of the NYT:</p><p>  ''If this group of women can't fight for a model for other women who don't have as much power and privilege, then who can?''</p><p>  Who else is involved: The actresses America Ferrera, Eva Longoria and Reese Witherspoon; Donna Langley, the chairwoman of Universal Pictures; and roughly 295 other women in Hollywood.</p><p>  What's different: The Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, which is backed by $13 million in donations and is overseen by Tina Tchen, a former chief of staff to Michelle Obama. It will help provide less-privileged women with lawyers to bring misconduct cases to court and protect them from blowback.</p><p>  The misconduct flyaround</p><p>   Take a peek behind the curtain at the monthly drug- and sex-fueled monthly parties attended by some of Silicon Valley's most powerful men, in an excerpt from ''Brotopia,'' the forthcoming book by the Bloomberg anchor Emily Chang.

(NYT)</p><p>  Read this story. (Lloyd Blankfein said so.)</p><p>  Last week, the NYT reported on how the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ends up with some of the highest construction costs in the world. Some facts:</p><p>   The Second Avenue subway cost $2.5 billion. Expanding Grand Central Terminal is now expected to cost $12 billion.</p><p>   Construction companies inflate their projected costs by up to 50 percent for M.T.A. work. Labor unions have arranged for up to four times the necessary staffing on some projects.</p><p>   Consultants have persuaded officials to spend heavily on design and management.</p><p>  Here's what Mr. Blankfein, Andrew's choice as 2017's best corporate tweeter, had to say:</p><p>  (Mr. Blankfein has good reasons for pique over the tax law: Goldman Sachs is taking  a $5 billion charge in its fourth-quarter earnings tied to the changes.)</p><p>  The Speed Read</p><p>Caterpillar faces a potential tax bill of $2 billion from the I.R.S., which says it has underpaid on profits from parts sales through its Swiss unit.

He warned for years that the big tech companies were arrogant and clueless and less good for mankind than they believed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Comeuppance, the billionaire investor warned, was coming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trouble has now arrived. Unfortunately for Mr. Thiel, the storm is centered on Facebook, whose board he has been a member of practically since its founding. The social network, which billed itself as bringing democracy and enlightenment to the world, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/technology/indictment-russian-tech-facebook.html\">was used by the Russians</url> to subvert democracy and sow confusion in the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even people paid to see the future didn\u2019t see that one coming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThe board\u2019s role is to help think about some of the medium- and longer-term problems coming around the corner,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cWe were far from perfect in doing that.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Thiel, 50, is at the center of nearly every issue that roils Silicon Valley, ranging from the tech elite\u2019s fascination with New Zealand hideaways (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/technology/peter-thiel-new-zealand-citizenship.html\">Mr. Thiel obtained New Zealand citizenship</url>) to Bitcoin (he is a major investor) to the problems of herd thinking (he is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles to escape it) to the evolving role of content on the internet (he has been exploring the creation of a media company that would outflank Breitbart and Fox for a younger audience).</p><p>Two subjects are currently overwhelming everything else: President Trump, whom <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html\">Mr. Thiel aggressively backed</url> for president, and Facebook, whose core mission is being called into question in the wake of the Russian revelations. In a typical Thiel move \u2014 he tends to run toward controversy even as his Silicon Valley peers try to make themselves inconspicuous \u2014 he agreed, in a rare interview, to talk about both.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a crazier two years than I would have thought,\u201d Mr. Thiel said in his new Midtown Manhattan apartment, which is so far up in the clouds that it literally looks down on Trump Tower.</p><p>Despite the proximity, the mutual enthusiasm between Mr. Thiel and Mr. Trump seems to have cooled. After <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/us/politics/peter-thiel-republican-convention-gay.html\">Mr. Thiel spoke at the Republican National Convention</url> in 2016, there were unsourced media reports that said Mr. Trump wanted to put him on the Supreme Court. But now even photo ops are rare.</p><p>The investor said he had last spoken to the president \u201ca few months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t talk that often,\u201d he said, but added, \u201cI can get access anytime I want.\u201d</p><p>The Trump whom Mr. Thiel touted at the Republican convention was a candidate who would \u201cend the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country,\u201d move us past \u201cfake culture wars\u201d and start projects the equivalent of the Apollo space program. That does not seem to be the president he got.</p><p>\u201cThere are all these ways that things have fallen short,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. But he said he had no regrets about his endorsement. \u201cIt\u2019s still better than Hillary Clinton or the Republican zombies,\u201d he said, referring to the other candidates.</p><p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Thiel is routinely labeled a libertarian. On a bookshelf in the apartment, as if in confirmation, is a hardback copy of Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cAtlas Shrugged,\u201d the bible of the movement. A gift, he said.</p><p>A lesser-known but possibly deeper influence was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/arts/international/rene-girard-french-theorist-of-the-social-sciences-dies-at-91.html\">French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Girard</url>, who taught at Stanford University when Mr. Thiel was an undergraduate there. For 15 years, on and off, Mr. Thiel sat in on a study group about Mr. Girard\u2019s ideas. Mr. Girard believed human beings were deeply mimetic, which is to say they copy one another.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very anti-Ayn Rand: There are no self-contained autonomous figures,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cOur desires are not our own. They get shaped powerfully by the society around us.\u201d</p><p>It was this illumination that helped him see the potential of Facebook \u2014 where people could find out in intimate and addictive detail what their friends were up to \u2014 when it was barely a year old. He was the first outside investor, buying 10 percent of the company for $500,000.</p><p>He sold most of his holdings in 2012 as Facebook went public. A few months ago, with Facebook\u2019s market capitalization at about $500 billion, he sold most of what he had left.</p><p>Last summer, there was a flap when a memo by a fellow board member, Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/technology/the-culture-wars-have-come-to-silicon-valley.html\">appeared in The New York Times</url>. In the memo, Mr. Hastings wrote to Mr. Thiel that he displayed \u201ccatastrophically bad judgment\u201d in supporting Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, did not ask him to step down from the board, and reports that he wants to leave the board are incorrect, Mr. Thiel said, noting that among other things he brings \u201cideological diversity.\u201d He declined to say exactly how much or what kind of advice the Facebook board was offering Mr. Zuckerberg, but defended the company from criticism that it was slow to wake up to what the Russians did.</p><p>\u201cRemember when Trump said the election was going to be rigged? People said that was crazy \u2014 \u2018How dare you question the integrity of the electoral process?\u2019 That was the view of most of the people working at Facebook, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did not think things were so hackable. It was a mistake, but an understandable mistake.\u201d Facebook declined to comment.</p><p>The anger now being turned on Facebook, Mr. Thiel argued, is less about Russia specifically and more about tech arrogance \u2014 its failure to do so much for so many. It is a sentiment that helped put Mr. Trump in the White House.</p><p>\u201cThe Trump campaign slogan, \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 was perhaps the single most offensive thing you could say to Silicon Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cSilicon Valley says the future is going to be better than the past. That is the propaganda, if you will.\u201d</p><p>A friend of his in Silicon Valley had the idea of running for governor of California this year. Mr. Thiel\u2019s advice was that he had better have a good answer to this question: Why is tech good for the average person in California? The answer, he cautioned, couldn\u2019t be a banality, such as \u201cit\u2019s making us more connected,\u201d and it couldn\u2019t be utopian, such as \u201cit\u2019s going to cure all diseases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t able to come up with an answer, and I couldn\u2019t come up with one, either,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. He declined to identify the friend, but it is well known in tech circles that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/opinion/sunday/sam-altman.html\">Sam Altman</url>, the president of Y Combinator, the prominent start-up accelerator, was thinking about running. Mr. Altman confirmed it was him and said he had decided not to run \u201cfor many reasons.\u201d</p><p>There is a big painting of a cresting wave in Mr. Thiel\u2019s living room, and it might as well be a visual metaphor for what is going on in big tech now.</p><p>\u201cHaving some ambition that transcends just making money is a critical thing for a company,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is some point where it gets crazy and self-delusional.\u201d He added that the companies \u201care probably in some trouble \u2014 maybe it\u2019s a little, maybe it\u2019s a lot.\u201d The prospect of government regulation looms.</p><p>In 2015 and 2016, Mr. Thiel gave $300,000 to Josh Hawley, who was campaigning to become Missouri\u2019s attorney general. Mr. Hawley won, and in November he opened an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/technology/missouri-google-investigation.html\">antitrust investigation of Google</url>. A spokeswoman for Mr. Hawley, a Republican who is now challenging the state\u2019s Democratic senator, Claire McCaskill, said there was \u201cno connection\u201d between Mr. Thiel\u2019s donation and the investigation. Google declined to comment.</p><p>The news last month that Mr. Thiel is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles reflects a shift that is as much mental as literal. Getting out of the tech bubble, he figures, will give him more clarity about his investments.</p><p>\u201cNetwork effects are very positive things, but there\u2019s a tipping point where they fall over into the madness of crowds,\u201d he said.</p><p>Another of Mr. Thiel\u2019s contentious ideas was destroying Gawker, the online publisher. He <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/business/dealbook/peter-thiel-tech-billionaire-reveals-secret-war-with-gawker.html\">secretly financed the privacy lawsuit that Hulk Hogan,</url> the former pro wrestler, filed against the media company, which Mr. Hogan won. That led to Gawker\u2019s bankruptcy in 2016.</p><p>A news operation that specialized in deflating the arrogance of Silicon Valley should have been to Mr. Thiel\u2019s liking. But he argues that his philosophy is consistent here.</p><p>\u201cGawker was trying to cut people down to size for not conforming,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability to speak and not have every word you say get distorted, to have wrong ideas and then be able to correct them \u2014 these notions were powerfully undercut by Gawker.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Thiel is still pursuing the remnants of Gawker in court, which has prompted accusations that he wants to remove all of its content from the internet as a final victory.</p><p>He denied this. \u201cTerry Bollea, a.k.a. Hulk Hogan, is still owed some money from the Gawker sale, and that is what I am trying to get,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want the archives. I don\u2019t think it makes sense to destroy them. Preserve them, study them instead.\u201d</p><p>Follow David Streitfeld on Twitter: @DavidStreitfeld. </p><p>PHOTO: \u201cWe were far from perfect\u201d in seeing problems that were around the corner, said Peter Thiel, a Facebook board member, in his Manhattan apartment.

He warned for years that the big tech companies were arrogant and clueless and less good for mankind than they believed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Comeuppance, the billionaire investor warned, was coming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trouble has now arrived. Unfortunately for Mr. Thiel, the storm is centered on Facebook, whose board he has been a member of practically since its founding. The social network, which billed itself as bringing democracy and enlightenment to the world, was used by the Russians to subvert democracy and sow confusion in the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even people paid to see the future didn't see that one coming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The board's role is to help think about some of the medium- and longer-term problems coming around the corner,\" Mr. Thiel said. \"We were far from perfect in doing that.\"</p><p>Mr. Thiel, 50, is at the center of nearly every issue that roils Silicon Valley, ranging from the tech elite's fascination with New Zealand hideaways (Mr. Thiel obtained New Zealand citizenship) to Bitcoin (he is a major investor) to the problems of herd thinking (he is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles to escape it) to the evolving role of content on the internet (he has been exploring the creation of a media company that would outflank Breitbart and Fox for a younger audience).</p><p>Two subjects are currently overwhelming everything else: President Trump, whom Mr. Thiel aggressively backed for president, and Facebook, whose core mission is being called into question in the wake of the Russian revelations. In a typical Thiel move - he tends to run toward controversy even as his Silicon Valley peers try to make themselves inconspicuous - he agreed, in a rare interview, to talk about both.</p><p>\"It's been a crazier two years than I would have thought,\" Mr. Thiel said in his new Midtown Manhattan apartment, which is so far up in the clouds that it literally looks down on Trump Tower.</p><p>Despite the proximity, the mutual enthusiasm between Mr. Thiel and Mr. Trump seems to have cooled. After Mr. Thiel spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2016, there were unsourced media reports that said Mr. Trump wanted to put him on the Supreme Court. But now even photo ops are rare.</p><p>The investor said he had last spoken to the president \"a few months ago.\"</p><p>\"We don't talk that often,\" he said, but added, \"I can get access anytime I want.\"</p><p>The Trump whom Mr. Thiel touted at the Republican convention was a candidate who would \"end the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country,\" move us past \"fake culture wars\" and start projects the equivalent of the Apollo space program. That does not seem to be the president he got.</p><p>\"There are all these ways that things have fallen short,\" Mr. Thiel said. But he said he had no regrets about his endorsement. \"It's still better than Hillary Clinton or the Republican zombies,\" he said, referring to the other candidates.</p><p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Thiel is routinely labeled a libertarian. On a bookshelf in the apartment, as if in confirmation, is a hardback copy of Ayn Rand's \"Atlas Shrugged,\" the bible of the movement. A gift, he said.</p><p>A lesser-known but possibly deeper influence was the French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Girard, who taught at Stanford University when Mr. Thiel was an undergraduate there. For 15 years, on and off, Mr. Thiel sat in on a study group about Mr. Girard's ideas. Mr. Girard believed human beings were deeply mimetic, which is to say they copy one another.</p><p>\"It's very anti-Ayn Rand: There are no self-contained autonomous figures,\" Mr. Thiel said. \"Our desires are not our own. They get shaped powerfully by the society around us.\"</p><p>It was this illumination that helped him see the potential of Facebook - where people could find out in intimate and addictive detail what their friends were up to - when it was barely a year old. He was the first outside investor, buying 10 percent of the company for $500,000.</p><p>He sold most of his holdings in 2012 as Facebook went public. A few months ago, with Facebook's market capitalization at about $500 billion, he sold most of what he had left.</p><p>Last summer, there was a flap when a memo by a fellow board member, Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, appeared in The New York Times. In the memo, Mr. Hastings wrote to Mr. Thiel that he displayed \"catastrophically bad judgment\" in supporting Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, did not ask him to step down from the board, and reports that he wants to leave the board are incorrect, Mr. Thiel said, noting that among other things he brings \"ideological diversity.\" He declined to say exactly how much or what kind of advice the Facebook board was offering Mr. Zuckerberg, but defended the company from criticism that it was slow to wake up to what the Russians did.</p><p>\"Remember when Trump said the election was going to be rigged? People said that was crazy - 'How dare you question the integrity of the electoral process?' That was the view of most of the people working at Facebook, too,\" he said. \"They did not think things were so hackable. It was a mistake, but an understandable mistake.\" Facebook declined to comment.</p><p>The anger now being turned on Facebook, Mr. Thiel argued, is less about Russia specifically and more about tech arrogance - its failure to do so much for so many. It is a sentiment that helped put Mr. Trump in the White House.</p><p>\"The Trump campaign slogan, 'Make America Great Again,' was perhaps the single most offensive thing you could say to Silicon Valley,\" he said. \"Silicon Valley says the future is going to be better than the past. That is the propaganda, if you will.\"</p><p>A friend of his in Silicon Valley had the idea of running for governor of California this year. Mr. Thiel's advice was that he had better have a good answer to this question: Why is tech good for the average person in California? The answer, he cautioned, couldn't be a banality, such as \"it's making us more connected,\" and it couldn't be utopian, such as \"it's going to cure all diseases.\"</p><p>\"He wasn't able to come up with an answer, and I couldn't come up with one, either,\" Mr. Thiel said. He declined to identify the friend, but it is well known in tech circles that Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, the prominent start-up accelerator, was thinking about running. Mr. Altman confirmed it was him and said he had decided not to run \"for many reasons.\"</p><p>There is a big painting of a cresting wave in Mr. Thiel's living room, and it might as well be a visual metaphor for what is going on in big tech now.</p><p>\"Having some ambition that transcends just making money is a critical thing for a company,\" he said. \"But there is some point where it gets crazy and self-delusional.\" He added that the companies \"are probably in some trouble - maybe it's a little, maybe it's a lot.\" The prospect of government regulation looms.</p><p>In 2015 and 2016, Mr. Thiel gave $300,000 to Josh Hawley, who was campaigning to become Missouri's attorney general. Mr. Hawley won, and in November he opened an antitrust investigation of Google. A spokeswoman for Mr. Hawley, a Republican who is now challenging the state's Democratic senator, Claire McCaskill, said there was \"no connection\" between Mr. Thiel's donation and the investigation. Google declined to comment.</p><p>The news last month that Mr. Thiel is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles reflects a shift that is as much mental as literal. Getting out of the tech bubble, he figures, will give him more clarity about his investments.</p><p>\"Network effects are very positive things, but there's a tipping point where they fall over into the madness of crowds,\" he said.</p><p>Another of Mr. Thiel's contentious ideas was destroying Gawker, the online publisher. He secretly financed the privacy lawsuit that Hulk Hogan, the former pro wrestler, filed against the media company, which Mr. Hogan won. That led to Gawker's bankruptcy in 2016.</p><p>A news operation that specialized in deflating the arrogance of Silicon Valley should have been to Mr. Thiel's liking. But he argues that his philosophy is consistent here.</p><p>\"Gawker was trying to cut people down to size for not conforming,\" he said. \"The ability to speak and not have every word you say get distorted, to have wrong ideas and then be able to correct them - these notions were powerfully undercut by Gawker.\"</p><p>Mr. Thiel is still pursuing the remnants of Gawker in court, which has prompted accusations that he wants to remove all of its content from the internet as a final victory.</p><p>He denied this. \"Terry Bollea, a.k.a. Hulk Hogan, is still owed some money from the Gawker sale, and that is what I am trying to get,\" he said. \"I don't want the archives. I don't think it makes sense to destroy them. Preserve them, study them instead.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow David Streitfeld on Twitter: @DavidStreitfeld.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000005766702</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SBC-WG41-JC85-N2M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1497\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 7, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We have John Wright, Chairman, President and CEO presenting, and Peter Cheung on my right here who is the CFO of Petrobank.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For those not familiar with the Petrobank story, it is a very unique story in this space. What you've got here is basically a combination of two entities. You have got majority ownership of PetroBakken which the name is pretty self explanatory. It is more of a light oil resource play focus and you also buying Petrobank, get effectively a share of the heavy oil business unit which is focused on oil sands and heavy oil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the things that obviously makes Petrobank very unique in the oil sands is that rather than pursuing the more traditional SAGD approach, the Company is attempting to commercialize its toe to heel air injection or THAI technology with applications in both oil sands and conventional heavy oil.</p><p>So we will do the presentation a little bit differently here. John will start walking through it but we will kind of pause throughout the presentation at various points to break for questions. So with that I guess I will turn it over to John to start going through the presentation.</p><p>JOHN WRIGHT, PRESIDENT AND CEO, PETROBANK ENERGY AND RESOURCES LTD.: Thanks, Andrew, and thanks all of you for joining us. We will see if this format works for the future because I don't think we have tried it before. Also with us today, Gregg Smith, who is the President and COO of PetroBakken is with us today as well as Bill Kanters, our VP New Ventures and Business Development. Gregg is presenting tomorrow and a third now -- a third member of the Petro family who has left home which is Petrominerales, Corey Ruttan will be here I think on Friday and presenting that part of the Petrobank family or the Petro story.</p><p>So I will just try and spin ahead here. A quick notice from our lawyers. I encourage you to read that at your leisure.</p><p>So the Petrobank story is getting a little simpler. The Company itself is effectively three separate assets. So we have our majority ownership of PetroBakken, which used to be our 100% own Canadian business unit and through a transaction we initiated in about October of 2009, we spun off PetroBakken through essentially a takeover of TriStar. And since that time, PetroBakken has been operating in the Canadian conventional light oil space and is the premier operator of horizontal drilling with multi-stage fracturing. And again, I invite you to visit Gregg's presentation tomorrow to learn more about that.</p><p>Petrobank also owns our heavy oil operating subsidiary, Whitesands, which has a pretty significant asset base in both bitumen and heavy oil in Alberta and Saskatchewan and I will get into that in a little bit more detail here. And then finally, a little unique for an oil and gas company but we own a technology company called Archon, and Archon actually is an active research and development arm of the company. We own now eight patents or pending patents on technologies related to heavy oil recovery. I'll show you a little bit later on in this presentation if we get to it, those patents have been now registered in 10 different countries on a global basis and they are waiting for final registration and recognition in a further 34 countries. So there is a big tech company part of Petrobank that sort of hides underneath the corporate umbrella.</p><p>So when you buy a share of Petrobank today, you get a little bit more than one share of PetroBakken, you get 100% ownership in those two business units which includes a very substantial reserve and resource position in the bitumen world where we have got about 669 million barrels of 2p and best estimate contingent resource available in the McMurray region.</p><p>And then a further access to about a further 80 million barrels of capability in the more conventional world in Seal and Kerrobert where we are looking at heavy oil not unlike the heavy well that you would find globally throughout most of the other basins of the world.</p><p>The Company itself has a really strong balance sheet, ended last quarter the third quarter with a little bit of net cash in hand. We actually accumulate well over CAD100 million a year in dividends from our stake in PetroBakken and as well, we have access to about a CAD200 million line of credit which again was not drawn at the end of the last reporting period.</p><p>I am going to skip by some of this stuff just so we can get into the meat of the matter but I mentioned we have got a pretty significant reserve and resource base. And at the end of last year as part of our ongoing and I think we have been pretty public about this, our ongoing plan to unlock value for shareholders, we spun off our majority interest in another one of the subsidiaries we created which is Petrominerales and provide some graphical data here. Obviously these valuations will fluctuate from day to day based on what the market says.</p><p>But I think what we are trying to say is there has been a lot of value creation by the Petrobank team. We have been able to create specific vehicles that are able to unlock some of those values in very unique circumstances and most recently, with the spinoff of Petrominerales and the continued higher liquidity in the market for Petrominerales and Petrobank that has evolved, I think we have continued to create some pretty good growth in the Company overall basin.</p><p>If you add all the pieces together I think a share of Petrobank recombined today would be worth about CAD47 or so round numbers just to put us in perspective.</p><p>I am not going to get into a bunch of detail on PetroBakken other than to tell you this is a company that is built for long-term accretive growth. We have got about 2000 drilling locations on the two biggest resource plays for light oil in Canada which is the Bakken and the Cardium in Alberta. And the team in place at PetroBakken has drilled, completed and brought on stream more horizontal wells with multistage frac technology than anyone else in this country. They have got a ton of experience and they are applying it with a very aggressive program this year which should so show some very, very impressive growth numbers through the end of the year and I think they are really starting to spin out some great results on our Cardium opportunity. And I will leave it at that.</p><p>That is kind of a good place to break if there's any questions about the macro corporate structure if you have any and if not, I can go on.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have a question about Archon.</p><p>JOHN WRIGHT: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: I guess a common criticism of the oil sands (inaudible) for an industry that is really dependent on technology (inaudible)</p><p>JOHN WRIGHT: Do we need to repeat the questions?</p><p>ANDREW POTTER: Yes, that actually helps.</p><p>JOHN WRIGHT: Okay, so the question is whether Archon is unique or whether the oil industry is sort of going that way. I think there was a recent article in the Globe and Mail that kind of captured it lately that said that more and more people in our industry are starting to recognize there is value not just in oil and gas resource but in the technologies that we are developing. And I don't think in any way that Archon is unique. I think we have been around for a long time and I think we have been pretty forward about filing patents and getting global recognition for some of the things we have done.</p><p>But an awful lot of the major innovations that have taken place in the global oil industry have originated in Canada and certainly what you are seeing with multistage fracking for example, that has been a huge push-out using the Packers Plus system for example which is a made in Canada success story. It is now in just about every country on earth showing some great results. And SAGD was another huge innovation that came out of the Canadian mind think.</p><p>And I think we have to remember that Alberta well, the Western Canadian sedimentary basin is very mature and really offers very little conventional opportunity now. So anything that we can do to create value in that basin is probably going to be unique and will be copied in other parts of the world. And it goes forward and no one will question that Exxon and Shell and BP have huge research organizations but if you drive by the University of Calgary, you will also see they have huge research centers that are working on that right now and Archon is just another one of them focused on -- Archon by the way is the god of fire. So it is focused on in situ combustion and thermal recovery methods for heavy oil.</p><p>ANDREW POTTER: Just on that topic, I mean what is the longer-term game plan for the different entities? Do you ultimately see spinning off the heavy oil business unit and Archon into separate entities down the road?</p><p>JOHN WRIGHT: Yes, thanks, Andrew. We have been pretty forthright about saying that we are all together in Petrobank as shareholders but we think we can unlock a lot a value by holding the different assets through different pieces of paper. So Petrominerales being spun off was a natural progression. It will be natural for us to ultimately unlock further value in PetroBakken by putting that in the hands of all the shareholders.</p><p>I think we can do the same thing with the heavy oil assets in Archon. Archon, the long-term business model there is actually to create a revenue generating capability through licensing and royalty opportunities that we have been working on for the technologies and that has no -- there is no peer for that in the oil and gas world. And I am not suggesting for a minute it is Microsoft or Apple, but it will trade like a high-tech company because it won't have reserves or capital requirements to invest in wells and so forth. It will essentially be marketing that technology and our long-term plan is to create that as a profit center and again put it in the hands of the shareholders.</p><p>Okay, I will just jump on. So jumping into what the heavy oil assets look like in Petrobank, we are focused in three specific areas. One is the conventional being the wrong word but the kind of the common thought around heavy oil and bitumen is the Fort McMurray and Athabasca oil sands and we have got a pretty huge resource base there. Everyone talks about how many billions of barrels they have. We have got about 1.6 billion barrels of bitumen in place on our asset there of which a little less than 700 million would be recoverable as estimated by our independent auditors using SAGD technology.</p><p>So it is a great resource base in a very active area that I think a lot of people are familiar with. We also have a big heavy oil resource base in the Dawson region which is in the Seal or Peace River part of Alberta and that is more conventional oil. This is oil that will actually flow cold and probably looks a lot more like the oil you will see in Colombia and Peru and the Middle East and China and Russia and Madagascar and places like that where it isn't bitumen but it is still very hard to get out of the ground.</p><p>And then sort of a huge resource in the Province of Saskatchewan, the massive heavy oil reserves that have been developed and brought on stream under conventional production. It's about 20 billion barrels of heavy oil in place in Saskatchewan and less than 5% of that is recoverable under conventional recovery methods. So there is a huge proven known discovered delineated resource base just sitting there in one of the most hospitable places to do business in Canada and we have got a chunk of it in a region called Kerrobert and we are always on the lookout for other opportunities that look like that.</p><p>We put on here just so to put things in perspective when you talk about billions, the Southeast Saskatchewan Bakken light oil play, resource play there is about a five billion barrel accumulation so it is almost dwarfed by all these big heavy oil accumulations that are out there. And the asset bases have to be converted into prospective developments so we have identified between 27,000 and 127,000 barrels a day of projects just on the three operating areas that we have put in place to date. And the first one is going to be at Kerrobert where we are actually building up a 7000 barrel a day project which I and going to get into in a little bit of time here.</p><p>When we talk about the THAI technology and I have got a little picture that describes it but maybe just say it in words, we kind of look at it as being able to get significantly more oil out of the ground at a significantly lower capital cost and a significantly lower operating cost, higher net back. And the idea there is because we are using fire, because we are using combustion in the ground as our heat source, we are able to actually displace and recover a much higher quantity of the oil in place than we would be if we were using steam which is a fairly passive way to deliver heat into the reservoir.</p><p>On the capital investment side, it is not a function of Petrobank having some secret way of spending less money. We literally invest in less equipment to put in place a THAI project. And by that I mean if you've visited any of our operating sites there, they are easily the least impressive field operations you are ever going to see because we don't have any massive boilers or big steam generators or water treating facilities or cooling towers or anything like that. We have an air compressor and an oil battery and it is pretty boring. But it is also pretty cheap. It can be built very quickly and so the capital investment can be very low and I am going to show you in our Kerrobert economics shockingly low for the heavy oil business in what we think is the best opportunity on our books to date.</p><p>And then on the net back side, because we are producing oil without steam and without producing three or four barrels of water for every barrel of oil we produce or anything like that, we don't have big water treating facilities. We don't have to recirculate our produced water or anything like that. We don't consume natural gas to create steam on the surface. So we have a very low operating cost base and we can show you some operating costs we are predicting will be sub CAD10 a barrel to run a full commercial THAI operation.</p><p>There is also on an ancillary basis but very positive basis some huge environmental positives about this technology. We can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions per barrel. We can significantly reduce the surface footprint because we use less facilities. We have produced an upgraded barrel of oil which means we have less refining, less upgrading that has to happen to our barrel.</p><p>And finally, we don't consume water so we take ourselves out of the whole water equation which has become a big part of the discussion around heavy oil recovery.</p><p>So this is what THAI looks like sort of in a slice of lasagna underground here. And you can kind of see the horizontal wells are the drainage wells at the bottom of the reservoir. At the toe of every horizontal well we drill a vertical air injection well. We inject air into that well. The air hits the reservoir. It combusts the oil. The oil starts to burn.</p><p>The best analogy we have is think about the charcoal briquettes on your barbecue. The more you blow on them the redder they get, the hotter they glow and they generate a bunch of heat. That heat is actually sufficient to crack the oil in situ so we drop out a significant portion of the heavy ends of the barrel in the form of coke in the reservoir so think of it as carbon dust in the reservoir. So a solid. That becomes the fuel for the fire. So we are actually burning coke in the reservoir to generate this heat.</p><p>The liberated oil is now very mobile. It flows like water. We create a drain point at the base of the reservoir which is like the drain in your bathtub so by gravity, all the flow goes down to the base of the reservoir and then up to the surface where we process it. And this is what the Kerrobert facility looks like and in fact is being drilled up at this moment and we will be on production next quarter.</p><p>I don't know, maybe that is a good place to stop for questions too if there are any. Any questions about the technology itself?</p><p>ANDREW POTTER: Any questions from the floor?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible question - microphone inaccessible).</p><p>JOHN WRIGHT: So the question is how universally applicable THAI is in the heavy oil world. So we have a pretty simple mantra. THAI will work in almost all sandstone reservoirs provided that there is enough permeability to actually get a high flux rate of air into the ground. So in engineering terms, we are looking at darcy plus rock so very high permeability rock.</p><p>To put that in perspective, the McMurray Sands in the Athabasca region and Fort McMurray region are 10 plus darcy sands. These Kerrobert sands are 2 to 3 darcy sands. Most shallow unconsolidated well sorted sand can have permeability in the 1 to 10 darcy range.</p><p>I will put that in perspective. The Bakken has a permeability of less than 1 millidarcy. So it is 1000 times less permeable than these types of reservoirs.</p><p>It probably doesn't lend itself well to carbonates. Carbonates are very buggy and not very consistent. And one of the issues that you have when you generate, you can probably effectively do it, but when you generate a high amount of heat in a carbonate reservoir, you also generate a lot of carbon dioxide. And I think until we have sort of got our heads around carbon capture and things like that, that is probably not where we want to go with it right now.</p><p>But the huge majority of heavy oil on earth is in sandstone reservoirs with high permeability so this has great applicability on a global basis.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible question - microphone inaccessible).</p><p>JOHN WRIGHT: So the question is do I want to make a prediction for next quarter? So we have kind of built our careers at Petrobank over the last 11 years by not making quarter-over-quarter projections and I think it is enough that we are trying a fireside chat format here. I am not going to change everything else about us.</p><p>But I will say to we are very comfortable with the results we have had from Kerrobert. The new well design that we have put in place there you know things to continue to evolve for us. I mean I want you to know this isn't a static technology. We are tweaking it on a regular basis but we are very excited about getting good commercial production out of Kerrobert and we expect oil out of the ground in the second quarter. And we have said and I think we are comfortable saying this within a year we hope to be ramped up to the 7200 barrel a day area. So sometime in the second quarter of 2012, we would hope to be up at full commercial rates here.</p><p>By the way, the project is commercial at rates much less than that but it is designed to go up to 600 barrels a day per well is the design right now.</p><p>I talked a little bit about reserves. This can get pretty technical and I am just going to skip this but I am happy to come back if someone has a question. The bottom line is compared to a SAGD reservoir, we think if we apply THAI to it we should be able to double the effective reserves. So for the same reservoir, the same project, different technology, twice the reserve recovery.</p><p>So this is what Kerrobert looks like in plan view and when I talk about Saskatchewan, you can kind of see we have stripped all the Viking oil wells off this map or it would just look like a big black mass because it is very heavily drilled in this region. But you can see all the heavy oil development that has happened here over the last 50 years.</p><p>A mile away from our project, our THAI project, there is a working SAGD project. I think last time we looked it was doing about 1300 barrels a day. So there is good baseline production here. There has been coal production for decades. What we are putting in place is the development in the kind of the heart of our asset base in Kerrobert which you will see us drilling it up with a total of 12 wells. And we've got some economics here and I will skip ahead a page here after this but 12 wells targeting 7200 barrels a day.</p><p>But I think the most exciting thing for us is this is a 7200 barrel a day project that effectively started drilling in January and will be on production in April. So it is not the timeline you have heard out for the big mine developments or even some of the bigger SAGD developments. This is the number of wells that Gregg Smith and his team at PetroBakken will drill in two weeks of work but will take a couple of months to get them all drilled in our method. But they will be onstream right away.</p><p>So air starts going into the ground sometime around the end of the first quarter. Oil is being produced in the second quarter so we will have some by heavy oil and bitumen standards, we will have some lightning fast results on this and get them to you.</p><p>There is some great numbers that go around here. I want to emphasize Kerrobert is probably one of the best economic opportunities on our books today. That is why we are putting so much effort into it. It is a very easy operating area. We are in the middle of a very flat farmland. All the surface is privately owned. We have great relationships with all the local farmers, local landowners. There is paved roads, there is Motel 6s, there is Tim Horton's and 7-11s. We don't have to run a camp operation. We have never seen a helicopter. This is as good as it gets and as easy as it gets.</p><p>And the only thing I want to emphasize about Kerrobert is there is probably 50 look-alikes to Kerrobert in Saskatchewan within a 50-mile radius of where we are operating because that is what Saskatchewan is like.</p><p>There is some great numbers that we are showing here as far as there is a little bit of a rate of return matrix at the bottom there compares oil prices to flow rates. But I think the big takeaway here is we are targeting 600 barrels a day per well for these projects. They are more than economic at 150 barrels a day which is a typical Bakken oil well for example.</p><p>And the capital investment here I mean I don't think we will ever get lower than this sort of CAD12,000 a flowing barrel rate but I mean that is literally a quarter of what a typical SAGD is costing today. And remembering that we are also generating an upgraded oil here. And by that, I can kind of show you the oil on the left is raw Kerrobert crude. It is about a 10 API gravity which means it is exactly the same density as water. It is very heavy crude. It is very viscous, thousands of centipoise of viscosity in its native state.</p><p>And what we have been producing because we are actually coking the oil in situ is oil that has been as upgraded as being 20 or 21 degrees API. And you can see over the last little period there that there has been a trend downward and a flattening and a kind of a -- we have got things moderated in the reservoir. It doesn't mean that that is where we are going to be operating things on the long-term but what we have been doing out of Kerrobert with a different corporate goal in mind is we have been trying to level load the facility, make everything run on a steady-state basis, not necessarily at full capacity but just to make sure our reserve auditors and ourselves are on the same perspective so that we can ultimately get recognized proved reserves for the whole Kerrobert project, and by analogy for Whitesands and for Dawson. So that has been a big part of our focus there.</p><p>But even at that lower level of air injection and lower pump rates, we are still seeing upgrades into the 15 degree API range which is a huge success for us.</p><p>Just jumping back into Alberta at our May River project, this is in big oil territory so you can see the Petrobank lands in red there. To the East, we have some familiar names, Devon Jackfish Lake, Cenovus, Christina Lake. To the west is the big Statoil land block. This gray block immediately to the west of us which is the Thai National Oil Company recently made a CAD2 billion investment. This is kind of the heart of heavy oil country for Alberta.</p><p>And what we have here right now is a three-well pilot project. We make the joke now that everything you see at our Conklin pilot will never be duplicated in any of our commercial projects. It has been our learning center. It has been a place where we tried a bunch of new technology. We have got plans to test some new ideas there but it essentially is a museum to our first attempts at applying the technology.</p><p>What we will be rolling out in May River is the first 10,000 barrels a day of our ultimate 100,000 barrels a day project. This project is currently waiting on regulatory approval from the government of Alberta but it is designed, we pre-purchased some of the equipment and when the time comes we have obviously missed another drilling window here this winter. But when the time comes, we will be able to get after this and get up to a full scale development.</p><p>This will be more expensive than Kerrobert. It will be -- it will take longer than Kerrobert because it is a tougher operating environment. But I think at the end of the day it will be a very, very big resource opportunity for us.</p><p>The last place you are going to see us drilling this year is at Dawson which is a look-alike to Kerrobert and we are literally going to take our old Kerrobert plant, drill up Dawson in the second and third quarter and put that Kerrobert plant to work for us there and have some oil out of here by Q3 or Q4 this year.</p><p>And I am kind of winding up to the end here. If you think Alberta and Saskatchewan have a lock on all the heavy oil on earth you are sadly mistaken. There is about 9 trillion barrels of heavy oil on a global basis. We show some of the main basins here where heavy oil has been accumulated. Alberta and Saskatchewan are leading the way in devising new ways to recover this but the wave of the future will be heavy oil from all of these basins on a global basis.</p><p>The red stars are of the countries where we already have THAI patented and licensed or unavailable for licensing in country. There is a further 34 countries where we are going through the process to get that in place and obviously we think there is some big licensing opportunities, joint venture opportunities on a global basis to go after that.</p><p>ANDREW POTTER: We have got about one minute so we will have one quick question from the floor.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Some of the biggest challenges to getting these license agreements is that they want to see more success before they commit or is it just a matter of negotiating (inaudible)</p><p>JOHN WRIGHT: The question was the biggest challenges to the licensing agreement. So our issue is outside of North America, Colombia, Peru, that is about it, outside of those regions, almost all the heavy oil on earth is controlled by governments, by state oil companies or energy ministers. So our negotiation goes from being commercial to being political very quickly.</p><p>We announced in December that we had actually withdrawn a license deal that we put in place with a national oil company, primarily because we got stuck in the political machinations there. So I think it is a combination of finding the right political mix and fitting the political mindset of some governments that aren't necessarily pro-new technology or pro-sharing the wealth or pro-foreign investment and finding a way to make a difference for both of us so that it is a win-win and it is a long tough process.</p><p>It is much easier to do deals in North America and Latin America where the business climate sort of fits our way of thinking. But I think long-term Archon is developing that capability to do these deals with these big state entities and we do have other negotiations in place right now that are proceeding.</p><p>But at the end of the day, there is always a political element to some of those that we obviously can't control and ultimately have to be very careful on behalf of our shareholders for.</p><p>ANDREW POTTER: I guess with that we will wrap it up. We will pause for a few minutes as we move over to the services panel but thanks John and Peter for that presentation.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Larger and heavier than its forbearer due to modern safety regulations and equipment levels, the new 500 has been a hit with buyers and reviewers since 2007 and was offered with a line-up of four-cylinder petrol and turbo-diesel engines, which are now joined by a two-cylinder engine emulating the original 500, and its use of bi-cylinder power. Developed by Fiat for a contemporary setting and a greener and more efficient near future of largely congested and urbanised driving with high fuel prices, the 0.9 TwinAir engine will come in several iterations of power output and will be fitted more widely across Fiat's automobile range, but to start with has found its logical and spiritual home with the retro-chic 500. However, unlike the 1957-75 500 with it's ancient air-cooled 0.5- and 0.6-litre engines producing between 13BHP to 23BHP, Fiat's modern two-cylinder is a high tech marvel that offers a uniquely charismatic petrol combustion engine solution for green and efficient motoring. </p><p>Big tech, small package Lighter, cheaper, less complex and more viscerally fun than hybrid, electric or even turbo-diesel green alternatives, the 0.9 TwinAir is a breath of tightly packaged fresh air with a peaky and buzzy persona. Developed using Fiat's latest automotive technology, the 0.9 TwinAir's efficient engineering solutions include direct fuel injection and electro-hydraulic valves, which cut fuel consumption by an estimated 10 per cent and raise power and torque by 10 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. The 0.9 TwinAir's reduced cylinder count also reduces friction for better efficiency and responsiveness, which surprisingly even translated into minimal lag before its turbo spools up to deliver its punchiest performance. Though more costly to produce than larger more conventional 1.2- and 1.4-litre naturally-aspirated four-cylinder engines offered on the 500, the 0.9 TwinAir's substantial price premium makes most sense in a heavily urbanised setting where its even greater fuel savings recoup the initial investment, while its petrol engine technology does not require costlier or more specialised maintenance like hybrid and electric vehicles. In the UK, the 500 0.9 TwinAir is considered so clean that it is exempt from inner city congestion charges, while 0.9 TwinAir engine version models could be expected to become less expensive in future when it becomes more widely used in other Fiats, probably stating with the Panda. Twin virtues Set to be produced in 64bhp and 104bhp versions as well, the current 0.9 TwinAir engine develops 84bhp at 5500rpm and 107lb/ft torque at 1900rpm, which equates to a highly prodigious 96bhp per litre. Compared with the 500's base four-cylinder engines, the 0.9 TwinAir outpowers the 1.2 by 16bhp and falls short of the 1.4 by 15bhp, but compensates with a reduced weight, 32lb/ft and 10lb/ft more torque respectively and a lighter weight. The 0.9 TwinAir also delivers its maximum torque much earlier, and offers a broad and rich torque band to help make the 500 responsive and flexible in terms of driving character. With impressive output figures, the Fiat 500 0.9 TwinAir manual gearbox with dash to 100km/h in 11-seconds and on to 173km/h, which is just short of the 1.4's 10.5-seconds and 182km/h, but noticeably better than the 1.2's 12.9-seconds and 160km/h. In terms of fuel economy and emissions the 0.9 MultiAir's advantage is much more pronounced, with 4.9-litre urban, 3.7l extra urban and 4.1l combined consumption per 100km/h and just 95g/km combined CO2 emissions. By comparison, the manual gearbox 1.2 returns 5.1l/100km combined consumption and produces 119g/km CO2, and the manual 1.4 scores 6.3l/100km combined and 149g/km emissions combined. Responsive and refined With some 25 per cent more torque at 1900rpm than the 1.4-litre 500, the 0.9 TwinAir feels surprisingly confident and modestly swift for its diminutive displacement, and while there is a rich torque band, one enjoys and feels encouraged to use its slick five-speed manual gearbox often and rev the engine right up to 6000rpm often to get the best performance. With good on-the-move and mid-range responsiveness, the 0.9 outclasses its larger stablemates, while a balancer shaft is so effectively used to smooth out the two-cylinder's natural on/off power strokes, one is hard-pressed to notice anything but a slight charismatic gruffness at idle or full load to suggest it's two-cylinder configuration. Featuring recent suspension and steering set-up changes, the Fiat 500 has also become a more comfortable and better planted car and drives more smoothly over imperfect roads, and offers better cabin refinement. A small, light and agile car, the 500 has never been more fun to throw around tight and zig-zagging corners, with a better weighted steering and more feedback complementing the 0.9 engine's lighter front-end weight. Eager to turn-in and tight through a swift corner, the 500 can also be easily controlled when pushed too hard and fast into oversteer, simply by easing off and modulating throttle input. Charismatic city car At it's best zipping through traffic and city streets, the 500 0.9 is manoeuvrable and responsive, and with city mode switched on, its steering becomes lighter but more communicative, while a stop start system deactivates the engine when one comes to a complete stop in neutral and re-fires the twin cylinder when the clutch is depressed, so as to further cut fuel costs. Charismatic, classy and chic, the 500 0.9's cute bubbly and retro-inspired lines and big footprint with a wide track and short overhang give it a feisty, road-hugging and athletic yet urbanised unisex appeal, very much like the hugely popular Mini. Disarmingly charismatic, the Fiat 500's interior is dominated by circular themes and has a chic and quality retro-modern ambiance. Though looking back through rose-tinted glasses, the 500's interior has all the modern trappings of convenience one would need of a contemporary compact city car, as well as comfortable and well-adjustable seats to accommodate even taller drivers. With good in class material quality, the 500's interior is airy, detailed, fun and sporty, with sports steering wheel, an upright driving position, and high-set seats and a sporty gear-lever positioned high in the centre console. With a commanding position, enhanced by its small dimensions and short sloped bonnet, the 500 has good visibility.

In addition, about half of Americans surveyed also believe the government should do more to regulate them. 'Overall, 72% of U.S. adults say social media companies have too much power and influence in politics today, according to the June 16-22 survey Pew's FactTank outlet observed[1] July 22.Even during a polarized election year, Americans across the political spectrum seem to agree that Big Tech needs to be brought to heel, as 'Majorities of both Republicans and Democrats believe social media companies wield too much power.' That said, Republicans are more likely to hold this view as 'Roughly eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (82%) think these companies have too much power and influence in politics, compared with 63% of Democrats and Democratic leaners.'Even liberal Democrats are 'somewhat more likely than moderate or conservative Democrats to agree with this assessment (68% vs. </p><p>60%).' In short, party hardliners of both the left and right share the common cause of calling for Big Tech companies' power to be held in check. The Pew survey appears to show that this is continuation of previously observed trends[2]. A previous survey demonstrated that 'Republicans were more likely than Democrats to believe social media sites censor political viewpoints and that tech companies generally support liberal views over conservative ones.' Yet even so, both sides largely agree that Big Tech is a problem that needs to be dealt with.Within the GOP, even while disagreeing on other matters, voters are largely unified about this issue. The most recent study found that 'nine-in-ten conservative Republicans (89%) think these companies have too much power,' while a slightly smaller majority (74%) 'of moderate or liberal Republicans' largely agree. As a result, one salient development since 2018 that the article makes clear is that 'Conservative Republicans are the only ideological group who have become more likely to favor increased regulation.'This summer has been a crucible of Big Tech controversies, only accelerating the already present tensions of an election year.In late May, Twitter fact-checked President Donald Trump[3] for suggesting that mail-in ballots could lead to voter fraud, a concern even The New York Times has acknowledged to be valid[4]. While undermining the president of the United States, Twitter has racked up an impressive record of liberal bias[5], including allowing blatant Chinese propaganda[6] to be spread among Americans.Facebook censored Trump with a new policy[7] that undermined his posts critiquing the hazards of mail-in voting by placing an interstitial showing users how and where to start the process themselves.Google gave a measly mea culpa[8] earlier this month after several conservative websites were delisted from its general search and appeared to have been blacklisted. Google critic Dr. Robert Epstein[9] wrote that Google gave at least 2.6 million votes to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 and that it could sway 'upward of 15 million votes' in the Democrats' favor in 2020. Google Responsible Innovation Head Jen Gennai was caught in 2018 suggesting that 'breaking up Google' would not 'prevent the next Trump situation.'[10] She also mused how changes in Google's secret algorithms could have prevented his election from happening in the first place.Apple snuck COVID-19 contract tracing technology[11] into one of its phone updates back in May. The technology, in theory, would notify users when they enter the presence of a person with the coronavirus. This despite surveys that have shown[12] that three in five Americans are either unable or entirely unwilling to use the technology.Amazon brushed off concerns about letting an anti-Christian organization like SPLC decide which groups may receive funds, blocking pro-life and pro-family organizations like Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council from receiving funds. MRC President L. Brent Bozell announced that[13] the Media Research Center would no longer accept money from the AmazonSmile program. He declared that 'Any money from Amazon is tainted, hate-filled money that we want nothing to do with.'Conservatives are under attack. This Wednesday, the CEO's of major Big Tech companies, including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify before the House Judiciary Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law Subcommittee[14]. Give the subcommittee a call at 202-225-3951 and demand that Big Tech be held to account.

In addition, about half of Americans surveyed also believe the government should do more to regulate them. 'Overall, 72% of U.S. adults say social media companies have too much power and influence in politics today, according to the June 16-22 survey Pew's FactTank outlet observed[1] July 22.Even during a polarized election year, Americans across the political spectrum seem to agree that Big Tech needs to be brought to heel, as 'Majorities of both Republicans and Democrats believe social media companies wield too much power.' That said, Republicans are more likely to hold this view as 'Roughly eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (82%) think these companies have too much power and influence in politics, compared with 63% of Democrats and Democratic leaners.'Even liberal Democrats are 'somewhat more likely than moderate or conservative Democrats to agree with this assessment (68% vs. </p><p>60%).' In short, party hardliners of both the left and right share the common cause of calling for Big Tech companies' power to be held in check. The Pew survey appears to show that this is continuation of previously observed trends[2]. A previous survey demonstrated that 'Republicans were more likely than Democrats to believe social media sites censor political viewpoints and that tech companies generally support liberal views over conservative ones.' Yet even so, both sides largely agree that Big Tech is a problem that needs to be dealt with.Within the GOP, even while disagreeing on other matters, voters are largely unified about this issue. The most recent study found that 'nine-in-ten conservative Republicans (89%) think these companies have too much power,' while a slightly smaller majority (74%) 'of moderate or liberal Republicans' largely agree. As a result, one salient development since 2018 that the article makes clear is that 'Conservative Republicans are the only ideological group who have become more likely to favor increased regulation.'This summer has been a crucible of Big Tech controversies, only accelerating the already present tensions of an election year.In late May, Twitter fact-checked President Donald Trump[3] for suggesting that mail-in ballots could lead to voter fraud, a concern even The New York Times has acknowledged to be valid[4]. While undermining the president of the United States, Twitter has racked up an impressive record of liberal bias[5], including allowing blatant Chinese propaganda[6] to be spread among Americans.Facebook censored Trump with a new policy[7] that undermined his posts critiquing the hazards of mail-in voting by placing an interstitial showing users how and where to start the process themselves.Google gave a measly mea culpa[8] earlier this month after several conservative websites were delisted from its general search and appeared to have been blacklisted. Google critic Dr. Robert Epstein[9] wrote that Google gave at least 2.6 million votes to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 and that it could sway 'upward of 15 million votes' in the Democrats' favor in 2020. Google Responsible Innovation Head Jen Gennai was caught in 2018 suggesting that 'breaking up Google' would not 'prevent the next Trump situation.'[10] She also mused how changes in Google's secret algorithms could have prevented his election from happening in the first place.Apple snuck COVID-19 contract tracing technology[11] into one of its phone updates back in May. The technology, in theory, would notify users when they enter the presence of a person with the coronavirus. This despite surveys that have shown[12] that three in five Americans are either unable or entirely unwilling to use the technology.Amazon brushed off concerns about letting an anti-Christian organization like SPLC decide which groups may receive funds, blocking pro-life and pro-family organizations like Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council from receiving funds. MRC President L. Brent Bozell announced that[13] the Media Research Center would no longer accept money from the AmazonSmile program. He declared that 'Any money from Amazon is tainted, hate-filled money that we want nothing to do with.'Conservatives are under attack. This Wednesday, the CEO's of major Big Tech companies, including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify before the House Judiciary Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law Subcommittee[14]. Give the subcommittee a call at 202-225-3951 and demand that Big Tech be held to account. If you have been censored, contact us at the Media Research Center contact form[15], and help us hold Big Tech accountable.

An overwhelming majority of Americans are skeptical over Big Tech\u2019s unchecked power, a Pew Research Center (Pew) study has found. In addition, about half of Americans surveyed also believe the government should do more to regulate them. \u201cOverall, 72% of U.S. adults say social media companies have too much power and influence in politics today, according to the June 16-22 survey Pew\u2019s FactTank outlet observed July 22.     Even during a polarized election year, Americans across the political spectrum seem to agree that Big Tech needs to be brought to heel, as \u201cMajorities of both Republicans and Democrats believe social media companies wield too much power.\u201d That said, Republicans are more likely to hold this view as \u201cRoughly eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (82%) think these companies have too much power and influence in politics, compared with 63% of Democrats and Democratic leaners.\u201d    Even liberal Democrats are \u201csomewhat more likely than moderate or conservative Democrats to agree with this assessment (68% vs. 60%).\u201d In short, party hardliners of both the left and right share the common cause of calling for Big Tech companies\u2019 power to be held in check.      The Pew survey appears to show that this is continuation of previously observed trends . A previous survey demonstrated that \u201cRepublicans were more likely than Democrats to believe social media sites censor political viewpoints and that tech companies generally support liberal views over conservative ones.\u201d Yet even so, both sides largely agree that Big Tech is a problem that needs to be dealt with.     Within the GOP, even while disagreeing on other matters, voters are largely unified about this issue. The most recent study found that \u201cnine-in-ten conservative Republicans (89%) think these companies have too much power,\u201d while a slightly smaller majority (74%) \u201cof moderate or liberal Republicans\u201d largely agree. As a result, one salient development since 2018 that the article makes clear is that \u201cConservative Republicans are the only ideological group who have become more likely to favor increased regulation.\u201d    This summer has been a crucible of Big Tech controversies, only accelerating the already present tensions of an election year.     In late May, Twitter fact-checked President Donald Trump for suggesting that mail-in ballots could lead to voter fraud, a concern even The New York Times has acknowledged to be valid . While undermining the president of the United States, Twitter has racked up an impressive record of liberal bias , including allowing blatant Chinese propaganda to be spread among Americans.    Facebook censored Trump with a new policy that undermined his posts critiquing the hazards of mail-in voting by placing an interstitial showing users how and where to start the process themselves.    Google gave a measly mea culpa earlier this month after several conservative websites were delisted from its general search and appeared to have been blacklisted. Google critic Dr. Robert Epstein wrote that Google gave at least 2.6 million votes to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 and that it could sway \u201cupward of 15 million votes\u201d in the Democrats\u2019 favor in 2020. Google Responsible Innovation Head Jen Gennai was caught in 2018 suggesting that \u201cbreaking up Google\u201d would not \u201cprevent the next Trump situation.\u201d She also mused how changes in Google\u2019s secret algorithms could have prevented his election from happening in the first place.    Apple snuck COVID-19 contract tracing technology into one of its phone updates back in May. The technology, in theory, would notify users when they enter the presence of a person with the coronavirus. This despite surveys that have shown that three in five Americans are either unable or entirely unwilling to use the technology.    Amazon brushed off concerns about letting an anti-Christian organization like SPLC decide which groups may receive funds, blocking pro-life and pro-family organizations like Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council from receiving funds. MRC President L. Brent Bozell announced that the Media Research Center would no longer accept money from the AmazonSmile program. He declared that \u201cAny money from Amazon is tainted, hate-filled money that we want nothing to do with.\u201d    Conservatives are under attack. This Wednesday, the CEO\u2019s of major Big Tech companies, including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify before the House Judiciary Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law Subcommittee . Give the subcommittee a call at 202-225-3951 and demand that Big Tech be held to account. If you have been censored, contact us at the Media Research Center  contact form , and help us hold Big Tech accountable.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42698645495</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FT-28M1-JCSC-J2NF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"873\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>NewsBusters</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;
