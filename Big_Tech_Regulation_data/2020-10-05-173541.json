So, it seems, do efforts to protect netizens' privacy. The European Union led the world with its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in May 2018. That law shook up internet giants and global advertising firms, both of which had previously used\u2014and at times abused\u2014consumer data with little oversight. On December 11th India's government introduced a bill that would force firms to handle data only with consumer consent and give the authorities sweeping access to them. The same day Scott Morrison, Australia's prime minister, promised a review of privacy laws and said the competition authority will monitor how advertising is done on digital platforms. But the most important piece of legislation rhyming with GDPR right now is the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which comes into force on January 1st. To online businesses, it jars. </p><p>The Californian law copies some of the GDPR's provisions. It gives consumers the right to know what online information is collected about them and how it is used, permits them to demand that their data be destroyed and to sue companies for data breaches. In some ways, the CCPA is looser than its European predecessor. It does not, for instance, insist that firms have a \"legal basis\" for collecting and using personal data or restrict the international transfer of data. It also stops short of demanding the appointment of corporate data-protection officers and assessments of projects' data-protection risks. And whereas the GDPR lets individuals demand that private information about them be removed from the web under certain circumstances, the First Amendment makes this \"right to be forgotten\" a non-starter in America.</p><p>In other respects, though, California goes further than the EU. The CCPA adopts a broader definition of personal information (which extends to such things as internet cookies that identify users on websites) and it explicitly forbids discrimination (by offering discounts to those who grant firms access to their data). Companies must enable Californians to opt out of the sale of personal data with a clear \"do not sell\" link on their home page, rather than through GDPR's fiddlier process. Michelle Richardson of the Centre for Democracy and Technology, a privacy-advocacy group which is bankrolled in part by big tech companies, calls the CCPA \"ground-breaking\". </p><p>The California law will apply to firms with revenues of $25m or more that do business in the state or process its residents' data, even if not based there. Any for-profit entity anywhere that buys, shares or sells the data from more than 50,000 Californian customers, households or devices a year is also covered. Law-breakers face fines of up to $7,500 for every violation, compared with 4% of global annual revenues or ?20m ($22m), whichever is higher, for the GDPR. But California's relatively trifling ceiling can add up quickly for firms with thousands of users.</p><p>The GDPR's track record suggests the effects of the CCPA will be far-reaching. Some 250,000 complaints have been lodged under the EU rules, and some penalties approach ?100m. If breaking the rules could prove expensive, so is respecting them. The International Association of Privacy Professionals, an industry body, and EY, an accountancy, reckon that complying with the GDPR costs the average firm $2m. Tech firms spend over $3m; financial firms, more than $6m. By one estimate, the total cost to all American firms with more than 500 employees could reach $150bn. </p><p>\"Initial compliance\" with the CCPA may, for its part, cost the estimated 500,000-odd affected American firms $55bn, according to a study commissioned by California's attorney-general. Any such estimates should be taken with a grain of salt. For one thing, global firms that are already GDPR-compliant have a head start, even if differences between the two laws mean abiding by the Californian one will be far from automatic. Big firms, which are already on the hook for GDPR, are expected to spend another $2m each. For the tech giants that looks like chump change. Microsoft and Apple say they are not only ready for CCPA, but also plan to implement it across America. </p><p>For America's legions of smaller online trinket-sellers, app-makers or other firms present on the internet the Californian law will be onerous. They can ignore European regulations, because most have no EU business, but cannot easily stay away from one of America's biggest domestic markets. A new survey by the US Chamber of Commerce, a lobby group, claims that only 12% of small businesses in America know about the law, let alone have prepared for it.</p><p>The impact of the CCPA is being felt beyond boardrooms. Big Tech is lobbying lawmakers in Washington, DC, for a federal statute on the subject. \"We really, really support an omnibus federal privacy law,\" says a data-privacy official at a large American technology company. Facebook and Google do, too, they profess. The US Chamber of Commerce, better known for opposing regulations, is also now in favour. </p><p>One explanation for tech firms' sudden enthusiasm to safeguard user information is their reasonable desire to avert a balkanised mess of contradictory state laws. Illinois, New York and Washington have differing state legislation in the works. Many others are looking into the matter. </p><p>Tech companies could have another motive to back federal rules. Because much online activity crosses state boundaries it falls under federal jurisdiction. A national data law would therefore supersede California's, unless it explicitly made federal rules the floor which states could raise if they wished. A Democratic proposal in the Senate does just this. A rival Republican one would set business-friendlier rules as the ceiling, in effect obviating the CCPA. No points for guessing which one of these America Inc would prefer. Neither is likely to pass before November's presidential elections. Until then companies will need to heed California's data sheriffs. After that, expect a shoot-out. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-5D8BGIT</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSJ-YRD1-DY2R-20P6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1023\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Instead of enduring a long process of requesting proposals, the store's team can enter BBVA's developer portal - a sort of online marketplace - choose the API of a product that meets its needs and start offering its own credit product the same day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The old-world way would be a direct line-to-line connection between the bank and each individual customer,\" said Derek White, BBVA's Madrid-based head of global consumer solutions. \"With an API platform, you can have thousands of companies access that one API, so the speed of connectivity is much faster.\"</p><p>BBVA's rollout is among the most ambitious efforts by banks to gain a foothold in a platform economy that proponents say will change everything from the way bank products are created and marketed to the role a bank plays in its customers' lives.</p><p>Platforms are best thought of as technology-enabled marketplaces that bring buyers and sellers together. They are lauded for the speed, agility, reach and cost-efficiency they can offer.</p><p>KPMG estimates the size of the global platform economy at $7.2 trillion, and it's growing rapidly. Seven of the 10 most valuable companies today - think Apple, Amazon and Facebook - employ platform strategies.</p><p>Companies in industries as diverse as heavy equipment, health care and hospitality are adding digital platforms too.</p><p>Banks have been relative no-shows thus far, mostly because they have more hurdles to clear and potentially more to lose.</p><p>Getting a platform strategy right can require changes to entrenched business models, cultures and back-office infrastructures. Banks must move cautiously to safeguard data and privacy. The jargon - \"banking-as-a-service,\" \"banking-as-a-platform,\" ecosystems and developer portals - is also intimidating and difficult to grasp.</p><p>Ask 10 different chief information officers to describe how banks can or should participate in the platform economy - or even exactly what it is - and you're likely to get 10 different responses.</p><p>\"When you talk about platforms, most bankers will think about their online banking platform or their lending platform. But this is different, and there's no clear definition of the terminologies,\" said Ron Shevlin, director of research at Cornerstone Advisors, a consultant in Scottsdale, Ariz. \"It's a confusing mess.\"</p><p>But with the world of digital platforms upon us, a growing number of institutions are concluding they no longer can afford to sit out the trend.</p><p>\"The biggest companies today are platform companies, and banks are looking to them for lessons on growth and driving value for customers,\" said Don Westermann, CIO at the $11 billion-asset Eastern Bank in Boston, which is tinkering with various platform approaches.</p><p>There's also a worry that if banks don't move quickly to offer platform-based financial products to their customers, then big tech will beat them to it. Bookstores, travel agents and stockbrokers all have seen their businesses disrupted by faster, cheaper platform models, and recent big-tech pressure on the Federal Reserve to build a real-time payments network, for example, is seen as a long-term threat.</p><p>In China, the digital platforms WeChat and Alipay began with real-time payments and have since moved into money market accounts, wealth management and more, an expansion that sparked complaints from bankers.</p><p>\"As we move to platform-based transactions, a lot of the fees banks charge for moving money or paying bills will disappear or be pushed to extremely low levels,\" said Michael Cusumano, a professor at MIT and the author of an upcoming book on platforms.</p><p>\"If I were a banker,\" he added, \"I would be worried.\"</p><p>With time, platforms could dramatically rework bank revenue streams, cost structures, customer acquisition and performance measurement.</p><p>The idea of the bank as the primary distribution channel for products and services that only it has manufactured could go by the wayside. So, too, could siloed sales, organizational structures and customer \"ownership.\"</p><p>Pure platforms are open forums focused on what's best for customers. These platforms don't own products, but generate \"network effects\" - a virtuous circle of evermore participants, with both sides growing in response to the other.</p><p>The success of the ride-sharing platform Uber attracts more drivers, which in turn makes the service attractive to more riders, fueling even more success.</p><p>Few, if any, existing banks are likely to pursue a true platform model, because the industry's underlying dynamics are different. Banks, by definition, are manufacturers of products and services, and seem disinclined to forgo that role.</p><p>But in an age when customers shop for rates and products across the internet, positioning the bank as the center of that financial shopping ecosystem can help it remain relevant.</p><p>\"As the cost of switching banks goes down for customers, platforms allow you to create more stickiness by adding a layer of intelligence, products and services on top of the core business model,\" Westermann said.</p><p>\"The goal is to be something more than the dumb pipes of the financial system,\" he added. \"It's very hard to maintain the value proposition as a simple intermediary in the platform economy.\"</p><p>There are trade-offs to consider. On a banking platform, a customer might choose a third-party product and authorize the bank to share his or her data using an API, much like an iPhone user gets different apps from Apple's app store.</p><p>Running an open platform this way makes a bank more like the \"conductor of a symphony, coordinating partners and customers\" that either provide or purchase that content, said Mark Shilling, U.S. practice leader in banking and capital markets for Deloitte Consulting.</p><p>\"It's not just a loan platform that does debits and credits and services the loans. It's a banking platform, which enables a variety of services from different providers for my client,\" he said.</p><p>Platforms offer banks the ability to use increasingly in-depth knowledge about their customers to help remain at the center of the customer experience, while boosting revenue potential and cutting some expenses.</p><p>In the best case, platforms can be good for all involved. Dominic Venturo, chief innovation officer for U.S. Bancorp, offers the example of working with Blend, a San Francisco fintech company. Using a set of APIs from Blend, U.S. Bancorp can allow potential mortgage borrowers to authenticate bank balances and other loan documentation electronically.</p><p>\"It makes for a better customer experience. Because we're doing the validation without paper, in real time, we can make a lending decision in minutes instead of weeks,\" Venturo said. \"And it's good for us. We're reducing all the data entry, validation, audit and review expenses by ingesting the data directly, and it's a faster time to revenue.\"</p><p>In this case, customers don't necessarily know they are using a Blend API, as the service is offered through the bank seamlessly.</p><p>But with what's envisioned for some marketplaces, customers would be accessing the services of others more directly.</p><p>The downside is that if a bank can't compete on deposit rates or loan products offered by someone else on its platform - by definition, very likely - it would only get a small fee for playing the role of marketplace middleman.</p><p>\"If you're being open and showcasing the best of what the market has to offer, the question is how you offset the cannibalization risk of having your customers choose someone else's products over yours,\" said Alan McIntyre, senior managing director for banking at Accenture.</p><p>\"For many traditional banks, the core asset-liability aspect is going to make it very hard to offer these services without ruining the economics,\" McIntyre said. \"If you make $4,000 a year off the spread on a small-business loan, that's tough to replace.\"</p><p>Conversely, a bank might become a specialist in a niche and market its products on other banks' (or other companies') platforms. Like a Netflix filmmaker, those who create competitive platform content can do well.</p><p>Shevlin tells of one big bank that seems \"more intent\" on embedding its products on other platforms than opening its platform to competitors.</p><p>In the platform world, the battle for customers can be intense and global, and you take what you can get.</p><p>\"The whole idea here is to be able to distribute products and services on both your channels and other channels and expand your footprint,\" said Abhishek Gupta, the San Francisco-based chief executive of the new BBVAOpen Platform, a unit of BBVA Compass.</p><p>For now, innovation labs and IT departments of most big banks (and many smaller ones) are working to figure out how best to capitalize on - or at least avoid being swallowed up by - an evolution spurred by the emergence of faster, cheaper cloud technologies and an explosion of fintech activity.</p><p>They're digesting volumes of consultant reports on the topic, training employees on the nuances of operating in open environments and eying each other - and platform-dependent markets like China - for lessons on how best to operate in this electronic ecosystem. They're also assessing a wide variety of issues, including data security, business models and culture.</p><p>The most ambitious are reconfiguring their technology backbones, in part to allow them to compete in a platform economy. Capital One, for example, is in the midst of migrating its in-house back-office system to Amazon Web Services.</p><p>For banks that want to embrace a platform-based business model, moving to the cloud - with its speed, flexibility and cost benefits - is viewed as basic table stakes.</p><p>\"The challenge is that banks don't have the right infrastructure that platforms need to engage and expand,\" Deloitte's Shilling said.</p><p>Platform models can represent such profound change that a bank's leadership must lead the cultural charge and provide the resources needed to transition to a new business model.</p><p>U.S. Bancorp, which uses APIs in businesses such as mortgage and payments, runs an internal \"API Center of Excellence\" where employees learn to create products that meet rigid process and risk-management standards.</p><p>\"We do internal training and hackathons where we have people spending free time building APIs to get experience,\" Venturo said. \"It's like anything else that's new; folks need to be trained to do it right.\"</p><p>Experimentation is the norm. The space is new enough, and there are so many possibilities of how things might play out, that there's no one \"best\" way to proceed.</p><p>Some are throwing open their own platforms to create a marketplace of solutions - some their own, some from fintechs - that give customers more options.</p><p>BBVA's Open Platform boasts products in six core banking areas, all accessible to customers through APIs. Providers are vetted, and then their software is put on the platform.</p><p>The bank's role is as much a one-stop facilitator of trade as it is a manufacturer.</p><p>White said it's all in response to strong demand from customers. Though only a handful of BBVA business customers were up and running on the platform in December, \"hundreds\" have expressed interest.</p><p>\"We're very much of the view that we will become an Amazon of banking,\" White said. \"We do not own the end-to-end customer experience, nor do we manufacture all the products and services - some of that comes from fintechs in our ecosystem.</p><p>\"It enables the bank to create products and services that are highly personalized and tailored to customer needs,\" he added.</p><p>Others are looking to partner directly with big nonbank platforms like Amazon or Facebook. Reports last spring that JPMorgan Chase was talking with Amazon about partnering on a white-label checking account sparked a round of industry hand-wringing, but don't be surprised if something like that happens eventually.</p><p>Citi has been working in recent years with ecosystems in places like China and India, where the concept is more advanced, looking for lessons on how customers interact with banks in a platform world. It has found, among other things, that customers who access the bank's products through APIs on platforms like WeChat show higher account-opening, usage and loyalty numbers than those who don't.</p><p>\"We see deeper engagement with us through WeChat than through the CitiPay app or website,\" Gavin Michael, head of technology for Citi's global consumer bank, said in an April interview.</p><p>As individual banks scramble to leverage the power of platforms to find a competitive advantage, there's room for creativity. McIntyre predicts a wide variety of \"hybrid\" models will emerge in the next few years, many piggybacking on customers' platform strategies.</p><p>For a community bank without the horsepower to compete on products, the smart play might be to partner with a fintech, or group of fintechs, that have a more compelling array of products and services. Its banking charter and blessing from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. are advantages that fintechs lack, at least for now.</p><p>\"There will still be value in the charter and the FDIC insurance, but they're not going to originate a lot of their own assets and liabilities,\" McIntyre said. \"They will become a balance sheet for rent.\"</p><p>At the $4 billion-asset Live Oak Bank in Wilmington, N.C., CEO James \"Chip\" Mahan dreams of using his bank's platform to provide bank accounts to the customers of online stock traders. \"How could we partner with a company like that to give its customers an FDIC-insured account?\" he asked.</p><p>Mahan also said that Live Oak, a branchless bank, aims to grow an already sizable veterinary lending business by using APIs to incorporate its services into the three practice-management software systems widely used by veterinarians.</p><p>\"With an open API core, we can bundle our products with the solutions offered to every veterinary practice in America,\" he said. \"Bank accounts and loans are commodities in the platform world. You need partners to thrive.\"</p><p>At Eastern Bank, Westermann's team has been working on a platform strategy that focuses on placing the bank at the center of a community, connecting customers with each other.</p><p>It might be promoting a discount to retail customers who use an Eastern credit card at a hardware-store client, or creating an app that brings together an office supply store with a group of bank customers to get bulk discounts.</p><p>Eastern also has a growing set of \"ancillary products\" for small businesses on its platform, such as a \"digital assistant\" that uses artificial intelligence to predict cash flows and sharpen a client's understanding of its customers' behaviors.</p><p>\"It's about augmenting the basic banking experience by leveraging the power of the network,\" Westermann said. \"As technology brings the costs of switching banks down for customers, we want to use technology to create more stickiness in the relationship.\"</p><p>Especially for smaller financial institutions, the work and potential expense behind pursuing even a partial platform approach can sound daunting. As the model becomes more popular, platform companies have emerged to help them get involved.</p><p>Constellation Digital Partners in Raleigh, N.C., was started by a consortium of credit unions to provide these small institutions with access to newfangled online and mobile apps in simple plug-and-play fashion. The company, which plans to allow other credit unions to join in the near future, claims that its services are unique because other such platforms are designed to serve a single financial institution - such as in the case of BBVA's Open Platform.</p><p>Constellation's platform acts as a secure bridge between fintechs and less-techie institutions, helping participants \"try things without needing to buy $400,000 in servers to figure out it doesn't work,\" said CEO Kris Kovacs.</p><p>The same model could apply to community banks, Kovacs said.</p><p>\"A community institution can spin things up and wind them down as needed. It gives the opportunity to experiment without making big investments, and helps fight the idea that those community institutions can't provide the latest technology,\" he said.</p><p>A growing number of banks are using platforms to drive sales. Shevlin points to LendKey, a student-loan platform that helps create and aggregate demand. LendKey allows banks to use their strengths, such as underwriting and risk management, while not having to pay high marketing costs.</p><p>\"There are benefits in platforms, but most of them are less about the bank becoming a platform and more about leveraging platforms to lower customer acquisition costs,\" Shevlin said.</p><p>There was a time, 20 years ago, when the industry didn't know what to make of the internet hype, but eventually it figured things out. The same will happen with platforms. And as with the internet, the impact could be profound.</p><p>As platforms continue to generate profits, headlines and confusion, banks are likely to feel greater pressure to jump into the fray. While they might not be able to avoid some disruption, they shouldn't panic.</p><p>\"Things are changing and you should educate yourself,\" Cusumano said. \"But in a regulated industry like banking, it's more of an evolution than a revolution.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USBANK-225250-2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USBANK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VB4-7K71-F06X-W0PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8066</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

It follows a contentious, but failed, attempt by foreign shareholders to elect some new independent directors to Toshiba's board at the July 31 meeting.<br/><br/>3D said voting rights representing a 1.1% stake in Toshiba were not reflected in the results of the meeting, according to an Aug. 9 letter from the hedge fund to Toshiba's outside directors seen by Reuters.<br/><br/>The fund, which holds a 4.2% voting stake and ranks among Toshiba's top five shareholders, had nominated two candidates as independent directors and publicly said it would vote against chief executive Nobuaki Kurumatani.<br/><br/>\"Such administration of shareholders meetings by Toshiba including the manner of processing voting forms was at least improper and was questionable from the viewpoint of corporate governance,\" 3D said in the letter. \u2013 Nampa/Reuters<br/><br/>Sanofi to buy Principia Biopharma<br/><br/>French healthcare company Sanofi SA has agreed to buy US company Principia Biopharma Inc for around US$3.7 billion, the companies saidyesterday, strengthening Sanofi's presence in research and development (R&amp;D) areas.<br/><br/>Sanofi will buy the outstanding shares of Principia for US$100 per share in cash, according to the joint statement, representing an aggregate equity value of around US$3.68 billion on a fully diluted basis and a premium of 10% to Principia Biopharma's stock closing of US$90.74 on Aug. 14.<br/><br/>Sanofi said the acquisition of Principia Biopharma, which develops therapies for serious immune diseases, would strengthen its research capabilities in areas such as autoimmune and allergic diseases.<br/><br/>\"This acquisition advances our ongoing R&amp;D transformation to accelerate development of the most promising medicines that will address significant patient needs,\" said Sanofi chief executive officer Paul Hudson.<br/><br/>Sanofi said it expected to complete the acquisition of Principia Biopharma in the fourth quarter of 2020.\"The merger will provide global resources to get these novel therapies to patients faster,\" said Martin Babler, president and chief executive officer at Principia Biopharma. \u2013 Nampa/Reuters<br/><br/>Google goes public with rebuke <br/><br/>Internet giant Google criticised proposed Australian antitrust laws, saying its free search service would be \"at risk\" and users' personal data could be shared if it is made to pay news organisations for their content.<br/><br/>The Alphabet-owned company said the proposed laws would also help big media companies artificially inflate their search rankings, luring more viewers to their platforms and giving them an unfair advantage over small publishers and users of Google's YouTube streaming website.<br/><br/>The statement, advertised on Google's main search page, marks an escalation of tensions between big tech companies and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) which has called for sweeping changes to rein in how Google and social media titan Facebook Inc use local content and consumer data.<br/><br/>\"You've always relied on Google Search and YouTube to show you what's most relevant and helpful to you,\" Google Australia managing director Mel Silva wrote in the open letter. \"We could no longer guarantee that under this law.\"<br/><br/>The proposed law \"wouldn't just impact the way Google and YouTube work with news media businesses, it would impact all of our Australian users\" she wrote. \u2013 Nampa/Reuters<br/><br/>Geely Automobile profit fell<br/><br/>China's Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd said on Monday first-half net profit fell 43%, as the coronavirus outbreak slammed the brakes on auto sales in the world's biggest market.<br/><br/>Geely, China's highest-profile automaker globally due to the group's investments in Volvo Cars and Daimler AG, posted January-June profit of 2.3 billion yuan (US$331.37 million), versus 4.01 billion yuan in the same period a year prior.<br/><br/>Revenue fell 23% to 36.82 billion yuan, Geely said. The result compared with the 36.89-billion-yuan average of three analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.<br/><br/>Geely earlier this month maintained its annual sales target of 1.4 million vehicles set in January, shortly after the coronavirus outbreak was first reported in China at the end of 2019. <br/><br/>On Monday, it trimmed the target by 6% to 1.32 million vehicles. Sales last year reached 1.36 million vehicles. It sold 530,446 vehicles in January-June, around 19% lower than its total over the same period last year. \u2013 Nampa/Reuters<br/><br/>CanSino wins vaccine patent<br/><br/>China's vaccine specialist CanSino Biologics Inc has won a patent approval from Beijing for its Covid-19 vaccine candidate Ad5-nCOV, state media reported, citing documents from the country's intellectual property regulator.<br/><br/>It is the first Covid-19 vaccine patent granted by China, state-owned newspaper People's Daily reported on Sunday.<br/><br/>The paper cited documents published by China's National Intellectual Property Administration saying that the patent was issued on Aug. 11.<br/><br/>Saudi Arabia said this month it plans to begin Phase III clinical trials for the CanSino vaccine. CanSino has said it is also in talks with Russia, Brazil and Chile to launch phase III trials in those countries.<br/><br/>CanSino's Hong Kong shares rose around 14% in Monday's morning session. Its Shanghai shares rose by 6.6% as of midday. \u2013 Nampa/Reuters</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/637/1808/16/159774789999.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/637/1808/16/159774789999.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NAMSUN-182336372</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NAMSUN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MB-G9J1-JDJN-654S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428553</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 NHM.

His New York start-up, once seen as a potential savior for journalism, cut roughly 220 staffers this year, the latest sign of turmoil in the digital media sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BuzzFeed, which generated more than $300 million in sales last year, is unprofitable. But Peretti, a founding shareholder, plans to take the company to profitability later this year as it continues to balance hard news and lighthearted memes, mixed in with advertising and marketing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are challenges ahead for the company, which has raised $497 million from investors, including NBCUniversal.</p><p>Facebook and Google, which run platforms where BuzzFeed and other digital media companies distribute their content, could potentially face government regulation, which could affect the algorithms and content on their platforms. BuzzFeed's news division is also seeking unionization.</p><p>Peretti, 45, spoke on Thursday from BuzzFeed's L.A. office. This interview was edited for length.</p><p>Why were the layoffs necessary?</p><p>It's something that on a personal level is the worst thing you have to do as a CEO, but it was a necessary thing to do in order to get the company's cost structure to be in line with the marketplace. In broad strokes, we're seeing a lot of improvement in the revenue that is coming from the big platforms, but not enough to have been able to continue forward without making some cost reductions.</p><p>How do you plan to bring the company to profitability?</p><p>The big thing is focusing on the things we're uniquely good at doing. The stuff that has really grown for us has been big partnerships. Probably the most well known example is [BuzzFeed's food network] Tasty which was generating no revenue on Facebook, even though it was the biggest media page on Facebook. We had to figure out our own ways to generate revenue and the partnership with Walmart was a good example of saying, 'OK, let's have a 100 sku [stock keeping unit] line of kitchen products that are for sale at every Walmart. Let's put those products into every Tasty video so that when people are watching the Tasty video they can see the products.' We have figured out ways to do things that Google [and] Facebook can't do -- things that are more creative [and] more strategic that cut across different businesses and are really solving business challenges.</p><p>The platforms are hungry for content. If you can create really good content at high scale, the economics are now to the point where that kind of activity can be profitable for a company like BuzzFeed. We're helping Amazon sell a lot of products through our shopping posts.</p><p>We're making videos that people love that have pre-roll or mid-roll [ads] on them. We're making articles or stories that have programmatic [ads] on them. Because of our scale, operating efficiency, our brand and other factors, and because the economics have improved on the big platforms, all of that taken together makes that an interesting, profitable business.</p><p>Your business still relies on these partners, like Facebook and Google. Do you feel like they're paying you enough for the content that you provide them?</p><p>I think it has improved a lot. [For example] our fill rates on YouTube have gone up. YouTube has had some high-profile examples of people who were in Google Preferred who did some offensive content so they are pulled out. [That] means that more of the premium content that we're making, there is less supply of that, which has helped our fill rates go up.</p><p>If you think about the glory days of cable, where the cable companies had consolidated to a point where the cable operators really needed their content, there was at least more balance [in negotiations]. The thing that is tricky about the current environment with the big tech platforms is ... you can count on one hand the companies that are having a huge impact on the media industry. Within digital media there is tremendous fragmentation across a lot of different companies. So you have a negotiation that is basically between a $500-billion market cap company and then some digital media companies that are worth less than 1% of that. It's hard for content to get paid fairly because of that.</p><p>The irony of it, though, is it ends up hurting the big platforms. The business model for fake news works, but the business model for news is a lot more challenging and unless the marketplace is managed more aggressively, they are not going to get the mix of content that supports all the things that will help them in the long run build a strong audience.</p><p>They are starting to understand this, and we're headed toward a better place, and we're seeing the CPMs [cost per thousand impressions] and fill rates going up. They have started to wake up to the fact they don't want to cut off the oxygen supply of the companies that are making things that actually people go to the platform for.</p><p>In the past you mentioned one solution to this is M&amp;A, these digital media companies joining together to better negotiate. Is that still a possibility for your company?</p><p>I think it's possible to achieve some of the same benefits without M&amp;A. Certainly if it was the right thing, buying another company that could add to what we're doing would make sense.</p><p>Some have compared BuzzFeed to Yahoo. Yahoo at its peak was involved in a lot of different things. Is BuzzFeed spread too thin?</p><p>We're focused on being a good digital media company and having diversified revenue is part of that. The diversification is really a strength. You want to find ways that the things you're doing support each other and reinforce each other. Our commerce business and our advertising business are very complementary. People come to BuzzFeed and they are looking for stories to read. Especially around holidays, they are looking for things to buy. Those things support each other. When our audience gets bigger, the commerce business does better, the advertising business does better.</p><p>Having disconnected things that don't help you is something we try to get out of. For example, we had this Homesick Candles business [which sold candles that smelled like peoples' home states]. Owning that business, even though it was a good business, didn't make sense for us. You had to manufacture and warehouse candles and ship candles. So we sold that business and have moved to more licensing models that actually make more sense.</p><p>Where do you see BuzzFeed News fitting into your overall business?</p><p>News has a lot of special qualities to it. You can't really treat news like any other content business. The stakes are higher, the impact you can have on the world is higher. For the business side, it has also been something that's been really strong in extending into studio development and making new kinds of shows. We have \"AM to DM\" on Twitter, a new one coming to Snap. We have a great Oxygen show based on a true crime story that a reporter covered and we produced the show.... News is something that drives a lot of repeat visiting, which is important. It's a time when people are intensely focused on the news for a lot of reasons.</p><p>Where do you see BuzzFeed News' role in pushing the boundaries?</p><p>What's amazing right now, everything is so polarized ... [and] even things that happened that were uncontroversial in the past for a news organization to publish all of a sudden become battlegrounds. It's hard to imagine publishing any scoop or news story or disclosing documents to the public and not have it be something that someone is going to get upset about. We have this crazy war between the president and the press, and between the different parts of the media industry and different camps on Twitter.</p><p>In the past, you've mentioned how you don't see unions as being a good fit at BuzzFeed. Now, you have members of BuzzFeed News trying to organize a union. Are your views on unions still the same?</p><p>Forming a union is a decision that employees make. It's not a decision that CEOs make. I really value my employees. A lot of people who found companies have a real different relationship to how they think about employees. You tend to have a mindset of 'we're all in this together and our interests are aligned and we're fighting for the same thing.'</p><p>That mindset is one of the reasons why to me it feels like there's better ways for direct communication to more flexibly and directly deal with some of the things unions can address in companies.</p><p>If you had to go back, knowing what you know now about BuzzFeed's business, what are things that you would change and do differently?</p><p>This is not a shock, but obviously our costs got too high in certain areas where the business logic didn't end up sustaining it.</p><p>In some cases, I thought that the platforms would want to move content up-market to make higher-quality content sooner than they did. And basically that they would reward higher-quality content with more production, and they really haven't. They have really stayed true to the 'I'm going to take a look at the data and see what users like and if that video costs $1 to make, that's fine and if the video costs $100,000 to make, that's fine.' That was one area where we increased the production value of certain things we were doing thinking that would be the place where YouTube or Facebook was headed, and that was not really true.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: BUZZFEED is \"focused on being a good digital media company and having diversified revenue is part of that,\" CEO Jonah Peretti says.

This is 'CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where the time is 7:00 in the evening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we start this hour with a story that affects pretty much everyone watching this show. And touches pretty much everything from politics to all of our personal lives. It's often said that if you're not paying for a product, then you are the product. Today, we are connecting the dots of data undermining democracy through social networks marketed as a force for good.</p><p>At the forefront, Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics company best known for its work on President Donald Trump's campaign. A former employee has gone public with claims that the firm obtained the details of 50 million Facebook users. They're a name we all know. Facebook, the world's biggest social media firm, accused of hiding a massive harvesting of personal data. And at the center, we have you and me and the impact it will have on our lives and even our democracies. A journalist from the U.K.'s channel 4 news posed as a possible client to obtain secret footage of executives at Cambridge Analytica. In this video the managing director of the company's political division, Mark Turnbull, describes the companies approach. Have a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK TURNBULL, MANAGING DIRECTOR, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: The fundamental human drivers when it comes to taking information on board effectively are hopes and fears, and many of those are unspoken and are even unconscious. You didn't know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked that reaction from you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Very good.</p><p>TURNBULL: And our job is to get -- is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else. To understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. It's no good fighting an election campaign on the facts, because actually, it's all about emotion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, Cambridge Analytica has sent CNN a statement rejecting the allegations made in channel 4's reporting. It says the report is edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of the conversations that took place. They say that their executives entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios, end quote.</p><p>Well, CEO Alexander Nix said he is aware of how this looks but it is simply not the case when the reporter posing as a prospective client turned the conversation to entrapment and corruption. The executives left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again.</p><p>Nix added, I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes, or so-called honey traps, and nor does it use untrue material for any purpose. I should have recognized where the prospective client was taking our conversations and ended the relationship sooner, he said.</p><p>Let's look at the global implications of all of this. CNN's Laurie Segall is in New York to talk about the impact on Facebook users and CNN's Isa Soares is in London. And let me start with you there Isa. Cambridge Analytica is accused of weaponizing personal data and selling it to the highest bidder and U.K. authorities want answers. What's happening there?</p><p>ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Not just U.K. authorities, European authorities, European Parliament too wants answers, Parliamentarians, we also lawmakers. As you quite rightly said, Becky, anyone who uses Facebook wants answers. They want to know how they got consent. How they used their data. In the last few hours, we have heard from MP Damian Collins who chairs the culture, media, and sports committee and he wants Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg -- until now has been silent -- to come to the U.K. and testify.</p><p>[11:05:02] He also wants Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica -- the firm just behind me -- to testify once more. And the reason I say once more, Becky, is because he testified last month. And last month, he actually said he's never used Facebook data, he's never worked with Facebook data. At the same time, a warrant is expected to be issued sometime today to Cambridge Analytica to come and get all their data, to come and get all their hard drives. To which Cambridge Analytica's replied it is willing to cooperate and is compliant and proactive.</p><p>Becky, this is a huge turn of events. A fall from grace for a company that's really prided itself on really profiling psychologically profiling each person but also critically winning the election for U.S. President Donald Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES (voice-over): Met the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, nine days before the U.S. presidential election in 2016. A man confident he could get inside the mind of American voters by predicting and then attempting to alter their behavior.</p><p>ALEXANDER NIX, CEO, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: I think the data's extremely robust and proven to be so time and again.</p><p>SOARES: His data helped this man win. U.S. President Donald Trump, who paid multimillion dollars for them to work their magic. But behind their winning method is more than just data crunching. It's a massive data grab. So, says their former contractor now turned whistleblower, Chris Wylie.</p><p>CHRIS WYLIE, FORMER CONTRACTOR, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: We spent almost $1 million doing this. It wasn't some tiny pilot project. It was the core of what Cambridge Analytica became. It allowed us to move into the hearts and minds of American voters in a way that had never been done before.</p><p>SOARES: And this is what Wylie says they did. Cambridge Analytica received data from a third party, a Professor Alexander Kogan based at the University of Cambridge, who was able to gather data on tens of millions of Americans through Facebook. And then using a survey placed on Facebook, they asked users to take a personality test. The answers grouped people on their personality types.</p><p>They combined it with voter history, what they buy, where they shop, and what they watch on TV. And that enabled them to predict a personality of every adult in the United States and then target them with specific political ads. But it goes further. By opting into these Facebook surveys, each user was actually giving not just their data but many of their Facebook friends.</p><p>WYLIE: It was a grossly unethical experiment. Because you are playing with an entire country, the psychology of an entire country without their consent or awareness.</p><p>SOARES: Speaking to the U.K. Parliament committee on data protection of fake news back in February, Cambridge Analytica denied they violated Facebook's terms.</p><p>NIX: They work with Facebook data. We don't have Facebook data. We do use Facebook as a platform to advertise, as do all brands and most agencies, all agencies, I should say, and we use Facebook as a means to gather data.</p><p>SOARES: The attention now turns to Facebook and how it reportedly allowed a data breach on this scale.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: As I've said from the beginning --</p><p>SOARES: And more importantly, how it was used to reach and influence voters ahead of the 2016 presidential election. In a statement, Facebook says the claim that this is a data breach is completely false and that those involved certified they had destroyed the data. Meanwhile, it says it's suspending the accounts of Chris Wylie, Cambridge Analytica, as well as Professor Alexander Kogan, who did not respond to our request for comment. If anything, it's shined a light on the dark heart of political advertising.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: And Becky, Cambridge Analytica has said today to CNN that it did not use any Facebook data in the 2016 presidential election but be prepared for more questions to be asked. Tomorrow is another expose by channel 4 is due later on today that looks at the links between Cambridge Analytica and U.S. President Donald Trump -- Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: Isa Soares is in London. Stand by for me there. Laurie, Facebook says it has over 2 billion -- billion -- monthly users. That is more than a quarter of the world's population. And just under 1.5 billion use the site, we are told, every day. What is the impact here on the average user?</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN TECH SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's a good question. I think we're all wondering how are we being targeted? I mean, this is a company whose business is our data. Who has built its business on us liking things on Facebook. On building a profile of who we are and what we saw with Cambridge Analytica and how successful they were with it. We really don't know, but they talk about this idea of psychometric targeting. They talk about this idea of targeting us as users, not based on our age or demographic but on inherent personality traits and messaging us with certain types of ads. That to appeal to us because we live in a certain place, but they are supposed to appeal to us because we are certain types of people. Because maybe we're more agreeable or angry and to have certain very specific message tailored to that.</p><p>I spoke to one researcher who said within 300 likes on Facebook, he could figure out -- he could know more about you than your spouse would know about you. I mean, that's an extraordinary statement. And I think we're just beginning to wrap our heads around that.</p><p>And I've been talking to sources at Facebook and they say there are a lot of ethical debates happening behind the scenes when it comes to online political advertising. Because there isn't regulation right now in this field and you know, where they're saying, how much -- when does micro- targeting turn into manipulation. Should there be this type of targeted advertising? I think that something we're going to hear come out of this. But as users, I think we're all scratching our heads and saying, what are we seeing? How are we being targeted and are we being manipulated?</p><p>ANDERSON: It's fascinating, isn't it? As long as social media has been around -- and let's remember there was a day back in the day when there wasn't any social media. But let's talk about the last decade or so. The industry -- Facebook and the industry have been absolutely determined that they are responsible enough to self-regulate. That is now in question. Isn't it? And right now, Facebook is staying pretty quiet. What is going on inside the company?</p><p>SEGALL: Oh, I think it's fascinating what's happening inside the company because all of us want to hear from Mark Zuckerberg or Cheryl Sandberg. These are the brand names of Facebook. These are names that are known around the world. But what's interesting is talking to top level executives inside the company, Becky. A lot of executives are saying, where is Mark in front of this. He's behind the scenes but we need him to be the face of this crisis. We need him to speak more openly. There's one top level executive told me, you know, there's this consensus that he's not really getting his hands dirt at a time when he really kind of needs to.</p><p>And there's this idea that he went last year around the world. He traveled to all different countries and the United States on a bit of a tour to get outside his Silicon Valley filter bubble. And there's a sense inside of Facebook he has his own communication team. He's in his own filter bubble and they're protecting him from really trying to tarnish the brand or putting himself out there. And there's a lot of tension within it. People saying you need to get out in front of these issues. You need to get out there more openly.</p><p>And by the way, Becky, these issues are not black and white. They do not have easy answers. There are a lot of ethical questions and ethical debates happening behind closed doors that deserve a public dialogue. Because they impact, you talk about those 2 billion monthly users, they impact all of us. So, these decisions, we want to have a better look at it. We want Mark or Cheryl or more executives speaking openly and more candidly ahead of it as opposed to what we're seeing now, where it's after the fact, crisis mode.</p><p>ANDERSON: Yes, I can't think of many other companies where you associate its founder with the company. I mean, Mark Zuckerberg, to many, many people is Facebook. Briefly, what's been the impact on the company? This is a publicly listed company.</p><p>SEGALL: I mean, the company taking a hit. I think you have investors worrying about this. And I think you have a multibillion dollar business when you look at their revenue model, when you look at their advertising model, it's inherently tied up in the use of our data. You know, you even look at the time well spent movement. Recently I was at Facebook interviewing their vice president of news feed who was talking about, you know, we need to get users actually off the platform and taking a little bit more time for themselves and using it in a more positive way. I said, won't that impact the business? And he said, yes, but we're willing to take a hit.</p><p>I think this is going to be a very interesting year for Facebook. I think, you know, this era of good intentions has turned into an era of unintended consequences, and we're going to see the business take a hit and some hard questions about the way this company was inherently built -- Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: Laurie Segall's on the story out of New York for you. Back to London and let's repeat, Tuesday, Cambridge Analytica tweeting, no Facebook data was used by our data science team in the 2016 presidential campaign. What's the future for this company at this point?</p><p>SOARES: Well, that is very much up in the air. And the CEO, Alexander Nix, when he made that statement to CNN, grossly saying that the channel for peace was edited grossly misleading. So, you have to think of all the employees that he worked in. He's even said in a piece today for the \"Times\" newspaper that if needs to step down to ensure the survival of the company, he will, Becky.</p><p>[11:15:02] But you know, following on from that expose last night and perhaps the one coming out tonight, where they paint a picture of themselves, of ghosting in and ghosting out as they're saying, with very dirty tactics, really, in which they prey on people's hopes and fears. I mean, this is something that has people here spitting feathers. The fact, they said he doesn't have to be believed. It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be believed. This is reverberating right around the U.K. as these words come out here. So, no doubt that what is issued tonight goes beyond just the data, Becky, but exactly the ethics behind this company.</p><p>ANDERSON: Isa Soares is in London on a company that prides itself, sells itself on discretion and its reputation. This cannot be good news.</p><p>And there is, of course, a Washington connection here as we have been discussing. Donald Trump's campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June of 2016 to help with its data operations. By August, former Cambridge Analytica vice president, Steve Bannon, would become the CEO of the Trump campaign. And as we know, Bannon later briefly served as White House chief strategist after Mr. Trump won the election.</p><p>A whistle blower who worked for Cambridge Analytica said some remarkable things to CNN about slogans the company was testing as far back as 2014. Have a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WYLIE: We were testing all kinds of messages and all kinds of imagery that included, you know, images of walls, people scaling walls. You know, we tested drain the swamp. You know, testing ideas of the deep state and the NSA watching you and the government is, you know, conspiring against you. And a lot of these narratives, which at the time would have seemed, you know, crazy for a mainstream candidate to run on, those were the things that we were finding that there were pockets of Americans who this really appealed to. And Steve Bannon knew that because we were doing the research on it. And I was surprised when I saw the Trump campaign started talking about building walls or draining the swamp. And I'm remembering in my head, wait, we tested this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: A Democratic lawmaker calling on that whistle blower to testify before the House Intelligence Committee in Washington as part of its investigation into Russian election meddling and -- sorry, let me repeat his name. Adam Schiff wants Christopher Wylie to give more details about how Facebook data was allegedly misused, where that data was stored, and whether third parties accessed and exploited the information, including in Russia.</p><p>Well, clearly this is an incredibly important story. It is complicated. But we are doing our utmost, as ever, on this show to break it down for you. One big question running through running through all of what is this intricate story is a truly democratic election even possible in the digital age? More on that in a little later in this broadcast.</p><p>Coming up tonight, powerful man from the east is making a royal visit to the West Wing. How Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince is building relations one U.S. city at a time.</p><p>[11:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, it's 20 past 7:00 in the UAE. You are watching CNN. This is CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson for you.</p><p>It is his first visit to the White House since becoming Saudi's crown prince. Now, Mohammed bin Salman is making the first leg of what is an ambitious charm offensive in the United States. First, Washington and then six other cities over the course of the next two weeks. Some of the thorniest issues in the Middle East on the agenda include Russia's role in the region, the Yemen conflict, and of course, Iran. The Saudi ambassador to the U.S. spoke to my colleague, Wolf Blitzer, a little earlier. Have a listen to some of what they discussed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRINCE KHALID BIN SALMAN, SAUDI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: Iran represent the number one threat to the region. The number one threat to the international security. They are continuing to escalate with their activities in the region and they have currently, as they have said, they have launched 95 ballistic missiles into Saudi Arabia, including our capital. And this is unacceptable. So, just imagine if there is a terrorist militia in the United States borders launching ballistic missiles to Washington, New York, and Texas. This would be also, unacceptable to any American citizen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: That is Prince Khalid bin Salman, the ambassador to Washington, the Crown Prince's brother. The Crown Prince also vying for more investment in his country after an anticorruption crackdown that has left investor morale shaken. CNNMoney emerging markets editor -- it's always difficult to say that. I should just say John Defterios joins me. You all know who he is. My colleague John.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNNMONEY EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: You're not the first person that said that.</p><p>ANDERSON: Listen, Mohammed bin Salman has arrived in Washington. We will see him at the White House within the next hour or so. He is hoping to achieve a number of things. What in Washington, the United States?</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Well, I would almost put it into two different buckets. One's a geopolitical bucket, and the other one is business. Let's cover the politics first and foremost. You've heard the ambassador to Washington from Saudi Arabia, his younger brother, suggest Iran tops the list. This is a regional foe. The reason I think it's very important at this meeting is because they see this as a window of opportunity, former Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, is out of the way. Mike Pompeo is going to be the nominee and sit before Congress. There's very little difference between Pompeo's position and President Trump's position. And therefore, taking a step further, very little difference between Mohammed bin Salman and President Trump.</p><p>They even want to take a hard line. They're pushing for the May 12th deadline on the sanctions. We have to watch that space very carefully. It'll change the dynamic in the Middle East as you very well know with the UAE backing Saudi Arabia here and it'll change the dynamics of the sanctions and the ability of Iran to export oil.</p><p>The other thing I think is added to the list now is the twist with Russia on the table because of the pivot from Riyadh to Moscow in 2017. They have a $20 billion gas deal that's on the table. Moscow has been willing to put money into a private placement for Saudi Aramco. There is an idea here that President Trump could say to Mohammed bin Salman, I thought we were close partners, we had that meeting in May of 2017 and signed contracts here. Aren't you going to put pressure on Moscow to come our way on Iran and Syria. You can see the tradeoff behind closed doors.</p><p>ANDERSON: It was interesting. I remember when we had this discussion around about the time when the Saudis were in -- when King Salman was in Moscow. And I remember you put it to one of your sources, are we seeing a pivot. At the time, they said, listen, we'll do business with whoever we want to. There wasn't necessarily -- there was no real message, they said, but now who knows in the world of global politics and diplomacy. But what about foreign investment? What about the cash? Because Donald Trump wants to make America great again.</p><p>[11:25:00] How can the Saudis help? And in turn, how can Washington and the rest of these big cities and businesses in the States help to make a new Saudi?</p><p>DEFTERIOS: OK, it's a little bit of payback I think for Mohammed bin Salman here. He signed those defense contracts in May of 2017 for $100 billion. This is what brought Donald Trump and Mohammed bin Salman closer together.</p><p>ANDERSON: To help make America great again.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Of course. And Jared Kushner, of course, was very instrumental behind the scenes, the son-in-law, to bring those two together. Why there was success at the meeting. This is a coast to coast visit. This is a big tour for Mohammed bin Salman. He needs to convince people that the crackdown on corruption is now behind them. It can allow international investors. U.S. investors to come in and they'll be protected. That's strategically important.</p><p>I find it interesting he's going to finish in Houston where there's, of course, lots of oil and gas. Saudi Aramco is a big investor in Texas, a big trader, a big refiner in the United States, so Aramco's there. And that's the $2 trillion question on the table right now. When and where? When, probably, is going to be in early 2019 from the sources I've been speaking to. Where is a tough job? Donald Trump is suggesting New York stock exchange. Sources inside that I spoke to in Riyadh today, said look, too risky in New York, perhaps London and Hong Kong, private placement that I talked about in Russia and China. One thing is for certain, Khalid al- Falih, the minister of energy told me last week, we're going to lead out with Riyadh in the home Market. Let's first listen to him and then we can wrap it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KHALID AL-FALIH, SAUDI OIL MINISTER: The only thing we know today is that the Dow will be the key listing location as our national exchange. And we're waiting for the reforms to be in place and to join the MSCI. And Aramco listing into Dow will be catalytic for that capital Market as we bring international capital into the kingdom.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Catalytic for the market. That market doesn't even have $500 billion of market cap. So, it's not deep enough to handle Aramco on its own. MSCI is the emerging market ranking system. They may clear it in June, that means they would be ready in early 2019. Hence the delay of the IPO probably to 2019. We know Donald Trump's quite the salesman, Becky. Can he turn this around and say New York's going to be safe for the kingdom and for the Crown Prince to have bragging rights to go on Wall Street? I think that's a tough sell internally in Aramco.</p><p>ANDERSON: Fascinating times. John, across this story as John pointed out, Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, makes his way across America. Well, that first meeting with Donald Trump set to take place in a little over half an hour. We'll be all over that for you bringing you the very latest as it happens. That's in Washington. Stay with us for that. Mr. Defterios, thank you.</p><p>Let's get you up to speed there on some of the other stories that are on our radar today.</p><p>And in the U.S. state of Maryland, three people have been injured in a school shooting. Students are being evacuated from the Great Mills High School, the local sheriff's office says the event has been contained.</p><p>Well, the U.S. state of Texas is on edge after an explosion outside San Antonio. Officials say a package exploded at a FedEx facility. No one was seriously hurt. Officials say they don't know if this is connected to four bombings in the Austin area.</p><p>And 23 Russian diplomats are returning home from Britain. U.K. Prime Minister, Theresa May, expelled them last week in response to the use of Russian nerve agent on British soil. The Kremlin has denied involvement in that attack.</p><p>Well, the U.S. says military exercises with South Korea will begin April 1st. That is before possible talks between Donald Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. The annual military operation will involve about 300,000 troops. North Korea has, in the past, considered it a provocation.</p><p>So, what is involved in laying the groundwork for what is this possible Donald Trump/Kim Jong-un meeting? You can find out about that and get updates on many other stories at our website. That is CNN.com.</p><p>Still to come on telly, hidden cameras capture the CEO of Cambridge Analytica making, well, quite frankly, some startling remarks about how to disrupt elections. We'll have more of that expose from Britain's channel 4 just ahead.</p><p>[11:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON: You're with CNN. This is CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson. Welcome back.</p><p>I want to get you back to our top story, the powerful combination of data and disinformation, weaponized to disrupt Democratic elections around the world. As incredible as it may seem, a British based company is facing allegations that it did just that. With the help of harvested information from unwitting Facebook users. Cambridge Analytica, best known for its work on Donald Trump's campaign, is also under investigation in the U.K. for possible links to the \"Leave EU\" movement. Remember that Brexit referendum back in 2016? Well, that's what we're talking about here.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica promising to share information with investigators and says it does not use untrue material for any purpose. But an undercover investigation appears to tell a very different story. We had part of the expose by Britain's channel 4 earlier. Here's another clip of that where a hidden camera captures the CEO of Cambridge Analytica discussing how bribes and sex workers could be used to entrap a candidate in a democratic election. Have a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And what we want to know is what is the expertise of the deep digging that you could do to make sure that the people know the true identity and secrets of these people.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: Oh, we do a lot more than that. I mean deep digging is interesting, but you know, it can be effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that's too good to be true and make sure that that's video recorded. You know, those sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption and putting it on the internet.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the operative you will use for this is who?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: Well, someone known to us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, so it is somebody, you won't use a Sri Lankan person.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: No, no we'll have a wealthy developer come in, somebody posing as a wealthy developer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A master of disguise.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: Yes, they will offer a large amount of money to the candidate to finance his campaign in exchange for land, for instance. We'll have the whole thing recorded on cameras. We'll blank out the face of our guy and post it on the internet.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, on Facebook or YouTube, or something like this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: Send some girls round to the candidate's house. We have lots of history of things.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For example, you're saying when you're using the girls to introduce to the local fellow, and you are using the girls for this, like the seduction? They are not local girls, not Sri Lankan girls.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: I wouldn't have thought so, no. We'll bring some, I mean, that was just an idea. Just saying we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us, you know what I'm saying?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. They are very beautiful Ukrainian girls.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: They are very beautiful. I find that works very well.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, Cambridge Analytica has sent CNN a statement rejecting the allegations made in Channel 4's reporting. It says the report is edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent of the conversations that took place. They say their executives, quote, entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios, end quote. CEO Alexander Nix said he is aware of how this all looks, but it is simply not the case, he says, when the reporter posing as a prospective client turned the conversation to entrapment and corruption, the executives left with grave concerns and did not meet him again.</p><p>Nix added, I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes, or so-called honeytraps and nor does it use untrue material for any purpose. He said, I should have recognized where the prospective client was taking our conversations and ended the relationship sooner. He said.</p><p>Well, our next guest is Phillip Howard. He's a professor with the Oxford Internet Institute. Part of a study that found Twitter and Facebook have become, and I quote, vessels of propaganda and manipulation. Professor, you've studied the use of data by companies like Cambridge Analytica as well as other forms of profiling, what you call manipulation online and across social media. What have you found, and how?</p><p>PHILLIP HOWARD, PROFESSOR, OXFORD INTERNET INSTITUTE: Well, we've found that it's a very big business, that millions of voters are profiled by firms like Cambridge Analytica and then those profiles are used to send direct political messages and often misinformation to voters in the days before they have to vote.</p><p>ANDERSON: So, what you're saying is Cambridge Analytica and the allegations against the organization are by no means unique, correct?</p><p>HOWARD: That's correct. It's quite a large industry. Cambridge Analytica is one of the most high-profile firms at the moment because they supported Trump's bid for the presidency.</p><p>ANDERSON: You have warned that much more has to be done to stymie what you call the tide of break news. Like what?</p><p>HOWARD: Well, it's probably time for social media firms to give more information to election commissions. Here in the U.K., Cambridge Analytica is under investigation by the election commission, as you mentioned, for its involvement during Brexit. It would be fairly straightforward for firms to provide an archive of political ads after a campaign so that we can all see how political micro targeting actually works.</p><p>ANDERSON: Let me just take a look at why all of this matters and remind our viewers why it all matters and what Facebook does with users' data. When we talk about users, I'm talking about the millions, in fact, 2.5 billion people around the world who use the site regularly. It sells personal information to advertisers and developers. Those can include age, location, political affiliation, likes, your info is bundled with others and stripped of names. Advertisers use information to target audiences.</p><p>HOWARD: Right. And that --</p><p>ANDERSON: Are you talking about the need to -- go on?</p><p>HOWARD: Well, that information will get married with credit card records, with census data. It will get married with any information that political parties might have on you, on your giving history, and all that's used to create a profile of how safely conservative or safely liberal you are or it will be used to identify you as an undecided, and then if they think you're undecided, they'll figure out what push points, what pressure points will move your opinion in a particular direction.</p><p>[11:40:00] ANDERSON: So, the NSA whistle-blower that many of our viewers will remember, Edward Snowden, tweeted Saturday saying, in short, Facebook is a surveillance company rebranded as social media. Is this going too far? And if it isn't what should be done?</p><p>HOWARD: Well, it certainly is a surveillance company in that most of this data is actually bought and sold for the advantage of advertisers. So, it's usually used -- these complex psychographics are used to sell you soap, to sell you consumer goods. It's only a small fraction of the business that involves politicians. That's just the unseemliest side of it all.</p><p>I think Facebook is a surveillance company. That's what their business model is based on. And in an interesting way, these Silicon Valley firms have the best data on public life the way libraries used to have data, or the government census used to have the best data on what we wanted as citizens, what we wanted for our democracies. Now it's social media firms that have the best data on the public.</p><p>ANDERSON: How damaging is this to democracy?</p><p>HOWARD: I think it's quite damaging. It means that large amounts of misinformation can be concentrated. We found in our own research that large amounts of misinformation was concentrated in swing states in the United States during the 2016 election, and I think it's important to spend time thinking about what happened during Brexit and what happened during November 2016, but at this moment, there are several other countries around the world, South Africa, Hungary, there's elections coming up in Egypt, democracy in India, Indonesia, Brazil, there's many democracies around the world where these same tricks that have been plied on the U.S. and the U.K. are now being plied in elections are under the world.</p><p>ANDERSON: Sir, is it too late to regulate these behemoths? For a decade or more now, as long as they've been in existence, they have said, don't worry about us, we're in it to win it, we're in it for good, it's all about the public. We don't need any regulation. Is that -- even if the governments decided to regulate these organizations now, is it too late?</p><p>HOWARD: It's not too late, and I think there's a growing consensus among policymakers that the moment for industry self-regulation has passed. The trick will be not to overregulate. So just as bad as having firms monopolize large amounts of data would be having governments regulating content in a deep way. There's a variety of policy mechanisms some governments are thinking about, some thinking about -- are thinking about anti-trust action. Some are thinking about content regulations. Probably the content regulations are not the way to go.</p><p>ANDERSON: Somebody recently suggesting that data is like the new oil as A.I. is like the new electricity. It's absolutely Fascinating. Let's see what happens next. Professor Howard, thank you for your insight. We've been talking about the crisis of trust over these Facebook revelations during this show, and that triggered Market losses for other big tech companies as well, along with Facebook's 7 percent tumble on the Nasdaq, Amazon, Netflix, and Google also fell.</p><p>Besides rattling investors, Britain's House of Commons and the U.S. Senate are demanding answers from Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, about the secret harvesting of data from 50 million Americans, allegedly to help data firms' clients manipulate the U.S. elections. The public relations nightmare also triggering pushback from Facebook users. CNNMoney correspondent Paul La Monica is joining us now with more on the big question of how we deal with data going forward, Paul?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I think this is going to be the big question, Becky. A lot of people are wondering what will Facebook do to respond to this crisis, and I think it's safe to call it one at this point. Will the company will forced to have Mark Zuckerberg and other senior executives appear in front of Congress and legislative bodies in Europe as well, to take bigger -- to talk about the bigger steps that they're going to take to safeguard user data and privacy?</p><p>Because we are talking about global elections that potentially have been swayed because of what has happened with regards to Facebook. These are obviously very serious concerns and Wall Street is finally taking it seriously as well. Facebook stock is down sharply again today.</p><p>ANDERSON: The problem is, Paul, that these companies are all about data, and that's how they run their businesses. So, any regulation, any clamp down on privacy, surely, that will massively affect the businesses that are these social media behemoths going forward.</p><p>[11:45:00] LA MONICA: Definitely. Facebook is, first and foremost, a new media company. It is an advertising company, even though they have taken some steps to diversify their revenue stream beyond advertising and marketing, we know that Facebook it is like the old TV networks if you will. I mean, this is a company that really relies on selling ads, and that is probably not going to change any time soon, and I think that's why there are worries about Google as well, because Google, as a search company, also owns YouTube, has also become part of this bigger question of just what data can potentially marketers have access to.</p><p>ANDERSON: I think one of the biggest problems with all of this, and the reason why this is shocking people so much, Paul, is that you say we know what these companies are. So many people around the world will say, well, we sort of know, but we didn't really realize how commoditized we were. Look, were going to close it out at this point, so I need to take a break. We'll have you back. This is absolutely fascinating, and as I've said a number of times this hour, this is not going away.</p><p>Thank you. Live from Abu Dhabi, this is CONNECT THE WORLD. Coming up tributes are pouring in for this one of a kind creature. The world says farewell to the last male Northern White Rhino.</p><p>ANDERSON: It's about 10 to 8:00 here in the UAE. Welcome back. A few more minutes to go, and during that time, I want to get you to a story about more than the death of an animal. We are essentially seeing extinction in front of our eyes. The world's last northern male White Rhino has died in Kenya. His handlers at the Nature Conservancy said 45- year-old Sudan had an amazing personality like a gentle giant. Farai Sevenzo, joining us now from a conservation park in Kenya with more on what is this sad milestone. And the challenge for scientists trying to protect this and other highly endangered species.</p><p>FARAI SEVENZO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Becky. This is a critically endangered animal. There are different species of rhinos, you've got the Black Rhinos, You've got the Southern White Rhinos and the Northern White Rhinos and that is the place Sudan came from. It was called Sudan because he was born there in 1973 and then his life took a turn.</p><p>In 1975, he was captured and sent to a Czech zoo, which was then Czechoslovakia and that, Becky, is what ironically saved his life.</p><p>[11:50:00] Because here in Africa, all his relatives were being poached, there were wars all over the Congo and basically the rhinos in this sub species were dying out by the score. In fact, now, science is trying to see if they can meet the cutting edge of new technology, biological technology, use similar kind of inventions and the whole idea of IVF for wild animals. It's a very exciting time for these scientists. They're trying to fuse conservation and science by harvesting the eggs of the two remaining females behind us and then using Sudan's sperm, and then baby putting all of that together in a surrogate Southern White Rhino surrogate mother. It's exciting time for science, but of course we all know why we have come to this point, Becky.</p><p>Poaching has been unhindered. People actually believe that the rhino horn from the far east is some kind of medicine. Some people were using that rhino horn as handles for daggers in the Yemen. So really, after 55 million years in existence, it's just took 200 years to wipe out this rhino.</p><p>ANDERSON: And lest we forget, Farai, for anybody out there who thinks the industry of poaching has been not done ahead. You say what?</p><p>SEVENZO: Oh, absolutely. That is not the case. Really, if you think about the poverty levels that Africans have, many more people are being captured every day. Many poachers are being sentenced to life sentences in jail as far as afield as Zimbabwe, Zambia, of course here in Kenya. Massive wildlife country, they still have that problem.</p><p>Game rangers have lost their lives to these people. And of course, because of the money involved, they've upped their game. They're moving around with GPS trackers, using sophisticated weaponry. It's not over yet for the rhino and at this particular conservancy, they're doing their best to keep them alive.</p><p>ANDERSON: Farai Sevenzo at the conservancy park where the last rhino of that ilk has passed away. Farai, always a pleasure. Thanks, mate.</p><p>More ahead, including what is a very special new year celebration.</p><p>ANDERSON: Just time tonight for your parting shots. This is the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere, but it has added significance for many people around the world. This is the Persian New Year or Norooz. It's a festival celebrated with food and other traditions. Have a look at this.</p><p>[11:55:00] I'm Becky Anderson. That was CONNECT THE WORLD from the team here in Abu Dhabi, and London and those working with in Atlanta, it is a very good evening. Thank you for watching. CNN, of course, continues after this short break.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018032001cbk29</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RX9-NJS1-JB20-G02P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6991\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 20, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The investigation, which is seeking confidential information from Canadian businesses, will include a particular focus on \u201cpotential abuse of dominance,\u201d the watchdog said.     \u201cThe bureau is examining whether Amazon is engaging in conduct on its Canadian marketplace, Amazon.ca, that is impacting competition to the detriment of consumers and companies that do business in Canada,\u201d the agency said in a release Friday.   Specifically, it is reviewing whether Amazon policies impact sellers\u2019 willingness to offer their products at a lower price on other retail channels, such as their own websites or rival online marketplaces.     jetcityimage via    The bureau is also looking into any efforts by Amazon to tilt consumers toward its own products over those offered by competing vendors, as well as any disadvantage that sellers incur by opting out of Amazon\u2019s shipping, customer relations and advertising services.   Amazon said it is co-operating with the bureau\u2019s probe and will continue working to support small businesses that sell products on Amazon.ca.   The investigation is ongoing and there is no conclusion of wrongdoing at this point, the bureau said.   The agency\u2019s request for public input comes amid rising concerns of monopoly power in the tech world and questions around the use of sellers\u2019 data to create rival products.   Last month, CEOs from some of the biggest U.S. tech titans faced tough questions from congressional lawmakers over market dominance and whether they need to be regulated more heavily, or even broken up.   The potential conflict of interest between Amazon\u2019s role as both a platform to sell goods and a seller of goods itself remains a key area of concern.   \u201cThe main issue, which came up at the congressional hearing in July, is that Amazon can collect data on its \u2018competitors\u2019 \u2014 i.e. sellers who use Amazon \u2014 and then develop products that compete with those sellers,\u201d said Kean Birch, who heads York University\u2019s graduate program in science and technology studies, in an email.  Cautionary tale  Birch pointed to the cautionary tale of Diapers.com, which Amazon elbowed out of the market by discounting rival brands on Amazon.com in 2009 before buying up the depleted online retailer the following year.   Restrictive contractual provisions between Amazon and the sellers in its online marketplace may also be under the Competition Bureau microscope.   \u201cIf I\u2019m some kind of competitor to Amazon \u2014 Adidas or Nike, say \u2014 one way I could compete would be to say, \u2018Hey, because of my lower cost structure, I\u2019ll be able to sell products to consumers at lower prices,\u2019\u201d said John Newman, a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer who now teaches law at the University of Miami.   \u201cBut if Adidas can\u2019t sell any products on its website or elsewhere at a lower price than it sells on Amazon (due to contractual terms), then it makes it harder to do that.\u201d   The outcome may be to drive prices down in the near term \u2014 the opposite of traditional monopolistic goals \u2014 but they could rise down the road as power concentrates in the hands of a dominant player.   \u201cThis kind of thing could suppress competition, prevent some innovative new company from entering the market and deprive us of all the wonderful but intangible benefits of innovation,\u201d Newman said in an interview.   In July 2019, the European Commission launched a formal antitrust investigation into Amazon to examine whether its data use violates competition rules. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have also opened investigations into the four Big Tech companies \u2014 Google, FacebookApple and Amazon \u2014 to suss out whether they were engaging in monopolistic activities.   The Competition Bureau probe, which kicked off quietly early this year, could result in a negotiated settlement or a case before the Competition Tribunal \u2014 if the investigation uncovers any contravention of Competition Act provisions.   \u201cRemedies under these provisions are primarily behavioural, including ordering an action to be taken or prohibiting an action from being taken, but can also include administrative monetary penalties,\u201d spokesman Jayme Albert said in an email.   It declined to confirm whether a broader investigation of other Big Tech companies is ongoing, \u201cas the bureau is required by law to conduct its work confidentially.\u201d   This report by The

But experts in copyright law and digital media don't expect Canada to follow suit - at least not any time soon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence, France's competition bureau, ruled last week that Google must negotiate a repayment agreement with news companies and publishers for using their content. The ruling stems from a November 2019 complaint from two unions representing press publishers and a French-headquartered news agency, that claimed Google displayed their content unfairly in snippets on its service, costing them important revenue.</p><p>\"The Competition Bureau is aware of this decision ... (but) regarding the conduct in question, it would be inappropriate for the bureau to speculate as to whether it may represent a contravention of (Canadian law),\" Marcus Callaghan, a spokesperson for the Canadian regulator, said in a statement Monday.</p><p>\"The bureau must conduct a thorough and complete examination of the facts before deciding whether to challenge any type of alleged conduct.\"</p><p>According to the complainants, search engines - largely Google - represent between 26 per cent and 90 per cent of their redirected traffic. Google's display policy meant publishers had to allow Google to display article extracts, photos and more without compensation - otherwise they wouldn't be displayed at all.</p><p>This meant publishers and news agencies had no choice but to comply with Google's display policies because they would otherwise lose income in a sector already facing a bleak economic outlook, the French regulator ruled.</p><p>Google's actions amounted to \"an abuse of a dominant position, and caused serious and immediate harm to the press sector,\" according to the regulators' statement. Google must now negotiate a new arrangement with French publishers within three months to repay them for \"reuse of their protected contents,\" including retroactive payments dating to Oct. 24, 2019.</p><p>Dwayne Winseck, a professor at Carleton University's school of journalism and communication, said Google's past approach - giving media companies the choice between displaying their content for free, or losing traffic through Google's powerful service - amounted to \"no choice at all.\"</p><p>\"That's an imposition (Google has) been able to make on the base of its market power. So I see the (Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence) decision as a counter to that,\" Winseck said in an interview Monday.</p><p>Winseck said he doesn't expect Canadian regulators to come to a similar conclusion in the short term. But he said they're at least aware of the problem, pointing to the findings of a government-commissioned independent review into Canada's media and communications environment released in January.</p><p>That review panel - chaired by industry veteran Janet Yale - recommended a new regulatory system to govern the relationship between big tech companies and \"content producers.\"</p><p>\"Canadians are increasingly accessing news online through social media platforms, which facilitate the sharing of content ... without any form of compensation to the journalists and media outlets that created the content,\" the report reads.</p><p>\"The problem is exacerbated by the imbalance in negotiating power between the dominant social media platforms and the great number of creators who actually produce the news.\"</p><p>But Michael Geist, a University of Ottawa law professor and leading researcher on internet and e-commerce issues, said the French regulators' ruling could establish a system where Google and other internet platforms must pay publishers - even if they don't use that publisher's content on their sites.</p><p>\"I think (the decision) raises some concerns about essentially deep government interference in a marketplace, when I think there are other approaches that could be used (to support publishers),\" Geist said in an interview.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2020041457733759</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YNF-J211-DY91-K35H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"660\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have also opened investigations into the four Big Tech companies - Google, FacebookApple and Amazon - to suss out whether they were engaging in monopolistic activities.</p><p>The Competition Bureau probe, which kicked off quietly early this year, could result in a negotiated settlement or a case before the Competition Tribunal - if the investigation uncovers any contravention of Competition Act provisions.</p><p>\"Remedies under these provisions are primarily behavioural, including ordering an action to be taken or prohibiting an action from being taken, but can also include administrative monetary penalties,\" spokesman Jayme Albert said in an email.</p><p>It declined to confirm whether a broader investigation of other Big Tech companies is ongoing, \"as the bureau is required by law to conduct its work confidentially.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 14, 2020.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-03b534e31d614458a1a2fd9e3b8f25fd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KP-GYF1-JBVR-30BS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"741\"/><timeReceived>04:57 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 14, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The investigation, which is seeking confidential information from Canadian businesses, will include a particular focus on \u201cpotential abuse of dominance,\u201d the watchdog said.    \u201cThe bureau is examining whether Amazon is engaging in conduct on its Canadian marketplace, Amazon.ca, that is impacting competition to the detriment of consumers and companies that do business in Canada,\u201d the agency said in a release Friday.    Specifically, it is reviewing whether Amazon policies impact sellers\u2019 willingness to offer their products at a lower price on other retail channels, such as their own websites or rival online marketplaces.    The bureau is also looking into any efforts by Amazon to tilt consumers toward its own products over those offered by competing vendors, as well as any disadvantage that sellers incur by opting out of Amazon\u2019s shipping, customer relations and advertising services.    Amazon said it is co-operating with the bureau\u2019s probe and will continue working to support small businesses that sell products on Amazon.ca.    The investigation is ongoing and there is no conclusion of wrongdoing at this point, the bureau said.    The agency\u2019s request for public input comes amid rising concerns of monopoly power in the tech world and questions around the use of sellers\u2019 data to create rival products.    Last month, CEOs from some of the biggest U.S. tech titans faced tough questions from congressional lawmakers over market dominance and whether they need to be regulated more heavily, or even broken up.    The potential conflict of interest between Amazon\u2019s role as both a platform to sell goods and a seller of goods itself remains a key area of concern.    \u201cThe main issue, which came up at the congressional hearing in July, is that Amazon can collect data on its \u2018competitors\u2019 \u2013 i.e. sellers who use Amazon \u2013 and then develop products that compete with those sellers,\u201d said Kean Birch, who heads York University\u2019s graduate program in science and technology studies, in an email.    Birch pointed to the cautionary tale of Diapers.com, which Amazon elbowed out of the market by discounting rival brands on Amazon.com in 2009 before buying up the depleted online retailer the following year.    Restrictive contractual provisions between Amazon and the sellers in its online marketplace may also be under the Competition Bureau microscope.    \u201cIf I\u2019m some kind of competitor to Amazon \u2013 Adidas or Nike, say \u2013 one way I could compete would be to say, \u2018Hey, because of my lower cost structure, I\u2019ll be able to sell products to consumers at lower prices,\u201d\u2019 said John Newman, a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer who now teaches law at the University of Miami.    \u201cBut if Adidas can\u2019t sell any products on its website or elsewhere at a lower price than it sells on Amazon (due to contractual terms), then it makes it harder to do that.\u201d    The outcome may be to drive prices down in the near term \u2013 the opposite of traditional monopolistic goals \u2013 but they could rise down the road as power concentrates in the hands of a dominant player.    \u201cThis kind of thing could suppress competition, prevent some innovative new company from entering the market and deprive us of all the wonderful but intangible benefits of innovation,\u201d Newman said in an interview.    In July 2019, the European Commission launched a formal antitrust investigation into Amazon to examine whether its data use violates competition rules. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have also opened investigations into the four Big Tech companies \u2013 Google, FacebookApple and Amazon \u2013 to suss out whether they were engaging in monopolistic activities.    The Competition Bureau probe, which kicked off quietly early this year, could result in a negotiated settlement or a case before the Competition Tribunal \u2013 if the investigation uncovers any contravention of Competition Act provisions.    \u201cRemedies under these provisions are primarily behavioural, including ordering an action to be taken or prohibiting an action from being taken, but can also include administrative monetary penalties,\u201d spokesman Jayme Albert said in an email.    It declined to confirm whether a broader investigation of other Big Tech companies is ongoing, \u201cas the bureau is required by law to conduct its work confidentially.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

We can't just go off on a jag of our own.\"</p><p>In this regard, the Bureau is encouraging market participants to schedule meetings with the Bureau to discuss the issues.</p><p>\"We're willing to hear from all quarters, including people who believe there is no cause for concern,\" he says.</p><p>In a general sense, what the Bureau wants to know is whether the characteristics of certain digital markets favour concentration - a process called \"tipping\", which emerges from a combination of the network effects of a widely used product (such as Facebook), economies of scale and access to huge databases.</p><p>The Bureau also wants to define the extent to which anticompetitive strategies may have contributed to the success of leading players. The Bureau's list of such strategies includes protecting core markets, capturing adjacent markets, refusals to deal, self-preferencing, margin squeezing and creeping acquisitions.</p><p>At stake is nothing less than the long-term viability of current practices in core digital markets, including online search engines, social media, display advertising, app stores and services such as ride-hailing. Still, both the Information Technology Association of Canada (ITAC) and Facebook have made public their willingness to co-operate with and be accountable to Canadian and other regulators.</p><p>\"ITAC welcomes the Canadian Competition Bureau's focus on targeting anticompetitive conduct in the digital economy,\" said Angela Mondou, the organization's president and CEO, in a email response to questions from Financial Post. \"It's important to note that the tech industry is always ready to co-operate with government.\"</p><p>Mondou went on, however, to add a note of caution.</p><p>\"It's important that government of all levels find a clear balance between being too prescriptive and setting clear rules for the tech of the future,\" she said. \" Industry should adhere to policies; and government must establish clear guidelines.</p><p>While many other stakeholders - particularly traditional media - have welcomed the call-out, critics have suggested that Canada is late to the game.</p><p>In the U.S., enforcement actions against Big Tech are already a reality: 50 states'attorneys general have recently announced antitrust investigations involving Google and Facebook. In July, the European Commission launched an antitrust investigation of Amazon.</p><p>At about the same time, Australia's competition regulator produced a 600-page report that recommended increased regulation of Facebook and Google and the creation of an algorithm that determines what appears in users'news feeds and search results.</p><p>But it's not as if the Competition Bureau has been standing still on digital issues.</p><p>\"We've been very much involved in the worldwide debate on the role of competition regulators in the digital economy,\" Boswell says. \"In fact, we were one of the authors of the G7 data paper that announced competition authorities'general understanding of the issues raised.\"</p><p>As it turns out, the Bureau has been on the digital economy case for several years - and showing no reluctance to go after the big fish.</p><p>As far back as January 2015, BCE Inc. paid a $1.25 million penalty after staffers posted deceptive online reviews. In January 2017, Amazon paid $1.1. million to settle an investigation into misleading pricing representations online. Rental car companies Avis, Hertz, Discount Car Rentals and Enterprise paid a total of $5.95 million in administrative monetary penalties in 2018 to settle allegations of \"drip-pricing\" practices (which occurs when companies offer low prices upfront but add in additional mandatory fees or charges later in the purchasing process).</p><p>Most recently, the Bureau reached a settlement of its first merger challenge ever involving software companies. The impugned transaction involved the acquisition of Canadian software company 3ES Innovation Inc., carrying on business as Aucerna, by a U.S. private equity firm, Thoma Bravo LLC. The Bureau alleged that the merger resulted in a substantial lessening of competition in the market for reserves software aimed at Canadian oil and gas producers. As part of the settlement, Thoma Bravo agreed to sell one of the two software products in issue.</p><p>\"The call-out is just one further step in prioritizing digital economy matters in accordance with our vision for the Bureau as set out in our annual plan,\" Boswell says.</p><p>The consultation period ends Nov. 30. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

And second, the issue to be focused on isn't the quantity of competitors in the market, but the quality of competition.</p><p>Now, it's still not exactly clear what the ACCC wants to look at next, what form its next inquiry into the market will take, and when it will occur.</p><p>Any big bang inquiry, such as the ACCC's examination of the mortgage pricing that was ordered by then-treasurer Scott Morrison in May 2017 and made its final report in December 2018, will need a tick from current Treasurer Josh Frydenberg.</p><p>And it's understood that Frydenberg is more focused on ensuring credit is flowing to the housing sector just now, given the rather fragile state of economic growth.</p><p>Still, considering the ACCC got more funding in 2017 to set up a permanent financial services unit, we shouldn't be surprised that chairman Rod Sims wants to do more.</p><p>The first point of unity from the two banking chiefs this column spoke with - on inquiry fatigue - is well made.</p><p>The sector argues that over the past five years there have been four big inquiries that have looked into competition, or at least touched on adjacent issues: David Murray's Financial Systems Inquiry, which reported in 2014; the Productivity Commission's look at competition in the Australian financial systems, which reported in August 2018; the aforementioned ACCC inquiry and the Hayne commission.</p><p>That the big banks have enough on their plates responding to these previous inquiries is not surprising. But it was the regional bank CEO who was most dreading the work involved in another inquiry.</p><p>Indeed, he suggested that these inquiries actually hurt competition in and of themselves, given the bigger banks could more easily absorb the cost and distraction required to formulate appropriate responses.</p><p>The second point - that regulators should be more worried about the quality of competition than the number of competitors - is more nuanced.</p><p>Sims told a parliamentary committee last week that \"even though you've got some quite big players outside the big four, it's not clear that any of them are really displacing any of the big four or making serious inroads''.</p><p>But the view from within the banks is very different.</p><p>Our big four chief says the mortgage market - which is now really the only prize as the big four simplify themselves - is currently ultra-competitive and the majors are giving ground.</p><p>The statistics from the year to June 30 show that while the big four's market share is still dominant at 75.1 per cent, this has retreated from 76.2 per cent.</p><p>This share has been mainly taken by the so-called challenger banks - led by Macquarie Bank, Members Equity Bank, AMP Bank and three foreign challengers - ING, HSBC and Citigroup - which have had their overall share rise by 70 basis points to 8.7 per cent.</p><p>Meanwhile, the non-bank sector's market share has risen to 6.2 per cent from 5.8 per cent.</p><p>Perhaps more interesting is the momentum enjoyed by some of these challengers versus the big four.</p><p>As of June 30, the majors were increasing their mortgage books at 0.57 times the growth of the entire banking system, well down from 0.81 times a year earlier.</p><p>But the challengers are growing at 3.4 times the system, up from 2.06 times a year earlier. The non-banks are also growing at 2.85 times, up from 2.33.</p><p>There are some fascinating moves among the challenger cohort. For example, HSBC is growing at 12.16 times system, up from 4.75 times at June 30, 2018. And Macquarie is growing at 3.62 times, up from 2.51.</p><p>Obviously, these challengers' loan books remain tiny compared with the big four. And Sims is right that it's far too early to claim that any of them are making \"serious inroads\" into the market position of the big four, particularly given their huge customer bases.</p><p>But it does appear that the fight for new loans is intense - and that's before any neobanks really get going, and big tech giants such as Apple and Amazon make the market forays that everyone expects over the longer term.</p><p>Our regional bank chief would also like to finally see some movement on the changes to capital rules that would call for regional banks to hold much higher levels of capital against their home loans than the big ones.</p><p>These changes were recommended by the Murray inquiry and rubber-stamped by the productivity inquiry, but there's been little movement.</p><p>While the regional banks do concede their size does require them to hold more capital than the big banks, seeing this gap closed is much more important to them than yet another inquiry that might not hand down its findings until 2021.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520184367</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3T-C651-JBJ7-N00T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><timeReceived>10:07 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

They actually have to commit an antitrust violation. They have to do something that's anticompetitive as opposed to competitive.</p><p>\"[If] they become successful even to the extreme of monopolising a market, if they have done it legally, we shouldn't then turn around and penalise them for success because that creates bad incentives. We want companies to be competitive and produce better products and cheaper prices.\"</p><p>The comments come as Google faces a competition investigation by 50 state attorneys general, which began by looking at its advertising arm but expanded in November to examine its search and Android smartphone software businesses.</p><p>The EU has so far taken the most decisive action against technology companies, fining Google $1.7bn (\u00a31.3bn) last March for favouring its own shopping service on its search engine, a decision which the company is appealing.</p><p>That sanction was the third such fine the European Commission has imposed on the company since 2017.</p><p>In July last year the FTC and Justice Department divided up oversight of big US technology companies, with Mr Simon's agency overseeing Amazon and the Justice Department taking charge of Google.</p><p>Later in the month the Justice Department announced a wide-ranging review looking into whether Silicon Valley's biggest players had broken competition law.</p><p>Mr Simons vowed over summer to take tough measures to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/18/googles-advertising-stranglehold-threatened-big-tech-crackdown/\">limit the reach of big tech</url>, but now appears to have significantly softened his stance.</p><p>Asked in August if he would consider breaking firms up to boost competition, he said: \"If you have to, you do it. It's not ideal because it's very messy. But if you have to you have to.\"</p><p>Silicon Valley companies have become a key topic in the Democratic presidential race, with former frontrunner Senator Elizabeth Warren calling for them to be broken up.</p><p>Firms such as Facebook, which began as a social media app, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/18/googles-advertising-stranglehold-threatened-big-tech-crackdown/\">have become powerful advertising and data businesses with multiple brands</url> and plans to expand into banking and consumer hardware products.</p><p>Along with Google and Twitter, Facebook has also faced a storm of criticism for its impact on democracy by creating a forum for untruths to spread rapidly among voters.</p><p>E-commerce website Amazon has faced criticism for its control over the vendors which sell on its site, who have to compete against its own-brand products.</p><p>In the UK, the business has come under heavy fire for squeezing out traditional bricks and mortar retailers while legally limiting its tax bill.</p><p>In Las Vegas, Mr Simons also suggested that the EU's flagship privacy law, GDPR, had \"entrenched\" big tech companies and negatively affected competition.</p><p>He said he supported efforts to introduce a country-wide privacy law in the US but said any legislation should be careful to avoid damaging smaller businesses.</p><p>The regulator said: \"One of the things that we have talked to Congress about is doing privacy legislation in a way that doesn't reduce competition.</p><p>\"One of the things we are particularly worried about is legislation that would essentially entrench the big dominant tech platforms and disadvantage the new players and the small guys.</p><p>\"There's some evidence that GDPR is having that impact, so that's something we should be concerned and be careful with any privacy legislation that Congress would adopt.\"</p><p>While big technology companies have the resources to prepare for new regulation, some evidence suggests that small businesses have struggled with the burden of complying with GDPR ever since the law was introduced in May 2018.</p><p>Data from Stifel, an investment bank, suggests that Facebook and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/18/googles-advertising-stranglehold-threatened-big-tech-crackdown/\">Google parent Alphabet now take almost 80pc of the money spent globally on online advertising</url>, up from 64pc in 2018.</p><p>Mr Simons said he was concerned about the impact of stricter data laws on smaller businesses, who may require information for advertising or for developing artificial intelligence.</p><p>He said: \"If you require opt-in consent for every piece of personal information then you might be in a situation where you are dramatically impacting the effectiveness of the advertising markets, you might be dramatically impacting the ability of small firms and new entrants to get data that they need from data brokers, so they don't have to do it themselves.</p><p>\"If you have a regime where it's very hard to have data brokers at all, then you could be seriously disadvantaging the smaller players and the new entrants.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-59343267</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYP-C6R1-JCJY-G15D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><timeReceived>9:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 12, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

They have to do something that's anticompetitive as opposed to competitive.</p><p>\"[If ] they become successful even to the extreme of monopolising a market, if they have done it legally, we shouldn't then turn around and penalise them for success because that creates bad incentives. We want companies to be competitive and produce better products and cheaper prices.\"</p><p>His comments come as Google faces a competition investigation by 50 state attorneys general, which began by looking at its advertising arm but expanded in November to examine its search and Android smartphone software businesses. The EU has so far taken the most decisive action against technology companies, fining Google $1.7bn (\u00a31.3bn) last March for favouring its own shopping service on its search engine, a decision which it is appealing against.</p><p>In July last year the FTC and Justice Department divided up oversight of big US technology companies, with Mr Simons' agency overseeing Amazon and the Justice Department taking charge of Google.</p><p>Later that month the Justice Department announced a wide-ranging review looking into whether Silicon Valley's biggest players had broken competition law.</p><p>Mr Simons vowed over the summer to take tough measures to limit the reach of big tech, but now appears to have significantly softened his stance.</p><p>Silicon Valley companies have become a key topic in the Democratic presidential race, with former frontrunner Senator Elizabeth Warren calling for them to be broken up.</p><p>Firms such as Facebook, which began as a social media app, have become powerful advertising and data businesses with multiple brands and plans to expand into banking and consumer hardware products.</p><p>Along with Google and Twitter, Facebook has also faced a storm of criticism for its impact on democracy.

This person will work closely with\u00a0a second lawyer we are hiring\u00a0to focus on consumer protection, privacy, content moderation, intermediary liability,\u00a0etc. Together, these two scholars will study, document and combat the so-called \u201cTechlash.\u201d They will join our existing team of Internet lawyers.</p><p><br/>We prefer candidates based in Washington, D.C., but will consider exceptional candidates based elsewhere \u2014 especially the San Francisco Bay area and Brussels. Remote candidates must be open to regular travel to D.C., and generally greater flexibility. Regular trips to D.C. would be required and at least two days per month in the D.C. area expected.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About Us:</emphasis>\u00a0TechFreedom\u2019s offices are located in Washington, D.C., but our work addresses state, national, and international policy considerations. We advance a philosophy of dynamism in tech policy debates: optimism about the future, humility about anyone\u2019s ability to predict the course of technological change, and skepticism about technocratic attempts to engineer a better future through regulation. We aim to transcend traditional political and industry divides with a principled message. We take deep dives into legal and policy issues and produce a variety of materials, including comments before regulatory agencies, amicus briefs in legal cases, and briefing materials for Congressional offices. Our experts are respected as thought leaders, participating regularly on panel discussions, convening our own working groups with other experts, commenting to the media, and more.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our Approach to Competition Policy:</emphasis>\u00a0Just a few years ago, policymakers were still celebrating the entrepreneurs who led the Digital Revolution. Now they\u2019re clamoring to jail business leaders \u2014 and increasingly blaming the Internet for society\u2019s ills. Likewise, after three decades of unparalleled digital dynamism, many now assume that today\u2019s \u201cBig Tech\u201d giants are locked into their market positions forever, that disruptive innovation has ceased\u2026 that the Internet has reached \u201cThe End of History.\u201d Such thinking is driving calls for completely changing how we govern the digital realm, especially competition law.<br/>Across the political spectrum, populists insist the consumer welfare standard that has guided antitrust law for decades should be abandoned \u2014 so competition regulators can make highly subjective policy decisions through antitrust enforcement. Others propose significant changes to the\u00a0process\u00a0of antitrust enforcement, such as changing burdens of proof, flipping evidentiary presumptions, or having the FTC write competition rules \u2014 and demand deference for those rules in court.<br/>Taken together, we believe such changes could make the digital world less, rather than more, dynamic, slowing beneficial innovations, denying consumers the largely unseen and unknownable benefits of lost innovation, and politicizing antitrust enforcement even more than it already has been at both the federal and state level. Antitrust could once again become a weapon for competitors to use against others \u2014 and by which politicians can try to push media companies, both new and old, to reshape political discourse in their favor<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scope of Work:</emphasis>\u00a0The Techlash didn\u2019t just happen. It reflects a coordinated, sustained effort \u2014 and so will an effective response. Our new Senior Fellow will, of course, spend part of their time responding to, and debunking, the arguments that the digital sky is falling and that only radical changes to antitrust law can save us. But even more important is building the intellectual foundation needed for us to defend well-developed antitrust principles that are now under fierce attack from the growing \u201chipster antitrust\u201d movement \u2014 and to answer the legitimately hard questions raised by critics of the status quo.<br/>We expect our new colleague to help us shape a proactive agenda of scholarship.

Five years after buying a Fitbit to \"try it out\", the gadget is almost always on his wrist. Every day, he'll check how he slept, log his calories, monitor his heart rate and track whether he's meeting his 12,000 daily step target.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But over the past few months, Cripps has been rethinking his loyalty. Late last year, Google announced it was buying Fitbit and, as a techie himself, Cripps was anxious: \"I was comfortable with Fitbit owning that data. I'm less so with Google.\"</p><p>Combined with all the other data Google gleans from him, the company could end up \"knowing more about me than my friends, my wife and probably even myself to be honest\", he says. He is far from alone in harbouring such concerns.</p><p>Since Google announced its plans last year to bulk up by swallowing Fitbit for $2.1bn (\u00a31.6bn), questions have been swirling over whether it is a data grab too far by the company.</p><p>Now, watchdogs may pull the plug on it altogether. European and Australian competition authorities have kicked off parallel investigations, to conclude in December. Australian regulators have cautioned that \"buying Fitbit will allow Google to build an even more comprehensive set of user data, further cementing its position and raising barriers to entry to potential rivals\".</p><p>Fitbit holds a much smaller share of the global wearables market than Apple, Xiaomi, Samsung and Huawei.</p><p>Yet the proposed takeover is raising more complex questions than sheer scale, which highlight how tech companies' thirst for data is blurring lines between competition and privacy. Ownership of Fitbit would grant Google access to the intimate data of 28 million people.</p><p>In Brussels, privacy is high on the agenda. EU advisers this year warned that a \"further combination and accumulation of sensitive personal data by a major tech company could entail a high level of risk to the fundamental rights to privacy and to the protection of personal data\".</p><p>\"What is at stake here is pretty much our fundamental rights,\" Ioannis Kouvakas, Privacy International's legal officer, says. A tie-up could give Google sophisticated real-time data about individuals' health conditions and needs, which Kouvakas warns could ultimately be pooled with the US firm's already vast data troves. This is not just information around how many steps users are taking. There are an array of applications on the devices, which can allow users to track their menstruation cycles and fertility windows, as well as log meditations. Such applications are set to increase in the coming years, as devices become more advanced. Experts have even said smartwatches could be used to detect early Covid-19 symptoms.</p><p>\"Everyone needs to stop and think what are the wider implications of this merger,\" Kouvakas says. In the short term, Google could use such data to train up artificial intelligence to provide better search results, he says. But, in future, Kouvakas claims it's not out of the question that Google would start telling your employer when you needed to be monitored or your insurer when you needed to eat. Such arguments have been roundly rejected by Google.</p><p>For one thing, Fitbit does not have unique user data. What's more, \"this deal is about devices, not data\", a Google spokesman says.</p><p>\"The wearables space is highly crowded, and we believe the combination of Google and Fitbit's hardware efforts will increase competition in the sector, benefiting consumers and making the next generation of devices better and more affordable.</p><p>Throughout this process, we have been clear about our commitment not to use Fitbit health and wellness data for Google ads.\"</p><p>Critics would be forgiven for some scepticism. In the past, some tech giants have reneged on pledges to ring-fence data gained through acquisitions. Google has also faced scrutiny over how it has used healthcare information. In the US, the company last year faced a lawsuit that it had used patient records from the University of Chicago to develop artificial intelligence products.</p><p>Wearable devices give much easier access to this particularly sensitive data, logging \"everything consumers do\", says Vanessa Turner from BEUC, the European Consumer Organisation.</p><p>She adds: \"This is an important test case for the commission in terms of how it deals with digital healthcare. It should not allow these markets to tip in favour of one supplier.\"</p><p>Consumer groups and privacy advocates may be holding out for a tougher stance from regulators, a sign that after years of mounting Big Tech power, real action is being taken. But, for now at least, users are split.</p><p>Unlike Cripps, some, like Carolanne Hart, who has been using her Fitbit during lockdown, were not \"even aware that Google had bought Fitbit to be honest\". She says: \"Would it influence my decision on using one? No, not at all.\"</p><p>John Fletcher, from Uxbridge, agrees: \"Does Google really want to check the calories I've burned?\" It's a rhetorical question, but Fitbit's future and Google's $2.1bn deal now rest on how regulators answer it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Margrethe Vestager, European competition commissioner, is scrutinising the Fitbit deal</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUTELE-162402039</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUTELE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KW-89N1-JCBW-N1N0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334988</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"840\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58170\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 16, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>XIAOMI INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They don\u2019t need national politicians from <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>telling them to worry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Consider the recent blowback from layoff decisions of two prominent regional companies, Qualcomm and Southern California Edison.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The layoffs highlighted a controversial corner of immigration policy occupied by H-1B visas, which allow companies to hire foreign workers for up to six years in \u201cspecialty\u201d occupations such as software, engineering, biotech or even fashion modeling.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Early this year, Edison began displacing about 500 information technology workers, about 100 voluntarily and 400 through layoffs. But their functions were outsourced to Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services, two giant firms based in India.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before they left, some workers were compelled to train their replacements, and some of them were foreign nationals working in the U.S.</p><p>The H-1B program \u201cwas supposed to be for projects and jobs that American workers could not fill,\u201d one Edison worker told Computerworld, an IT news magazine. \u201cBut we\u2019re doing our job. It\u2019s not like they are bringing in these guys for new positions that nobody can fill. Not one of these jobs being filled by India was a job that an Edison employee wasn\u2019t already performing.\u201d</p><p>In response, 10 federal lawmakers asked the Department of Labor to investigate whether the H-1B program can be used to directly replace American workers. As of June, that probe was under way, according to Sens. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill.</p><p>Indirect replacement is no better, if you\u2019re the one losing a job.</p><p>Last month, Qualcomm said it would cut about 15 percent of its global workforce, about 4,700 workers (it employs 15,000 in San Diego; 31,000 worldwide). Executives haven\u2019t released any details, yet the news lit up social media.</p><p>\u201cThere are large, multistory apartment complexes in Kearny Mesa and Clairemont Mesa full of Qualcomm engineers from India,\u201d said Gail Anderson, a commentator on the Union-Tribune\u2019s digital editions. \u201cI\u2019d say send them all back.\u201d</p><p>Hiring amid expansion</p><p>Qualcomm, which dominates segments of the smartphone industry, has received about 2,900 H-1B visas since 2009, a period of rapid expansion. Although some are probably renewals of three-year visas \u2014 federal agencies don\u2019t break out those numbers \u2014 the total works out to 19 percent of the 15,000 people the company hired over the past six years.</p><p>Put another way, Anderson is correct, in theory: Qualcomm might reach its domestic layoff target simply by firing guest workers.</p><p>However, business reality would seem to rule out the simple approach. As I mentioned, executives aren\u2019t discussing layoff details.</p><p>Still, it stands to reason that if H-1B workers were necessary to begin with, arbitrarily firing them would hurt the company. This would hurt the 26,000 or so Qualcomm employees who remain, not to mention shareholders and customers.</p><p>It\u2019s a familiar argument. Big tech employers say they struggle to fill highly technical jobs with qualified Americans, so the program is essential to international competitiveness. And losing that competition just sends more jobs overseas.</p><p>Tech workers in demand</p><p>Led by Microsoft (which recently cut 7,800 jobs), they\u2019ve lobbied Congress to permit far more H-1B visas. Legislation caps tech visas at 85,000 a year, but exemptions for nurses, university researchers and others boost the true annual figure to 120,000 or so.</p><p>For perspective, the U.S. has allowed about 1 million immigrants a year over the past decade to legally gain permanent residency. Meanwhile, illegal immigration has been almost nonexistent since 2007, although 11 million unauthorized immigrants still live in the U.S., according to the Pew Research Center.</p><p>The H-1B program for temporary workers is clearly popular with employers. Federal officials in April received a record 233,000 applications, or nearly four times this year\u2019s tech slots.</p><p>Criticism of the program comes from two directions: Many H-1B workers don\u2019t become U.S. citizens, so hiring them ultimately transfers skills to foreign competitors.</p><p>Some pay lower wages</p><p>Meanwhile, they tend to depress wages. Regulations call for equivalent pay, but employers often use loopholes to pay at the low end of industry scales.</p><p>Others sympathize with foreign workers, saying the program amounts to indenturement because the visas belong to employers. Workers who lose jobs generally must leave the country. Such leverage adds potential for abuse.</p><p><person><nameText>Bernie Sanders, </nameText></person>the Vermont senator seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, has said that, although some foreign workers are needed, the H-1B and other guest worker programs help business owners with cheap labor at the expense of workers.</p><p>\u201cWhat right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy,\u201d Sanders said last month.</p><p>In broad terms, this view is shared by <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>the Republican contender who last week issued a policy paper advocating a temporary halt to all immigration.</p><p>On H-1B visas, Trump favors boosting the prevailing wage for foreign workers until employers find it more efficient to hire Americans. He said Republican rival Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s bid to triple the number of such visas would \u201cdecimate women and minorities.\u201d</p><p>H-1B joins campaign</p><p>Rubio, along with Jeb Bush and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, have called for comprehensive reforms that would provide paths to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants. Yet Sanders and Trump, who are drawing crowds and rising in polls, seem to be driving the immigration debate.</p><p>In his policy paper, Trump also cited academic research suggesting that U.S. schools are graduating plenty of citizens with degrees in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), but they are having trouble finding jobs. In other words, the ballyhooed STEM shortage is a myth.</p><p>Other studies argue the opposite. And rising wages for software engineers suggest tight supply.</p><p>Some economists say most Americans would be better off without H-1B visas \u2014 if Congress reformed immigration policy to offer residency and eventual citizenship for sharply higher numbers of people, putting skilled workers first in line.</p><p>More workers, higher GDP</p><p>The Congressional Budget Office reckoned the overhaul that passed the Senate in 2013 (but failed in the House) would have allowed 10 million more immigrants over the next decade, boosting the level of gross domestic product by 3.3 percent.</p><p>Canada famously uses a point system that favors people with job offers and advanced degrees. The U.S. sticks to favoring family reunification, and doesn\u2019t focus on skills.</p><p>In San Diego, the issue is far from academic. Recent immigrants long ago came to dominate low-wage jobs in hospitality, farming and landscaping. Then they moved into middle-wage jobs in construction and manufacturing.</p><p>Now natives increasingly encounter competition from young, hungry recent graduates in professional and technical services, a sector that has added a net 24,300 jobs since 2009 in San Diego County.</p><p>And Qualcomm is far from the only local employer using H-1B visas. The list ranges from biotech giant Illumina to Accelrys, a software firm.</p><p>Just as certainly, talented foreigners have played key roles in powering economic and technical achievement in San Diego.</p><p>Focus on innovation</p><p>At Achates Power, a startup that has invented a dramatically cleaner and more-efficient diesel engine, 10 percent of its 50 workers used H-1B visas and about one-third were born abroad, the Union-Tribune reported in 2013.</p><p>It\u2019s easy to see why Congress is reluctant to discourage such innovation on U.S. soil. With the American economy gaining strength as the rest of the world slumps, global competition will only grow in ferocity.</p><p>Regardless of where talk of national reform ends up, the emotional power of the immigration issue seems unlikely to diminish.</p><p>For decades, workers have watched jobs disappear to foreign competitors inside and outside the U.S. And for years, pundits and politicians said boosting skills offered a path to job security.</p><p>Reality is more complex. Competition has arrived at the highest skill levels.</p><p>Increasingly, workers face the following stark choices: Settle for less money, or work harder and more skillfully than the guy coming for your job \u2014 or both.</p><p>Or you can wait for politicians to limit trade and immigration in ways that protect more jobs than they destroy. Given the dismal history of such measures, that could be a long wait.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dan.mcswain@sduniontribune.com\">dan.mcswain@sduniontribune.com</email> (619) 293-1280 \u2022 Twitter: @McSwainUT</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-UTS2529607</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GS7-MKM1-DY33-2013-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1425\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The San Diego Union-Tribune</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union-Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>August 23, 2015 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002FST</classCode><className>SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0006QXF</classCode><className>TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002PNL</classCode><className>INFOSYS LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS221111 HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC4911 ELECTRIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

The case that the largest online giants are monopolies that require antitrust action has been made by critics from both left and right. The case against these companies, however, is on shaky ground.  </p><p><br/>On the surface, it looks like there is significant market concentration. Facebook owns the top three social media apps\u2014Facebook, WhatsApp, and Messenger, all of which exceed 1 billion unique monthly active users. The company captures 20.9 percent of total U.S. digital ad revenue, putting it only behind Alphabet, which, through products like Google Search and YouTube, captures 42.2 percent, leading to claims that these two firms form a duopoly (although Amazon is fast encroaching on this space).  <br/>However, putting these numbers in perspective makes the picture more complicated.  <br/>First, while Facebook dominates social media apps, this does not mean it dominates mobile entirely. Apple\u2019s native iMessage service, which does not show up in social media download statistics, shows much higher user engagement than Facebook Messenger, especially among younger demographics. While Snapchat has less than one third of Instagram\u2019s users, those under 25 use Snapchat much more heavily, suggesting that demographics need to be taken account in order to assess long-term dominance. The market space online is far more complex than direct competition, as each social media site seeks to carve out its own niche.  <br/>One criticism levied against a firm like Facebook is that its dominant position can be used to influence its users in a way others cannot. Claims about addictiveness and the network effects that make Facebook difficult to leave are cited to justify claims that Facebook is too big. Yet, this obscures the fact that Facebook has not been able to leverage its market dominance. For instance, in 2014, Facebook attempted to develop a standalone Camera app to compete against the rising Snap and Instagram, but it quickly failed and was discontinued.  <br/>Competitiveness online requires developing ecosystems for users, given the difficulty of leveraging existing user bases to sell new products.  <br/>This reveals one of the difficulties in seeing who is competing against whom online. Facebook competes not only against other social media sites like Snap, but also against the likes of Google, Apple, and Microsoft in various domains. Online competition requires a firm being able to provide for a variety of user demands or seed ground to rival startups. Unless a firm like Apple can provide a messaging service  its users enjoy, it would allow Facebook to gain ground, weakening the long-term prospects of the business. These \u201cplatform wars\u201d mean that competition between tech giants takes place over many different products and services, at various tiers, and that to understand the level of concentration, one cannot specify the market too narrowly.  <br/>The recent international controversy surrounding the amount of \u201cfake news\u201d on Facebook reveals that the company\u2019s market dominance only appears strong when the market is defined incorrectly. The firm responded to claims that it bears responsibility for \u201cfake news\u201d and has been trying to change its user experience to respond to those pressures. Its latest gambit, which involved prioritizing well-being, cost it users\u2014which will likely show up in decreased ad revenue. Consumers\u2019 ability to voice their concerns to Facebook\u2014and Facebook\u2019s profits being on the line if it does not take those concerns seriously\u2014suggest that claims that the firm has the ability to abuse its market dominance are unfounded.  <br/>It is a feature of platform economics that interaction with the user base drives improvements in the platform. If platforms fail to respond to user concerns or needs, they can fall from seemingly dominant positions rapidly\u2014as recent history amply demonstrates.  <br/>Correctly specifying the market makes the claim that Facebook and Google constitute a duopoly in online advertising similarly unfounded. When one looks at advertising in general, the two firms together account for 20 percent of ad revenue. While digital ad revenues are growing, it is fallacious to claim that there is too much concentration when the two companies take up only a fifth of the total advertising marketplace. If Facebook and Google are increasing their revenues to the detriment of newspapers, neglecting newspaper print ads exaggerates the supposed concentration.  <br/>The line between what is and is not an online company is increasingly blurry. Alphabet continues to branch out into physical products, while Apple is both an established software and hardware manufacturer. Netflix is a streaming service, but among its competitors are distributors that release films in theatres, which incentivized Disney to rethink its future business models with its Fox buyout. Thus, the concentration levels of these companies looks artificially inflated due to the difficulty in specifying what their market actually is.  <br/>One thing is perfectly clear. Consumers are by and large happy with their services. None of the Big Five tech companies\u2014Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook\u2014have an approval rating below 60 percent. These companies may be large, but competition among them is as fierce as ever, incentivizing them to consistently innovate and provide consumers with new and better services.  <br/>Attempting to force \u201ccompetition\u201d (according to a model developed in the pre-tech economy), without a clear understanding of the current market dynamics and the consumer welfare implications, would leave users worse off. These days, that means all of us. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN573802020180208</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RKX-THW1-DXCW-D3TD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"972\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 8, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

From portal apps such as Roku, Apple TV, or Sling to free and paid streams such as those created by YouTube, HBO, CBS and the various professional sports leagues, the video consumer today is king.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But those basic facts about \"television\" - as undeniable as they seem - are being challenged at the FCC right now by a group of Big Tech companies that want to put all these competing sources of entertainment and information in one place where they can monitor and control them. It's a proposal called \"AllVid,\" and unless the FCC finds the common sense and backbone to give it the quick burial it deserves, the future of television is going to change - and not for the better.</p><p>Companies such as Google, Tivo, Sony and others that support AllVid want the FCC to require every provider of \"pay TV\" - Verizon, ATT, Comcast, Time Warner, Cox, Charter, Dish, DirecTV, every last one of them - to let these \"Allvid\" companies put a box on top of your TV that intercepts the shows and channels you paid for and repackage them, allowing them to move channels around the dial, manage the flow of content, and monitor and track your choices in order to sell more information about you to hungry advertisers, much as Google does already to your email and Internet searches.</p><p>And not only would they not pay one thin dime for this privilege, but they would be allowed to wrap their own advertising around the programs you watch. In fact, by shredding the arrangements under which distributors cut deals with content providers, and by forcing all cable boxes to interact with their technical standards, the Big Tech firms would be adding costs while they benefit at the viewer's expense.</p><p>Their proposal sounds bizarre, but their rationale is even more otherworldly. AllVid proponents claim in their FCC filings that this proposal would increase competition and choice in the video marketplace.</p><p>How's that again? Is there anybody who thinks that between traditional pay and broadcast TV, the new streams flooding over the Internet (whether free ones such as YouTube or paid ones such as Netflix), or devices such as Apple TV or Amazon Fire, that there's not enough to watch? There's a reason why today's world is already called \"TV Everywhere.\"</p><p>In fact, the AllVid proponents are trying to manage competition, not defend or enhance it. They're looking for a sweetheart deal that would let them scrape programming off of other systems that have cut distribution deals with studios and other content providers, and then repackage and resell them through AllVid.</p><p>When USA buys \"Mr. Robot,\" for example, they carefully negotiate the time it will be shown, the extent and nature of commercials, and a plethora of other terms. And USA in turns negotiates with the big multichannel distributors for additional terms, like what other channels it will be near and whether it will be on a basic or premiere tier of service. But all those economically vital terms would be upended by AllVid, disrupting the revenue streams that fund production of these great new shows in the first place. This isn't about \"disruption\" - it's about asking for a free ride on something that others have worked hard to deliver to an enthusiastic audience of consumers.</p><p>One of the few ideas the political spectrum gathers around, particularly in a campaign season, is that regulation isn't about helping the regulated. The left bemoans regulators who are held captive by the companies they're there to regulate. The right assails \"crony capitalism,\" by which political influence is turned into economic gain for the favored few. Both sides, therefore, ought to take a cold and hard look at this attempt to poach the entire television system by asking the FCC to do something the market never would.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ev Ehrlich is president of ESC Co., an economics consulting firm, and was undersecretary of commerce from 1993 to 1997.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONTCH-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MONTCH2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HKP-C6X1-F02B-Y0SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313959</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Monterey County Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Monterey County Herald (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"12\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>December 13, 2015 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And it costs consumers dearly,\" UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said.</p><p>Digital markets, where Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google have replaced oil and gas and telecom firms among the top 10 global companies based on market capitalization in 2018, also demonstrate the trend.</p><p>\"Digitalization, in particular, has led to winner-take-all dynamics in digital markets,\" Dr. Kituyi said.</p><p>\"Economies of scale and network effects have led to single dominant firms in e-commerce, online search, online advertising and social networking.\"</p><p>\"This has also given these firms significant control over consumer data, which confers them further market power, raising not only competition-related concerns, but also consumer protection concerns.\"</p><p>These concerns are compelling competition law and policy makers to find new ways of approaching, policing and addressing the challenges.</p><p>Some believe a long history of competition law has equipped legislators with what they need to tackle competition issues in the digital economy.</p><p>\"At a global level competition policy goals don't need to change they are sufficiently flexible to accommodate changes in the digital economy,\" the University of Melbourne's Prof. Caron Beaton-Wells said in her keynote address to the meeting.</p><p>\"But the toolkit needs to be tweaked and enforcement needs to be bolder and quicker.\"</p><p>Digital fallout</p><p>The activities of big technology companies are cause for concern for competition law and policy makers, not only because of competition and concentration issues within the technology space, but also their cannibalization of the offline market too.</p><p>\"The United States' and China's technology giants generate 90% of digital revenues. The same companies are penetrating sectors in the non-digital economy, disrupting traditional business models, in areas such as retail trade and financial services,\" Prof. Beaton-Wells said.</p><p>She added that the digital economy was taking over the offline market as the new engine for the economy.</p><p>\"But there are economic distress signals: increasing market concentration, declining business dynamism, slowing productivity growth, increasing mark-ups and stagnating wages.\"</p><p>There is also little real competition within the industry, dominated by a handful of big companies which buy competing start-ups before they become a real threat, experts said.</p><p>The matter of regulation and enforcement is thus central, the meeting heard.</p><p>Philip Marsden, the deputy chair of the Bank of England's enforcement decision making committee said while \"big tech\" are like babies, \"they live in our house and need to live by our rules\".</p><p>\"They're wonderful and life changing, but at the same time exhausting and very demanding. We have to remember that they have a mommy and a daddy. Who's that? That's us, the regulators,\" he said.</p><p>\"We know what the tech giants want. They want our data and they want to make money off it. Enforcers have to run faster to face digital era challenges. We officials cannot wait for the glacial evolution of the judicial precedent, we have to lead it. It is up to us to ensure Big Tech run competitively in the market race,\" Mr. Marsden said.</p><p>A big stick for 'big tech'</p><p>The importance of international cooperation in combating cross-border anticompetitive practices was emphasized both governments and experts at the meeting.</p><p>Frederic Jenny, OECD competition committee chair, speaking about the rise of the digital economy, said: \"We see the development of a new way to organize the economy which raises the same competition issues in all countries simultaneously. We need stronger cooperation to face those challenges,\" he said.</p><p>An acknowledgement of the need for greater international cooperation and coordination saw the adoption of the Draft Guiding Policies and Procedures under Section F of the UN Set on Competition, of which UNCTAD is the custodian.</p><p>These will be submitted for consideration and approval to the eighth United Nations Conference to Review the UN Set of Principles and Rules on Competition in 2020.</p><p>\"This is a milestone and paves the way for stronger cooperation between competitions authorities at a global level,\" said Teresa Moreira, UNCTAD's head of competition and consumer policies branch.</p><p>Closing the session Prof. Beaton-Wells said: \"Competition is not a panacea designed to deal with all of the challenges presented by the technological tsunami.\"</p><p>\"But, as an instrument concerned with the use of economic power, it has a vital role to play in ensuring that we all reap the benefits of the transformative changes taking place in our economies and society.\"</p><p>Considering the capacity and resource constraints for competition law enforcement in developing countries, her message for developing countries was to consider regulation as a tool to ensure that digital markets work for their people.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123073920</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKP-X3P1-JCBF-S54R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1016\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Our ability to better procure and perceive the data surrounding us has allowed us to cross new horizons and get access to a better understanding of the world we live in. These developments have resulted in a reflection of almost all that we do, into virtual and online outlets. Take, for instance, a basic function such as communication. Rapid developments in our technologies have allowed large scale interactions between populations with the help of social media.</p><p>The vast increment in our technological capacities has given rise to an increasingly digitized economy, where consumers often come across seemingly free services over the internet, for instance web-search services, which may be provided by a platform. In such cases, more often than not, consumers find themselves providing their data as a consideration for the services availed from the platform rather than paying a direct monetary consideration in exchange for the services. These platforms, in turn, monetize this consumer data by providing it to advertisers that use it to target consumers with personalized and relevant advertisements. It is an efficient system, reducing costs, both for businesses as well as consumers. Businesses can get better returns on investment, both in terms of resources spent on developing products the market wants and also in terms of advertising costs by reaching out to groups who are most likely to purchase those products. Correspondingly, it reduces a consumer's search costs, i.e., the cost the consumer would bear to look for the good or service that would best satisfy his/her want (for e.g., consider the fuel spent on reaching the markets and the time spent on looking for the desired product).</p><p>However, the manner in whichoperation of these markets has manifested itself in this 'Digital World' may raise potential legal concerns. Competition authorities across jurisdictions are becoming more and more cognizant of the evolution and rise of new business models which are centred around the collection and processing of data in general, and consumer data in particular. Specific characteristics of the market, (such as disproportionately high returns to scale, network effects and the barriers to entry that may be erected as a result thereof) suggest that there is an increased likelihood of positions of entrenched market power, compared to traditional industries.</p><p>Given this fact, it is important to appreciate that while on the one hand, markets in the Digital Economy are rapidly evolving and pose new challenges, on the other hand, competition law is tasked with scrutinizing the conduct of participants in the market and as a result is reactive. It is, therefore, imperative that competition regulation keeps pace with new challenges that markets in the Digital Economy pose and not wait for the market to 'stabilize'. It has been an accepted position that competition regulatory authorities cannot debar themselves from examining the position of an undertaking in an evolving and growing market pending its final consolidation, since this may mean an ex post acceptance of any abuses committed.</p><p>However, before delving into the application and dynamics of competition law in this area, it is imperative to understand the background and certain essential features of this new world order. Therefore, through this piece, one needs to see why increased interaction between competition law and the digital economy is going to be an inevitable trend in light of fundamental changes in the global business landscape and how increasing internet penetration across the globe, as well as India, has pushed India in the position of one of the fastest growing e-commerce markets.</p><p>DIGITAL ECONOMY: ESTABLISHING A TREND</p><p>The increment in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has been a primary driver of evolution for the Digital Economy which has led to a fundamental shift in the global business landscape. In 2009, the list of top 10 companies by market capitalization was dominated by companies in sectors such as oil and gas and telecommunications, with only one company operating in the information technology industry (Microsoft). However, there has been a fundamental shift which has been generated in less than a decade, where 7 of the top 10 companies in the world in 2018 operate in the Digital Economy, which includes Apple, Google, Microsoft Amazon, Facebook et al.</p><p>In order to capitalize on this growing trend, India has set for itself the commendable yet ambitious target of ensuring high speed internet penetration in the remotest parts of the country as part of the Digital India programme. The efforts of the Government towards increasing internet penetration in India seem to be paying off, as according to some estimates, internet penetration rate in India has increased to nearly around 50 percent in 2020, from just around 4 percent in 2007. If these estimates were to be considered, it would mean that approximately half of a population of close to 1.37 billion people have access to the internet in 2020.</p><p>Along with the rise in internet penetration, reports also estimate that between 2018 and 2023, the Indian e-commerce market would increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 41%, from INR 2,375.43 billion in 2017. This growing number of Internet users and a comparative increase in purchasing power are the primary drivers of growth of the e-commerce market in India, which some revenue estimates project to reach close to US$ 43,489 million in 2020.</p><p>LAYING OUT THE BASICS: SOME GENERAL FEATURES OF THE 'DIGITAL ECONOMY'</p><p>Transactions over the digital economy are a global phenomenon. To understand the digital economy, several jurisdictions are coming up with market / sectoral studies under their respective legislations to understand the impact of this sector and best enforcement or regulatory strategies in their markets. Some of the noted that may be listed as a way of a representative sample are 'Competition Policy for the digital era' by European Commission in EU, 'Digital platforms inquiry' by Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, 'Market study on E-commerce in India' by the Competition Commission of India, market study for the 'Online Travel Booking Sector in Singapore' initiated by Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore and 'Market study of digital platforms' by Swedish Competition Authority and 'Vertical Restraints Project' of the Unilateral Conduct Working Group (UCWG) of the International Competition Network (ICN). The latest in this representative sample of market studies is the final report on the market study of 'Online Platforms and Digital Advertising' by the Competition and Markets Authority of the United Kingdom, which was released on 01.07.2020. Some of the common themes emerging out of these markets are as under:</p><p>* EXTREME RETURNS TO SCALE: The digital economy presents a world of opportunity for many (such as small businesses) who can have access to a much wider consumer base / audience through the click of a button than would have been possible in any conventional sense. However, firms increasingly find themselves to be in a relationship with an \"unavoidable trading partner\" in these markets where the counterparty exercises market power due to possessing such enormous data. This happens in situations such as, amongst others, in the case when firms must transact over the internet using an architecture or platform that is a defining feature of a particular market. In digital markets, the cost of producing the information / service / value is much less than proportional to the number of customers served. This sets the stage for yet another feature of the digital economy-this is a sector where traditional operation of economies of scale are pushed to the very extreme.</p><p>* NETWORK EFFECTS: Another defining feature of the digital economy is its propensity for network effects. Network effects are characterized as the increased usefulness of a service to the users as the number of users using the service increases. This creates a positive feedback loop for services that are offered, wherein an increase in the number of users / input to a service improves the value of the service to other users and therefore further attracts new users. This can be understood from the representation given here (Figure 1):</p><p>If we start from any of the points in the given circle, we see how the positive feedback loop comes into operation. For instance, the number of consumers contributes to the value derived by each producer in a platform. As the value derived by each producer increases, the number of producers finding the economic activity profitable also increases. Consequently, as more producers join the economic activity, the value to the consumer increases (for instance in the form of increasing choice in the market). This then further attracts more consumers, completing the loop. This is a self-reinforcing loop that can be seen in operation in case of platforms such as e-commerce platforms, wherein the number of consumers increases as the number of sellers providing different and more variety of goods increase, which consequently choose the platform to sell products because of access to more consumers. Network effects once established show a propensity to lock in users from both sides of the market.</p><p>The digital economy has provided a stage on which \"platforms\" have come to acquire significant roles. These platforms often connect two separate set of users, where each side of the platform is both a consumer as well as a product which is being sold to the other side. A classic case of network effects is experienced in telecommunications industry. Operation of network effects in cases of platforms are observed in case of platform service providers for social networking services, wherein a person joins the network only if a sufficient number of people are already part of the user base.</p><p>Creation of network, thus, is the new mantra. This is the precise reason why even after having nil or very thin profit margin, such companies continue to function on the same model and manage to get huge and multiple rounds of funding from sophisticated investors, The investor outlook has also undergone a fundamental change with network creation being primary concern rather than immediate profitability.</p><p>* THE POSSIBILITY OF TIPPING OF MARKETS: As we saw above, two fundamental features of the digital economy have been observed from our experience with it so far: it is characterized by extreme returns to scale and is prone to network externalities. These characteristics point to that fact that competition as deemed desirable in the traditional sense, whereby multiple firms providing similar services compete on the basis of lower prices and innovation, may not be compatible with the ways in which the digital economy unfolds itself.It is therefore possible that competition in the Digital Economy may manifest in the form of competition \"for the market\" rather than competition in the market.</p><p>There is yet another interesting feature of the Digital Economy. Since economies of scale and network externalities not only favour a concentrated market but also erect entry barriers, strong network externalities also present the distinct possibility of all consumers in the market deciding to opt for the product of a particular firm or for a particular technology, therefore leading to a \"tipping\" of the market in favour of that firm and entrenching a monopolist position in the market. Investments required to challenge a handful of incumbent firms which have managed to set up or sufficiently alter the \"background architecture\" of a market in its favour may therefore prove to be prohibitively expensive. Attaining critical mass of users can lead to firms assuming position of entrenched market power. In such markets, it becomes extremely difficult for new entrants (even if such firms does not face any dearth of capital) to dislodge the incumbent from its position. It is therefore imperative that firm activity is closely monitored by competition regulators to check how such firms obtain, what can be thought of as the escape velocity, to rapidly monetize disruptive innovations.Considering the same, the propensity of the digital world has been winner takes it all, which makes it all the more important that competition authorities take a clarion call to active expeditiously and proactively to ensure that such entities with market power conduct in a fair manner in the market</p><p>THE VALUE OF DATA: MORE THAN JUST A PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>As we saw above, big tech companies do not follow the conventional model of charging their customers to make a profit. Social networking platforms, e-commerce platforms and most of the google services are for free. The primary source of revenue for most of them is through advertisement. One of the ways by which consumers pay for the services is their data. Data is what these company require to provide better services, or more personalised service, which ultimately hooks the user to such services. To understand the role of data in this whole transaction, it is pertinent to take note of certain basics of the data economy.</p><p>The EC Competition Policy for Digital Era identifies three main channels for collection of data. First is 'volunteered data', which means data that the consumer wilfully provides to any enterprise. Second is the data that is 'observed', which is mainly behavioural data obtained by tracking user's activity in digital space.</p><p>Data is the market power, often described now as the oil required for the engine of growth. Once an enterprise has enough number of users and their data, as well as capacity to convert such data into useful information, it is very difficult for a new enterprise to make entry in the market. Access to data for a long time may be used by a superior algorithm to improve their service and to attract even more users. For an example, users are unlikely to shift from Google towards any other search engine, despite enterprise like Microsoft are its competitor. Any attempt for the same would require a huge amount of resources.</p><p>The platforms which attract consumers for free or the negligible fee, target consumer using their data. The model on which their business works is 'digital advertising'. The model, being different from traditional advertising model, targets consumers with personalised advertisement. This is the common business model for search engines and social networking sites. Google and Facebook are the largest companies working on this business model. The core methodology by which these online platforms work can be defined through the concept of attention economy, which works simply on attracting limited human attention. The online platforms, of every kind, works on this concept to engage the number of hours an individual spends on such platform. The CMA report explains this model though the chart below, where although the consumer does not pay money to the platform, but there exists transaction (Figure 2).</p><p>Figure2. Advertising funded business model for online platforms</p><p>SOME SAMPLE INSTANCES OF FIRM CONDUCT IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY</p><p>There are several possible ways of conducting itself in the market that open up for a firm having access to crucial data in the market.With a lot of data to process, an enterprise is given the opportunity to put itself in a perfect position to anticipate consumer needs and demand in more than one sector. Armed with this data, the firm can create its own product/ services which the data shows consumers may prefer.</p><p>Then there are instances where firms which act as platforms and connect two separate set of consumers may show a preference for products / services manufactured by the firm itself (for instance e-commerce platforms). In case of other platforms that simply provide a service of connecting two sets of users (such as social media or general search services), firms may choose to subsidize one side of the market to increase traffic and consequently the value for users on the other side of the market, choosing to earn from advertising revenues. It is a positive loop situation where considering the traffic on the other side, the advertisers will continue their engagement with platforms.</p><p>An enterprise is also presented with the opportunity to get access to more data by offering different services, which are highly complementary to the main service. AS a result, by operating such complementary services, firms have the option to create their own ecosystems which helps attract more users which derive value from the ecosystem.</p><p>Therefore, access to data opens a world of possible behaviours that firms may choose to adopt in the market. The possible competition implications of such conduct, such as creating entry barrier, lack of innovation, consumers paying higher prices etc, have generated an entire body of case-laws, market studies and research both in India as well as other jurisdictions.</p><p>Figure 2: Online Platforms and Digital Advertising, CMA, supra note 16.</p><p>Abir Roy is Partner, Sarvada Legal.</p><p>Figure 1 image source: What are Network Effects?</p><p>googletag.cmd.push(function() {</p><p>googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1592052647733-2');</p><p>});</p><p>googletag.cmd.push(function() {</p><p>googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1592052647733-6');</p><p>});</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Sunday Guardian.

Our ability to better procure and perceive the data surrounding us has allowed us to cross new horizons and get access to a better understanding of the world we live in. These developments have resulted in a reflection of almost all that we do, into virtual and online outlets. Take, for instance, a basic function such as communication. Rapid developments in our technologies have allowed large scale interactions between populations with the help of social media.    The vast increment in our technological capacities has given rise to an increasingly digitized economy, where consumers often come across seemingly free services over the internet, for instance web-search services, which may be provided by a platform. In such cases, more often than not, consumers find themselves providing their data as a consideration for the services availed from the platform rather than paying a direct monetary consideration in exchange for the services. These platforms, in turn, monetize this consumer data by providing it to advertisers that use it to target consumers with personalized and relevant advertisements. It is an efficient system, reducing costs, both for businesses as well as consumers. Businesses can get better returns on investment, both in terms of resources spent on developing products the market wants and also in terms of advertising costs by reaching out to groups who are most likely to purchase those products. Correspondingly, it reduces a consumer\u2019s search costs, i.e., the cost the consumer would bear to look for the good or service that would best satisfy his/her want (for e.g., consider the fuel spent on reaching the markets and the time spent on looking for the desired product).    However, the manner in whichoperation of these markets has manifested itself in this \u2018Digital World\u2019 may raise potential legal concerns. Competition authorities across jurisdictions are becoming more and more cognizant of the evolution and rise of new business models which are centred around the collection and processing of data in general, and consumer data in particular. Specific characteristics of the market, (such as disproportionately high returns to scale, network effects and the barriers to entry that may be erected as a result thereof) suggest that there is an increased likelihood of positions of entrenched market power, compared to traditional industries.    Given this fact, it is important to appreciate that while on the one hand, markets in the Digital Economy are rapidly evolving and pose new challenges, on the other hand, competition law is tasked with scrutinizing the conduct of participants in the market and as a result is reactive. It is, therefore, imperative that competition regulation keeps pace with new challenges that markets in the Digital Economy pose and not wait for the market to \u2018stabilize\u2019. It has been an accepted position that competition regulatory authorities cannot debar themselves from examining the position of an undertaking in an evolving and growing market pending its final consolidation, since this may mean an ex post acceptance of any abuses committed .    However, before delving into the application and dynamics of competition law in this area, it is imperative to understand the background and certain essential features of this new world order. Therefore, through this piece, one needs to see why increased interaction between competition law and the digital economy is going to be an inevitable trend in light of fundamental changes in the global business landscape and how increasing internet penetration across the globe, as well as India, has pushed India in the position of one of the fastest growing e-commerce markets.    DIGITAL ECONOMY: ESTABLISHING A TREND    The increment in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has been a primary driver of evolution for the Digital Economy which has led to a fundamental shift in the global business landscape. In 2009, the list of top 10 companies by market capitalization was dominated by companies in sectors such as oil and gas and telecommunications, with only one company operating in the information technology industry (Microsoft). However, there has been a fundamental shift which has been generated in less than a decade, where 7 of the top 10 companies in the world in 2018 operate in the Digital Economy, which includes Apple, Google, Microsoft Amazon, Facebook et al.    In order to capitalize on this growing trend, India has set for itself the commendable yet ambitious target of ensuring high speed internet penetration in the remotest parts of the country as part of the Digital India programme. The efforts of the Government towards increasing internet penetration in India seem to be paying off, as according to some estimates, internet penetration rate in India has increased to nearly around 50 percent in 2020, from just around 4 percent in 2007. If these estimates were to be considered, it would mean that approximately half of a population of close to 1.37 billion people have access to the internet in 2020.    Along with the rise in internet penetration, reports also estimate that between 2018 and 2023, the Indian e-commerce market would increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 41%, from INR 2,375.43 billion in 2017. This growing number of Internet users and a comparative increase in purchasing power are the primary drivers of growth of the e-commerce market in India, which some revenue estimates project to reach close to US$ 43,489 million in 2020.    LAYING OUT THE BASICS: SOME GENERAL FEATURES OF THE \u2018DIGITAL ECONOMY\u2019    Transactions over the digital economy are a global phenomenon. To understand the digital economy, several jurisdictions are coming up with market / sectoral studies under their respective legislations to understand the impact of this sector and best enforcement or regulatory strategies in their markets. Some of the noted that may be listed as a way of a representative sample are \u2018Competition Policy for the digital era\u2019 by  European Commission in EU, \u2018Digital platforms inquiry\u2019 by Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, \u2018Market study on E-commerce in India\u2019 by the Competition Commission of India, market study for the \u2018Online Travel Booking Sector in Singapore\u2019 initiated by Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore and \u2018Market study of digital platforms\u2019 by Swedish Competition Authority and \u2018Vertical Restraints Project\u2019 of the Unilateral Conduct Working Group (UCWG) of the International Competition Network (ICN). The latest in this representative sample of market studies is the final report on the market study of \u2018Online Platforms and Digital Advertising\u2019 by the Competition and Markets Authority of the United Kingdom, which was released on 01.07.2020. Some of the common themes emerging out of these markets are as under:    * EXTREME RETURNS TO SCALE: The digital economy presents a world of opportunity for many (such as small businesses) who can have access to a much wider consumer base / audience through the click of a button than would have been possible in any conventional sense. However, firms increasingly find themselves to be in a relationship with an \u201cunavoidable trading partner\u201d in these markets where the counterparty exercises market power due to possessing such enormous data. This happens in situations such as, amongst others, in the case when firms must transact over the internet using an architecture or platform that is a defining feature of a particular market. In digital markets, the cost of producing the information / service / value is much less than proportional to the number of customers served. This sets the stage for yet another feature of the digital economy\u2014this is a sector where traditional operation of economies of scale are pushed to the very extreme.    * NETWORK EFFECTS: Another defining feature of the digital economy is its propensity for network effects. Network effects are characterized as the increased usefulness of a service to the users as the number of users using the service increases. This creates a positive feedback loop for services that are offered, wherein an increase in the number of users / input to a service improves the value of the service to other users and therefore further attracts new users. This can be understood from the representation given here (Figure 1):    If we start from any of the points in the given circle, we see how the positive feedback loop comes into operation. For instance, the number of consumers contributes to the value derived by each producer in a platform. As the value derived by each producer increases, the number of producers finding the economic activity profitable also increases. Consequently, as more producers join the economic activity, the value to the consumer increases (for instance in the form of increasing choice in the market). This then further attracts more consumers, completing the loop. This is a self-reinforcing loop that can be seen in operation in case of platforms such as e-commerce platforms, wherein the number of consumers increases as the number of sellers providing different and more variety of goods increase, which consequently choose the platform to sell products because of access to more consumers. Network effects once established show a propensity to lock in users from both sides of the market.    The digital economy has provided a stage on which \u201cplatforms\u201d have come to acquire significant roles. These platforms often connect two separate set of users, where each side of the platform is both a consumer as well as a product which is being sold to the other side. A classic case of network effects is experienced in telecommunications industry. Operation of network effects in cases of platforms are observed in case of platform service providers for social networking services, wherein a person joins the network only if a sufficient number of people are already part of the user base.    Creation of network, thus, is the new mantra. This is the precise reason why even after having nil or very thin profit margin, such companies continue to function on the same model and manage to get huge and multiple rounds of funding from sophisticated investors, The investor outlook has also undergone a fundamental change with network creation being primary concern rather than immediate profitability.    * THE POSSIBILITY OF TIPPING OF MARKETS: As we saw above, two fundamental features of the digital economy have been observed from our experience with it so far: it is characterized by extreme returns to scale and is prone to network externalities. These characteristics point to that fact that competition as deemed desirable in the traditional sense, whereby multiple firms providing similar services compete on the basis of lower prices and innovation, may not be compatible with the ways in which the digital economy unfolds itself.It is therefore possible that competition in the Digital Economy may manifest in the form of competition \u201cfor the market\u201d rather than competition in the market.    There is yet another interesting feature of the Digital Economy. Since economies of scale and network externalities not only favour a concentrated market but also erect entry barriers, strong network externalities also present the distinct possibility of all consumers in the market deciding to opt for the product of a particular firm or for a particular technology, therefore leading to a \u201ctipping\u201d of the market in favour of that firm and entrenching a monopolist position in the market. Investments required to challenge a handful of incumbent firms which have managed to set up or sufficiently alter the \u201cbackground architecture\u201d of a market in its favour may therefore prove to be prohibitively expensive. Attaining critical mass of users can lead to firms assuming position of entrenched market power. In such markets, it becomes extremely difficult for new entrants (even if such firms does not face any dearth of capital) to dislodge the incumbent from its position. It is therefore imperative that firm activity is closely monitored by competition regulators to check how such firms obtain, what can be thought of as the escape velocity, to rapidly monetize disruptive innovations.Considering the same, the propensity of the digital world has been winner takes it all, which makes it all the more important that competition authorities take a clarion call to active expeditiously and proactively to ensure that such entities with market power conduct in a fair manner in the market    THE VALUE OF DATA: MORE THAN JUST A PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS    As we saw above, big tech companies do not follow the conventional model of charging their customers to make a profit. Social networking platforms, e-commerce platforms and most of the google services are for free. The primary source of revenue for most of them is through advertisement. One of the ways by which consumers pay for the services is their data. Data is what these company require to provide better services, or more personalised service, which ultimately hooks the user to such services. To understand the role of data in this whole transaction, it is pertinent to take note of certain basics of the data economy.    The EC Competition Policy for Digital Era identifies three main channels for collection of data. First is \u2018volunteered data\u2019, which means data that the consumer wilfully provides to any enterprise. Second is the data that is \u2018observed\u2019, which is mainly behavioural data obtained by tracking user\u2019s activity in digital space.    Data is the market power, often described now as the oil required for the engine of growth. Once an enterprise has enough number of users and their data, as well as capacity to convert such data into useful information, it is very difficult for a new enterprise to make entry in the market. Access to data for a long time may be used by a superior algorithm to improve their service and to attract even more users. For an example, users are unlikely to shift from Google towards any other search engine, despite enterprise like Microsoft are its competitor. Any attempt for the same would require a huge amount of resources.    The platforms which attract consumers for free or the negligible fee, target consumer using their data. The model on which their business works is \u2018digital advertising\u2019. The model, being different from traditional advertising model, targets consumers with personalised advertisement. This is the common business model for search engines and social networking sites. Google and Facebook are the largest companies working on this business model. The core methodology by which these online platforms work can be defined through the concept of attention economy, which works simply on attracting limited human attention. The online platforms, of every kind, works on this concept to engage the number of hours an individual spends on such platform. The CMA report explains this model though the chart below, where although the consumer does not pay money to the platform, but there exists transaction (Figure 2).   Figure2. Advertising funded business model for online platforms   SOME SAMPLE INSTANCES OF FIRM CONDUCT IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY    There are several possible ways of conducting itself in the market that open up for a firm having access to crucial data in the market.With a lot of data to process, an enterprise is given the opportunity to put itself in a perfect position to anticipate consumer needs and demand in more than one sector. Armed with this data, the firm can create its own product/ services which the data shows consumers may prefer.    Then there are instances where firms which act as platforms and connect two separate set of consumers may show a preference for products / services manufactured by the firm itself (for instance e-commerce platforms). In case of other platforms that simply provide a service of connecting two sets of users (such as social media or general search services), firms may choose to subsidize one side of the market to increase traffic and consequently the value for users on the other side of the market, choosing to earn from advertising revenues. It is a positive loop situation where considering the traffic on the other side, the advertisers will continue their engagement with platforms.    An enterprise is also presented with the opportunity to get access to more data by offering different services, which are highly complementary to the main service. AS a result, by operating such complementary services, firms have the option to create their own ecosystems which helps attract more users which derive value from the ecosystem.    Therefore, access to data opens a world of possible behaviours that firms may choose to adopt in the market. The possible competition implications of such conduct, such as creating entry barrier, lack of innovation, consumers paying higher prices etc, have generated an entire body of case-laws, market studies and research both in India as well as other jurisdictions.

On March 8th Elizabeth Warren, a left-leaning senator from Massachusetts and candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, caused a sensation by calling for the big Silicon Valley platform firms, such as Facebook and Google, to be broken up. In Europe, meanwhile, tech firms face death by a thousand cuts, as national governments and the European Union stab at them over privacy, fake news, tax and competition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the midst of these fights, a report published on March 13th provides a welcome note of calm. Written by a commission appointed by the British government and led by Jason Furman, who was an economic adviser in Barack Obama's White House, the Report of the Digital Competition Expert Panel recommends more competition rather than stifling regulation or break-ups. To this end it proposes a new regulator to force firms to rewire themselves, so that users have control of their data and can switch between providers. It also suggests modernising antitrust rules.</p><p>The experts start by noting the benefits of big tech: its products are wildly popular. Britain's dozen most digital-intensive industries generate 16% of its GDP and 10% of employment. But digital markets are also highly concentrated. As in most of the rich world, one or two companies dominate Britain's markets for online search, advertising, social media and phone operating systems. Measured by time spent online by British users, Alphabet (including Google and YouTube) and Facebook have a combined market share of 37%. Even firms regarded as bit players in Silicon Valley are larger than Britain's home-grown content platforms, measured by aggregate time spent online by British users--Sweden's Spotify beats the BBC.</p><p>This concentration is, the report argues, an innate feature of digital markets. Network effects mean single firms can grow especially large. Their collection of data about their users is a formidable barrier to entry that inhibits new competitors and makes it hard for consumers to switch. Whereas the dominant tech firms of the past, such as IBM or Nokia, were eventually displaced, today's giants are more deeply entrenched, thanks to their data, their vast investment budgets and their habit of buying up putative rivals. If sustained, their dominance could pose a threat to consumers and business users such as advertisers, who could face rising prices and less choice. And too little competition could dampen innovation. The tech giants would then be a drag on the economy, not a stimulant.</p><p>Mr Furman and his colleagues reject breaking up big tech firms, which Britain, on its own, would be unable to do anyway. They also dismiss the idea of regulating them in the same way as water or power utilities, with capped profits and tight state supervision. This would, they argue, amount to an acceptance of permanent monopolies in the heart of the economy. Instead they suggest that government action to stimulate competition and choice is the best way to handle the digital age.</p><p>To this end, says the report, Britain should create a new digital regulator. It would designate some large firms as having \"strategic market status\". These would be subject to a code of conduct on competitive behaviour that would, for example, prevent an online marketplace such as Amazon from favouring its own products over those of a rival in a search result shown to a consumer. The watchdog would also require firms to redesign their software to allow \"data mobility\". Individual customers could move their search and purchasing histories from one platform to another. Social-media users could post their messages to friends, regardless of the networking site those friends use. And anonymised bulk data gathered by one firm would be made available to new entrants with safeguards for privacy. (The report argues that the EU's GDPR regime for personal data falls short of making true data mobility possible.)</p><p>On top of this, the experts reckon, Britain should beef up its antitrust rules. The report sticks with the underlying philosophy of antitrust in America and Britain--that the consumer should come first, rather than suppliers or other interest groups. But it recommends that Britain's competition watchdog should act earlier and faster when big tech firms try to stifle competition by buying smaller firms that could one day become a threat.</p><p>As a balanced piece of analysis that puts markets and consumers first, rather than big tech firms or the government, the experts' report is first rate. However, two important questions stand out.</p><p>First, how might data mobility work in practice? There are few examples--Britain has a system opening up payments and bank-account data, but it has so far been a damp squib.</p><p>Second, what impact will the report have? Even if Britain were to adopt its recommendations, the tech titans are global in scope and American by nationality. Ultimately America and the EU (which Britain is due to leave soon) are the powers that will decide their destiny. Still, politicians and regulators in both jurisdictions, who are struggling to deal with an avalanche of proposals and mounting public anger, would do well to study Britain's report closely.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMM-X3W1-F03B-T320-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">251202</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"888\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Economist Newspapers, NA, Incorporated All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Economist.Com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37727\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Thus, there's glaring recognition that the challenges that lie ahead require joint concerted effort.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is, therefore, imperative that these relationships are further cemented and continue in earnest.</p><p>The advent of democracy in 1994 ushered in a new regulation era in South Africa, and the government gave high priority to redressing the economic imbalances which corresponded with the racial divisions in the country.</p><p>Strong competition policy became and still remains an important industrial policy tool in attaining this. We all know that prior to 1994, in the era of apartheid, the entire economy was designed to exclude black South Africans from meaningful economic participation.</p><p>During this time, the government suppressed market competition and promoted anticompetitive behaviour through state-sanctioned monopolies and cartels.</p><p>Notwithstanding these post 1994 changes, South Africa's market structures have remained largely unchanged, with high levels of concentration and very little economic transformation.</p><p>Previously state-owned entities still remain dominant in markets with very little meaningful and pervasive market entry by small to medium-sized firms.</p><p>For South Africa, this demands competition law and policy that is geared towards addressing these developmental concerns, which challenge the orthodox approach to market regulation. This will require looking at competition regulation and market conduct in new ways.</p><p>In keeping with the maturation of South Africa as a new democracy, between the years of 1999 to 2004 the competition authorities spent these formative years building institutional capacity for enforcement.</p><p>Competition authorities have since 1999 levied administrative penalties of about R7billion, with the greater part of the penalties levied in the period 2008 to 2017. Remedies, including divestitures, have also been imposed to address market concentration and public interest concerns.</p><p>The economic challenges that face South Africa today require a strong policy response to the issue of economic concentration and inequality.</p><p>From a competition regulatory perspective, we are seeing a rise in cross-border cartels, including those in automotive components and foreign currency trading.</p><p>We have also prioritised investigations relating to the high cost of pharmaceuticals, building on the collaborative work in the BRICS working group.</p><p>The commission will continue its investigations in these markets and challenge the role of intellectual property rights to the extent that these rights lead to detriment in society.</p><p>The commission has previously intervened in these types of markets in relation to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) and achieved significant outcomes which led South Africa being the world leader in the ARV roll-out programmes.</p><p>From a merger control perspective, we are also seeing a rise in cross-border merger transactions, recently in agricultural markets, including Dow/Du Pont, Bayer/Monsanto, ChemChina/Syngenta as well as in beer, with ABInBev acquiring SABMiller. This will require that as a regulator, we actively apply our minds to new approaches to competition regulation and enforcement, recognising specific needs and demands of South Africa, the African region and its global position.</p><p>This will require innovative competition regulation and enforcement, which addresses developmental economic priorities. South Africa recognises that innovation and the pursuit of a knowledge economy will allow us to better exploit our comparative and competitive advantages.</p><p>Technology and innovation also have important roles to play in the lives of ordinary South Africans, and competition regulation must work towards ensuring that markets work for the betterment of society.</p><p>The commission is, therefore, cognisant of the role that tech giants such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Netflix are playing on the global agenda.</p><p>South Africa is a country with a population of just under 57million people, with approximately 22million people with access to the internet, a figure that is growing annually.</p><p>Access to such technologies has meant that disruptors such as Uber, Taxify and Netflix have been able to make inroads within South Africa, increasing consumer choice and somewhat lowering the cost of transportation and broadcasting.</p><p>On the other side of the coin, however, the role of technology and the use of big data has come under severe criticism, especially in the wake of Facebook and data leaks and the growth of fake news.</p><p>From a competition perspective, the European Community has recently prosecuted and fined Google 2.4billion for manipulating search results in order to favour its own offerings over those of rivals and entrenching its dominance of the search engine and online shopping sectors.</p><p>This raises regulatory issues of how competition authorities deal with technology in their assessment of markets, as well as considering issues of consumer protection in seeking to regulate such ubiquitous firms. The policy thinking towards big tech giants and dominant firms generally, is changing.</p><p>South Africa is also thinking about how to tackle market power and its abuse, this through the introduction of a Competition Amendment Bill, which raises some solutions to dealing with market power and market concentration.</p><p>New thinking and new approaches towards competition regulation also requires that regulators share their experiences and continue deep and meaningful co-operation in seeking to regulate for effective competition.</p><p>There are five uppermost challenges that competition policy should seek to tackle and address at present:</p><p>First - the rise in the use of data and associated connectivity in markets which are at the heart of the fourth industrial revolution.</p><p>Second - the continued growth of multinationals through mega-mergers, creating even larger firms that are dominant across different markets, value-chains and countries.</p><p>Third - trade agreements that include conditions which entrench the dominance of multinational firms rather than the promotion of competition and development in affected domestic markets.</p><p>Fourth - growing wealth inequality, primarily in developing countries. Competition policy should seriously confront questions of the distribution of wealth and resources in markets, access to markets by small and medium sized firms and dismantling barriers to entry, both regulatory and non-regulatory.</p><p>Fifth - the pervasive nature of cartels in local and global markets. Cartels are increasingly employing subtle techniques, including algorithms and other market signalling techniques that require an urgent global response.</p><p>Competition authorities, globally, should therefore be at the centre of tackling these new challenges to ensure competitive, growing and inclusive markets.</p><p>Hardin Ratshisusu is the deputy commissioner of the Competition Commission of South Africa.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRETOR-103143726</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRETOR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SGV-HNG1-JCV0-13Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312439</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1189\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Newspapers Pty (Ltd) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Pretoria News (South Africa)</publicationName><edition>E1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 06, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00022B5</classCode><className>MONSANTO CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000DLWA</classCode><className>CHINA NATIONAL CHEMICAL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000261Y</classCode><className>SYNGENTA AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>MON (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SYT (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SYNN (SWX)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001444</classCode><className>RACE &amp;

Introduction</emphasis></h><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><anchor id=\"ref5b0400\"/>This paper examines how <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">merger control</emphasis> affects the efficiency of the market for corporate control. Merger control refers to the government-controlled approval or disapproval of proposed mergers, with the stated aim of deterring mergers that could significantly impede effective competition.5 Governments usually justify intervening in the market for corporate control to protect the interests of consumers, the economy, and society as a whole. However, recent government discussions about breaking up big tech companies, such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google (<link><marker>The Wall Street Journal, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0400\"/></link>), highlight the importance of understanding <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">all</emphasis> possible ramifications of competition policy. One such effect is how government intervention in the market for corporate control impacts efficiency. This important topic has received scant research attention thus far. We aim to fill this gap.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0165\"/>Our overarching hypothesis is that merger control is detrimental to efficiency in the market for corporate control. Our rationale is that merger control, and especially uncertainty about merger control, amplifies managerial entrenchment by reducing the threat of a takeover. The argument is as follows. Merger control is designed to deter deals that could potentially harm effective competition (<link><marker>Duso et al., 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0165\"/></link>). However, this <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">deterrence effect</emphasis> potentially creates <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">managerial entrenchment</emphasis> in the controlled deals segment by reducing the threat of takeover in two key ways: There are fewer deals overall, first, because some would be anticompetitive, and, second, because some pro-competitive deals are not even proposed because of substantial regulatory uncertainty.10 The resulting entrenchment may result in lower firm value (<link><marker>Bebchuk et al., 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0050\"/></link>). <link><marker>Masulis et al. (2007)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0320\"/></link> and <link><marker>Harford et al. (2012)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0230\"/></link> show that the reduced firm value of high-entrenchment firms is driven by managers making value-destroying acquisitions of the empire-building type. Because merger control plausibly increases managerial entrenchment, empire-building acquisitions characterized by lower acquirer returns are expected to be relatively more prevalent in the controlled deals segment. Therefore, we expect that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">acquirer returns will be lower in controlled deals</emphasis>.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0030\"/>To test this hypothesis, and establish a causal interpretation of uncertainty as the specific source of how merger control destroys value, we exploit a unique institutional context. We focus on merger control in Europe, paragraphed in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">European Commission Merger Regulation</emphasis> (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ECMR</emphasis>), because the degree of uncertainty appears more pronounced in Europe than in other jurisdictions (see, e.g., <link><marker>Bagchi, 2005</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0030\"/></link>; <link><marker>The Wall Street Journal, 2001</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0395\"/></link>).15 Note that the ECMR was reformed in 2004 with the goal of reducing regulatory uncertainty and lifting the deterrence effect on efficient deals.20 It is this exogenous variation in the degree of uncertainty that we exploit to establish a casual interpretation of our results. If controlled deals entail lower acquirer returns <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">because</emphasis> of the merger control and the related uncertainty, the difference should decrease after the Reform.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0380\"/>To be clear, throughout this paper, we use the terms \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">merger control\"</emphasis> and \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ECMR\"</emphasis> interchangeably (except where otherwise explicitly stated), but we use the term \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Reform\"</emphasis> only to refer to the 2004 event that changed the regulatory regime. Specifically, we use a difference-in-differences design to compare controlled and non-controlled mergers before and after the Reform of 2004. The intuition is that controlled mergers should be characterized by lower acquirer returns than non-controlled mergers, but the difference should decrease afterward because of the partial elimination of regulatory uncertainty. To satisfy the parallel trends assumption in our model, we apply propensity score matching to ensure that acquiring firms in the treatment and control groups are similar, and we also compute size-adjusted acquirer returns (<link><marker>Schneider and Spalt, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0380\"/></link>). Overall, our methodology allows us to not only estimate the effect of merger control on acquirer returns, but also to causally establish regulatory uncertainty as the specific source.</p><p>Using a final sample of 1336 deals between 2001 and 2011 with equally large treatment and control groups, we find, as hypothesized, that acquirer returns are significantly lower in the controlled deals segment (treatment group). The 3.07% difference from the non-controlled deals segment (control group) is statistically and economically significant. However, the 2004 Reform caused the difference to narrow substantially. The results are consistent with the view that regulatory uncertainty about merger control impedes the efficiency of the market for corporate control.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0010\"/>We next show supporting evidence that merger control can reduce the threat of takeover in the controlled deals segment, but that the 2004 Reform counteracts this effect, which is central to our interpretation and argument. First, prior to the Reform, cross-border deals were obstructed by protectionist and nationalistic behavior, thus substantially reducing the takeover threat from foreign firms (<link><marker>Aktas et al., 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0010\"/></link>; <link><marker>Dinc and Erel, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0145\"/></link>). We find that the probability of cross-border bids increased after the Reform. Second, we document that the probability of very large deals taking place - measured by combined sales, which is an important prima facie figure for the assessment of competitive effects - increased after the Reform, again suggesting an increased takeover threat for firms in the controlled deals segment for the post-Reform period.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0290\"/>Because of this, agency costs from empire-building acquisitions and other self-serving behavior should be reduced. This is exactly what we show next. In keeping with <link><marker>Lang et al. (1991)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0290\"/></link>, we find that the probability of high free cash flow firms acquiring low-growth targets decreased after the Reform. This is consistent with <link><marker>Wurgler (2000)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0425\"/></link>, who reports that well-governed firms allocate resources more efficiently by avoiding low-growth industries. Moreover, we show that the Reform reduced agency costs in the long run. Our results indicate that overall firm value, as proxied for by Tobin's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">q</emphasis> and other governance-related proxies like the asset utilization rate, improved after the Reform, while we document a decrease in free cash flow levels. These results hold for event windows from (\u22122, +2) to (\u22125, +5) years with respect to the deal announcement year. Our findings are in line with results from studies of the long-run effects of corporate governance (<link><marker>Jensen, 1986</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0265\"/></link>; <link><marker>Ang et al., 2000</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0020\"/></link>; <link><marker>Bebchuk et al., 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0050\"/></link>; <link><marker>Drobetz and Momtaz, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference79000\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0070\"/>Finally, we examine the role of two crucial institutional features: quality of law enforcement and product market competition. First, following the growing literature on law enforcement in financial markets (<link><marker>Bhattacharya and Daouk, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0070\"/></link>; <link><marker>Jackson and Roe, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0260\"/></link>; <link><marker>Humphery-Jenner, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0250\"/></link>; <link><marker>Dubois et al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0160\"/></link>; <link><marker>Dissanaike et al., 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link>), we show that relatively weak enforcement institutions lessen the Reform's positive effect on acquirer returns. Specifically, government-dependent national supervisors and lax criminal sanctions can aggravate agency conflicts. Second, we analyze heterogeneous treatment effects in product markets, because merger control is perceived more as an obstacle in concentrated product markets where regulatory intervention is more likely (<link><marker>Duso et al., 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0175\"/></link>). Following this, we find that merger control does not impact fragmented product markets enough to significantly affect acquirer returns.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0245\"/>The results are robust to (1) controlling for the disparity in firm size in controlled versus non-controlled deals by means of a size-adjusted measure of acquirer returns; (2) running a falsification (placebo) test that takes into account the concurrent European Takeover Directive (<link><marker>Humphery-Jenner, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0245\"/></link>; <link><marker>Dissanaike et al., 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link>); (3) accounting for transactions during the financial crisis; and (4) controlling for differences in acquirers' corporate governance standards. We acknowledge that, in addition to our proposed agency channel, the Reform may have affected the merger market by changing the nature of completed deals for a variety of other reasons. Therefore, to further mitigate selection concerns, we control for a comprehensive set of changes in value-relevant deal characteristics. We find no indications that changes in target and/or deal characteristics explained the observed uplift in acquirer returns in the post-Reform period.</p><p>Our study makes several important contributions to the literature. Unlike most studies on merger control in the U.S. and Europe, which concentrate on competitive effects, we focus explicitly on the efficiency of the market for corporate control. We find that merger control can reduce the threat of takeovers, which increases agency costs in concrete corporate deals and also over the long run. Our findings are of great economic importance, because sizable wealth in the form of assets and control rights is reallocated in M&amp;A markets. Thus, it is important to analyze potential obstacles to the efficiency of this process.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to link acquirer returns in controlled deals to entrenchment. It is a stylized fact that antitakeover provisions that entrench managers tend to destroy acquisition value (<link><marker>Harford et al., 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0230\"/></link>; <link><marker>Masulis et al., 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0320\"/></link>). However, no such effect has been documented thus far for competition policy. A major reason for the lack of research has been the difficulty in distinguishing empirically between entrenchment and other possible explanations. Most importantly, we recognize that an increase in acquirer announcement returns could also stem from an increased probability of getting efficient deals approved. Using our diff-in-diff research design, we demonstrate that the Reform-induced increase in acquirer returns is at least partly attributable to an increased takeover threat and to fewer agency-oriented transactions. This is exactly what our entrenchment explanation, based on <link><marker>Harford et al. (2012)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0230\"/></link> and <link><marker>Masulis et al. (2007)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0320\"/></link>, predicts. Our findings have important policy implications for the design of merger control. Ineffective merger control may not only cause competition inefficiencies, but it could also inhibit the external corporate governance function of the market for corporate control.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0065\"/>This study also contributes to recent literature on the role of M&amp;A uncertainty by complementing existing evidence on market and policy uncertainty. We add a regulatory dimension to uncertainty. <link><marker>Bhagwat et al. (2016)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0065\"/></link> show decreasing deal activity for public targets when market volatility rises. <link><marker>Bonaime et al. (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0080\"/></link> and <link><marker>Nguyen and Phan (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0355\"/></link> use <link><marker>Baker et al.'s (2016)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0040\"/></link> index as a proxy, and find that policy uncertainty is negatively related to firm acquisitiveness. In stark contrast to our own findings, <link><marker>Nguyen and Phan (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0355\"/></link> further show that acquirers create greater shareholder value during times of high policy uncertainty, which they attribute, inter alia, to acquirers' prudence. This result highlights the importance of exploring the different sources of uncertainty and how they impact firm value. In the context of competition policy, uncertainty is usually expected to reduce firm value. This is because it tends to deter efficient deals, while signaling better odds of getting falsely approved to managers with potentially agency-motivated, inefficient proposals (<link><marker>Duso et al., 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0165\"/></link>).</p><p>Although our empirical study is built on the Reform of European competition policy, the insights are relevant to many jurisdictions. Our analysis can also be seen as an indirect test of the efficiency-based U.S. merger control regime. The ECMR moved closer to the U.S. regime after the 2004 Reform, which was marked by an increase in M&amp;A market efficiency. This is a desirable feature of competition policy that may not be directly testable in the U.S. due to the lack of a counterfactual.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional background on European merger control. Section 3 frames our testable hypotheses, while Section 4 describes our data. Section 5 presents the main empirical results, and the results of robustness tests are in Section 6. Section 7 concludes.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. European Commission Merger Regulation: institutional background</emphasis></h><p>The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">European Commission Merger Regulation</emphasis> (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ECMR</emphasis>) outlines the mandate of the European Commission (EC), laid down in Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It aims \"to maintain and develop effective competition within the common market\" (Art. 2 (1a)). The ECMR came into effect in 1990. and was reformed in 2004.25 It states that the European competition agency, the Directorate-General for Competition (DG COMP), has jurisdiction over proposed mergers that are of \"EU dimension,\" which are defined as follows:<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>The combined aggregate global turnover of all businesses concerned is greater than (EURO)5 billion, and the aggregate EU turnover of each of at least two undertakings is more than (EURO)250 million, or</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>The combined aggregate global turnover of all businesses concerned is more than (EURO)2.5 billion, and, in each of at least three Member States, the combined aggregate turnover of all businesses concerned is more than (EURO)100 million (and aggregate turnover of at least two of those businesses is more than (EURO)25 million) and aggregate EU turnover is more than (EURO)100 million<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis>30</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Under the 2004 reformed ECMR, Art. 2 (2) states that \"[...] a concentration which would significantly impede effective competition, in particular by the creation or strengthening of a dominant position, in the common market or in a substantial part of it shall be declared incompatible with the common market.\" With the 2004 Reform, the \"significant impediment to effective competition\" test (SIEC test) replaces the much criticized dominance test.35 These two tests are discussed further in Section 1 of the Internet Appendix.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref80005\"/>The ECMR also defines the procedural steps for merger control. <link><marker>Fig. 1</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80005\"/></link> illustrates the process. Acquirers must formally notify DG COMP (Art. 4) if their intended deal is of EU dimension, although they are advised to seek pre-notification contact with DG COMP to clarify critical issues beforehand. During a period of 25 working days, DG COMP undertakes a formal investigation (Phase I). Subsequently, as long as the proposed case is of European dimension and thus subject to investigation, it must decide whether (1) the merger is compatible with the common market and can be approved without conditions, (2) it can only be declared acceptable contingent on conditions, or (3) there are serious concerns, in which case an in-depth Phase II investigation is launched (Art. 6 (1b), 8).<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference80005\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref80005\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000173409291199v62sCS0929119919301142mainassetsgr1SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000173409291199v62sCS0929119919301142mainassetsgr1LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p>Fig. 1 - Merger control process according to Council Regulation 139/2004.</p></caption></nitf:media></p><p>Phase II investigations usually last 90 working days, and result in a final merger control decision (Art. 8, 10 (3)). In the case of a clearance decision, the merger may be implemented. If the merger is implemented before final approval, the EC has the power to order any action that could restore initial competition, including divestiture of assets and dissolving control structures after a public bid. The merging parties can object to DG COMP decisions by submitting the case to the Court of First Instance (CFI).</p><p>Note that the economic environment prior to the Reform featured considerable legal uncertainty surrounding merger control. Several prominent cases were brought before the CFI that reversed DG COMP decisions. These were accompanied by severe criticism of the quality of European merger control. For example, in 2002, the CFI overturned three DG COMP decisions within only six months. In the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Airtours/First Choice</emphasis> case,40 the CFI annulled DG COMP's 1999 merger prohibition, and attested to DG COMP's \"incomplete and incorrect assessment of the data submitted [...] during the administrative procedure,\" as well as its failure to prove allegations.45 In the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Schneider/Legrand</emphasis> case, the CFI found \"errors, omissions, and inconsistencies [...] of undoubted gravity [...] in the Commission's analysis of the impact of the merger,\" in addition to worrying procedural errors.50 Similar comments accompanied CFI's reversal of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tetra Laval/Sidel</emphasis> decision.55<link><marker>Duso et al. (2007)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0165\"/></link> posit that these problems are systematic, given that European merger control creates legal uncertainty by issuing questionable merger control decisions. In their sample of 168 controlled deals, they find that DG COMP mistakenly blocked or remedied pro-competitive, efficient deals in 28% of the cases. The Reform addressed these issues, among others, in an effort to improve the quality of European merger control.</p><p>Indeed, in a comprehensive assessment of the 2004 Reform, <link><marker>Duso et al. (2013)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0175\"/></link> find that it improved the predictability of merger control decisions. Explaining DG COMP decisions by observable characteristics (such as deal, market, and institutional measures), they document that the goodness-of-fit of their predictive model has significantly increased subsequent to the Reform. We discuss these changes further when we develop our hypotheses in the next section, and in the Internet Appendix.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Hypothesis development</emphasis></h><p>The overarching hypothesis is that merger control amplifies managerial entrenchment in the controlled deals segment by reducing takeover threats. Fewer deals occur (1) because some would be anticompetitive, and (2) because some pro-competitive deals are not even proposed by acquirers because of regulatory uncertainty. Managerial entrenchment causes agency costs (<link><marker>Bebchuk et al., 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0050\"/></link>), and should thus affect the returns on acquisition decisions in the controlled deals segment (<link><marker>Harford et al., 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0230\"/></link>).60<sup>,</sup>65</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0415\"/>The reduced takeover threat stems from two distinct cost types for acquirers: uncertainty-related and real. First, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">merger control-related uncertainty</emphasis> reduces the proclivity of firms to attempt an acquisition. Therefore, the threat of takeover in the controlled deals segment shrinks, increasing managerial entrenchment levels and enabling managers to make agency-motivated acquisitions (<link><marker>Masulis et al., 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0320\"/></link>; <link><marker>Harford et al., 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0230\"/></link>). We identify at least four sources of control-related legal uncertainty: (1) The ECMR is relatively vague about its economic analysis and criteria (<link><marker>V\u00f6lcker, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0415\"/></link>), (2) it vests considerable discretion in DG COMP without publicly establishing what criteria deem a proposed deal \"compatible with the common market\" (<link><marker>Monti, 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0340\"/></link>; <link><marker>Garrod and Lyons, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0210\"/></link>), (3) European merger control is susceptible to political influences (<link><marker>Duso et al., 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0165\"/></link>; <link><marker>Aktas et al., 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0010\"/></link>; <link><marker>Dinc and Erel, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0145\"/></link>), and (4) European merger control can create legal uncertainty by issuing questionable merger control decisions (<link><marker>Duso et al., 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0165\"/></link>; <link><marker>Duso et al., 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0170\"/></link>). A detailed discussion about each source of uncertainty is in Section 2 of the Internet Appendix.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0185\"/>Second, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">real costs</emphasis> affect the profitability of corporate acquisitions. We identify three sources of control-specific costs: (1) acquirer transaction costs, such as compliance with notification requirements (e.g., preparing notification forms and reacting to DG COMP's statements of objections) and those related to the actual review process (e.g., appearing at oral hearings),70 litigation or legal costs in the case of objections by competitors (<link><marker>Egge et al., 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0185\"/></link>) or appeals to the Court of First Instance (CFI), and opportunity costs associated with, e.g., merger delays (<link><marker>Clougherty, 2005</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0105\"/></link>), (2) reputational risks for the firm and its incumbent managers (<link><marker>Neven et al., 1998</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0350\"/></link>), and (3) the costs to the merging parties of disclosing private information (<link><marker>Barros, 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0045\"/></link>), which may become accessible to competitors (<link><marker>Paul and Gidley, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0360\"/></link>).</p><p>Taken together, merger control imposes significant uncertainty-related and real costs for acquirers, which reduce the takeover threat. These frictions amplify managerial entrenchment, and entrenched managers are more likely to destroy value in acquisitions (<link><marker>Harford et al., 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0230\"/></link>; <link><marker>Humphery-Jenner, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0245\"/></link>). Therefore, our first hypothesis is:<br/>Merger control depresses returns to shareholders of acquiring firms in controlled deals.</p><p>Next, we hypothesize how the Reform has affected the relation between merger control and acquirer returns. This is pivotal for our study, because the exogenous variation induced by the Reform enables us to draw causal inferences about the claimed relation underlying our first hypothesis.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0375\"/>The Reform seems to have improved the quality of European merger control in at least three key areas (discussed in detail in Section 2 of the Internet Appendix): (1) It limited the level of discretion provided to enforcers by accelerating the proceedings for hearing objections to DG COMP decisions and codifying practices (<link><marker>Duso et al., 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0175\"/></link>; <link><marker>R\u00f6ller and de la Mano, 2006</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0375\"/></link>), (2) it reduced the time pressure for merger control, which improved notification timing (Art. 10),75 and encouraged pre-notification contacts between DG COMP and acquirers (<link><marker>Duso et al., 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0165\"/></link>), and (3) it enhanced the quality of DG COMP decisions by improving market understanding, increasing sound economic expertise and analysis, and establishing a peer review panel (<link><marker>Monti, 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0340\"/></link>; <link><marker>Duso et al., 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0175\"/></link>). In particular, DG COMP tended to block or remedy pro-competitive deals less frequently after the Reform, thereby decreasing false disapprovals (<link><marker>Duso et al., 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0175\"/></link>).</p><p>The reduced uncertainty is a plausible explanation for decreased managerial entrenchment via an increased takeover threat in the economy. Importantly, however, the economy-wide effect is heterogeneous. Managers in the controlled deals segment are affected to a much greater degree than those in the uncontrolled deals segment. For example, managers in the controlled deals segment are the most entrenched, and are thus more affected when the threat of a takeover increases. The takeover threat for firms in the controlled deals segment from smaller firms is negligible (i.e., these firms are too big to be acquired); in contrast, the takeover threat for firms in the uncontrolled deals segment - from firms in the controlled deals segment - is real. Firms in the uncontrolled deals segment can also be taken over by peers in that segment. Finally, there are generally no peer-related takeover threats for firms in the controlled deals segment because such deals would be blocked by the ECMR. Therefore, while all firms in the economy are affected by the increased takeover threat, the effect for firms in the controlled deals segment is most pronounced.80</p><p>We expect that the Reform has reduced the level of regulatory uncertainty, which would increase the takeover threat in the controlled deals segment. Therefore, our second hypothesis is:<br/>The Reform's marginal effect on the relation between merger control and the shareholder value of acquiring firms in controlled deals is positive.</p><p>Note that an empirical finding that cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) increased after the Reform could also be consistent with an increased probability that good deals are being approved thanks to reduced uncertainty. To confirm that any identified effect is really caused by an agency-related mechanism, we need to test additional hypotheses directly related to agency costs. We elaborate on this line of reasoning further in Sections 5.3 and 5.4.</p><p>In addition to our two main hypotheses, we test two additional hypotheses related to the general quality of law enforcement and industry concentration. These hypotheses are explained in more detail in Sections 5.5 and 5.6, as well as in Section 2 of the Internet Appendix. Section 3 of the Internet Appendix also contains a test of the hypothesis that any causal corporate governance effect should be stronger in national cultures that are more intolerant to uncertainty.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. Data and summary statistics</emphasis></h><p>During our 2001-2011 sample period, 3337 M&amp;A proposals were reported to DG COMP.85 Of those, 3011 (90.2%) cases were cleared unconditionally, and 48 (1.4%) were approved with conditions (e.g., divestiture of subsidiaries) after Phase I investigations. 110 (3.3%) of the proposals entered in-depth Phase II investigations, of which 36 (1.1%) were declared compatible with the ECMR, 48 (1.4%) were approved subject to conditions, and 8 (0.2%) were prohibited. The remaining cases were withdrawn, out of the ECMR's scope, or referred to regulatory agencies in member states.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0005\"/>For our empirical tests, we sample the treatment group from the 3011 unconditionally cleared cases, which include notifications under the old (Council Regulation 4064/89) and new ECMR (Council Regulation 139/2004). We selected cases for the treatment group that were approved outright. We excluded all others because they could contaminate our estimates of acquirer returns if investors anticipate the higher costs associated with regulatory interventions, as shown by <link><marker>Aktas et al. (2004)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0005\"/></link>.90 Restricting our sample to \"unproblematic\" transactions is also important to avoid having the dependent variable, the announcement return to shareholders of the acquiring firm, confounded by market power rents (<link><marker>Duso et al., 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0175\"/></link>). Furthermore, we require that the publicly listed acquirer and target be located in a European member state, i.e., our sample intentionally excludes non-EU firms to mitigate protectionist biases (<link><marker>Aktas et al., 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0010\"/></link>). Additional information on market, firm, and deal characteristics comes from the Thomson Reuters SDC M&amp;A database, Bloomberg, and Datastream.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0235\"/>For the control group, we draw our sample from the population of unscrutinized M&amp;A deals in the Thomson Reuters SDC M&amp;A database between 2001 and 2011. The identification is based on propensity score matching, which helps ameliorate the potential problem of model dependency in natural experiments. In particular, we follow the <link><marker>Ho et al. (2007)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0235\"/></link> approach to ensure that oversight by DG COMP as the European antitrust regulator is randomly assigned. We select matching firms - largely in line with <link><marker>Bris and Cabolis (2008)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0085\"/></link> - by requiring that (1) firms belong to the same country and industry as the treatment observation,95 (2) the matching merger occurred in the same year, and (3) the target firm is the closest in terms of relative deal size (defined as deal size over acquirer total assets) and the full set of explanatory variables, as defined in Section 5.2. For each observation, the <link><marker>Ho et al. (2007)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0235\"/></link> algorithm estimates the probability of being in the treatment group, and matches control with treatment cases based on these propensity scores.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref90005\"/>The above methodology yields a sample of 1336 M&amp;A deals, consisting of controlled (668) and non-controlled (668) transactions in equal proportion. <link><marker>Table 1</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90005\"/></link> presents the sample distribution, arranged by announcement years. Our sample represents approximately 22.2% of all European dimensional M&amp;A deals over the sample period. Apart from data scarcity for our matching approach, the main limiting factor for the number of observations is the requirement that the acquirer be publicly listed. Consistent with other studies of European M&amp;A, our sample shows an increasing number of acquisitions until the peak in 2005, followed by a decreasing trend. The pre-Reform sample consists of 398 transactions, and we have 938 deals for the post-reform period. We also report the market capitalizations of the acquiring firms, deal sizes, and relative deal sizes for both controlled and non-controlled firms.<table><title><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref9t0005\"/></link></title><tgroup cols=\"6\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\" colwidth=\"112\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col6\" colwidth=\"112\"/><thead><row><entry><anchor id=\"reference9t0005\"/>Year</entry><entry># of all unconditionally cleared mergers (Art. 6 I b of ECMR)</entry><entry># (%) of all mergers in the sample</entry><entry>Average market value of controlled (non-controlled) acquirers</entry><entry>Average value of controlled (non-controlled) deals (target size)</entry><entry>Average relative deal size of controlled (non-controlled) deals</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry morerows=\"1\">2001</entry><entry morerows=\"1\">299</entry><entry>24</entry><entry>15,077</entry><entry>4845</entry><entry>32.1%</entry></row><row><entry>(1.8%)</entry><entry>(207)</entry><entry>(29)</entry><entry>(14.1%)</entry></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">2002</entry><entry morerows=\"1\">238</entry><entry>92</entry><entry>14,954</entry><entry>1322</entry><entry>8.8%</entry></row><row><entry>(6.9%)</entry><entry>(875)</entry><entry>(58)</entry><entry>(6.6%)</entry></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">2003</entry><entry morerows=\"1\">203</entry><entry>208</entry><entry>20,592</entry><entry>771</entry><entry>3.7%</entry></row><row><entry>(15.6%)</entry><entry>(14,428)</entry><entry>(38)</entry><entry>(0.3%)</entry></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">2004</entry><entry morerows=\"1\">220</entry><entry>256</entry><entry>18,741</entry><entry>1141</entry><entry>6.1%</entry></row><row><entry>(19.2%)</entry><entry>(6528)</entry><entry>(99)</entry><entry>(1.5%)</entry></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">2005</entry><entry morerows=\"1\">276</entry><entry>260</entry><entry>44,392</entry><entry>1308</entry><entry>2.9%</entry></row><row><entry>(19.5%)</entry><entry>(5008)</entry><entry>(84)</entry><entry>(1.7%)</entry></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">2006</entry><entry morerows=\"1\">323</entry><entry>144</entry><entry>22,554</entry><entry>2699</entry><entry>12.0%</entry></row><row><entry>(10.8%)</entry><entry>(1170)</entry><entry>(61)</entry><entry>(5.2%)</entry></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">2007</entry><entry morerows=\"1\">368</entry><entry>120</entry><entry>22,639</entry><entry>2431</entry><entry>10.7%</entry></row><row><entry>(9%)</entry><entry>(671)</entry><entry>(32)</entry><entry>(4.7%)</entry></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">2008</entry><entry morerows=\"1\">307</entry><entry>92</entry><entry>17,717</entry><entry>1478</entry><entry>8.3%</entry></row><row><entry>(6.9%)</entry><entry>(677)</entry><entry>(169)</entry><entry>(25.0%)</entry></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">2009</entry><entry morerows=\"1\">225</entry><entry>48</entry><entry>21,173</entry><entry>862</entry><entry>4.1%</entry></row><row><entry>(3.6%)</entry><entry>(129)</entry><entry>(15)</entry><entry>(11.7%)</entry></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">2010</entry><entry>253</entry><entry>52</entry><entry>15,069</entry><entry>458</entry><entry>3.0%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(3.9%)</entry><entry>(379)</entry><entry>(90)</entry><entry>(23.7%)</entry></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">2011</entry><entry morerows=\"1\">299</entry><entry>40</entry><entry>19,434</entry><entry>838</entry><entry>4.3%</entry></row><row><entry>(3%)</entry><entry>(145)</entry><entry>(14)</entry><entry>(9.5%)</entry></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">Pre-reform</entry><entry morerows=\"1\">887</entry><entry>398</entry><entry>18,483</entry><entry>1385</entry><entry>7.5%</entry></row><row><entry>(29.8%)</entry><entry>(8647)</entry><entry>(78)</entry><entry>(0.9%)</entry></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">Post-reform</entry><entry morerows=\"1\">2124</entry><entry>938</entry><entry>26,829</entry><entry>1480</entry><entry>5.5%</entry></row><row><entry>(70.2%)</entry><entry>(3253)</entry><entry>(69)</entry><entry>(2.1%)</entry></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">Total</entry><entry morerows=\"1\">3011</entry><entry>1336</entry><entry>24,343</entry><entry>1452</entry><entry>6.0%</entry></row><row><entry>(100%)</entry><entry>(4860)</entry><entry>(72)</entry><entry>(1.5%)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Table 1 - Sample distribution by announcement years.</p><p>Despite the fact that relative deal size is part of our matching process, the average acquirer market value in our treatment (control) group is $24 ($5) billion, deal size is $1.5 ($0.1) billion, and relative deal size is 6% (1.5%). To avoid the problem of natural variations in firm size driving our regression results, we size-adjust the dependent variable, investment efficiency, in a robustness test, as described in Section 6. Note that average acquirer size increased post-Reform from $18.5 billion to $26.8 billion. This change is statistically significant, and already suggests that very large firms became more active acquirers after the Reform, thus corroborating our conjecture that the threat of takeovers increased in the controlled deals segment after the Reform.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. Empirical results</emphasis></h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.1. Univariate analysis</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref90010\"/>As panel A of <link><marker>Table 2</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90010\"/></link> shows, the average 11-day acquirer CAR for the entire sample is 1.29%, which is significantly different from 0 at the 1% level.100 The result that the average European takeover is beneficial to shareholders of the acquiring firm is consistent with prior studies, such as <link><marker>Martynova and Renneboog (2011a)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0310\"/></link> (0.79%) and <link><marker>Drobetz and Momtaz (2019)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0155\"/></link> (1.23%). Controlled M&amp;A deals create insignificant value (0.39%), while uncontrolled deals generate a highly significant 2.18% in acquisition gains. This suggests that merger control has a detrimental impact on acquirer returns. Furthermore, the level of acquirer returns fell from 2.06% before the Reform to only 0.96% thereafter (both at a 1% level of significance). This drop may be attributable to the global financial crisis, which occurred during the period after the event.

Comparing these differences suggests that the Reform created value of about 2.80% (at a 1% level of significance). This significantly positive variation in pre-/post-Reform differences is driven mainly by a decrease in the control group, which suggests that the benefits of the Reform compensated for the overall decrease in acquirer returns.

id=\"ref5b0420\"/>In Model 1, we regress CARs only on the variables necessary to construct the DDE<sub>ECMR</sub> and industry-year fixed effects.110 We do this to ensure that any identified effect between merger control and acquirer returns is not driven by the presence of our control variables. In Model 2, we acknowledge that some of the independent variables may be endogenously determined, e.g., Tobin's Q, leverage, cross-listings, friendly takeovers, method of payment, and target type (<link><marker>Masulis et al., 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0320\"/></link>; <link><marker>Wang and Xie, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0420\"/></link>). Therefore, to ensure our DDE<sub>ECMR</sub> is not biased by these controls, we replace Tobin's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">q</emphasis> and leverage with their industry medians. The other controls are omitted, because we are unable to find suitable substitutes. Model 3 includes all control variables.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0370\"/>The estimated coefficient of d(merger control) is significantly negative in all specifications, while DDE<sub>ECMR</sub> is significantly positive. DDE<sub>ECMR</sub> ranges from 3.07% to 3.24%. This small range across different models is reassuring, because, if the treatment is really exogenous, including additional covariates should have only a negligible impact on the treatment effect (<link><marker>Roberts and Whited, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0370\"/></link>).</p><p>In Model 3, the estimate for the merger control dummy is \u22120.0347, and that for DDE<sub>ECMR</sub> is 0.0307, which are both significant at the 1% level. These are non-trivial figures, given that the full sample's average CAR is 1.29%. With an acquirer's average market capitalization in the treatment group of $24.3 billion, these estimates show that the Reform-induced improvement of merger control quality led to an increase in returns to shareholders of acquiring firms of $835 million per deal. As such, the Reform was economically significant for acquirers.</p><p>Overall, our results thus far corroborate Hypotheses 1 and 2. First, we find that merger control depresses investment efficiency in controlled deals by \u22123.47%. Second, the Reform ameliorated this effect, as evidenced by a 3.07% increase in acquisition-related investment efficiency. In principle, these findings are consistent with our hypothesis that legal and commercial uncertainty regarding merger control deters M&amp;A activity and reduces takeover threats, which in turn amplifies managerial entrenchment and enables relatively more agency-motivated investments. However, it is also possible that the effect is driven by an increase in the probability that certain merger proposals will receive approval.115 For example, <link><marker>Duso et al. (2007)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0165\"/></link> show that one-fifth of all procompetitive deals receive false approval. If the conditional probability of approval given a good deal increased after the Reform, then our dependent variable (CARs) should also increase. To ensure the identified effect is at least partly driven by reduced agency costs, we provide further direct evidence. In the next section, we explore the sources of value destruction in controlled deals, and show that this valuation effect is indeed driven by a reduction in managerial entrenchment.</p><p>Among the control variables, we find consistent estimates across all model specifications. We note that most results are consistent with recent work, such as <link><marker>Dissanaike et al., 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link>, <link><marker>Harford et al. (2012)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0230\"/></link>, <link><marker>Humphery-Jenner (2012)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0245\"/></link>, <link><marker>Martynova and Renneboog (2011a)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0310\"/></link>, and <link><marker>Masulis et al. (2007)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0320\"/></link>. In particular, (1) Tobin's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">q</emphasis> is insignificant, (2) firm size is significantly negative, (3) the relation between acquirer returns and leverage in Europe is negative, which contrasts with U.S. evidence, (4) relative deal size is positively correlated with acquirer returns, and (5) cross-border acquisitions create more value in Europe than domestic ones. We also decompose our sample by method of payment (all-cash or stock component) and target type (public or private). Since the remaining estimates all have negative signs, the omitted base group (all-cash*public target) is associated with the highest CARs (although most are not significantly different).</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.3. Sources of value destruction</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0015\"/>Next, we examine the proposed entrenchment effects, and explore the sources of value destruction in controlled deals. This effect suggests that merger control reduces the threat of takeover, and, in turn, enables relatively more agency-motivated acquisitions. We test two economic channels for the reduction in takeover threats associated with merger control. First, we expect that the increase in acquirer returns following the Reform is attributable to greater cross-border M&amp;A activity. Earlier studies show that European merger control had a protectionist stance toward foreign acquirers (<link><marker>Aktas et al., 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0010\"/></link>; <link><marker>Dinc and Erel, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0145\"/></link>). In addition, a plethora of anecdotal evidence indicates protectionist policies in Europe.120 However, protectionism seems to have disappeared more recently (<link><marker>Aktas et al., 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link>).</p><p>Second, we expect that the probability of very large deals, as measured by the combined sales of the acquirer and the target, has increased after the Reform. We focus on combined sales since it is often used as a prima facie threshold assessment by antitrust law enforcers. A post-Reform increase in the level of combined sales per deal would support our conjecture that an improvement in the predictability of merger control decisions has made M&amp;A deals of a certain size possible that would previously have been very unlikely.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref90020\"/>We present the results of tests for both channels in panels A and B of <link><marker>Table 4</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90020\"/></link>. The dependent variable in panel A is a binary variable that equals 1 for cross-border deals, and 0 for domestic deals. Depending on the model, the DDE<sub>ECMR</sub> indicates that the probability of cross-border deals increased by a range of 6.92% to 11.68% following the Reform. Panel B uses the acquirer's and target's combined sales in millions of USD as the dependent variable. The DDE<sub>ECMR</sub> ranges from $5177 million to $5251 million, suggesting that the takeover threat in the controlled deals segment rose because controlled transactions significantly increased in deal size.125 Given that both diff-in-diff estimators in panels A and B are significant, this suggests that the takeover threat from cross-border and large-cap transactions increased subsequent to the Reform.<table><title><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref9t0020\"/></link></title><tgroup cols=\"4\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"352\"/><colspec align=\"left\"

In particular, <link><marker>Wurgler (2000)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0425\"/></link> provides evidence that strong minority shareholder rights are associated with better capital allocation, which stems more from a reduction of overinvestment in declining industries than an increase in capital directed at growing industries.130 He further shows that value-added growth is positively correlated with Tobin's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">q</emphasis>, and that it is a valuable tool for investors and managers in distinguishing between good and bad investments.</p><p>Due to these prior findings, we test the Reform's impact on the probability that a high free cash flow firm acquires a low-growth target. The dependent variable is a binary variable that equals 1 if the acquirer has free cash flow above the sample's arithmetic mean and acquires a target with a Q ratio below the sample's arithmetic mean, and 0 otherwise. Panel C of <link><marker>Table 4</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90020\"/></link> shows the results. As expected, we find a significantly negative DDE<sub>ECMR</sub> coefficient in the range of \u221213.77% to \u221215.74%, suggesting that the probability of agency-motivated deals significantly decreased after the Reform.</p><p>Altogether, the above analyses provide evidence of an increased threat of takeover and a decrease in agency-motivated deals due to the Reform. This result lends support to our overarching hypothesis that the uncertainty and costs associated with merger control tend to deter M&amp;A activity, reducing takeover threats and enabling entrenched managers to engage in value-destroying acquisitions.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.4. Long-run effects on agency costs</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0190\"/>Another implication of our entrenchment explanation is that a decrease in agency-oriented deals should be reflected in reduced agency costs over the long run. Three tests of long-run agency costs are common in the literature. First, Tobin's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">q</emphasis> is often used, as it reflects long-term market expectations of a firm's overall value (<link><marker>Erickson and Whited, 2000</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0190\"/></link>). Therefore, we expect that Tobin's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">q</emphasis> increased due to the Reform if post-Reform deals improved the governance structure of our controlled sample firms, which lowered managerial entrenchment levels and boosted firm performance (<link><marker>Bebchuk et al., 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0050\"/></link>).</p><p>Second, we directly test the free cash flow (FCF) hypothesis. According to <link><marker>Jensen (1986, p. 323)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0265\"/></link>, \"[f]ree cash flow is cash flow in excess of that required to fund all projects that have positive net present values when discounted at the relevant cost of capital.\" The problem with high FCF levels is that they can cause managers to grow their companies beyond optimum size. It follows that agency-oriented managers maintain higher FCF levels. Therefore, we expect to find reduced FCF levels after the Reform if it constrained agency-oriented decision making.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0390\"/>Third, we examine the Reform's effect on the asset utilization rate. This is a direct measure of equity agency costs, and is typically higher in owner-managed firms that are less subject to principal-agent conflicts (<link><marker>Ang et al., 2000</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0020\"/></link>; <link><marker>Singh and Davidson, 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0390\"/></link>). Partly as a result of excessive agency-motivated expenses, asset utilization decreases when agency conflicts are severe. Therefore, we expect to find a positive effect of the Reform on the asset utilization rate if it curbed agency costs over the long run.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref90025\"/><link><marker>Table 5</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90025\"/></link> presents the results of our three diff-in-diff regressions. The table descriptions provide definitions of all variables introduced in this section. We compute changes in the dependent variables, where we compare the two years prior to the acquisition year to the two years afterward. Overall, the long-run effect of the Reform reduced agency costs along all three dimensions. Specifically, in our sample of controlled deals, we document that Tobin's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">q</emphasis> increased after the Reform, free cash flow decreased, and the asset utilization rate increased. Our results are robust to extending the event window to (\u22125 years, +5 years). We conclude there are significant real effects of merger control on firm performance.<table><title><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref9t0025\"/></link></title><tgroup cols=\"4\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"136\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\" colwidth=\"152\"/><thead><row><entry><anchor id=\"reference9t0025\"/></entry><entry>Model 1 (Tobin's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">q</emphasis>)</entry><entry>Model 2 (Free cash flow)</entry><entry>Model 3 (Asset utilization)</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry>Difference-in-differences variables</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">d(merger control)</entry><entry>\u22120.9108<sup>\u204e\u204e\u204e</sup></entry><entry>519,600<sup>\u204e\u204e\u204e</sup></entry><entry>0.7262<sup>\u204e\u204e\u204e</sup></entry></row><row><entry>(0.2161)</entry><entry>(187,500)</entry><entry>(0.2498)</entry></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">d(post-reform)</entry><entry>\u22120.6422<sup>\u204e\u204e\u204e</sup></entry><entry>44,990</entry><entry>\u22120.5714<sup>\u204e\u204e</sup></entry></row><row><entry>(0.1732)</entry><entry>(153,100)</entry><entry>(0.2879)</entry></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">DDE<sub>ECMR</sub></entry><entry>0.7895<sup>\u204e\u204e\u204e</sup></entry><entry>\u2212378,100<sup>\u204e</sup></entry><entry>0.5849<sup>\u204e\u204e</sup></entry></row><row><entry>(0.2459)</entry><entry>(214,400)</entry><entry>(0.2570)</entry></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">(Intercept)</entry><entry>13370<sup>\u204e\u204e\u204e</sup></entry><entry>\u22123215</entry><entry>\u22120.5976<sup>\u204e\u204e</sup></entry></row><row><entry>(0.1530)</entry><entry>(13,330)</entry><entry>(0.2819)</entry></row><row><entry>Industry-year fixed effects</entry><entry>Yes</entry><entry>Yes</entry><entry>Yes</entry></row><row><entry>Firm controls</entry><entry>Selected</entry><entry>Selected</entry><entry>Selected</entry></row><row><entry>Deal controls</entry><entry>Selected</entry><entry>Selected</entry><entry>Selected</entry></row><row><entry># observations</entry><entry>1336</entry><entry>1336</entry><entry>1336</entry></row><row><entry>R<sup>2</sup></entry><entry>0.04</entry><entry>0.04</entry><entry>0.11</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">F</emphasis>-statistic</entry><entry>4.06</entry><entry>4.28</entry><entry>12.66</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>-value</entry><entry>0.000</entry><entry>0.000</entry><entry>0.000</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Table 5 - Long-run effects on agency costs.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.5. Quality of law enforcement</emphasis></h><p>We next examine how the quality of law enforcement moderates the effect of merger control on acquirer returns. Prior studies have highlighted the importance of public enforcement (<link><marker>Jackson and Roe, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0260\"/></link>), and show that financial market efficiency increases with the strength of enforcement agencies and the strictness of legal sanctions (<link><marker>Dubois et al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0160\"/></link>). In the context of merger control, we expect that jurisdictions with weaker law enforcement agencies will benefit the least from the Reform, for two reasons. First, because the EU lacks an executive authority, national executive branches enforce remedies and fines. If a national executive branch is relatively weak, the changes brought about by the Reform will likely impact the market in that jurisdiction to a lesser degree. Second, consistent with our entrenchment explanation, potential claims of indemnification and similar matters (e.g., shareholders suing (entrenched) managers for attempting obviously anticompetitive mergers that resulted in reputational and financial damages to the firm) are subject to civil action. Civil law charges are dealt with by national courts, and thus are subject to national law enforcement.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0285\"/>To test the hypothesis related to the quality of law enforcement, we run a triple difference model, in which we introduce another variable, d(weak enforcement), which we interact with all other diff-in-diff variables. Most importantly, the triple difference estimator, DDDE<sub>Enforcement</sub>, is defined as DDE<sub>ECMR</sub>*d(weak enforcement). It measures the marginal effect of a jurisdiction with below-median enforcement quality on the positive marginal effect of the Reform on investment efficiency. We operationalize d(weak enforcement) with two aspects of enforcement quality. First, supervisory characteristics measure the extent to which enforcers are dependent on the government. Second, criminal sanctions measure the extent to which misconduct in financial markets is punished. Both measures come from <link><marker>La Porta et al. (2006)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0285\"/></link>. The dummy variable d(weak enforcement) equals 1 for jurisdictions with below-median scores in <link><marker>La Porta et al.'s (2006)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0285\"/></link> index, and 0 otherwise.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref90030\"/>The results of our triple difference model are in <link><marker>Table 6</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90030\"/></link>. Panel A employs the d(weak enforcement) variable based on supervisory characteristics, while the d(weak enforcement) variable in panel B is based on the criminal sanctions index. The estimate for DDDE<sub>Enforcement</sub> is significantly negative in both panels, ranging from \u22122.27% to \u22123.39% in panel A and from \u22121.79% to 2.92% in panel B. The control variables are suppressed, because they are very similar to those reported in the double difference models in <link><marker>Table 4</marker><locator

This estimate corresponds to the coefficient on d(post-Reform) in <link><marker>Table 3</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90015\"/></link>. Similarly, the \u22124.26% pre-Reform difference between the treatment and control groups (with a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>-value below 1%) corresponds to the estimate for d(merger control).

In contrast, for fragmented industries, the estimator is small (0.99%) and insignificant.</p><p>Overall, these results corroborate our hypotheses that the negative effect of pre-Reform merger control is significantly stronger in concentrated industries, and that the Reform's marginally positive effect on this relation is more pronounced where product market competition is low. This is consistent with the notion that merger control-related uncertainty deters more M&amp;A in concentrated industries because the probability of regulatory intervention is higher. It therefore amplifies managerial entrenchment and enables relatively more agency-motivated acquisitions.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6.

However, most importantly, we find an insignificant \"placebo DDE\" that is close to zero. Accordingly, there is no evidence of different time trends in the pre-event years, and our results are robust to this falsification attempt.</p><p>Note that a natural concern is that the causal effect estimators in our diff-in-diff approach may be model-dependent, because the treatment (the Reform) was not truly randomly assigned - only M&amp;A deals deemed to potentially significantly impede effective competition in the EU were affected by it. In this case, the sample distributions of the treatment and control groups would not perfectly resemble each other with respect to all firm and deal characteristics.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0330\"/>Matching according to relative deal size is particularly important in our setup.

To accurately measure the incremental impact of one size variable on acquirer returns, one needs to control for the other.145 We re-run our baseline models from <link><marker>Table 3</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90015\"/></link> using size-adjusted CARs, and the results are in <link><marker>Table 9</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90045\"/></link>.

However, the regression results in <link><marker>Table 10</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90050\"/></link> indicate that DDE<sub>ECMR</sub> is still highly statistical significant across all models, and close to the coefficients reported in <link><marker>Table 9</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90045\"/></link>. Moreover, the diff-in-diff estimators vary little across models for different truncation levels, which provides further evidence.150 Overall, this suggests that our results are not caused by the firm size disparity between the treatment and control groups.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0195\"/>Next, we control for a concurrent regulatory reform, the European Takeover Directive (ETD).155 The implementation of the ETD in May 2006 created a level playing field for takeovers in Europe by harmonizing takeover law, strengthening shareholder and minority shareholder rights, and installing efficient takeover mechanisms (<link><marker>European Commission, 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0195\"/></link>; <link><marker>Moschieri and Campa, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0345\"/></link>). Although the ETD's net effect on acquirer returns was likely detrimental (<link><marker>Humphery-Jenner, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0245\"/></link>), some European countries still benefited from it (<link><marker>Dissanaike et al., 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link>). This influence could be problematic for our study if the distribution of transactions by acquirer country is different after the merger control-related Reform. It would imply that at least part of the identified variation in investment efficiency around the Reform could be attributed to the ETD.</p><p>To control for the ETD, we follow <link><marker>Dissanaike et al., 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link>, and estimate its effect on acquirer returns. Countries that significantly improved their takeover laws by adopting at least one of the ETD's four major statutes (mandatory bid rule, board neutrality rule, and squeeze-out and sell-out rights) are assigned a value of 1 [ETD<sub>improvement</sub> = 1], and 0 otherwise. Those countries include Belgium, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Spain. Countries where the ETD had little or no effect on takeover laws include Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, and the U.K. We create an indicator for transactions that took place after the ETD's May 2006 implementation deadline of [ETD<sub>after</sub> = 1 if true, ETD<sub>after</sub> = 0 otherwise]. The interaction term [DDE<sub>ETD</sub> = (ETD<sub>improvement</sub>)*(ETD<sub>after</sub>)] serves as the estimator for the causal effect of the ETD on acquirer returns. All three variables are included in our regression models.</p><p>Finally, we add country-level variables to our regressions, because institutional differences across countries may bias our diff-in-diff estimator (DDE<sub>ECMR</sub>) if the geographical distribution of transactions subsequent to the ECMR Reform differs. We control for legal origin (Anglo-Saxon, French, German, and Scandinavian), ownership dispersion, corruption control, and regulatory quality (see <link><marker>Table A1</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90070\"/></link> in the Appendix for a definition of the country-level institutional control variables).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref90055\"/><link><marker>Table 11</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90055\"/></link> shows the regression results controlling for the ETD and institutional variables.

Parameter estimates for firm and deal characteristics are also similar to those reported in <link><marker>Table 3</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90015\"/></link>.

id=\"ref5b0090\"/>Furthermore, our results confirm the findings of <link><marker>Dissanaike et al., 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link> that the ETD-induced improvement of legal shareholder rights caused an increase in acquirer returns in countries that adopted the ETD's main tenets. This is specifically reflected in our DDE<sub>ETD</sub> estimate, which is significantly positive. This result is consistent with recent theoretical work, suggesting that acquirer returns are increasing with the quality of legal investor protection (<link><marker>Burkart et al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0090\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0075\"/>Finally, we find a significantly positive coefficient for corruption control, indicating that acquirer returns decrease when it is easier for public power to be exercised for private gains. This result is consistent with <link><marker>Bittlingmayer and Hazlett's (2000)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0075\"/></link> argument that merger control blocks efficient M&amp;A deals for reasons such as bureaucratic self-interest, private use of antitrust statutes, and political extraction.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0120\"/>Two other regulatory reforms that coincide with our sample period are the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Markets in Financial Instruments Directive</emphasis> (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">MiFID</emphasis>), and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Market Abuse Directive</emphasis> (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">MAD</emphasis>). MiFID harmonized trading rules in November 2007, and MAD, although passed in 2004, was implemented at the same time (see <link><marker>Cumming and Johan (2008)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0120\"/></link> for a discussion of why). <link><marker>Cumming et al. (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0130\"/></link> show that MiFID-related indices, which were developed in <link><marker>Cumming et al.

Thus, we also control for these indices in <link><marker>Table 12</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90060\"/></link>. Specifically, we control for the Market Manipulation Rules Index (MMI) and the Insider Trading Rules Index (ITI). The MMI is constructed as the sum of various price and volume manipulation rules, as well as spoofing and false disclosure rules. The ITI is defined as the sum of dummy variables for front-running, client precedence, trading ahead of research reports, separation of research and trading, broker ownership limit, restrictions on affiliation, restrictions on communications, investment company securities, influencing or rewarding the employees of others, and anti-intimidation/coordination.<table><title><link><locator

<link><marker>Table 12</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90060\"/></link> show that both indices are associated with negative parameter estimates (significant at the 10% level). This suggests that the MMI and the ITI are negatively correlated with acquirers' CARs. While these findings are not expected, they are consistent with evidence in <link><marker>Cumming et al.'s (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0130\"/></link> study of end-of-day price manipulation. They report that the targets' returns slightly increase in these two indices. They also propose <link><marker>Becker's (1968)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0055\"/></link> theory of crime as a possible explanation of their finding, according to which the reward of committing an illegal act must outweigh the risk and costs of being caught. While it is beyond the scope of our study to examine the reasons for the signs on the MMI and ITI estimates, these robustness tests clearly show that our main variable of interest, DDE<sub>ECMR</sub>, is robust to including these MiFID-related controls. Therefore, we conclude that the identified ECMR effect is independent of the coinciding MiFID.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref90065\"/>In addition to our diff-in-diff setup, we exclude deals during the global financial crisis in yet another effort to address concerns about spurious correlation. Specifically, we exclude deals in the years 2007-2008, 2008-2009, and 2007-2009 in Models 1-3 in panel A of <link><marker>Table 13</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90065\"/></link>. This specification also yields a closer match between the length of the pre- and post-Reform windows. The results continue to be robust, with the estimates for the merger control dummy and DDE<sub>ECMR</sub> similar in terms of both magnitude and statistical significance. We thus conclude that neither the financial crisis nor the asymmetry in the length of the pre- and post-Reform windows materially impact our main findings.<table><title><link><locator

main hypothesis pertains to higher levels of takeover threats and lower managerial entrenchment following the Reform. Therefore, we further examine the robustness of our results by controlling for a set of country- and firm-level corporate governance variables. In panel B of <link><marker>Table 13</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90065\"/></link>, we control for <link><marker>Martynova and Renneboog's (2011b)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0315\"/></link> shareholder rights and minority shareholder rights indices. <link><marker>Dissanaike et al., 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link> show that shareholder rights are positively related to acquirer returns because they may reduce agency costs from managerial entrenchment. <link><marker>Wurgler (2000)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0425\"/></link> finds that strong minority shareholder rights increase investment efficiency by curbing investment in declining industries. Nevertheless, in the context of merger control, we fail to find significant effects of <link><marker>Martynova and Renneboog's (2011b)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0315\"/></link> indices.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0215\"/>We also control for the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) in panel B of <link><marker>Table 13</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90065\"/></link>. As per <link><marker>Giroud and Mueller (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0215\"/></link>, a high HHI, i.e., a concentrated industry, can be negatively related to firm value when other governance mechanisms are weak. This is because, absent product market competition, managers can exercise greater discretion. Supporting <link><marker>Giroud and Mueller's (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0215\"/></link> argument, we find a significantly negative coefficient in Model 3. This finding is consistent with our earlier results in <link><marker>Table 7</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90035\"/></link>. In particular, firms in concentrated industries are more likely to be affected by competition policy, and, if the effect of merger control is value-destroying, it should be more pronounced in high-HHI sectors.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0405\"/>In panel C of <link><marker>Table 13</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90065\"/></link>, we control for different ownership stakes at the bidder level. <link><marker>Tirole (2001)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0405\"/></link> argues that large blockholders, if necessary, have an incentive to closely monitor managers and discipline them. However, whether blockholder monitoring creates value is a source of some contention.160 Most recently, <link><marker>Asker et al. (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0025\"/></link> fail to find support for this argument in a corporate investment context. Similarly, our evidence suggests that, at least in an M&amp;A context, ownership is not related to acquirer returns.</p><p>The most important observation in panels B and C in <link><marker>Table 13</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90065\"/></link> is that the estimates for the merger control dummy and DDE<sub>ECMR</sub> remain similar, both in terms of magnitude and of statistical significance. We conclude that the valuation effects associated with merger control are not driven by differences in acquirers' corporate governance standards, e.g., only bids from poorly governed firms in the pre-reform period. Rather, the legal uncertainty and the costs related to merger control lead to managerial entrenchment and agency-motivated takeovers in the controlled deals segment, independent of the acquirers' level of corporate governance.</p><p>Another potential concern is that our results may be driven by more profitable deals that could only be realized after the Reform. Therefore, we check whether target and deal characteristics that are known to influence acquirer returns have changed before and after implementation of the Reform. To further mitigate selection concerns, and isolate our proposed agency channel when the nature of completed deals in the market has potentially changed for a variety of other reasons targeted in the Reform, we estimate diff-in-diff regressions using the following dependent variables: relative deal size, leverage, diversification, hostile takeover, and days to complete (see <link><marker>Table A1</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90070\"/></link> for the definitions). Overall, in unreported results, all diff-in-diff coefficients of interest are insignificant. Thus, there are no indications that changes in target and/or deal characteristics can explain the observed uplift in acquirer returns in the post-Reform period.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0280\"/>Finally, we check the sensitivity of our results to a battery of ad hoc specifications that are common in the literature. The (unreported) results are also robust to the following modifications: (1) measuring CARs alternatively by mean-adjusted CARs,165 (2) using a dummy variable approach, where our dependent variable equals 1 if the market-adjusted returns are positive, and 0 otherwise, (3) clustering standard errors by years and countries, (4) re-running regressions with equally long observation windows (i.e., pre-Reform: 2001-May 2004; post-Reform: June 2004-2007), (5) including <link><marker>La Porta et al.'s (1998)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0280\"/></link> antidirector and creditor rights indices and <link><marker>Martynova and Renneboog's (2011b)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0315\"/></link> shareholder, minority shareholder, and creditor rights indices as control variables, (6) distinguishing the method of payment in all-cash, stock component, and all-stock deals, (7) controlling for whether the acquirer or the target comes from a large country,170 (8) controlling for whether the acquirer and target speak the same language, and (9) re-estimating our models with a subsample that systematically excludes acquisitions in one specific industry and/or country to ensure our results are not biased by a spurious correlation with confounding events in a particular industry or country during our sample period.175</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7. Conclusion</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0220\"/>This paper uses the 2004 Reform of merger control in Europe as a natural experiment to establish a causal link between merger control and acquirer returns. Combining propensity score matching and difference-in-differences methodologies, we find that merger control depresses acquirer returns in controlled deals. Much of the value destruction can be attributed to regulatory uncertainty. Uncertainty about merger control decisions impedes takeover threats from foreign and very large acquirers, which creates managerial entrenchment and enables agency-motivated acquisitions. Agency costs are also higher in the controlled deals segment over the long run. These effects are more pronounced when deals involve firms in concentrated industries and in countries with government-dependent supervisory authorities and lax criminal sanctions. While the entrenchment-value relation is well documented in the literature (<link><marker>Gompers et al., 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0220\"/></link>; <link><marker>Bebchuk et al., 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0050\"/></link>; <link><marker>Masulis et al., 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0320\"/></link>; <link><marker>Harford et al., 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0230\"/></link>), we offer the first study to show that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">merger control</emphasis> can create value-destroying entrenchment.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0035\"/>Overall, this study makes important contributions to the role of the regulatory embeddedness of the market for corporate control, and specifically to the effect of competition policy on investment efficiency. Our findings have important policy implications, inter alia, for the institutional design of merger control in several jurisdictions. The identified detrimental effect on M&amp;A efficiency contributes to the debate about the need for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ex ante</emphasis> merger control, i.e., merger control based on hypothetical scenarios, and to whether there is a need for competition policy (<link><marker>Baker, 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0035\"/></link>; <link><marker>Crandall and Winston, 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0115\"/></link>; <link><marker>Duso et al., 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0170\"/></link>). However, further research on the net effect of value destruction in M&amp;A and the protection of consumers would be needed to better understand whether and how merger control is ultimately socially beneficial.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></h><p>We thank two anonymous referees, as well as Nihat Aktas, Joseph Clougherty, Douglas Cumming (the editor), Eric Devos, Espen Eckbo, Klaus Gugler, Antonio Macias, Geoff Meeks, Felix von Meyerinck, Georg Ringe, Zachary Sauers, Christoph Schneider, Karin Thorburn, Franziska Weber, Geoff Whittington, and Iana Zborshchyk.

It encouraged a lengthy pre-notification process in order to allow potential issues to be identified and information requirements to be agreed upon. This ensured a more efficient post-notification process. It also ended the requirement that the merging parties sign a binding letter of intent (Art. 5 I 2nd paragraph). This gives parties more control over the timing of the antitrust review process.

(2007)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0320\"/></link>, industry-year fixed effects are captured by adding the volume of all acquisitions in a given industry (contained in Thomson Reuter's M&amp;A database) divided by the volume of sales of that industry in a given year.</p><p>We thank a reviewer for pointing this out.</p><p>For example, French President Charles de Gaulle intervened when French carmaker Citroen was about to be acquired by Italian carmaker Fiat. Shortly thereafter, it was arranged that France's Peugeot would acquire Citroen (see <link><marker>Dinc and Erel, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0145\"/></link>).</p><p>The fact that firm size (measured using sales) increased during our sample period does not affect our diff-in-diff results. As reported in <link><marker>Table 1</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90005\"/></link>, acquirers in the treatment group become larger after the reform, while acquirers in the control group become smaller. Because larger acquirers tend to generate smaller announcement returns than smaller ones (<link><marker>Moeller et al., 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0330\"/></link>; <link><marker>2005</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link>), this divergence in firm size further strengthens our results.</p><p>Similarly, <link><marker>McLean et al. (2012)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0325\"/></link> show that firms in countries with strong minority shareholder rights exhibit a higher sensitivity of investment to growth opportunities, and enjoy higher factor productivity growth and higher profitability.</p><p>This is also the view of the <link><marker>European Commission (2007)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0195\"/></link>. It states in its horizontal merger guidelines that, \"The overall concentration level in a market may also provide useful information about the competitive situation. In order to measure concentration levels, the Commission often applies the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). [...] The absolute level of the HHI can give an initial indication of the competitive pressure in the market post-merger.\"</p><p>For the sake of brevity, we only report the diff-in-diff coefficients and suppress the remaining control variables. All are similar to those reported in Table 3.</p><p>Schneider and Spalt (2019) find that, once correlation is removed, the return patterns for bidder size are the mirror-image of the patterns for the target size effect. They conclude that size should not be used as a proxy for some underlying value driver, but it rather scales a given per dollar gain or loss.</p><p>If firm size had a confounding effect, we would expect the diff-in-diff estimator to decline from Model 1 to Model 2 and then to Model 3 as the firm size distributions of the treatment and control groups converge.</p><p>Directive 2004/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 21, 2004, on takeover bids.</p><p><link><marker>Demsetz and Villalonga (2001)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0135\"/></link> provide a comprehensive review of studies that examine the relation between ownership concentration and firm value.

Estimation and event windows are the same as for the market-adjusted CARs.</p><p>Consistent with <link><marker>Duso et al. (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0170\"/></link>, we define France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the U.K. as large countries.</p><p>Other potential control variables may affect our dependent variable, such as whether merging firms have the same auditor, or whether they share the same accounting standards (<link><marker>Chircop et al., 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0100\"/></link>). Unfortunately, we are not able to include these controls in our empirical tests because of insufficient data availability. For example, <link><marker>Chircop et al. (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0100\"/></link> show that common auditors can reduce deal uncertainty, which results in higher M&amp;A efficiency. In our study, this may influence our main results if the relative frequency with which merging firms share an auditor changed after the Reform, but there is no basis for such an assumption. Therefore, the parallel trend assumption in our model should be not be affected by the presence of a \"common auditor\" control.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: \u204e Corresponding author.</p></bodyText></contact><graphic/><bibliography><bodyText><p><anchor id=\"reference5b0005\"/><link><marker>Aktas et al., 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref5b0005\"/></link> N.

In the report, the three authors, all academics, share their views on the application of competition rules to platforms, data, and digital and tech 'killer' acquisitions. While confirming that the fundamental goals of competition law remain the same in relation to the digital economy, the Advisers advocate 'vigorous' enforcement and certain adjustments to the way competition law is currently applied, including:Tougher treatment of a dominant platform's alleged 'self-preferencing' of its own products and services; Potential data-sharing or interoperability remedies for dominant technology companies if required to ensure effective competition by breaking down network effects and data-related entry barriers; No change to the EU merger control thresholds to capture so-called 'killer' acquisitions (where a supposedly dominant incumbent buys out a nascent technology that might have emerged as a competitive threat), but suggesting that if these types of deals are identified, it should be for the companies to prove no anti-competitive effects or offsetting efficiencies. BackgroundOn March 28, 2018, Commissioner Vestager appointed the academics \u2014 Heike Schweitzer, professor of law at the Humboldt University of Berlin; Jacques Crmer, professor of economics at the Toulouse School of Economics; and Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, assistant professor of data science at Imperial College London \u2014 as special advisers for a period of one year (mandate ended on March 31, 2019) to help explore how competition policy should evolve to continue to promote innovation in the digital age. </p><p>In their much-awaited final report, the three experts describe what they see as the main characteristics and challenges of the digital economy and they make general suggestions on the application of EU competition rules to platforms, data, and digital and tech 'killer' acquisitions. The Advisers identify strong economies of scope across the digital economy, which favors the development of ecosystems, giving incumbents a strong competitive advantage that makes them 'very difficult to dislodge.' The Advisers also identify a 'reasonable concern that dominant digital companies have strong incentives to engage in anti-competitive behaviour' that require 'vigorous' competition enforcement and adjustments to the way competition law is currently applied. Current under-enforcement in the digital sphere is a concern and thus strategies by dominant companies to reduce competition 'should be forbidden' unless the company can clearly demonstrate benefits for consumers. While the Advisers consider that the existing basic framework of EU competition law remains relevant and sufficiently flexible to protect competition in the digital age, they advocate a departure from certain established concepts, doctrines and methodologies \u2014 such as consumer welfare, market definition and market power \u2014 and more emphasis on theories of harm and identification of anti-competitive strategies.PlatformsIn markets where network effects and returns to scale are strong, the Advisers consider 'there might be room in the market for only a limited number of platforms.' In such context it is essential to both protect competition 'for' the market and protect competition 'in' the market (i.e., on the platform itself). The Advisers argue that large platforms have a quasi-regulatory role as they determine the rules according to which their users interact. The fact that they determine rules is not an issue per se, but when acting as regulators, they have a responsibility to use their power in a pro-competitive manner and should 'take this role seriously.' The Advisers further advocate that actions by a dominant platform to impede market entry without competing on the merits (e.g., through the use of 'most favored nation' clauses, best price clauses, restrictions on multi-homing and switching) 'should be suspect under competition law' and that the dominant platform should bear the burden of demonstrating the efficiency of such measures as defense. The Advisers note that self-preferencing by a dominant platform (i.e., giving preferential treatment to the platform's own products or services when they are in competition with products and services of other entities using the platform) is not abusive per se but should be subject to an 'effects test.' Self-preferencing by a vertically integrated dominant digital platform can be abusive when it is not justified by a pro-competitive rationale. The Advisers propose that, to the extent that the platform performs a regulatory function, it should bear the burden of demonstrating that self-preferencing has no long-term exclusionary effects on product markets. Where self-preferencing has significantly benefited a platform's subsidiary by improving its market position vis--vis competitors, remedies might need to include a restorative element.DataThe Advisers note that timely access to relevant data is increasingly becoming a parameter for competitiveness. However, a broad dissemination of data must be balanced against the need to ensure sufficient investment incentives for firms to collect and process data, as well as the need to protect privacy and business secrets. Commenting on the report, Commissioner Vestager stated 'as data becomes the key to success, the huge quantities of information that some big businesses have can give them an edge that smaller rivals can't match. And the importance of network effects can mean that it's hard for smaller firms to compete, even with a better product, if they don't have a critical mass of users,'2 but also that 'collecting data also takes effort and time. So if we insist that companies share it with others, without proper compensation, we could discourage others from putting in those efforts in the future.'3 Data sharing and data pooling arrangements are not fully developed. While a legal framework is yet to be clearly defined, the Advisers consider that a block exemption regulation on data sharing and data pooling may be appropriate. In a number of cases, data access will not be indispensable to competition and if so, public authorities should refrain from intervention. However, there are cases where an obligation to ensure data access \u2014 and possibly data interoperability \u2014 'may need to be imposed.' This would be the case for data needed to serve complementary markets or aftermarkets, i.e., markets that are part of the broader ecosystem served by the data controller. The Advisers consider that data access/interoperability can be a remedy against anti-competitive leveraging of market into markets for complementary services and add that '[w]here vertical and conglomerate integration and the rise of powerful ecosystems may raise concerns, requiring dominant players to ensure data interoperability may be an attractive and efficient alternative to calling for the break-up of firms \u2014 a way that allows us to continue to benefit from the efficiencies of integration.'Digital and Tech 'Killer Acquisitions'The Advisers examine whether the current EU merger control rules need to be revised to address concerns relating to early elimination of potential rivals by dominant firms, through acquisitions of small startups with a quickly growing user base and significant competitive potential, commonly called 'killer acquisitions.' Many of these acquisitions may escape the European Commission's jurisdiction because they take place when the targets do not yet generate sufficient revenue to meet the conditions of the EU Merger Regulation. The Advisers consider it too early to contemplate any changes to the rules. They consider it more appropriate, for the time being, to monitor the performance of new thresholds linked to transaction value that were recently introduced in certain member states, such as Germany and Austria. Amendments to the EU rules may become justified in the future. The Advisers consider however that there is a need to revisit the substantive theories of harm to properly assess acquisitions in the digital sector. The report states that competition law should be particularly concerned about protecting the ability of competitors to enter markets. This would imply a heightened degree of control of acquisitions of small startups by dominant platforms and/or ecosystems, to analyze whether they are used as a possible strategy against partial user desertion from the ecosystem. The report adds that where an acquisition is plausibly part of such a strategy, the notifying parties should bear the burden of showing that the adverse effects on competition are offset by merger-specific efficiencies. The report specifies that this theory of harm does not create a presumption against the legality of such mergers but that it takes due account of new business strategies and the competitive risks they raise.Similar UK initiativeOn March 13, 2019, the Digital Competition Expert Panel appointed by the U.K. chancellor and chaired by professor Jason Furman, former chief economist to President Obama, issued a similar report making strategic recommendations for changes to the U.K.'s competition framework to face the opportunities and challenges of the digital economy.4 The report recommends updating the rules governing merger and antitrust enforcement. In particular, the report advocates the need for the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to take more frequent and firmer action to examine digital and tech acquisitions and calls for a review of the CMA merger assessment guidelines based on the latest economic understanding and an update of the legislation clarifying the standards for blocking or conditioning a merger. The report also stresses the need to prioritize and fast-track enforcement in digital markets, placing less reliance on large fines and enabling action that targets and remedies issues more directly. The report also proposes a set of pro-competition measures to open up digital markets, such as the establishment of a pro-competition digital markets unit tasked with securing competition, innovation and beneficial outcomes for consumers and businesses.ConclusionThe Advisers' report makes general suggestions on the application of the EU competition rules to the digital sphere. While it does not suggest a complete overhaul of existing competition policy, it proposes adjustments to established concepts and assessment tools. In some areas, the report suggests that regulatory changes may be needed in the longer run. However, the Advisers do not envision a new type of 'public utility regulation' to emerge for the digital economy: '[T]he risks associated with such a regime \u2014 rigidity, lack of flexibility, and risk of capture \u2014 are too high.' At the same time, the report advocates that competition agencies can contribute to the better functioning of the digital economy by providing more guidance, thereby creating more legal certainty for companies. For instance, guidance may be needed on the definition of dominance in the digital environment, the duties of dominant platforms as regulators, data sharing and data pooling, data access and interoperability requirements. Rather than offering a final word on how the EU rules on competition should adapt to the fast-moving and fast-growing digital economy, the report provides a significant contribution to the ongoing debate between competition authorities, academics and other stakeholders on both sides of the Atlantic as to whether existing competition rules are fit to address the many challenges and opportunities of the digital economy. The report offers a clear contrast to recent proposals promoted by U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren to 'break up' big tech companies and impose 'big, structural changes' to the sector. Commissioner Vestager has recently stated that in the EU, structural changes in the tech industry are met with great skepticism and breaking up big tech companies would be 'the last resort,' as EU enforcers are focused on using existing antitrust rules to address issues in the market.5 The report suggests that access to data and data interoperability may be an efficient alternative to breaking up big tech companies. Commenting on the publication of the report, Commissioner Vestager said that the European Commission will 'need to take some time to think about those ideas and to discuss and debate before conclusions are reached.'6 It might be some time before we see drastic proposals for change. It also remains to be seen how the new commission will implement the proposals offered by the report after the elections this fall. * * * Skadden senior professional support lawyer Caroline Janssens contributed to this article. _______________ 1'Competition Policy for the Digital Era[1],' a report by Jacques Crmer, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, Heike Schweitzer, 2019. 2'Defending Competition in a Digitised World[2],' a speech by Margrethe Vestager at the European Consumer and Competition Day, Bucharest, April 4, 2019. 3 Ibidem. 4'Unlocking Digital Competition: Report of the Digital Competition Expert Panel[3],'March 2019. 5 'Warren Says She'll Break Up Amazon, Facebook, Google if Elected President in 2020,' MLex, March 8, 2019; 'Warren Proposal to Break Up Big Tech Is 'Very Far-Reaching,' Vestager Says,' MLex, March 11, 2019. 6 'Defending Competition in a Digitised World,' a speech by Margrethe Vestager, op. cit.

The FTC's extraordinarily elastic mandate--including the power to ban \"unfair methods of competition\" (1) and \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" (2) and its diverse portfolio of policy making tools' (3)--gives the FTC a seemingly unmatched capacity to study and remedy a multitude of economic problems. (4) Since the FTC's creation in 1914, these institutional features have placed the agency in the center of debates about the future of U.S. competition and consumer protection policy. (5)</p><p>Today the FTC is again in the spotlight. Various commentators have urged that the FTC dramatically expand its efforts to apply its distinctive powers. (6) The suggested agenda for the FTC includes measures to reduce excessive levels of industrial concentration, to arrest abusive behavior by dominant enterprises, to protect the interests of small and medium enterprises, and to achieve a range of social policy objectives beyond the promotion of economic efficiency. (7) To some observers, the FTC's scalable mandate makes it the preferred vehicle for a fundamental reorientation of competition and consumer protection policy. (8)</p><p>In the late 1960s and in the 1970s, similar calls for action helped spur ambitious applications of the FTC's competition and consumer protection powers. (9) As the FTC's chairman from May 1977 to February 1981, Michael Pertschuk exemplified the FTC's determination to exercise the full potential inherent in its mandate. (10) Pertschuk came to the FTC after a long, influential career as a congressional staffer. (11) As FTC chairman, he urged the Commission to embrace a view of \"competition... in its broadest sense\" and to apply the agency's powers expansively. (12)</p><p>The program conceived by Pertschuk and his predecessors at the FTC in the late 1960s and in the 1970s was breathtaking in its aims and means. The agency achieved some litigation and rulemaking successes, and introduced policies that have had enduring value. (13) At the same time, the FTC's program of the 1970s generated many failed cases and rules. (14) FTC efforts to explore the outer limits of its powers elicited powerful political backlash that threatened a major curtailment of the agency's jurisdiction. (15)</p><p>This Article examines Michael Pertschuk's leadership of the FTC for several purposes. This Article uses this era to consider the policy implementation difficulties that an \"independent\" regulatory agency faces when it seeks to apply a powerful, flexible policy mandate. (16) This Article also studies the institutional prerequisites for such an agency to apply this mandate effectively. (17) These predicates include an awareness of the broader political and economic context in which the agency operates, the development of sound methods to set priorities and choose specific projects, and the establishment of effective processes to match an agency's commitments to its capabilities. (18) In doing these things, the Article suggests implications of the FTC's 1970s experience for modern proposals that would have the FTC undertake a far-reaching expansion of its existing law enforcement and regulatory programs. (19)</p><p>The Article proceeds as follows. Part I describes the FTC policymaking status quo when Pertschuk became chair in 1977. This Part traces the causes and content of the sweeping redirection of FTC programs that began in the late 1960s and carried forward until Pertschuk came to the agency in May 1977.</p><p>Part II sets out how Pertschuk defined his agenda in 1977. Pertschuk presented the basic ingredients of his program in two speeches delivered late in 1977. (20) The speeches provide essential foundations for understanding the evolution of modern U.S. competition and consumer protection policy.</p><p>Part III describes how the FTC sought to realize Pertschuk's vision from 1977 until March 1981, when President Ronald Reagan appointed David Clanton to serve as the agency's acting chairman.</p><p>Part IV critically assesses the FTC's experience in the 1970s. The Article does not evaluate the economic effects of the agency's program during this period. Instead, it focuses on the quality of the FTC's program from an institutional perspective. It emphasizes two institutional flaws: a failure to ensure that the agency had the capacity to successfully carry out its ambitious agenda, and a failure to account for how the FTC's projects would land in an increasingly hostile political environment. Among other developments, this discussion also recounts congressional moves from 1979 through the early 1980s to curb the FTC's antitrust and consumer protection authority.</p><p>Part V turns to the potential implications of the FTC's experience in the 1970s for modern debates about possible adjustments to antitrust law and policy. Drawing upon modern commentary, Part V sketches what a far-reaching program to reorient and expand the FTC's antitrust and consumer protection programs might look like. Part V does not assess the substantive wisdom of proposals for FTC policy reforms. Instead, it uses the institutional perspective set out in Part IV to consider how the agency might fare in seeking to implement a bolder program of enforcement, notably measures to break up concentrated industries.</p><p>The story of the FTC in the 1970s reveals phenomena that ought to inform contemporary discussions about the purposes and content of U.S. competition and consumer protection policy. This Article chiefly examines the FTC's experience, but it also notes parallel developments in the antitrust progam of the Department of Justice (DOJ). Despite its U.S.-centric orientation, the story has things for other jurisdictions to ponder, as well.</p><p>I. MAKEOVER: THE FTC FROM 1969 TO THE PERTSCHUK CHAIRMANSHIP</p><p>In the late 1960s and through the 1970s, the FTC undertook a sweeping overhaul of its competition and consumer protection programs. Two highly critical studies of the agency set the reforms in motion. In early 1969, Ralph Nader's organization published a caustic evaluation of the agency, focusing chiefly on its consumer protection programs. (21) Publication of the Nader study led President Richard Nixon to request the American Bar Association (ABA) to carry out its own inquiry. (22) Later in 1969, an ABA-sponsored blue ribbon panel issued a report that largely echoed the Nader study's dismal assessment, albeit in less flamboyant terms. (23) The following Section reviews the Nader and ABA studies and discusses their significance for the FTC's work in the 1970s. (24)</p><p>A. The Nader and ABA Reports</p><p>Taken together, four aspects of the Nader and ABA studies stand out, because they shaped expectations about what the FTC had to do to redeem itself and justify its continued existence. First, both studies depicted the agency as being an appallingly bad institution. The Nader study relentlessly criticized the FTC's work, suggesting that only by chance did the FTC occasionally stumble into doing something that advanced consumer interests. (25) The ABA panel more generously recognized positive FTC accomplishments, (26) but suggested that these appeared as rare oases in a desert of ineptitude, sloth, and timidity. (27)</p><p>Second, both reports blamed several causes; chief among them the FTC's obsession with trivial cases. (28) Both groups scolded the agency for spending massive consumer protection resources on policing the labeling requirements for furs and textiles. (29) On the antitrust side, the ABA damned the FTC for its preoccupation with Robinson-Patman enforcement to the exclusion of other, more worthy pursuits, such as challenges to vertical contractual restraints. (30) The preoccupation with the trivial stemmed from a basic failure to devise internal policy planning and priority setting mechanisms to focus resources on matters of true economic significance. (31) Grave weaknesses in senior leadership and the professional staff likewise denied the FTC the talent it needed to function effectively. (32)</p><p>Third, both reports featured a notably scathing tone. The Nader report dripped with contempt. In a chapter titled \"The Cancer,\" the Nader report observed: \"Misguided leadership is the malignant cancer that has already assumed control of the Commission, that has been silently destroying it, and that has spread its contagion on the growing crisis of the American consumer.\" (33) In another passage, the Nader report used words such as \"corruption\" and \"collusion\" to describe the agency's relationship with businesses under its supervision. (34) In his preface to the study, Nader said the FTC was \"a self-parody of bureaucracy, fat with cronyism, torpid through an inbreeding unusual even for Washington, manipulated by the agents of commercial predators, impervious to governmental and citizen monitoring.\" (35) Even the FTC's headquarters building took it on the chin: the Nader group observed that \"the architect of the Federal Trade Commission building had a genius for sensing the mediocre.\" (36)</p><p>The ABA panel's language was more prosaic than the Nader report, but its dreary recital of FTC failures conveyed a similar sense of institutional decay. The ABA panel documented major deficiencies in the FTC's competition and consumer programs, and recounted grave weaknesses in the agency's operational procedures (for example, for setting priorities) and leadership. (37) Richard Posner's dissent from the panel's recommendations was more pointed and less generous. (38) In a subsequent law review article, he recommended shutting down the agency. (39)</p><p>A fourth criticism appears most clearly in the ABA report. The ABA study reviewed earlier evaluations of the FTC, and perceived a powerful institutional resistance to needed reforms dating back to the agency's first decade. (40) The ABA's reading of past commentary indicated the persistence of the same flaws over time. (41) These included \"the absence of effective planning and failure to establish workable priorities, the consequent tendency to become involved in too many trivial cases, the delay and unnecessary secrecy in FTC operations, and the uneven quality of staff.\" (42)</p><p>Rather than dismantle the agency and allocate its duties to other government bodies, the ABA panel recommended that Congress give the FTC one last chance to demonstrate its worth. (43) As an antitrust policymaker, the FTC needed to focus resources on \"difficult and complex antitrust questions,\" (44) leaving enforcement of well-established, per se rules of illegality to the DOJ. (45) The redirection of effort would entail, among other means, a substantial curtailment of Robinson-Patman Act enforcement, which the FTC had made the centerpiece of its antitrust program in the 1950s and 1960s. (46) The new FTC would focus chiefly on matters \"where issues of anticompetitive effects turn essentially on complicated economic analysis, and where decided cases ha[d] not yet succeeded in fashioning a clear line marking the boundary between legal and illegal conduct.\" (47)</p><p>1. Institutional Implications of the Suggested Reforms</p><p>The ABA and Nader recommendations came with a major catch. The depiction of an agency so obdurate in its decades-long commitment to a program of economic insignificance, (48) punctuated only by occasional projects of genuine value, (49) suggested that the proof that the FTC had undertaken needed reforms would have to come in the form of dramatic enhancements in the FTC's program. (50) This would require the FTC to replace trivial matters with matters of the highest economic importance; swap out the repetitive application of well-settled legal principles for imaginative, pathbreaking cases that addressed unsettled areas of the law; and set aside timid, unimaginative matters in favor of bold, creative initiatives that exercised the full range of the agency's authority. (51) Big, visible, innovative applications of the FTC's powers would be essential to the agency's continued existence. (52) If the FTC could be likened to a movie production company, its merit would be measured by its capacity to turn out blockbusters--lots of them, and quickly.</p><p>How was the FTC to accomplish such an extraordinary turnaround? A fundamental retooling of the institution would be necessary. The ABA and Nader studies documented severe weaknesses in the FTC's operational methods and human talent. (53) Faulty planning induced a preoccupation with trivial matters and denied the agency the ability to set meaningful priorities and select projects to achieve them. (54) Poor case management and sclerotic procedures caused \"crippling delay[s]\" in carrying out projects. (55) Years of uneven appointments to senior leadership positions, and uninspired staff-level recruiting that deliberately targeted weak candidates whom other employers would not be tempted to poach, created serious talent deficits. (56) In order to revitalize its substantive program, the FTC needed to dramatically upgrade its internal decisionmaking processes and workforce. (57) The anticipated institutional makeover would require the agency to rebuild the house and live in it at the same time.</p><p>2. Deconcentration: A Focal Point for Expanded Enforcement</p><p>At the time of the Nader and ABA studies, economic concentration had emerged as a difficult, unsettled, and highly significant competition law issue--the very type that the ABA report envisioned the FTC asserting its powers over. From the mid-1940s through the 1960s, a large body of commentary argued that competition policy had failed grievously to deal effectively with economic concentration. (58) The literature said that, to a growing degree, dominant enterprises and tight oligopolies gripped the American economy. (59)</p><p>In 1945, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit's ruling in United States v. Aluminum Co. of America (Alcoa) seemed to open possibilities for the broader application of the Sherman Act to attack industrial concentration. (60) In 1947, two articles published in the same issue of the University of Chicago Law Review--one authored by Edward Levi and the other by Eugene Rostow--seized upon Alcoa to call for renewed federal enforcement to attack industrial concentration. (61) To both authors, the urgency for a basic redirection of U.S. competition policy was clear. A prominent academic, Levi later became Attorney General during the administration of President Gerald Ford. (62) In his article, he warned:</p><p>It is doubtful if a free and competitive society can be maintained if the direction of concentration is to continue.... If the concentration problem in this country is to be dealt with by measures themselves not incompatible with free enterprise, it is probable that the hope lies in the new interpretation of the Sherman Act and an increased awareness of the responsibility of the courts to give adequate relief. (63)</p><p>Rostow's article elaborated upon the same themes. High levels of concentration undermined economic performance: \"There is a great deal of evidence... that on the whole Big Business is less efficient, less progressive technically, and relatively less profitable than smaller business.\" (64) No less important was the danger that industrial concentration posed to the nation's broader social and political health. (65) Rostow said:</p><p>One of the major problems requiring a social decision in our time is whether we could achieve a wider dispersal of power and opportunity, and a broader base for the class structure of our society, by a more competitive organization of industry and trade, in smaller and more independent units. (66)</p><p>He added that \"[i]t should be easier to achieve the values of democracy in a society where economic power and social status are more widely distributed, and less concentrated, than in the United States today.\" (67)</p><p>Commentary from the 1940s through the 1960s acknowledged that from time to time since 1890, federal enforcement officials had mounted campaigns to dissolve positions of individual and shared dominance. (68) This literature contained a persistent theme that the government had gained few victories of true importance in seeking to deconcentrate industries dominated by a single firm or a small collection of firms. (69) Many commentators considered this lapse to be the single-greatest failure of the U.S. system and an urgent priority for correction. (70) One of the most powerful proposals for a redirection of policy appeared in 1959 with the publication of Donald Turner's and Carl Kaysen's book Antitrust Policy, which provided the most influential synthesis of the economics and law of competition policy of its time. (71) Kaysen and Turner said, \"The principal defect of present antitrust law is its inability to cope with market power created by jointly acting oligopolists.\" (72) Kaysen and Turner proposed new legislation that would restructure industries whose concentration exceeded certain thresholds. (73)</p><p>In 1969, when the Nader and ABA studies appeared, the case for a new program to reduce economic concentration received a boost from a blue ribbon panel convened by President Lyndon Johnson. (74) Known as the White House Task Force on Antitrust Policy, and chaired by Dean Phil Neal of the University of Chicago Law School, the group proposed a threefold strategy: expand the DOJ's and FTC's enforcement of the existing antitrust laws against dominant firms and tight oligopolies, police mergers more aggressively, and adopt new legislation to deconcentrate U.S. industry. (75) The Neal report helped frame expectations for the FTC makeover that the Nader and ABA studies demanded. (76) Some component of the FTC's competition program would have to include measures to address the problem of industrial concentration. (77)</p><p>B. The FTC's Antitrust Agenda Before the Pertschuk Chairmanship</p><p>Congress embraced the Nader and ABA studies' damning assessments of the FTC, and used the ABA report as a blueprint for reorienting the FTC's competition programs. (78) Echoing the ABA panel's \"one last chance\" warning, (79) some key legislators said the agency's continued existence depended on a sweeping overhaul. (80) At an FTC oversight hearing convened on the day the ABA panel issued its report, Senator Edward Kennedy said the time had come for the FTC to correct longstanding flaws, or \"to consider abolishing the agency and starting it from the ground again.\" (81)</p><p>The FTC got the message. From late 1969 until Michael Petschuk's arrival to chair the agency in May 1977, the FTC undertook a variety of new competition and consumer protection programs that responded to criticism from the ABA commission, the Nader study, and Congress. (82) Sketched below are some of the most notable elements of the agency's policy agenda in this period. This Section focuses on new competition cases initiated from 1969 onward, (83) and identifies selected respects in which the agency sought to formulate competition policy with tools other than litigation. (84) This Section emphasizes competition-related matters, and Part I.C briefly identifies important consumer protection initiatives that represented new directions in agency policy. (85)</p><p>This Section does not survey the FTC's work comprehensively. Instead, it captures highlights of the nonmerger competition program that was underway at the FTC when Pertshuck became chairman in 1977. This Section provides context for the discussion in Part II, below, which reviews Pertschuk's speeches in Boston and Atlanta late in 1977. In particular, this Section provides a basis for assessing Pertschuk's claim that federal antitrust enforcement policy (including the work of the FTC) had performed poorly due to a lack of ambition, frail political will, and a faulty understanding of the aims of competition law.</p><p>1. Concentrated Industries: Dominant Firms and Collective Dominance</p><p>One set of FTC cases that were filed between 1969 through 1976 addressed exclusionary conduct by dominant firms. The Commission initiated predatory pricing cases against the largest U.S. bread producer (IT&amp;T), (86) the leading U.S. instant coffee producer (General Foods), (87) and the largest U.S. reprocessed lemon juice producer (Borden). (88) In this period, the agency settled a monopolization claim against the largest plain-paper photocopier manufacturer (Xerox), (89) prosecuted the largest citrus fruits producer (Sunkist) for various exclusionary practices, (90) sued the largest U.S. automobile manufacturer (General Motors) for attempting to monopolize the distribution of crash parts, (91) and prosecuted the principal airline service directories publisher for a refusal to deal (Reuben Donnelley). (92)</p><p>A second category of cases dealing with concentrated sectors involved allegations of collective dominance. The FTC brought two matters that became known as \"shared monopoly\" cases. (93) In one matter, the agency challenged the four leading U.S. ready-to-eat breakfast cereal producers (Kellogg, General Mills, General Foods, and Quaker). (94) In the other, the FTC sued the eight leading U.S. petroleum refiners (Exxon, Mobil, Gulf, Texaco, Atlantic Richfield, Amoco, Chevron, and Shell). (95) The FTC also brought a conspiracy to monopolize case against the three leading automobile rental companies (Hertz, Avis, and National) for excluding rivals from the best airport rental locations. (96)</p><p>As it was litigating cases, the FTC sought to build a stronger empirical foundation for analyzing the performance of individual sectors. The FTC's leading initiative, the line-of-business program, used the agency's information-gathering powers to issue questionnaires to individual firms. (97) The program had a number of possible applications, but one of its main purposes was to identify connections between economic concentration, profitability, and other measures of economic performance. (98) Industry strongly contested the line-of-business program and litigation ensued. (99) After several years of litigation, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit sustained the FTC's program. (100)</p><p>2. Horizontal Conduct</p><p>The FTC initiated several distinctive matters concerning agreements involving competitors or having significant horizontal effects. Most notably, the FTC challenged the American Medical Association, the largest U.S. professional physicians association, for its advertising restrictions. (101) The FTC also prosecuted a shopping mall development (Tysons Corner) for agreeing with its anchor tenant not to allow competing enterprises to locate stores in the development. (102)</p><p>The FTC also brought a pathbreaking matter involving the adoption of facilitating practices by rivals: the FTC challenged the leading U.S. softwood plywood producers (Boise Cascade, Georgia Pacific, and Weyerhaeuser) for the parallel, noncollusive adoption of base-point pricing. (103)</p><p>3. Distribution Practices</p><p>The FTC acted upon the ABA report's recommendations by expanding its program to address vertical contractual restraints. A flagship for this initiative was the prosecution of the leading U.S. soft drink companies (Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Seven-Up, and Crush) for giving their bottlers exclusive territories. (104) The challenged behavior had been a standard distribution practice in the sector for decades. (105) The FTC also brought a comparable matter against a leading participant in the brewing sector (Coors). (106) The FTC demonstrated its commitment to police resale price maintenance (RPM) more aggressively by challenging a minimum RPM agreement imposed by the leading U.S. blue jeans manufacturer (Levi Strauss). (107)</p><p>The FTC also investigated major U.S. aerospace companies (Boeing, Lockheed, and McDonnell Douglas) that had used commercial bribery to accomplish sales overseas. (108) The investigation yielded a consent decree in 1978. (109)</p><p>4. Notable Qualitative Features</p><p>This incomplete list is notable for several reasons beyond an accounting of the number and types of cases. A number of cases (Official Airline Guides, (110) Kellogg Co., (111) Exxon Corp., (112) Boise Cascade Corp., (113) and Xerox Corp. (114)) were premised substantially or wholly upon the capacity of Section 5 of the FTC Act to reach beyond existing interpretations of the other antitrust laws. FTC complaints involving dominant firm misconduct or collective dominance stated a theory of harm--the maintenance of a noncompetitive market power--that had no counterpart in existing jurisprudence under the Sherman Act. (115) All of these matters could be considered to be experimental, prototype cases that sought to extend the reach of competition law. (116)</p><p>Another important aspect of the FTC's program in this period was the agency's emphasis on structural remedies as a means to reduce economic concentration. Four cases (Kellogg, Exxon, Borden, and Xerox) sought structural relief in the form of divestitures or compulsory trademark licensing, or both. In the cereal case, the FTC sought to break each of the respondents into multiple firms, and to mandate extensive royalty-free licensing of their trademarks. (117) The relief requested in the petroleum shared monopoly case comprised a mix of horizontal and vertical divestitures. (118) Compulsory licensing of intellectual property anchored the request for relief in the Borden (119) and Xerox (120) cases.</p><p>Finally, it is impressive to note the economic significance of the commercial interests that the FTC prosecuted in its competition program. The list of defendants is a roster of some of the most significant firms in the U.S. economy of the 1970s: petroleum (Exxon, Mobil, Chevron, Amoco, Gulf, Atlantic Richfield, Shell, Texaco); (121) food (Borden, Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Crush, Seven-Up, IT&amp;T, General Foods, Kellogg, General Mills, Sunkist); (122) the medical profession (American Medical Association); (123) apparel (Levi Strauss); (124) lumber products (Boise Cascade, Weyerhaeuser); (125) automobile manufacturing (General Motors); (126) aerospace (Boeing, Lockheed, and McDonnell Douglas); (127) photocopiers (Xerox); (128) and transportation services (Hertz, Avis, and National). (129) The agency's nonlitigation programs during this period also attracted the attention of major business enterprises. (130) As discussed earlier, the line-of-business program affected many leading U.S. companies, which vigorously attacked the FTC for this data collection initiative. (131)</p><p>C. The Consumer Protection Agenda</p><p>As noted above, this Article deals mainly with the FTC's 1970s competition policy programs. To understand the magnitude of the FTC's redirection in this decade, it is important to note the extent of the agency's efforts to transform its consumer protection program in this period leading up to the Pertschuk chairmanship. Several highlights stand out. In the early 1970s, the FTC established its advertising substantiation program, which required firms to support factual claims made in advertising. (132) Established through litigation and policy guidance, (133) the advertising substantiation program transformed commercial advertising regulation in the United States. (134) It is the essential foundation of federal advertising regulation today. (135)</p><p>Perhaps more notable was the FTC's expanded recourse to rulemaking to achieve consumer protection and, sometimes, competition policy aims. This approach accelerated in the mid-1970s when Congress adopted the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, which expanded the FTC's rulemaking authority. (136) The list in Table 1 below is a partial list of the FTC rulemaking matters completed between 1969 and 1976:</p><p>Table 2 provides a partial list of rulemaking proceedings pending at the time Michael Pertschuk's chairmanship began in 1977:</p><p>The pending rules presented above implicated a broad swath of U.S. commerce. Some of the affected firms were large enterprises that operated throughout the United States. (161) Others were small businesses which, collectively, had a presence in many communities across the country. (162)</p><p>D. The Administrative and Human Resources Infrastructure</p><p>From 1969 to 1976, the FTC responded to the ABA and Nader reports by upgrading its processes for policy planning, setting priorities, and selecting projects. (163) The Commission undertook major efforts to improve its human capital in management and case-handling positions. (164)</p><p>II. Two SPEECHES</p><p>Michael Pertschuk became the FTC's Chairman in April 1977. (165) Appointed by President Jimmy Carter, Pertschuk served on the Commission from 1977 to 1984, (166) and chaired the agency from 1977 to 1981. (167) In the 1960s and 1970s, as one of the most powerful staffers in the U.S. Congress, Pertschuk played a pivotal role in drafting new consumer protection legislation. (168) He had a sure grasp of the FTC's work in consumer protection, so he devoted considerable time early in his chairmanship to studying the FTC's competition mission. (169) Pertschuk spent several months with his staff and external experts assessing the state of the agency's antitrust programs. (170)</p><p>After months in which he said little about his intentions for antitrust, Pertschuk rolled out his program in two speeches late in 1977. He presented the first in Boston on November 18 before what was then one of the most prominent gatherings of competition law specialists, the New England Antitrust Conference. (171) He gave the second speech in Atlanta in December at the annual meeting of the Association of American Law Schools. (172) Together, the two talks staked out a decidedly ambitious program for the agency.</p><p>A. Boston: \"Competition Policy in Its Broadest Sense\"</p><p>Pertschuk titled his address before the New England Antitrust Conference \"New Directions for the FTC.\" (173) He called the talk \"a first public effort to set forth my own evolving competition philosophy.\" (174) Pertschuk's assessment of the state of U.S. antitrust policy was generally gloomy. \"I have seen and learned a good deal since joining the Commission,\" he began, \"I have become increasingly convinced that current antitrust policies lack clarity and conviction.\" (175) Describing antitrust enforcement as one instrument of a broader domain of \"competition policy,\" (176) Pertschuk found its modern application to be seriously deficient:</p><p>[T]here is a widespread perception that antitrust has failed to deal significantly with significant problems. In the clear, cold light, there appears [to be] a failure of philosophy, a failure of resources, and, most important, a failure of political courage, of will. There is a sense abroad that federal antitrust cases have not focused with enough frequency or intensity on the most important questions. (177)</p><p>Even when the federal agencies had addressed \"central questions\" such as \"cases which would restructure dominant firms or entire industries,\" the efforts often yielded \"protracted proceedings and ineffective remedies instead of real reform.\" (178)</p><p>Several failings in agency perspective and practice accounted for the inadequate performance. The most basic failing was a cramped view of their responsibilities:</p><p>The antitrust enforcement agencies have often been lacking in historical perspective and imagination. Tending to think only like litigators or to restrict themselves to a narrow allocative efficiency approach to economics, they have failed to provide leadership in their most important and fundamental area of responsibility: taking the broad view and attempting through enforcement initiatives and the power of information to bring the structure and behavior of major industries and, indeed, of the economy itself more into line with the nation's democratic political and social ideals. (179)</p><p>In antitrust enforcement and other applications of their competition law mandate, the federal agencies had lost sight of why Congress created them: \"Competition policy has inadequately served the American people because it has forgotten that human beings are its constituency.\" (180) The agencies too often \"have lost touch with too many aspects of the human condition[, leaving] [t]he individual... to dog-paddle as best he can in a rough sea of over-sized and often undemocratic organizations--big government, big business, big labor.\" (181)</p><p>In his inadequacy narrative, Pertschuk chiefly villainized the U.S. antitrust system's growing emphasis on economic analysis, especially ideas generated by the Chicago School:</p><p>The heart of the present dilemma is a misunderstanding of the social and political underpinnings of competition policy in the United States, most vividly demonstrated by the role economic analysis is accorded in policy decision-making and enforcement activity today. Antitrust has been preoccupied with, if not entirely overtaken by, the narrow economic objective of allocative efficiency. The impact of the Chicago School has certainly been felt in the law schools, at the Commission, and in the Courts. (182)</p><p>To Pertschuk, this direction of travel was ill conceived: \"[C]ompetition policy, as I picture it, incorporates far more than the scientific search for efficiency.\" (183)</p><p>1. The Cures</p><p>Pertschuk called for a competition policy rethink, starting with a reformulation of its aims. He saw \"a critical need to re-examine the purposes of competition policy and to arrive at a new consensus as to what [the FTC is] about.\" (184) He expected this reexamination to produce an expanded vision of competition policy: \"I believe we have a mandate to develop competition policy in its broadest sense.\" (185) As he explained, \"broadest sense\" encompassed a wide array of concerns:</p><p>[A]lthough efficiency considerations are important, they alone should not dictate competition policy. Competition policy must sometimes choose between greater efficiency, which may carry with it the promise of lower prices, and other social objectives, such as the dispersal of power, which may result in marginally higher prices. In 1977, no responsive competition policy can neglect the social and environmental harms produced as unwelcome by-products of the marketplace: resource depletion, energy waste, environmental contamination, worker alienation, the psychological and social consequences of marketing-stimulated demands. Economic analysis can clarify the terms of the trade-off between efficiency and other objectives to ensure that the least inefficient remedy consistent with other policy objectives is found. But economic analysis alone cannot dictate the final outcome. (186)</p><p>In other passages, Pertschuk elaborated his vision of what constituted competition policy \"in its broadest sense.\" He said \"competition policy can help assure that the worker has a choice of employers to deal with and a work place of human scale.\" (187) He warned that \"[i]ncreasing macroconcentration can turn this country into a series of very big and very frightening company towns.\" (188) Instead, the country's \"economic structure should be consistent with the democratic political and social norms of the nation.\" (189) Moreover, the country's economic structure \"must operate within a framework of fairness and ethical commercial conduct\" (190)--an objective embodied in the FTC's mandate to arrest \"unfair methods of competition,\" which Pertschuk said \"clearly subsumes concepts of both equity and efficiency.\" (191)</p><p>To implement competition policy \"in its broadest sense,\" (192) Pertschuk enumerated a number of specific steps he expected the FTC to consider and, in many instances, to carry out. One element would be forward-looking applications of Section 5 of the FTC Act to address \"the future structure, conduct and performance of industry.\" (193) The application of Section 5 \"require [d] boldness on the part of the decision-makers\" and \"bold action based upon reasoned prediction.\" (194) Pertschuk noted that this dimension of the FTC's mandate \"ha[d] been largely dormant since 1914,\" but its revival would be \"central to the implementation of an effective competition policy in the last quarter of this century.\" (195) He added that the FTC was \"contemplating a number of test cases [it] would like to bring, when the appropriate facts are presented, to resolve the breadth of Section 5 so that Congress will have a clearer picture of the scope of existing competition legislation and the possible need for statutory revisions.\" (196)</p><p>Pertschuk highlighted other possibilities beyond a renewed application of Section 5, such as fulfilling a promise, delivered during his Senate confirmation hearings, to have the FTC conduct \"a large scale investigation of the impact of macroconcentration on our lives.\" (197) He explained: \"I want to stress that the realm of competition policy includes problems of macroconcentration as well as microconcentration. This would seem to be a truism, but because of the blinders that antitrust has been wearing, it may lead to new directions for the Commission.\" (198) Pertschuk also anticipated \"a step-up in merger activities\" and efforts \"to refine the concept of actual potential competition and to try to win its acceptance either through the courts or, if necessary, by legislation.\" (199) Pertschuk also said he expected the FTC to explore the use of rulemaking to make competition policy, to expand the agency's advocacy program involving regulated industries and government curbs on competition, to focus more intensely on the design of effective remedies, and to make fuller use of the FTC's information-gathering and reporting parties. (200)</p><p>Pertschuk closed his address by praising his immediate predecessor, Calvin Collier, whom he thanked for \"[h]is efforts at modernizing the management of the Commission and his constant, probing demand for quality.\" (201) One might question the depth of Pertschuk's gratitude to Collier and other agency leaders who had shaped the FTC's program following the FTC's near-death experience in 1969. (202) The testimonial to Collier appeared on the final page of the speech's twenty-page text. (203) Many of the previous nineteen pages had documented the failures of federal antitrust policy. (204) Among other criticisms, Pertschuk recited a lack of boldness, a failure of political will, a lack of vision, blindness to the true aims of competition policy, and the incapacity to grasp the full potential inherent in the FTC's mandate (205)--not exactly a glowing tribute to Collier. In Boston, Pertschuk positioned himself to change all of those failings, and place the FTC on a fundamentally different path. (206)</p><p>B. Atlanta: \"The Unchartered Territory of Competition Law\"</p><p>In late December, Pertschuk came to the annual meeting of the Association of American Law Schools (AALS), and spoke at a session arranged by the organization's Section on Antitrust and Economic Regulation. (207) He started with a rueful jibe at the symbiotic relationship that linked the FTC to a parasite economy of external groups that profited from its presence:</p><p>[T]he FTC has brought Christmas cheer to many a prosperous household: the Chevy Chase homes of the FTC bar, who enjoy secure and gainful employment through generations of trial; the deregulators, that hardy group which simultaneously reviles and praises the FTC; the newsletter writers who proliferate and prosper; woodsmen and papermakers, court reporters, printers, and archivists. (208)</p><p>He promised that under his leadership the FTC would strive to ensure \"that the consumer and the citizen benefitted at least equally as richly\" from the FTC's labors as its external constituencies. (209) In doing so, the agency would be \"somewhat more bold, innovative and risk-taking.\" (210) There was no mistaking the intended direction of the agency's competition programs: \"[W]e are determined to venture in the unchartered territory of the law of competition.\" (211)</p><p>Pertschuk then summarized \"the working principles of competition policy\" he had set out a month earlier in Boston. (212) He largely paraphrased his \"working principles of competition policy\" from the earlier text, (213) but he also sharpened some of his previous remarks. For example, he warned that \"[a] failure of competition policy to come to terms with the effects of very large institutions on the quality of life can have repercussions that are far more threatening to our society than some marginal losses of efficiency.\" (214)</p><p>With this preamble in hand, Pertschuk turned to the chief purpose of his talk to the law professors: to discuss how an expanded application of Section 5 would enable the FTC to fulfill the destiny he had described in Boston--\"to develop competition policy in its broadest sense.\" (215) Pertschuk said, \"[W]e are convinced that the FTC Act, interpreted unflinchingly and with imagination, affords us the basic instrument for effectuating a far-reaching competition policy.\" (216) He recited a traditional taxonomy of concepts that courts had determined to be prohibited as \"unfair method[s] of competition.\" (217) He identified four categories: conduct that (1) transgressed \"the letter of either the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act[,]\" (2) \"threatene[d] an incipient violation of these antitrust statutes, (3) \"violate [d] the underlying spirit of the other antitrust laws, or (4) \"violate [d] public policy\" as articulated in statutes and other legal commands outside the antitrust laws. (218)</p><p>Pertschuk's framing of the FTC's authority accurately reflected and cited the legislative history and jurisprudence. This part of his talk was unremarkable. The provocative element appeared in his elaboration of what behavior the FTC might deem to be contrary to public policy and worthy of condemnation under Section 5. (219) He correctly noted that the Supreme Court's recent decision in FTC u. Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. (S&amp;H) (220) appeared to have given the FTC considerable discretion to discern when conduct violated public policy even though the behavior at issue violated neither the letter nor the spirit of the antitrust laws. (221) Pertschuk said the FTC would continue to make use of the S&amp;H precedent, \"as it illustrates the elastic nature of the concept of 'unfairness' which Section 5 embodies.\" (222) In the following passage, Pertschuk discussed the potential breadth of the power this elasticity gave the Commission:</p><p>What are the sources of public policy from which Section 5 can draw? Certainly, we can include those policies declared by statute.... We can also include policies established by the generally recognized business ethics of the community.... The implications are interesting, though I won't dwell on them. Can the FTC enjoin businessmen from employing illegal aliens? Could we enjoin a company from cheating on its taxes to gain a competitive advantage? Could we obtain an order requiring that an environmentalist be placed on the board of a company that repeatedly violates the pollution control laws? I leave you to ponder these and related possibilities. (223)</p><p>In these comments, Pertschuk may have been thinking out loud in an academic style before an audience of academics about one dimension of competition policy rather than announcing well-formulated intentions about the enforcement of Section 5. (224) Perhaps Pertschuk meant only to speculate about the logical limits of the public policy component of unfairness. Might Section 5 enable the FTC to punish firms that gained a competitive advantage by avoiding costs through their noncompliance with other legal commands? Noncompliance could provide a major cost advantage; a broad range of conduct that infringed legal rules outside the antitrust laws--for example, failing to satisfy air pollution abatement mandates, (225) ignoring workplace health and safety standards, (226) employing illegal aliens and shortchanging their wages, (227) or evading taxes (228)--could confer a significant cost advantage on their wrongdoer. At a high conceptual level, do such illicitly attained cost advantages not distort the competitive process? (229) If so, are they not unfair methods of competition?</p><p>Maybe Pertschuk's aim was only to provoke an active discussion among academics on a winter's day in Atlanta. Yet, to pose the questions as he did, even in the form of a \"what if hypothetical before an audience fond of such thought exercises, had foreseeable consequences beyond the AALS annual meeting. Pertschuk's remarks about the potential reach of Section 5 soon appeared in the antitrust trade press. (230) As Pertschuk's opening comments indicated, there is an attentive audience of external observers (such as practitioners, business officials, journalists, advocacy groups) who scour each word uttered by senior FTC officials for clues, genuine and spurious, of intentions to be analyzed and reported. (231)</p><p>To the audience of FTC kremlinologists, Pertschuk's comments suggested, however faintly, that the FTC could become, and might want to become, the nation's omnibus regulator. An agency determined to develop \"competition policy in its broadest sense\" (232) and \"venture in the uncharted territory of the law of competition\" (233) might aspire to use Section 5 to backstop the ineffective or halfhearted efforts of other public bodies entrusted with primary responsibility to enforce the law. (234) If other regulatory agencies or law enforcement bodies could not or would not do their jobs, Section 5 could provide a universal safety net. (235) The application of Section 5's public policy component would enable the FTC to secure compliance with nonantitrust laws, subject only to the constraints imposed by the agency's budget ceiling. (236) Were there any laws that affected the operation of business enterprises that would not be fair game for FTC intervention?</p><p>The brief rumination about the FTC as a super-regulator overshadowed specific proposals that were serious and not mere speculation. In one passage, Pertschuk said the FTC was considering whether Section 5 could arrest \"conglomerate mergers whose effects tend to increase macrocentration, but which have no identifiable anticompetitive effect in any one product and geographic market[.]\" (237) He added that the agency was exploring the possibility of devising a competition trade regulation rule to create a presumption against conglomerate mergers of a certain size. (238) In another comment, Pertschuk said, \"Section 5 may prove even more effective than the Sherman Act in reaching actions by oligopolists who operate so interdependently that the distinction between monopoly and oligopoly is a chimera.\" (239) The Commission might consider whether \"certain acts of price signaling are incipient forms of collusion\" and whether Section 5 would allow the agency to challenge incipient threats to competition posed by nondominant firms, without having to demonstrate a \"dangerous probability of success.\" (240)</p><p>III. THE PERTSCHUK PROGRAM</p><p>In a number of ways, the Pertschuk FTC sought to deliver on the promise of the Boston speech and use Section 5 to stretch the frontiers of enforcement. During Pertschuk's chairmanship of the FTC, the agency initiated the following competition litigation matters:</p><p>1. A Section 5 test case challenging the parallel, noncollusive adoption of a facilitating practice in the tetraethyl lead industry (Ethyl). (241) 2. A Section 5 test case challenging plant expansion announcements as improper strategic entry deterrence (Du Pont/Titanium Dioxide). (242) 3. A test case (Russell Stover) that sought to overturn the safe harbor created in United States v. Colgate &amp; Co. (243) for firms that announced a policy of not dealing with discounters and terminating retailers that did not abide by the policy. (244) 4. Cases that challenged potential competition mergers. (245) 5. Cases that reinforced the FTC's authority to police restrictive practices in the learned professions. (246)</p><p>Beyond these measures, the Commission studied litigation possibilities that the agency ultimately did not pursue. It conducted preliminary investigations of firms that might be suitable candidates for a no-fault monopolization test case brought under Section 5 of the FTC Act. (247) In articles, speeches, and testimony, the Commission supported antitrust legislative reforms to recognize a no-fault cause of action. (248)</p><p>A key landmark of the Pertschuk era was the development of the administrative and policy framework for implementing merger review responsibilities imposed by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR). (249) Congress designed the HSR to give the government an opportunity to review certain mergers before they were consummated. (250) The statute required firms undertaking mergers above a certain size to notify the federal antitrust agencies in advance. (251) HSR established an initial waiting period in which the agencies could decide whether to request additional information from the merging parties; if the agencies sought more information (a step known today as a \"second request\"), the parties were obliged to provide it, and, upon completing the submission, to give the reviewing agency additional time to consider whether to challenge the transaction. (252) During the initial waiting period, the second request production, and the final waiting period, the parties were barred from consummating the transaction. (253)</p><p>The HSR statute gave the FTC responsibility for administering the merger notification regime on behalf of both federal antitrust agencies (254)--a major administrative undertaking. The FTC drafted the implementing rules and established the operational infrastructure--including a premerger notification office and the development of internal procedures for reviewing information submitted by the parties--to execute the system. (255) Once the system went live late in 1978, the FTC (and the DOJ) began the difficult task of deciding what information to collect and, in challenging specific transactions, when to engage with the federal courts to determine which standards should be applied in determining when challenged transactions should be enjoined. (256) None of these tasks--drafting rules, devising procedures, and litigating the cases--was easy.</p><p>In his Boston speech, Pertschuk said the FTC would attempt to use rulemaking to develop substantive competition policy standards. (257) The FTC considered a variety of possibilities, but promulgated no competition policy rules other than the measures required to implement the HSR statute. (258) The Commission issued an initial proposal to regulate standards and certification processes, (259) and it gave consideration to measures to control certain conglomerate transactions, to prohibit physician organizations from controlling Blue Shield medical plans, and to bar integrated oil companies from owning crude oil or petroleum products pipelines. (260) The FTC ultimately adopted none of these measures. (261) The agency's staff testified before Congress regarding legislation to amend the Clayton Act to establish limits on conglomerate transactions and recommended enactment of a \"cap and spin-off measure that would allow large firms to make acquisitions so long as they divested an equivalent amount of assets. (262)</p><p>Under Pertschuk's guidance, the FTC expanded its infrastructure devoted to policy analysis, planning, and implementation. Among other steps, the agency formed two new units in the Bureau of Competition (the Office of Special Projects and the Planning Office), (263) and created a consumer protection unit within the Bureau of Economics. (264) These and other FTC units undertook a wide range of policy research and development projects to improve the foundations for FTC policymaking. Key initiatives included:</p><p>1. Hearings and the publication of a report on the social effects of firm size and market structure; (265) 2. Hearings and the publication of proceedings on the effects of concentration in the media; (266) 3. A conference and published papers and proceedings on modern theories of predation; (267) 4. Publication of staff papers setting out new theories of harm involving raising rivals' costs and facilitating practices; (268) 5. Publication of staff papers on the origins and meaning of the FTC's mandate and on the history of its enforcement programs; 6. A symposium and publication of proceedings on the history of competition policy in the United States; (270) and 7. Evaluations of the economic effects of previous law enforcement matters. (271)</p><p>As described more fully below, few of the agency's innovative litigation initiatives succeeded in the face of what proved to be significant judicial resistance. (272) Nor did the FTC's legislative reforms become law. (273) As the 1970s came to a close, the FTC's competition and consumer protection programs had created powerful political backlash that threatened key elements of the FTC's authority. (274)</p><p>IV. A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT</p><p>Michael Pertschuk's Boston and Atlanta speeches laid the groundwork for a number of changes that fostered lasting improvements at the FTC. (275) The most notable enduring accomplishments involved enhancements of institutional capacity: the initiation of what became a continuing program of impact evaluations of completed matters, (276) the creation of the HSR merger review system, (277) the development of the agency's role as a convenor of programs and a sponsor of research involving emerging topics of law and policy, (278) and the raising of awareness of history as a tool for improving agency decision making. (279)</p><p>The Pertschuk litigation program also yielded some important successes. A notable example is FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, which commanded sustained support from FTC leadership into the 1980s and generated a favorable Supreme Court decision on the application of the rule of reason. (280) Most FTC cases initiated in the 1970s by Pertschuk and his predecessors to extend the frontiers of antitrust enforcement failed. (281) The philosophy of expansionism that guided FTC competition and consumer protection programs from the late 1960s through the Pertschuk era--do more, push the frontiers, be bold (282)--elicited a hostile reaction from Congress. (283) A legislative conflagration beset the agency from 1979 to 1982; with a few relatively minor exceptions, the FTC successfully defended most of its jurisdiction, but the near-death experience left lasting scars. (284)</p><p>Why did the FTC enjoy relatively little success in building a program of law enforcement and rulemaking grounded in an understanding of \"competition policy in its broadest sense\"? (285) Why did so many of the agency's proposed consumer protection rules run aground? One popular narrative portrays the FTC of the 1970s, and the Pertschuk era in particular, as simply a product of irrationality, a period in which the FTC plunged into the abyss because it became what one legislator called \"a rogue agency gone insane.\" (286) This narrative typically depicts Pertshuck as the villain and berates him. (287)</p><p>For three reasons, the Pertschuk-centric irrationality narrative is seriously mistaken. First, many failed projects that ultimately inflicted woe on the FTC took shape before Pertschuk became the FTC's chairman. (288) If the FTC came to grief because it abandoned a necessary sense of caution or realism in applying its broad powers, Pertschuk's predecessors (especially Caspar Weinberger, Miles Kirkpatrick, and Lewis Engman (289)) deserve a generous share of blame for the result. (290) At most, Pertschuk added fuel to a conflagration ignited well before he became the agency's chair; if Pertschuk was irrational--for example, in seeking to press the exercise of the FTC's powers to the limits and aggressively attack problems of industrial concentration--he had lots of respectable company. (291)</p><p>Second, portraying the FTC of the Pertschuk era (and the 1970s, more generally) as an unrelieved calamity overlooks the many good things that Pertschuk and the Commission did in this period. As noted in the introduction to this Part, various FTC substantive programs and processes established in the 1970s and during the Pertschuk chairmanship have improved the quality of competition and consumer protection policy. (292) The paint-it-black interpretation ignores valuable FTC accomplishments in the 1970s, and diminishes our understanding of how good programs and practices originate.</p><p>Third, and most relevant to this Article, the irrationality narrative that casts Pertschuk as the demented head of a \"rogue agency gone insane\" (293) takes an easy way out of the problem of why regulatory agencies and other organizations fail. The irrationality narrative excoriates a scapegoat (here, Pertschuk) for problems substantially attributable to flaws in culture, design, and operations of institutions. (294) This blame-casting approach ignores major institutional factors that deserve more attention in explaining the behavior of the FTC and other regulatory bodies. The popular ritual of individual condemnation hides institutional weaknesses that have contributed to policy failures at the FTC. (295)</p><p>The discussion below considers the performance of the FTC in the 1970s and the Pertschuk era by identifying institutional weaknesses that contributed to its mixed record of success in executing its substantive programs and exposed the agency to destructive political backlash in the late 1970s and early 1980s. As the discussion indicates, Pertschuk made his own share of improvident decisions. Yet the decision making lapses were not his alone. Some miscalculations--for example, the failure to achieve a suitable match between the agency's commitments and its capabilities--were evident in the choices made by Pertschuk's predecessors. (296) Deeper institutional explanations account for a number of difficulties that commentators tend to lay at Pertschuk's feet. The aim here is to illuminate avoidable errors rooted in how institutions make decisions.</p><p>A. Poor Historical Awareness</p><p>In his tenure as FTC Chairman, Pertschuk spoke perceptively about using history to improve agency decisionmaking. His Boston speech mentioned the contributions of historians as potentially useful sources of insight to guide FTC policy. (297) In 1979, the FTC convened a series of seminars by leading business historians, who examined the changing and often ambivalent role of competition policy in the United States. (298) In the late 1970s and early 1980s, with Pertschuk's encouragement, FTC staff members performed extensive research projects, and published papers on the agency's formation and the history of its efforts to carry out its mandate. (299)</p><p>The man who deeply cared for history lacked an informative historical perspective when he needed it the most--namely, in formulating his program in 1977 and in rolling out his competition and consumer initiatives in 1977-1978. As discussed in Part II.A. above, Pertschuk's Boston speech portrayed the FTC as a seriously underperforming agency. (300) Pertschuk depicted the FTC as timid and unimaginative; the FTC wanted for political will, lacked a proper understanding of its aims, and too often ducked significant matters. (301) The FTC of the Boston speech was beholden to an excessively narrow economic (Chicago School) perspective; it shirked its fuller responsibility to look beyond price effects to account for the interests of workers, to accomplish goals originating in other legal commands (for example, environmental policy), and to promote market structures compatible with the nation's democratic ideals. (302) Because it lacked fortitude and an appreciation for \"competition policy in its broadest sense,\" (303) the FTC had not explored creative ways to fulfill its destiny by using its distinctive mandate, Section 5, to proscribe unfair methods of competition. (304)</p><p>The Boston speech revealed a poor understanding of the FTC's history, both recent and more distant. Pertschuk showed no awareness of the significance of the matters that the agency had undertaken from 1969 through 1976, nor did he comprehend the magnitude of the program the Commission had in flight in the late fall of 1977. (305) Pertschuk and his advisors seem to have not mapped out the commitments, summarized in Part I above, that the FTC was already seeking to fulfill. (306) Pertschuk's call for ambition and boldness did not grasp the boldness and ambition of the agency's existing antitrust litigation portfolio. (307) In what possible sense could efforts to break up the leading petroleum refiners (308) and the largest breakfast cereal producers (309) be deemed substantively unimaginative, risk-avoiding, or lacking political courage? Or running three predatory pricing cases at one time against major enterprises? (310) Or dismantling the distribution system relied upon by soft drink producers for much of the twentieth century? (311) Or attacking the longstanding advertising codes of the nation's largest medical professional association? (312)</p><p>The Boston and Atlanta speeches were no less historically obtuse in discussing the expanded application of Section 5 of the FTC Act. (313) In spelling out what he meant to do with Section 5, Pertschuk made little mention of what the agency already was doing, and how far it was reaching in prosecuting highly experimental theories of infringement. (314) The FTC had already concluded one expansive, pathbreaking application of Section 5 in settling its monopolization case against Xerox. (315) In late 1977, the agency was running four major matters--the Exxon and Kellogg shared monopolization cases, the Boise Cascade facilitating practices case, and the Official Airline Guides refusal to deal case--that were premised substantially or entirely on Section 5. (316) The Boston and Atlanta speeches give no hint that Pertschuk or his staff--in the months of reflection and preparation that led up to his presentations--understood the doctrinal and economic stakes of these cases. (317)</p><p>The lack of short-term historical awareness in the Boston and Atlanta speeches is bewildering and distressing. How could the new chairman and his staff underestimate the significance (and difficulty) of the existing portfolio, and why did they not assess this program in the context of the FTC's history going back to 1914? I offer two answers to this perplexing question. First, the prevailing sentiment, inspired by the Nader and ABA studies in 1969, (318) that the FTC had to do greater things to justify its existence, caused Pertschuk and his advisors to discount the significance of cases already underway. The second explanation points to an institutional weakness. There should have been a mechanism in the FTC to assess current developments in their larger historical context. This mechanism would have made Pertschuk and his advisors aware that, from its first decade onward, the FTC's efforts to undertake bold and imaginative applications of its competition or consumer protection powers confronted two, often-crippling obstacles: They involved massive implementation challenges that put a premium on recruiting and retaining capable staff, and they tended to arouse congressional opposition and, in some instances, spurred Congress to intervene destructively in the agency's affairs. (319)</p><p>One expects that a primer on the agency's history--especially about its occasionally tumultuous relations with Congress--would have caught Pertschuk's attention. In his Atlanta speech, Pertschuk spoke approvingly of a 1940s FTC litigation program instituted to challenge the adoption of basing point pricing systems as a violation of Section 5. (320) Pertschuk did not mention that the FTC's litigation success in this endeavor provoked a harsh congressional backlash. (321) So intense was the opposition that Congress elicited promises from the FTC never again to rely on features of the recent basing point cases that endorsed the agency's effort to dispense with a finding of agreement in prosecuting such behavior under Section 5. (322) In doing so, Congress in effect forced the FTC to forswear the future application of the doctrinal end it had sought to achieve with Section 5. The basing-point pricing episode provided a sobering lesson about how political backlash can eviscerate an inventive, novel Section 5 case, and Pertschuk's team missed it.</p><p>B. Lack of Political Awareness</p><p>In 1977, awareness of the larger historical context in which the FTC's programs had evolved would not have dictated the abandonment of politically risky cases. (232) Instead, a better sense of the Commission's history would have revealed a potential hazard of using the agency's distinctive authority to pursue a \"competition policy in its broadest sense.\" (324) Such awareness would have pressed Pertschuk and his advisors to reflect more carefully on the political feedback loop that had confronted the agency since 1914. (325) FTC cases involving high economic stakes--especially matters involving the application of novel theories of liability, and the pursuit of powerful remedies--tend to attract the attention of legislators whose constituents are agency targets. (326) This reality requires the FTC to consider how many major battles it can fight at one time, and to find ways to mobilize countervailing political support for the contests it pursues. (327)</p><p>Thus, applying the agency's broad policy making powers can have strong side effects, which the agency ignores at its peril. (328) Accurately mapping the FTC's competition and consumer protection agendas as of the fall of 1977 would have revealed the full dimensions of the political risks the agency had already undertaken. (329) This exercise would also have indicated the possibilities of formulating powerful commercial coalitions that might assemble to demand intervention from Congress and the executive branch. (330) A missing ingredient in the Commission's decision making process in the 1970s was a conscious process to account for political risk--by anticipating potential political hazards of proposed and ongoing matters, and by devising counter measures.</p><p>Political awareness also requires ongoing monitoring of shifts in the political environment that could affect the FTC's fortunes. (331) Pertschuk was an astute student of the legislative process, (332) and his remarks in Boston revealed his confidence that Congress would support his plans for more aggressive competition and consumer protection programs. (333) Since the ABA and Nader reports, Congress had supported the FTC's transformation not only in demanding bold applications of the agency's authority but also in augmenting the agency's statutory powers and budget. (334) The FTC enjoyed especially strong backing in the Senate, where Pertschuk's patron (Senator Warren Magnuson) and a large cohort of Democrats and Republicans had urged the agency to explore the frontiers of its powers. (335) In the eyes of a number of powerful legislators in the first half of the 1970s, the FTC's program was merely a good start. (336)</p><p>This supportive environment began to erode in the 1976 national elections. (337) Jimmy Carter's victory for the presidency obscured major changes in the Senate, where key members of the pro-FTC coalition retired or failed to gain reelection. (338) In many instances, senators with greater skepticism about the regulatory process replaced pro-FTC senators. (339) A growing, vocal chorus of business opponents to the Commission was forming, and a more sympathetic Congress awaited the complaining commercial interests. (340)</p><p>Pertschuk's 1977 speeches did not take note of the changing political and commercial environment in which the Commission would have to carry out programs that explored \"the unchartered territory of the law of competition.\" (341) The development of his program through 1978 seemed oblivious to the political storm that had begun to descend on the FTC. (342) Key events that spelled further trouble for the FTC in 1978 included a Washington Post editorial ridiculing the FTC for assuming the role of the \"National Nanny\" in trying to adopt a rule that would limit the advertising of certain foods to children, (343) and a further conservative shift in the Senate in the fall midterm elections. (344)</p><p>In barely two years, from the fall of 1976 to the fall of 1978, the congressional mood toward the FTC had changed from supportive to disturbingly hostile. (345) Programs that began earlier in the decade in a more agreeable setting now confronted increasingly formidable opposition as they matured. (346) By 1980, before Ronald Reagan came to Washington, D.C. as President, the roof had fallen in on the FTC. On two occasions the agency closed shop for a few days because Congress allowed its funding to lapse. (347) On the day before national elections in November 1980, Vice President Walter Mondale promised at a rally in Battle Creek, Michigan (headquarters of Kellogg) that he and Jimmy Carter would seek legislation to bar the FTC from imposing structural relief in the Kellogg's cereal shared monopoly case. (348)</p><p>C. Poor Awareness of Policy Implementation Prerequisites</p><p>Running successful cases requires an agency to have strong human talent in substantive disciplines, such as law and economics; in forensic skills, such as investigation and advocacy; and in administrative teams that support the economists and lawyers. (349) The harder the cases, the better the talent must be. (350) Cases that involve large economic stakes or advance novel theories of liability place greater demands on the agency's teams than matters that concern lesser economic importance and rest upon well-established principles of law. (351) Cases that implicate large economic stakes and seek to extend the boundaries of doctrine are the hardest of the lot. (352)</p><p>When an agency strikes at the heart of large economic interests, the affected organizations assemble the best teams of lawyers and economic consultants they can find to defend themselves successfully. (353) For an agency to prevail in such matters, it must field a team with comparable skills. (354) Thus, a crucial question for an agency in deciding whether to launch a specific case is who will handle the matter. (355) In answering this question, that agency cannot make the blithe assumption that its best team can handle all of its difficult matters. (356) Agencies vary considerably in the breadth and depth of their talent, but no agency has a limitless number of first-rate case-handling teams. (357) If an agency is to operate effectively, it must strive to ensure that the commitments entailed by its initiation of cases matches its capability to deliver. (358) An agency's commitments can outrun its capability by some margin; this can be an inevitable step in stretching and improving an agency's skills. (359) An agency that tries to run at 200 percent of its capacity will break down. (360)</p><p>As recounted above, the dramatic upgrade of the FTC's programs contemplated in the ABA and Nader reports--bigger defendants, larger economic stakes, ambitious applications of doctrine--required a sweeping overhaul of its personnel. (361) The agency could only take on a bolder agenda if it could recruit the managers and staff with the skills to run those projects effectively. (362) The demand for instant results meant that the agency could not wait until every piece was in place before it embarked on the new agenda. (363) If the FTC rolled out its program too quickly, however, it faced a genuine risk of being crushed by the formidable opposition that its bold, economically significant cases would arouse. (364)</p><p>By early 1977, the FTC had achieved a poor match between its commitments and capabilities. For example, the showcase shared monopoly cases (365) were in trouble from the outset, as the defendants' strong legal teams ensnared the agency in the litigation-equivalent of trench-by-trench warfare. (366) A careful look at the roster of competition and consumer protection matters pending in early 1977, as presented in Part I.B above, and reflection on the sophistication, experience, and sheer size of the advisors retained by the affected firms should have inspired the FTC to ask itself how it could land its pending matters successfully. (367) Such an assessment might have inspired still deeper thinking later in the year about how the agency would undertake a newer, bolder, more far-reaching agenda in the Pertschuk era.</p><p>Pertschuk and his leadership team were not indifferent to implementation issues. They pressed onward with efforts to upgrade the agency's talent and to invest in building the knowledge base that would support new FTC programs. (368) The agency also tried to simplify the prosecution of new matters in light of knowledge gained from previous experiences with case management. (369) As noted above, by the end of the 1970s the agency was taking steps to understand why its fortunes, and the role of competition policy, had risen and fallen at different times in the FTC's history. (370)</p><p>Despite these admirable initiatives, the FTC in the 1970s and during the Pertschuk chairmanship systematically underestimated the implementation issues and problems associated with major extensions of the FTC's programs. (371) Perhaps the single principal lapse was the failure to develop a system, from 1969 onward, that tested each new project proposal on its own terms and in the context of the agency's entire portfolio (372): What did the agency expect to gain? What were the risks of failure? Who would do the proposed project? How long would it take? What would it cost? How did the project affect the risk and difficulty of the entire portfolio? (373)</p><p>One has to ask why the FTC did not give implementation issues more emphasis in deciding whether to initiate new litigation or rulemaking matters in the 1970s. One factor may have been the acute pressure the FTC felt to be seen as making massive, immediate progress toward the realization of the performance standard (set out most clearly in the ABA Report) that had to be satisfied to justify the agency's continued existence. (374) The ABA and Nader Reports portrayed the FTC as a badly failed regulatory authority, beset by dull-witted leadership, shot through with weak managers and mediocre staff, oblivious to decades of criticism, and preoccupied with fishing for commercial minnows. (375) Congress echoed this grim assessment and repeated the ABA panel's admonition that this was the agency's final chance to prove its worth. (376) The agency needed to launch big initiatives--quickly and in large numbers. (377) Even as the agency sought to ramp up its program in the early 1970s, key legislators reminded the agency that the output of seemingly massive new matters was not enough. (378)</p><p>Pertschuk himself would have felt this pressure. He was a product of a legislative environment that helped set stratospheric goals for the FTC. (379) By the time he arrived at the FTC, he had become a leading figure in a public interest community that relentlessly demanded that regulators do more and undervalued what regulators actually did. (380) If an agency landed on the Moon, the public interest community immediately asked why the regulator had yet to land on Mars. This community viewed any signs of compromise or hesitation as betrayals of the public interest cause. (381) Pertschuk doubtlessly observed how key figures of the public interest community visited their wrath on others whom Jimmy Carter had appointed from its ranks to serve in key regulatory posts. (382) Long personal relationships and the demonstrated fidelity of these individuals to the public interest cause counted for nothing if the newly appointed regulators were seen to waver in any respect. (383) For this audience, spoken concerns about policy implementation and agency capability were threadbare excuses for inaction. (384) With courage and more funding, any aim was attainable. (385) Another factor is the calculus that individual leaders use to decide how much the agency should invest, respectively, in new matters (such as cases or rules) and in building institutional capability to perform such matters effectively. (386) Ideally, agency leadership strives to achieve an appropriate balance between the two. (187) On the one hand, a leader must recognize the importance of activity in performing the agency's mandate--to prosecute violations, to deter future misconduct, and to demonstrate the agency's legitimacy in the eyes of the public that provides the resources it deploys. (388) On the other hand, a leader must understand the principal mentioned earlier: successful performance of ambitious programs requires the application of skills and knowledge equal to the task. (389) Building these skills and knowledge requires investments that do not yield immediately observable results. (390) The necessary capability will not emerge unless incumbent leaders make investments that will largely benefit their successors. (391) Incumbent leaders who are mainly interested in their own future advancement may emphasize investments in new initiatives that generate immediate credit-claiming opportunities and de-emphasize investments that improve agency capability. (392)</p><p>Pertschuk struggled to achieve a good balance between \"consumption\" in the form of new cases and \"investment\" in the form of outlays that build institutional capability. (393) Despite his expressed intention to do more, his output of new matters lagged behind the pace set by his predecessors from 1969 through 1976. (394) His investment in institutional capability grew beyond prevailing levels. (395) Pertschuk's predecessors began too many ambitious matters without proper concern for effective implementation, and</p><p>Pertschuk tended to receive the blame when many of those matters collapsed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. (396)</p><p>On the whole, one can see Pertschuk being pulled by two conflicting forces. One force pressed him to expand the agency's programs aggressively; the other called for significant upgrades in capability to do the job well. As he took office, he faced a political imperative to announce a new and bolder agenda. (397) Given his professional background and his fidelity to the goals of the public interest community, (398) he would have found it impossible to say something along the following lines:</p><p>I expect to do more at the FTC and to employ a broader conception of competition policy. At the same time, I am mindful of the number and magnitude of competition and consumer protection matters the FTC already has in motion. In light of those commitments, and the difficulties we are facing in delivering on the existing agenda, I will be somewhat cautious in adding new matters to the list. (399)</p><p>Had Pertschuk said that, various legislators and members of the public interest community would have demanded his head. (400)</p><p>In practice, Pertschuk turned out to be more restrained in adding new initiatives than his Boston and Atlanta speeches foreshadowed. (401) The evident difficulties faced by the agency in delivering on existing projects, and Pertschuk's belated awareness that the political environment was turning against him, inspired him to scale down some of his earlier plans. (402) At the same time, he did not back away from making investments to enhance the agency's capability. (403) One wonders what might have happened if more of this investment had taken place early in his chairmanship--for example, the historians' seminar on the history of competition law in the United States (404) or the research on the evolution of FTC enforcement and its political implications (406)--rather than later in his term.</p><p>V. IMPLICATIONS FOR A NEW OVERHAUL OF U.S. COMPETITION POLICY</p><p>As noted in the Introduction, a number of contemporary proposals aim to make the FTC the engine for a transformation of U.S. competition policy. (406) Many of these proposals resemble the program that Michael Pertschuk set out in his Boston and Atlanta speeches. A number of similarities stand out.</p><p>First the current call for a dramatic redirection of policy is grounded in a narrative of calamitous system failure. (407) Among other lapses, the modern critique argues that U.S. competition policy since the 1970s has squandered precious resources on trivial matters (notably, the prosecution of horizontal restraints cases involving small, poorly paid service providers); (408) shied away from challenging dominant firms and industries characterized by collective dominance; (409) ignored the destructive consequences of vertical integration; (410) and tolerated mergers that increased concentration or allowed dominant incumbents to absorb smaller firms that, as independent enterprises, could emerge as major competitive forces. (411)</p><p>A major stated cause of these policy distortions has been a fundamental misconception of the proper aims of competition policy. Consumer interests, under the banner of \"consumer welfare,\" have displaced the egalitarian vision of a fairness-based competition policy that Congress embraced in adopting the Sherman, Clayton, and FTC Acts and the federal courts effectuated, especially from the late 1930s into the 1970s. (412) The cramped, single-minded focus on consumer interests is attacked for excluding consideration of the interests of workers, small and medium enterprises, income distribution effects, and the welfare of communities devastated by capricious choices made by dominant enterprises. (413) The consumer welfare fixation on price effects is scorned for ignoring how restrictive practices and sheer corporate size undermine innovation and endanger a host of other values. (414) The misshapen contemporary goals structure is assailed for being so tolerant of corporate gigantism that it undermines democracy itself. (415)</p><p>In a number of instances, the litany of competition policy failures merges with a parallel critique of modern consumer protection policy. This is another narrative of grave inadequacy, in no area more telling than the indifference to the collection and misuse of personal data collected by large information technology firms. (416)</p><p>The new critique derives strength from more frequent expressions of concern by elected officials and candidates for public office. (417) Some demand closer regulatory scrutiny of existing commercial giants; (418) others call for a program to break up these enterprises into smaller firms. (419) Proposals to accomplish these or related ends through new legislation have appeared in statements by individuals and groups within the major political parties. (420) Given the difficulties inherent in adopting legislation of this scope, one imagines that litigation would remain the policy tool of choice for the coming years.</p><p>Suppose that the advocates of the transformation sketched above get the opportunity they wish for. Political developments align to elect a President and a Congress that embraces a redirection along the lines laid out above. The President appoints and the Senate confirms agency leaders committed to a program including the following elements:</p><p>1. Abandonment of an efficiency-based consumer welfare orientation of competition policy and its replacement with a conception of \"competition policy in its broadest sense,\" encompassing the interests of citizens as consumers, workers, and community residents who desire the protections afforded by a broad range of policy commands including areas such as environmental protection, health and safety legislation; (421) 2. Primary emphasis on litigation programs to challenge individual dominant firms and tight oligopolies, with routine recourse to structural remedies to deconcentrate affected sectors, including efforts to unravel mergers that the federal agencies improvidently cleared or approved subject to inadequate remedies; (422) 3. Severe curtailment of advocacy programs that challenge occupational licensure restrictions and of current litigation efforts to cut back on the reach of the state action doctrine; (423) 4. Reform of existing horizontal restraints litigation programs to repudiate cases that (a) challenged efforts by low-wage service providers to raise their fees, (424) and (b) rejected defenses predicated on the preservation of product or service quality; (425) 5. Revision of the Department of Justice criminal anticartel program to allow smaller enterprises to present defenses based on the preservation of employment levels; (426) 6. Expanded reliance on theories that challenge vertical integration by contract or ownership; 7. Restoration of Robinson-Patman Act enforcement as a core element of federal antitrust policy; (427) 8. Strict opposition to mergers whose concentrative effect exceeds levels set by the U.S. Department of Justice Merger Guidelines issued in 1968; (428) in merger matters, the government will adhere to the policy aims set out in the Supreme Court's decision in 1962 of Brown Shoe v. United States; (429) and 9. The routine use by the FTC of Section 5 of the FTC Act to overcome doctrinal limitations imposed by existing Sherman Act and Clayton Act jurisprudence that embraces a consumer welfare standard and unduly confines the interpretation of these statutes. (430)</p><p>The implementation of the program at the federal antitrust agencies will require the appointment of senior managers and new staff who repudiate the consumer welfare standard and embrace the multidimensional conception of the proper goals of competition law. (431) Those already employed by the enforcement agencies as managers and staff will be expected to accept the expanded goals framework or they will find their duties reduced and their roles marginalized.</p><p>New appointees to top leadership positions will not be tainted by substantial previous experience in the private sector, nor will they have spent too much time as civil servants in a government enforcement culture that assumed the primacy of consumer welfare as the aim of antitrust law. (432) The concern about compromised motives also is likely to disqualify academics who, though sympathetic to some expansion of antitrust enforcement, remain excessively beholden to some notion of a consumer (rather than citizen) welfare standard, (433) or have consulting practices that have engaged them in acting for defendants in antitrust cases. (434) The \"do-more-with-what-we-have\" proponents of some extension of enforcement will be dismissed as excessively timid or hopelessly centrist, and the somewhat proenforcement academics with too much experience representing defendants will bear much the same stigma as private practitioners in economic consultancies or law firms.</p><p>The demand for a single-minded, uncompromised vision of expansive enforcement will lead to a different pool of leadership candidates. New appointees to top leadership and senior management positions at the DOJ and the FTC will be drawn chiefly from nongovernment public interest organizations, state attorneys general antitrust units that adopted an expansive view of competition policy, and from university faculties (but not academics who consult extensively for private parties).</p><p>As noted above, the means for the redirection of competition policy will be the prosecution of large numbers of major cases. (435) In this framework, there will be no room for smaller matters. (436) Given the intensity of the modern inadequacy narrative and the expectation of sweeping reform, there will be strong demands for a high tempo of prosecutions. (437) The elected officials and advocacy groups who demand and support this transformation of competition policy will have no patience for temporizing or half-measures. (438) Those who waver from a total commitment to the agenda may face a wrath comparable to the opprobrium Ralph Nader unleashed upon former colleagues whose zeal he found wanting during the Carter administration. (439)</p><p>The experience of Michael Pertschuk's FTC chairmanship, and the experience of the FTC in the 1970s more generally, suggests what the newly transformed FTC might expect as it attempts to roll out the new policy agenda. (440) One certainty is the difficulty of policy implementation. (441) The types of cases contemplated by the program outlined above will elicit strong resistance from the affected firms, which will amass large teams of accomplished lawyers and economic advisors to assist them. (442) How long will it take the newly reoriented federal agencies to develop litigation teams to match the skills that the defendants will bring to the case--not just for one or a few cases, but the many high-stakes cases that the new program will call for? (443) The political overseers and public interest community are likely to brush aside excuses about implementation difficulties. (444) The pressures to deliver the new agenda will create serious dangers of a mismatch between commitments and capabilities--the same condition that befell the FTC in the 1970s and caused many of its flagship cases and rules to perish. (445)</p><p>The cases will be litigated before judges who are generally predisposed to accept the consumer welfare framework, either by personal preference or by a felt compulsion to abide by forty years of jurisprudence that tells them to do so. (446) A new president gradually could change the philosophy of the federal courts by appointing judges sympathetic to the aims of the proposed transformation. (447) The reorientation of the courts through judicial appointments could take a long time. (448) In the interim, the agencies will face a doctrinal status quo that does not embrace competition law in its broadest sense. (449)</p><p>A possible antidote to the rigidities of existing jurisprudence is new legislation that directs the courts to apply the desired goals framework and changes various substantive standards. Such legislation would be a major undertaking, and it would elicit strong opposition from affected firms and industries. (450) The affected business interests would mobilize all of the electoral resources available to them under the existing framework of lobbying and campaign financing. (451) Legislative relief from existing jurisprudential strictures might take years to accomplish.</p><p>The last consideration focuses attention on the likely durability and commitment of the electoral coalition that demands a redirection of competition policy and supports the overhaul of the enforcement agencies. The history of the FTC and the Pertschuk era show how political coalitions can be volatile, unpredictable, and evanescent. (452) Will the coalitions endure long enough--perhaps five to ten years--to support the agency through the entire life cycle of major litigation matters? Will the coalition of legislators who favor competition policy in its broadest sense resist the enormous political pressure that will be brought to bear--especially by firms within their own constituencies--once the full magnitude of the new program becomes apparent? (453)</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>The FTC's experience from the 1970s does not predetermine the outcome of a modern effort to reorient competition policy in a new time and a new place. The events of Michael Petschuk's chairmanship may or may not reoccur in some form. Yet these experiences point to important institutional considerations that warrant attention in contemplating a journey into difficult seas; it makes sense to learn about navigational hazards that other mariners have encountered in the past, and to study how they sought to surmount them. The FTC of the 1970s suffered greatly because it lacked effective mechanisms to maintain a good fit between program commitments and capabilities to deliver, and to anticipate political backlash that major cases and rulemaking proceedings would elicit. There was no lack of trying, but there was too little attention to \"the problem of implementation, that is, the path between the preferred solution and the actual performance of the government.\" (454) The FTC experience of the 1970s and the Pertschuk chairmanship deserve a close look if future Commission leadership attempts to build a new program to realize competition policy in its broadest sense.</p><p>WILLIAM E.

Owing to weaknesses in remedies obtained in Sherman Act monopolization cases, Adams said, \"the Government... has won many a law suit but lost many a cause.\" Id. at 31. Among other initiatives, Adams concluded that the famed Department of Justice suits against Standard Oil Co. and American Tobacco Co. in the first two decades of the twentieth century yielded feeble remedial outcomes.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforcement policy seeks to deter violations of pollution control laws by recovering, in the calculation of civil penalties, the economic benefit that violators derive from noncompliance.

Studies of gruesome industrial accidents sometimes reveal that company management deliberately violated health and safety laws. The coal dust explosion that killed twenty-nine miners in April 2010 at Massey Energy Company's Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia is a notable example. NORMAN G. PAGE ET AL., MINE SAFETY &amp; HEALTH ADMIN., REPORT OF INVESTIGATION: FATAL UNDERGROUND MINE EXPLOSION, APRIL 5, 2010 (2011), <url normalizedValue=\"https://arlweb.msha.gov/Fatals/2010/UBB/FTL10c0331.pdf\">https://arlweb.msha.gov/Fatals/2010/UBB/FTL10c0331.pdf</url> [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/ZYF8-F763\">https://perma.cc/ZYF8-F763</url>].

Some competition law systems directly seek to address competitive distortions that can arise in the implementation of a taxation program.

In early January 1978, BNA's Antitrust &amp; Trade Regulation Report carried an account of the Pertschuk's Atlanta speech and reported his comments about whether Section 5 of the FTC Act might address the scenarios (hiring illegal aliens, nonpayment of taxes, and repeated violations of environmental laws) Pertschuk had mentioned. See Pertschuk Speculates on Stretching Laws: Can Robinson-Patman Act Apply to Services?, Antitrust &amp; Trade Reg. Rep. (BNA), No. 845, at A-17 (Jan. 5, 1978).

I first joined the FTC in the fall of 1979 as an attorney in the Planning Office of the Bureau of Competition. One of my assignments was to work with a team of Planning Office attorneys to identify possible candidates for a no-fault test case that the FTC would bring under Section 5. The team prepared one memorandum that spelled out the legal foundations of a no-fault case and a second memorandum that singled out five companies as possible test case targets. My recollection is that Campbell Soup Company stood atop the list of recommended targets.</p><p>(248.) See Alfred F.

See generally supra Part III (describing the ambitious FTC competition and consumer protection programs initiated earlier in the late 1960s and in the 1970s before Pertschuk's chairmanship began). Pertschuk's predecessors used adventurist rhetoric hardly different from his own. For example, in 1970, in a letter to Senator Edward Kennedy, Weinberger said the Commission was urging its staff \"to make recommendations to us that will probe the frontiers of our statutes.\" William E. Kovacic, Congress and the Federal Trade Commission, 57 Antitrust L.J. 869, 876 n.29 (1988) (quoting Letter from Caspar W. Weinberger, Chairman, Fed. Trade Comm'n, to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Chairman, Senate Subcomm. on Admin. Practice &amp; Procedure (July 22, 1970), in Hearing on the Nomination of Miles K. Kirkpatrick to be Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission Before the S. Comm. on Commerce, 91st Cong. 133-34 (1970)). Weinberger added that the agency was making progress in \"[p]robing the outer limits\" and \"exploring the frontiers\" of its statutes. Id. In remarks published in 1971, Kirkpatrick said he and his fellow commissioners \"fully intend to be in the vanguard of exploration of the new frontiers of antitrust law.\" Id. at 876 (quoting Federal Trade Commission, '43 Grad Transforms Agency into a 'Growling Watchdog', U. PA. L. ALUMNI J., Fall 1971, at 9). Pertschuk's commitment to deconcentration echoed the views of many contemporary commentators, including distinguished academics who advocated the application of \"no-fault\" monopolization theories to restructure dominant firms. See Kovacic, supra note 58, at 1137.</p><p>(292.) See supra notes 275-80 and accompanying text.</p><p>(293.) See supra note 286 and accompanying text.</p><p>(294.) Simple explanations that attribute failure in complex organizations to the \"human error\" of specific individuals often overlook larger institutional forces that cause such systems to break down.

WOODS ET AL., BEYOND HUMAN ERROR (2d ed. 2010) (focusing on how \"human error\" can obscure system malfunctions). On the phenomenon of scapegoating individuals as a convenient alternative to addressing larger institutional deficiencies that cause organizations to fail, see Marilyn Paul, Moving from Blame to Accountability, SYS.

See generally supra Fart I.B. Pertschuk's claim that U.S. antitrust enforcement in the years leading up to 1977 lacked courage and political will also took no apparent account of the magnitude of the DOJ's litigation program involving dominant firms. At the time of the Pertschuk speeches in 1977, the DOJ was prosecuting monopolization cases against the nation's largest producer of mainframe computers (IBM), the country's principal telephone company (AT&amp;T), and its two leading manufacturers of automobile tires. See United States v. IBM Corp., [1961-1970 Transfer Binder] Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) 1 45,069 (S.D.N.Y. filed Jan. 17, 1969) (complaint alleging monopolization and attempted monopolization); United States v. AT&amp;T Co., [1970-1979 Transfer Binder] Trade Reg. Rep.

See generally supra Part I.B (describing the FTC's antitrust agenda before Pertschuk became chairman). One basis for this observation is my experience at the FTC in the late 1970s and early 1980s. From late 1979 through 1982, I was an attorney in the Planning Office of the Bureau of Competition. In preparing a history of the FTC's competition programs and its relations with Congress, see Kovacic, supra note 291, I devoted special attention to the formulation of the FTC's competition program from the late 1960s through the 1970s. I found no indication that the agency (including the Pertschuk leadership team) realized in 1977 how the agency's agenda from 1969 through 1976 was easily the most ambitious competition enforcement program in the FTC's history and, arguably, no less remarkable in its scope and aims than the DOJ antitrust program from 1905 to 1920.

This state of mind is captured in comments that Senator William Proxmire made to FTC Chairman, Lewis Engman, in a hearing convened hy the Joint Economic Committee of Congress in November 1974. Market Power, the Federal Trade Commission, and Inflation: Hearing Before the J. Econ. Comm., 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 58-59 (1974) [hereinafter FTC Hearing]. At the time of the hearing, the FTC was running its shared monopolization cases against the breakfast cereal and petroleum industries and its monopolization case against Xerox. See supra notes 308-09 and accompanying text. Powerful structural relief was the FTC's stated objective in all three matters. See supra notes 117-20 and accompanying text. Against this background, Proxmire told Engman: \"[T]he FTC, like a number of other regulator agencies seems to concern itself with minor infractions of the law, and to spend much of its time on cases of small consequence.\" FTC Hearing, supra, at 59.</p><p>(379.)

In one memorable episode, Ralph Nader accused his long-time colleague, Joan Claybrook, of betraying the cause of consumer protection in her role as a Carter Administration appointee to head the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). See Firnest Holsendolph, Nader Calls on Ex-Colleague to Resign Safety Post, N.Y.

Until her appointment to head the NTSB, Claybrook had lead Congress Watch, the main lobbying arm of the Nader organization. See id. Nader described Claybrook's tenure as \"a trail of averted or broken promises\" and accused her of \"a failure of nerve.\" Id.</p><p>(383.) Nader's attack on Claybrook is illustrative. Nader scolded her for not moving fast enough and far enough with measures to introduce requirements that automobile manufacturers install air bags in all vehicles. See id. Journalists recounted how Nader was criticizing consumer advocates who had taken positions in the Carter Administration but had failed to meet Nader's expectations. See, e.g., id. One story quoted Nader as saying \"My personal feelings about them are not at stake.... The issues are bigger than that.\" Id.</p><p>(384.) When challenged by Nader to be more aggressive, Joan Claybrook pointed out that her agency was understaffed and had \"a long way to go.\" See id. The response did not persuade Nader, who said the only appropriate response to the Secretary of Transportation's decision to delay implementation of various safety measures was Claybrook's resignation. See id.</p><p>(385.) See Kovacic, supra note 349, at 885. During the early 1970s, Congress raised the FTC's budget from $16.9 million to $47.2 million to allow the FTC to pursue a more ambitious agenda. See id. Legislators seemed to assume that greater resources could immediately be translated into highly capable teams of analysts and case handlers. This overlooked the time it takes for an agency to recruit superior personnel, train the teams, and acquire the experience needed to carry out ambitious tasks.</p><p>(386.)

Whilst I unfortunately had to miss the event, I was able to watch part of the recording over the weekend thanks to a new acquisition[1] that admittedly has provoked some laughter and jokes at the office. A good overview of the event is available here[2]. Some hopefully constructive thoughts follow: 1) The way I see it, it's a good thing for competition authorities to hold conferences on issues about which they care. These initiatives can show that authorities are willing to listen to different viewpoints. </p><p>They also publicly expose the thinking that is influencing enforcers. From this perspective (and for all their hard work), the organizers truly deserve credit. 2) The conference was meant to be about 'shaping competition policy'. The official line is that the conference showed a consensus on the need for active enforcement. If the real aim was to give an appearance of consensus to put the issue on the table for the next Commission and Parliament, then it probably was a success. 3) The conference did indeed feature multiple viewpoints, all of which nonetheless converged in advocating for stronger enforcement. The problem, however, is a certain impression that the program may have been designed with that in mind. The conference would have benefitted from a greater balance of views, even if (or precisely because) that would have shown that the consensus may not be there at present. 4) The point above is, in my personal view, particularly important in the case of a conference organized by an enforcer. This is, first, because an enforcer must not only be neutral but appear to be neutral; and second, because one learns the most from views that -right or wrong- challenge one's own ideas. From that perspective, it would seem ironic to use the conference to discuss 'neutrality obligations' and the problem of 'echo chambers'. 5) Perhaps the best illustration of what I'm saying lies in this intervention of a representative from the Open Markets Institute focused on Amazon as a Private Government (see around 11.58 h. here[3]). I cannot see the reasons that would justify giving a public enforcer's microphone (even if a not-always-functioning one ) to such extreme views.Perhaps because other stuff would seem more reasonable by comparison? On this point there seems to be a real consensus among attendees. The Commission itself must have probably instantly realized about how self-damaging that was for the event and its objectives. 6) In my view, the more-vs-less enforcement debate is pretty Manichean and not so useful. Most, if not all of us, would always support strong enforcement if the law is correctly applied to a proven set of facts. So this is not so much about policy as it is about the law. Stronger enforcement may perhaps be needed, but then the question is 'how?' Is it just about doing more cases under the current legal framework,or is it about changing or ignoring the law as refined and incrementally built over decades of experience? Do we need to change the law as applicable only to certain companies/business models/activities? [On the latter point, by the way, the State aid experts at the Commission could explain that selective regulation also constitutes State aid] 7) Unfortunately, there was not that much discussion about the law. In fact, too often in these debates the law is side-stepped or looms in the background as an uncomfortable obstacle. Unfortunately the conference only featured (3/18) jurists (plus a very good one, Heike, as moderator) and no practitioners (this I can understand) or judges. The academic panelists were surely respected figures, but also the most vocal on the anti-big-tech front (which is absolutely fine, but only represents one side). There was not much of a debate on how the current case law already addresses the issues raised. Btw, Pablo's contribution[4] to the Commission's call for ideas was precisely about that. 8) The highlight of the day was probably Jean Tirole's keynote. Many of us admire his work and consider him to be a very reasonable person. Two messages that caught my attention were (a) his comment that failing to consider the multi-sided nature of some practices leads to absurd results; and (b) the common theme that one 'should err on the side of competition policy'. From a legal standpoint, I couldn't agree more with the first message. From the same standpoint, the second message sounds my alarms, as it did when in a previous interview some months ago (available here[5]) he responded the following to the question 'so how should antitrust evolve?': 'First, we need to reconsider our burden of proof in antitrust decisions. This is a delicate matter. Consider the acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram by Facebook. They were social networks, just like Facebook. They could have become Facebook competitors. But is there any evidence for that? Not really, as this is just a guess on what the future would have looked at in the absence of acquisition. The suppression of competition in the absence of data is hard to prove. My guess is that we should err on the side of competition, while recognizing that we will make mistakes in the process'. 9) Tirole's comments have the virtue of putting the spotlight exactly where it belongs. It reveals what the debate is really about in clear terms that others are (understandably) much more reluctant to use. One can perhaps legitimately decide to 'err on the side of competition' when it comes to regulation or even merger control. We can have a debate on those areas, and this is perhaps what Mr. Tirole has in mind. But, in my view, not when it comes to antitrust (i.e. Articles 101 and 102). As repeatedly held by the Courts, this is a quasi-criminal area of law. This is not about regulation nor about seeking optimal results. It is about punishing illegal behavior with potentially very drastic consequences for the company's finances, reputation and now, seemingly, even structural integrity. And illegal wrongdoing must be established by the authority on the basis of facts, not suppositions to compensate for lack of evidence. There is probably a consensus among jurists on this point, as we are trained to identify the dangers of such logic and to protect the presumption of innocence. The rule of law is no less important than alleged optimal economic outcomes. This should not be a problem, and digital businesses should certainly not get a free pass. There may well be competition problems and anticompetitive practices in these markets, but if the alleged problems are so evident, then proving them is perhaps not so much to ask for. This is not to say that one should not be cautious or take into consideration factors such as innovation or potential competition. One can perfectly do all that within the current legal framework. What I'm saying is that there's no reason to reconsider our burden of proof[6]. 10) This is why, interestingly, the policy debate that is taking place in this regard goes in exactly the opposite direction to the legal trends visible in the case law (see most notably Cartes Bancaires and Intel which, as noted[7] by Vice-President Van der Woude, raise questions for which answers 'can be found in the burden of proof that rests upon the Commission pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation 1/2003', or see also the most recent Krka Judgment). One can only speculate about what will happen when these two opposing trends meet each other and clash (although if history tends to repeat itself, look at the 2002 annus horribilis on the merger front). Strong competition policy requires a strong, respected, neutral and confident enforcer. And the Commission can certainly be that, perhaps better than any other authority in the world. But the trick is to step up and meet its burden, not to try to relax it or do away with it. +1) Some may perhaps think that I'm writing all this because I myself am biased and work for large digital companies affected by this debate (which I do, although I also work for smaller and non-digital companies that might also be affected). But any of you who has ever attended our own events would have realized that we have always done our best to ensure a good balance of views regardless of how convenient or aligned with our own opinions (see e.g. the first panel at our last Chillin'Competition conference). That's really not it. For the reasons recently set out by Pablo[8], we genuinely care about the Commission's reputation and we believe so much in the Institution that we often subject it to the high standards that it can aspire to meet. In the long term, defending our law-based system is the best way to protect the Commission.

Amazon's minority stake in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/11/amazon-deal-deliveroo-doubt-watchdog-raises-competition-concerns/\">Deliveroo stems from a $575m (\u00a3436m)</url>deal announced in May this year, and the US e-commerce giant currently has no presence in the UK restaurant food delivery market. </p><p>A note from analyst firm Jefferies said the announcement \"smacks of 'not on my watch' interventionism.\" The CMA's aggressive move, analysts say, represents Britain's regulator getting tough on big tech deals. </p><p>\"This is a remarkable decision,\" says Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital. \"It is hugely significant if it's setting a precedent.\"</p><p>The key concerns of the CMA are focused on whether the deal could damage competition in the restaurant food and grocery delivery markets.</p><p>Andrea Gomes da Silva, executive director of the CMA, said: \"If the deal were to proceed in its current form, there's a real risk that it could leave customers, restaurants and grocers facing higher prices and lower quality services as these markets develop.\"</p><p>The move by the CMA to push Amazon comes as it makes moves under Lord Andrew Tyrie, a former Conservative MP and chair of the Treasury Select Committee, to bear down on US technology giants. </p><p>\"The bottom line is acquisitions made by big tech players are highly likely to get looked at in detail because of the nature of the acquirer,\" says Simon Pritchard, a competition lawyer at the firm Linklaters. </p><p>The UK's restaurant food delivery sector represents is worth \u00a38.1bn and is set to grow to \u00a310bn by 2020. Deliveroo, which had nearly \u00a3500m in sales in 2018, is a key player, competing with US giant Uber Eats and London listed Just Eat.</p><p>Founded in 2013 by former banker Will Shu, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/11/amazon-deal-deliveroo-doubt-watchdog-raises-competition-concerns/\">Deliveroo has emerged as one of the UK's brightest technology start-ups</url>. It has raised $1.5bn in investment and is valued at around $3.8bn. But its future, at least in part, rests on a major investment from the Seattle-based retail behemoth founded by Jeff Bezos-an investment that could be scuppered by the CMA.</p><p>Amazon has long had designs on entering expanding into food delivery. It runs Amazon Fresh, its grocery delivery arm and until November 2018 had its own restaurant delivery brand in the UK: Amazon Restaurants. But it pulled its restaurants business out of the market, and in May this year invested in Deliveroo, taking a minority stake as part of a $575m deal, having explored a full acquisition.</p><p>But in June, the CMA said it was looking into the deal-issuing an initial enforcement order.</p><p>After <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/11/amazon-deal-deliveroo-doubt-watchdog-raises-competition-concerns/\">six months</url>, the CMA announced its Phase 1 decision. Amazon's investment in Deliveroo, the CMA said, gave it material influence over the UK company, meaning they could \"cease to be distinct\" and effectively merge. Its announcement even described the investment as the \"acquisition by Amazon of Deliveroo\". It did not matter it was a minority stake. Amazon had significant expertise in logistics and influence thanks to its board member, Amazon UK head Doug Gurr.</p><p>The Phase 1 finding claims Amazon was already looking to return to food delivery in Britain, either through an investment or acquisition of another company. Such a move could have boosted competition, but instead it chose to invest in Deliveroo to strengthen its hand. It said the deal created \"serious concerns\" over competition.</p><p>The finding has baffled some analysts. \"The CMA believes, quite remarkably, that despite the fact that Amazon had exited the market in Nov-2018, ex-the investment in Deliveroo, it could well have re-entered the UK market,\" wrote Jeffries analysts Giles Thorne. </p><p>Although the CMA has taken a stern view of mergers in the food space before, taking a planned merger between Just Eat and rival Hungry House to a Phase 2 investigation in 2017, it ultimately waved that deal through.</p><p>But it is not just restaurant delivery. The CMA has also demanded remedies in grocery delivery, a sector it believes will be negatively impacted by the deal.</p><p>Online grocery orders in the UK were worth around \u00a312bn last year, according to data from Mintel. But the fast-delivery, small basket segment is growing as consumers look for greater convenience with groceries delivered within the hour.</p><p>Both Amazon and Deliveroo have made moves into the grocery delivery space, but both are at an early stage in Britain.</p><p>Amazon offers its Amazon Pantry service, for cupboard goods like snacks and drinks, and Amazon Fresh in some cities, a fresh produce service. It also offers grocery shopping with supermarket chain Morrisons for same-day delivery. </p><p>Deliveroo, meanwhile, has dipped its toe into groceries through a pilot scheme with Co-op.</p><p>The CMA claims the combination sets the pair up as the dominant force in grocery delivery. \"Supermarkets do not have the necessary logistical capabilities,\" its decision read, \"The merger would result in the combination of two of the largest and best established suppliers of online convenience groceries.\"</p><p>But its decision is likely to face kickback. \"It seems ridiculous given the size of Ocado and Tesco in grocery delivery,\" says one market source.</p><p>The move is also potentially damaging for Deliveroo's ambitious growth plans. The CMA's intervention over the summer forced it to put a halt on a large portion of its planned $575m investment, which had been led by Amazon.</p><p>The parties have five days to offer remedies to the CMA, or the investigation will drag on with a Phase 2 probe. This, according to Jefferies, would add \"another six months of uncertainty\". The analysts pointed to the fact that Deliveroo had \u00a3185m in cash at the close of 2018-and a cash burn of \u00a3211m. Deliveroo is understood to have a plan in place regardless of the decision on Amazon's investment. </p><p>A Deliveroo spokesman said it had been working with the CMA and that Amazon's investment would \"add to competition\".</p><p>The implications of the intervention, analysts say, go beyond this deal. \"Is the British authority basically saying to US tech groups: 'We are concerned with how you disrupt markets and we are on your case'?\" asks Shore Captial's Black.</p><p>And, he adds, is it planning to look at not just major takeovers but \"investments in small companies in small markets\" leading to \"six month inquiries and millions in legal fees\". Such aggression from the regulator, he says, could prove \"tectonic\".</p><p>In the short term, Amazon and Deliveroo have five days to make concessions, or lawyer up to take the fight to the CMA.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-58593893</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPV-ND01-JCJY-G560-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1137\"/><timeReceived>5:37 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

It comes from a regulator that dealmakers complain is increasingly unpredictable. </p><p>The Competition and Markets Authority upset advisory apple carts when it dared to block Sainsbury\u2019s tie-up with Asda in 2019, after clearing Tesco\u2019s takeover of wholesaler Booker. A tardy intervention in Takeaway.com\u2019s takeover of Just Eat last month and an in-depth probe of Amazon\u2019s acquisition of a minority stake in Deliveroo have left dealmakers spitting that uncertainty will stifle M&amp;A. </p><p>They are right there is a new uncertainty over which deals the CMA will call in for scrutiny. It has been pushing its jurisdictional boundaries. Dealmakers who once assumed their transactions would not trouble the antitrust authorities can no longer be so sure. </p><p>But the CMA\u2019s belligerence should not surprise. The watchdog has said, plainly and repeatedly, that it is taking a more active approach. And a wide-ranging review by the CMA of competition in Britain, commissioned on Wednesday, shows government support. The reasons are several, and sensible. </p><p>Brexit plays a part. The EU has handled the complex, cross-border cases. The CMA must prove, quickly, that companies should fear it as much as they do Margrethe Vestager, EU competition commissioner. After almost two years as CMA chairman, ex-MP Andrew Tyrie is doing his best. He has brought a politician\u2019s perspective to the regulator. His political nous is plain in the watchdog\u2019s choice of big, consumer-facing cases, and in prioritising consumer protection. </p><p>More than that, though, the CMA\u2019s shift is a response to the transformative effect of the digital marketplace. The regulator is adapting accordingly. Mr Tyrie has lambasted the UK\u2019s antitrust regime as an \u201canalogue system\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009in a digital age\u201d. \u201cCarrying on roughly as we are is not a prudent option\u201d, he says. Digital markets develop quicker and the competitive pressures differ. Online businesses are not restricted by bricks and mortar. New ground rules mean deals involving big tech will not be waved through, even if the transactions are small themselves. Potential competitors count, not just actual competitors. </p><p>Dealmakers justifiably complain the CMA can be slow and untimely. Fast-moving markets need fast decisions, as the CMA acknowledges. But complaints about unpredictability will not stand for long. Barely six years old, the CMA will become more predictable \u2014 predictably interventionist. </p><p>Vodafone stripped to fit</p><p>Up a bit, down a bit. An inch to the left. That\u2019s Vodafone. Third-quarter service revenues up 0.8 per cent. Europe down 1.4 per cent. Recovery in South Africa offset by lower growth in Turkey. </p><p>Nick Read, finance chief turned chief executive, is executing his vision for the telecoms business. And it is a narrowing vision: lower costs, lower growth, lower debt. Having bought Liberty Global\u2019s European assets, the business is shedding what it can outside Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. It has sold off its New Zealand division, is trying to halve its exposure in Australia, and wrote down its JV in India to pretty much zero last year. Last week it agreed to hive off its Egypt business. Next year, the plan is to spin off mobile towers to take advantage of higher valuations attached to listed towers companies such as Inwit. </p><p>Gone are the imperial ambitions of Mr Read\u2019s predecessors. </p><p>Instead, Voda is expansive about simplification and digitalisation as a strategy for growth. In reality, it is more about cost-cutting. The company trumpets Tobi, its chatbot, as a pioneering way to handle complaints, not a way to thin the workforce. Its customers may know better.</p><p>Mr Read talks of reducing churn and tying customers down with more services \u2014 broadband, fixed telephone lines, mobile and TV \u2014 to improve quality of earnings. </p><p>However, enterprise value (market capitalisation plus net debt) is about six times earnings. That is fair enough for a business competing in the commoditised world of voice and online data. Vodafone is being stripped to its virtual wires \u2014 like its shares, trading at nearly half their 2015 peak. </p><p>Ryanair \u2018flygskam\u2019</p><p>Ryanair is putting a new slant on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">flygskam </emphasis>or flight shame. This week the Advertising Standards Authority hung the Dublin group\u2019s greenwashing out to dry. It objected to Ryanair ads claiming it had the lowest carbon emissions of any major airline. The ASA rebuked Ryanair over the comparison and the data points. It seems Ryanair had not made clear it crams more people on its planes. Who knew? </p><p>It is hard to imagine any gas-guzzling airline proclaiming its green credentials and customers believing them. It is questionable, too, how much passengers care. Only about 2 per cent of Ryanair\u2019s customers have made donations, totalling about \u20ac2.5m, to Ryanair\u2019s voluntary carbon offset programme, which studies humpback whales and helps to restore tree habitats in the Algarve and Ireland. </p><p>Ryanair seems unrepentant.

The rule has had an 8-fold word-count increase.<br/><br/>The federation now pronounces on details going all the way from maximum dimensions to whether the racket can have communications equipment embedded within it.<br/><br/>From whether a player can use two rackets at the same time to whether a racket can carry a solar cell or battery. There's a serious point in all this. Tennis works as a competition because the ITF makes sure that the rules are kept up to date with changes that take place.<br/><br/>We the public are the ultimate beneficiaries of the wonders of sport at this level and we can enjoy the game decade after decade because the rules keep up with the technology.<br/><br/>To paraphrase The Leopard, if the game is to stay the same, everything must change.<br/><br/>And so, I want to argue today, the same is true for competition in the economy.<br/><br/>If we want to have rivalry, we want to continue to do the unrivalled good that competition has, in the past, done for our economy, we must constantly adapt its rules.<br/><br/>There are three main reasons that the rules of competition must change:<br/><br/>First, this is unfinished business from the recent past, we have got to make retail markets in regulated sectors - like energy, finance and telecoms - work consistently in the interests of all households.<br/><br/>Second, platforms, big tech, big data are, as everyone knows, disrupting the basic plumbing of markets and, despite the huge benefits they have brought, they sometimes create new forms of harm - especially for vulnerable consumers. Third, we have a productivity problem to solve and competition policy is one of the really powerful tools for improving the economic performance of firms.<br/><br/>All over the world, governments and competition authorities have seen that the promises made of the system, that was slowly built over the last 40 years with Britain leading the way consistently, has sometimes fallen short in the face of new threats.<br/><br/>In this talk, I'd like to take stock of what we've achieved in the last three years and to talk a bit about what needs to be done and to communicate why, in my view, it is so urgent we get on with this.<br/><br/>But before turning to each of these, allow me a brief, historical detour which I hope will show that government shaping of markets has always been with us, and needs to be approached without ideology - pro or contra - but in a pragmatic and empirical spirit.<br/><br/>You can go to the British Museum today and see a stamp of King Alfred's penny on a half-pound lead weight. It had been given the King's seal of approval, literally. You could buy your grain and the King vouched for the weight you'd get in exchange. And there's an obvious reason; Alfred needed to regulate markets.<br/><br/>Just imagine the Monty-Pythonesque scene of a market on the Mercia/Wessex border, circa 880AD, where the miller defends himself against a buyer claiming fraud.<br/><br/>He claims his weights are right. The baker offers another definition of the pound, and the butcher a third.<br/><br/>If you think mobile phone tariffs can be confusing, just imagine comparison when different suppliers don't agree on basic measures of minutes or gigabytes.<br/><br/>Regulation to make sure that competitive markets can even establish themselves has been the stuff of government forever.<br/><br/>Our complex modern economies work because we've been able to push away the boundaries of mistrust.<br/><br/>The extraordinary wealth that has been created and spread by national and international markets is underpinned by the countless rules and mechanisms of regulation. Much of it, from the joint stock company to food standards, backed by the force of law.<br/><br/>But that's not the only reason that Alfred had to regulate markets. It was also that by unifying Wessex, Anglia and Mercia, that he created a single market and so disrupted older patterns of exchange. And this was very good for all the reasons that we know - insurance, specialisation, etc.<br/><br/>But it also undermined some of the traditional social mechanisms in which trust was rooted. If you didn't know people in your town or village or wider area, then the traditional foundations of trust may not be adequate.<br/><br/>And so, regulation, again, filled the gap and allowed the new markets to flourish.<br/><br/>If good regulation does not accompany disruptions, then they can be resented, especially by those most reliant on those old social contexts.<br/><br/>This need to make new retail markets work for all fits, in many respects, the problem we have today.<br/><br/>I think of it as unfinished business of creating well-functioning consumer markets in the basic utility sectors that have been gradually deregulated over the last 40 years.<br/><br/>There have been some huge successes in this programme.<br/><br/>Technological disruption, driven by carefully constructed competition in telecoms, for example, has completely transformed our lives.<br/><br/>The same scale of transformation cannot yet be claimed for how we use gas, electricity or water.<br/><br/>The basic philosophy of utility deregulation in domestic retail markets was that we could eventually replicate the sorts of healthy, competitive markets that have evolved in essentials like food.<br/><br/>This was part of the broader new regulatory philosophy pioneered by Britain 40 years ago and copied all over the world.<br/><br/>The retail markets piece of this transformation still needs further development.<br/><br/>First, there's the relatively slow pace of basic innovation in some of these markets. Second, they have often settled into business models in which many consumers continue to be subjected to higher prices than can be justified, while a savvy minority benefit from very cheap deals.<br/><br/>The CMA called this to public attention with the problem of default tariffs in energy. Martin Cave, who wrote the dissenting minority opinion to the CMA report is here and now chairs Ofgem.<br/><br/>This recommendation to impose a retail price cap on default tariffs was made and Citizens Advice followed this up with, in my view, its very welcome \"Super-Complaint\" to the CMA, applying this argument to other markets.<br/><br/>Let me take this moment to thank the Social Market Foundation and James Kirkup, in particular for the traditions and the work that this organisation has done to advance our understanding of the issue and how we can tackle it.<br/><br/>The \"loyalty penalty\" has now been extensively analysed by the CMA and other regulators.<br/><br/>The numbers can be eye-watering.<br/><br/>A household inactive in all the markets studied risks being over-charged by \u00a31549 per year.<br/><br/>That is the same amount as the entire, annual discretionary spending of the poorest 10% of households, and often there is a close collaboration between the poorest and those who are paying higher.<br/><br/>This government has responded extremely supportively to the CMA's recommendations on the \"loyalty penalty\". Business and their regulators must find ways to end the worst effects of these business models and the companies involved should look to the energy industry as a proof of our seriousness in the lengths we need the regulators to go to.<br/><br/>Luring consumers onto cheap tariffs in the hope that many of them will fail to notice subsequent price rises should be seen as simply bad business.<br/><br/>Doing everything possible to confuse customers so they don't notice the rises is even worse. Protecting consumers from sharp practices has been a constant of Government in this country for centuries.<br/><br/>I've mentioned Alfred's standardisation of weights already. Another example comes in the medieval \"Assizes of Bread\". Specialist courts that made sure that bakers and millers were stopped from selling substandard product.<br/><br/>A home insurance company that gradually turns the screws, an energy company that price-walks you up the curve; they are earning their gains on a sort of asymmetry of power and information in which we have long intervened.<br/><br/>These are business practices that rely on undermining the trust of the consumer.<br/><br/>The markets that have really benefited from competition are the ones in which innovation, quality and price are the focus of corporate energies - not the invention of a new pricing practice.<br/><br/>If the notion generally takes hold that our utility markets are rife with this sort of behaviour then the entire legitimacy, it seems to me, of that sector suffers, and indeed, the whole economy suffers.<br/><br/>This is a point that has been very eloquently put on many occasions by Lord Andrew Tyrie, with us today, whom I was delighted to appoint to be Chair of the CMA. Andrew's work before he took up this position as Chair of the Treasury Select Committee between 2010 and 2017 was infused by this very preoccupation. The legitimacy of our financial system being threatened by some, small number of bad apples in finance. And there are places where the same can be true in other household sectors today.<br/><br/>So, when it came to the decision to appoint a new Chair to the CMA, I knew that Andrew's combination of passion for the wellbeing of ordinary working people, his rigorous thinking and his ever-effective drive - having experienced it the other side of the Treasure select committee, being subject to grilling's from Andrew, I can attest to the rigour of that and thought he was the ideal person for the task.<br/><br/>And I was delighted that he received the unanimous backing of the BEIS select committee.<br/><br/>Everything that I see coming from the CMA confirms in my view that Andrew was the right choice.<br/><br/>Under his watch, the CMA has made it very clear that it would concentrate efforts on tackling consumer harms. The pace of change has been remarkable. From unfair administrative charges in care homes to an investigation of the funeral business. From cleaning up the online-ticketing market to hard-to-reverse subscriptions in online games. From excessive pricing in pharmaceuticals to ensuring merger activity does not undermine lively competition in the retail sector.<br/><br/>These cases and more in the future, together with a welcome emphasis on strong public communication of the essential work that the CMA does, will both solve immediate problems and tell the general public that when it comes to their lives as consumers the CMA has their back.<br/><br/>For this, I'd also like - as well as thanking Andrew - to commend Andrea Coscelli, the CMA's Chief Executive whom I also appointed, and to all those in their organisation who have contributed to this excellent work.<br/><br/>Recognising that competition policy is foundational to our economy and society, the first thing I asked Andrew in his new post was for the CMA's recommendations on how we should reform the system itself.<br/><br/>A large number of proposals were put to me in a thoughtful and comprehensive letter that some of you may have seen.<br/><br/>Let me start by making three points of principle.<br/><br/>First, the CMA wants its primary duty to be to the welfare of consumers. I have to say that at a philosophical level, I entirely agree.<br/><br/>Competition should never be seen as an end in itself, except perhaps last Sunday when watching England win the cricket. But normally, it's as a means to thriving lives on the part of consumers.<br/><br/>Many of Andrew's proposals relate to this basic shift in principle and the exact package we opt for will be a very important question to address, and do so urgently.<br/><br/>Second, the CMA wants the enforcement of consumer law to be as effective as is the enforcement of competition law, and asks for new powers to be shared between itself and the sectoral regulators to make this a reality.<br/><br/>As I have said already, in our response to the CMA's loyalty penalty report, I agree with that too.<br/><br/>This will help not only with the \"unfinished business\" but will also allow us to shape the new digital markets.<br/><br/>Third, the CMA is very concerned that the speed of disruption in the economy, from digital markets and big data, means that the current machinery of competition enforcement is too slow.<br/><br/>It is no good taking a tech company through the courts over many years, when in the meantime another three relevant markets have tipped into a \"winner-takes-all\" state.<br/><br/>Again, I have no doubt that this is true in principle.<br/><br/>This takes me back to what I said earlier about King Alfred's need to regulate markets after the unification of markets in Wessex and Mercia.<br/><br/>Cyberspace is a glorious new space for markets, but it is not in the long-term interest of business or consumers for it to become a low-trust environment, quite the reverse.<br/><br/>Achieving greater speed and flexibility will require some of the solutions put forward by Jason Furman, especially more principles-based ex ante regulation of platforms.<br/><br/>It will also require the CMA to be able to act more swiftly and robustly ex post where it finds anti-competitive conduct.<br/><br/>And I agree with the CMA on this. What is needed now is to find a way of speeding up this work while maintaining the UK's unparalleled reputation for procedural fairness and legal rights.<br/><br/>Our reputation is enormously valuable in terms of business confidence, and it must always be maintained. And I have asked my department to prepare advice on the options we have on this.<br/><br/>I would like to emphasise that these issues are urgent. Consumer mistrust in the economy must not be allowed to grow to be higher.<br/><br/>The positions of platforms become more entrenched and every day we become more aware of some of the exploitative business practices that have become easy to spread.<br/><br/>The CMA has produced a menu of reform options. The Furman Review has added to them. Our Smart Data Review has committed to some of these and to Furman's central recommendation - the establishment of a Digital Markets Unit.<br/><br/>Today, I am adding to this by publishing our strategic steer to the CMA and the Competition Law Review, a piece of analytical work on the technical performance of the competition regime which will provide important research material for the wider changes ahead.<br/><br/>Now is the time for industry, the legal profession, economists, consumer groups, regulators and civil society to respond to these initiatives and proposals.<br/><br/>And in this, I also very much think that we need to understand the views of judges and the judiciary since the appeals system is such an important part of enforcement. That will put all elements in place for a new administration to decide how to act on these pressing matters.<br/><br/>The power of the CMA's request for tools that can be used at speed arises, of course, from the spectre haunting all markets today; the disruption that can be associated with big platforms, big tech and big data.<br/><br/>But what exactly is that spectre?<br/><br/>Many ordinary consumers feel the pinch of loyalty penalties in recently deregulated sectors, and very few consumers think of the offerings from Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Spotify, Uber, Deliveroo, Ocado or Netflix as anything other than a miraculous revolution in terms of ease, quality and price.<br/><br/>Hands up here who remembers navigating London with an A to Z?

If I were to mention the A to Z to my children, they wouldn't know what I was talking about.<br/><br/>Transactional ease is off-the-scale in all sorts of markets compared to where we were, even fewer than 20 years ago.<br/><br/>And yet the CMA and Jason Furman, who led our review of competition between the Tech Giants, are right that the rules need to be considered and may need to change if competition is to perform its magic there too.<br/><br/>Consumers may not feel the pinch when they click on that link for a cheaper credit card, but the card-issuer who has to recover the \u00a3100 that this click cost them on the search engine certainly does and will have to recover the cost from consumers somehow.<br/><br/>The holiday-maker usually does not see any cost from booking the charming BB by the seaside through Trip-Advisor, but the couple who have to fork out the social media referral fees do have an interest in ensuring that market is competitive.<br/><br/>Do consumers have effective control over their data and is what is done with it ultimately in their own interest?<br/><br/>These various, potential harms are only just becoming headline news and we need to make sure that they do not drown out all the good that platforms have brought us and continue to bring us.<br/><br/>The CMA has just launched a much-needed market study into digital advertising and Professor Furman recommended that we establish a \"Digital Markets Unit\" that will work to establish and enforce ex ante the principles by which we must shape these markets.<br/><br/>I trust that the CMA's analysis will provide some of the knowledge needed to establish the Digital Markets Unit. Some will, no doubt, groan at the suspicion that Government is trying to control cyberspace. There is no scarcity online.<br/><br/>And that is the reverse of the intention because, it seems to me, that if people are unhappy with how some things are, we should be looking to make sure that level of trust and confidence is maintained. The vision of cyberspace has some connections with American frontier town of the late 19th Century. Cyberspace has followed, in some respects, a similar revolution. It was that very period of expansion and excitement brought with it some of the monopolies that gave rise that the development and the birth of anti-regulation as we know it.<br/><br/>The power of railroad monopolies in the US led to the birth of anti-trust and sometimes accompanied by populist policies. So we need to make sure that what may have characteristics in digital platforms that could run the risk of sapping innovation, squeezing businesses and raising the prices of goods anticipates some of the problems that may arise. But consumer choice is just a click away, one might think, so what kind of monopoly do the giants really have?<br/><br/>Here, I would just like to say that one of the best things to have happened in the understanding of markets in the last 10 years, and Martin Cave has written extensively on this, has been the rise of realistic views of how consumers actually behave and not just how they ought to behave.<br/><br/>In the unfinished business in consumer markets, as well as in the new challenges posed by the oligopolies, and potential oligopolies of cyberspace, we need to guard against an overly-narrow conception of economics that I think has been part of the problem. Something that economics itself, I think, has made great strides in recent days in recognising.<br/><br/>This is why I have asked, in my steer to the CMA that it makes sure that it update its methodological toolkit, so it's not just relying on the old economic tools.<br/><br/>New approaches that use huge, rich datasets, disciplines like behavioural economics, psychology and anthropology all have their part to play in understanding how markets actually work, rather than how regulators have too often hoped they would work.<br/><br/>The CMA and other future-facing regulators like the FCA, Ofgem and the CAA are embracing these new tools and methodologies. I strongly welcome that and hope to see much more still.<br/><br/>Let me now turn to competition and productivity.<br/><br/>There are roughly four ways that changing the conditions of competition affects productivity.<br/><br/>First there are the direct effects of competition eliminating unearned rents. Prices fall so the real amount each worker can buy with the value created by an hour of work increases. Our energy price cap, for example, means a single person on the minimum wage need work almost two days fewer to pay for their annual energy bill. This is a significant difference to many people in this country.<br/><br/>What's more, the people and equipment that were employed in the rent-seeking activity are liberated to do something more productive and that has knock-on effects. Taking unearned rents out of supply chains makes businesses that rely on those inputs more productive. They have more surplus to spread over capital and labour after all inputs have been covered.<br/><br/>But against all these positive effects there is a potentially trickier relationship between competition and productivity, and specifically, incentives to innovate. Historically, the link between competition and innovation can sometimes be a paradoxical one.<br/><br/>Patent law is meant to grant inventors temporary monopoly. In that respect, it is an \"anti-competition\" policy.<br/><br/>There are good arguments to be had about whether patent today is working as it should, but what is clear is that all of us benefit when innovators are rewarded in this way.<br/><br/>The Nobel prize-winning economist Bill Nordhaus estimated that innovators capture only about 3% of the value that they create. The rest, 97%, goes to society at large, for free. So, it's strongly in our interest to back and reward innovation.<br/><br/>That's why so many elements of our Industrial Strategy put an emphasis on aligning all the strengths of companies, universities and government agencies.<br/><br/>Innovation is so valuable that we're happy to see coordination being delivered through public RD investment, common Grand Challenges that bring together companies, universities, research institutions and businesses, sector deals to line-up the efforts providing common research centres, common infrastructure and investments in education.<br/><br/>And traditional merger control needs to consider this delicate balance between competition and coordination. When a big pharma company buys the minnow with a promising molecule for a spectacular sum is it helping to get a valuable product to market or is it taking out potential competition against something it has on its own lab-bench? In the first case, a merger authority should OK the deal. In the second, in my view, it should say no.<br/><br/>Jason Furman wondered about the same effect within Big Tech. When Facebook bought pre-revenue Instagram and WhatsApp for billions, which of these was it doing?<br/><br/>If the power of innovation is to be fully realised for the general good, our approach to mergers must now ask these hard and detailed questions.<br/><br/>I was very pleased to see the CMA doing so in its recent decision just last week to examine Amazon's investment in Deliveroo.<br/><br/>I'd like to finish this speech with some reflections on an absolutely foundational input which the CMA and this government have put a great deal of effort into improving, and that is audit. Again, one of the foundations of trust and reputation. Audit is the primary mechanism by which management's assessment of how a business is doing gets challenged, verified and made public.<br/><br/>We have reason, it seems to me, to have some concerns to be very concerned about the recent quality of audit, and to believe that this has wide repercussions on the performance of the whole economy.<br/><br/>There have been the high-profile failures that have made headlines. The BHS pension liability, Carillion, of course, and Patisserie Valerie.<br/><br/>But that's not all.<br/><br/>The Financial Reporting Council, our audit regulator, has just reported that one third of Price Waterhouse Cooper's audits of FTSE 350 companies failed to meet the standard of \"requiring only limited improvement\".<br/><br/>Grant Thornton did even worse with only 50% of audits passing that threshold.<br/><br/>Not a single top 4 firm met the FRC's standard for 90% of audits last year.<br/><br/>Perhaps, even more troubling from an assessment of the state of competition, the CMA found that, between 2014 and 2017 KPMG, for example, grew its market share while also scoring worst of the Big 4 in audit quality.<br/><br/>And yet audit is a sector that should be ripe for disruptive innovation. Big data and AI could be transforming the practice.<br/><br/>Without the pressures of competition, will this technology be produce an even better audit? A succession of independent analyses have drawn attention to a systematic problems. Sir John Kingman in the review that I asked him to perform of the sector, the BEIS select committee in their report, the Financial Reporting Council itself and the CMA in its market study - excellent and dependable audit is a public good, the whole economy benefits from the fact that businesses choose to establish themselves in a jurisdiction in which confidence in audit is secured.<br/><br/>Capital is better allocated and at lower cost, the better quality information is.<br/><br/>The wide array of users of company accounts, not just shareholders but customers, suppliers, employees, places and civil society organisations too, can all the better rely on complex chains of interdependence when the quality of audit is good.<br/><br/>Solving the problem of audit quality can therefore bring great productivity benefits to the whole economy and make the UK an even better place to start and grow a business.<br/><br/>Competition should be central to that.<br/><br/>Company boards must have meaningful choice of auditors.<br/><br/>We cannot run the risk of systemic over-reliance on just a few firms that could reduce further.<br/><br/>The regulator needs to ensure that quality persists, despite the intrinsic problem of incentives in this market.<br/><br/>So I am pleased to have two important announcements to be able to make today. First, is to announce the appoint of Sir Jonathan Thompson as the new Chief Executive of the Financial Reporting Council. Many of you will know that he has been the recent head of HMRC, someone with a strong and rigorous record.<br/><br/>He will have the crucial task of transforming the organisation as it becomes the new and strengthened Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority, ARGA, created as recommended in Sir John Kingman's review.<br/><br/>And Second, I am publishing our consultation on the CMA's, in my view, powerful and compelling package of recommendations.<br/><br/>I believe that we need to act fast before another audit scandal makes headlines. I don't believe that we should wait for the review that I have asked Sir Donald Brydon to perform on the purpose of audit. Whatever the answer to that question, the mechanism to reach it will necessarily be delivered through a well-functioning market and a strong regulator.<br/><br/>But I would like to add this.<br/><br/>The audit sector should be in no doubt about the need and the resolve to make these reforms.<br/><br/>Audit quality must improve and we will do everything that's needed.<br/><br/>But the audit sector itself could do a great deal, now, voluntarily before any legislative change comes and I strongly urge them to do so.<br/><br/>It is right, it is good for the economy and it will give the sector much more credibility in helping shape the regime of the future.<br/><br/>Let me end as I started - with the weekend's sporting triumphs.<br/><br/>Here, according to the MCC's rulebook is how we come to know with confidence that last Sunday's score was actually the score that the umpires judged, and how cricket does its own version of audit, if you like. I quote:<br/><br/>\"Two scorers shall be appointed to record all runs [...] ...The scorers shall frequently check... ...to ensure that their records agree.<br/><br/>They shall agree with the umpires... ...at least at every interval [...]<br/><br/>The scorers shall accept all instructions and signals... ...given to them by the umpires... ...and shall immediately acknowledge each separate signal.\"<br/><br/>It is subtle and instructive.<br/><br/>It is suited to the particulars of the problem being solved.<br/><br/>Like all rules that evolve to make competition really work, it embodies and distils volumes of collected experience, wisdom and judgement in practice.<br/><br/>And just as Britain has led the world in codifying the rules of sport, as well as occasionally, and satisfyingly, winning at them, here I must mention for completeness the third of the weekend's great sporting fixtures and salute the amazing performance of Lewis Hamilton at Silverstone.<br/><br/>We should have every confidence that we should continue to lead in many ways the similar task, and in which we have long had a world-leading, international reputation of codifying and keeping the most innovative in the world, the rules of market and competition. It's one of our strongest and proudest exports.<br/><br/>The CMA, our regulators, government, our Parliament and our people collectively have the knowledge, pragmatism and experience to be winners at the economically crucial, global competition to design the rules of competition.<br/><br/>Getting this right has a great prize attached, a Fourth Industrial Revolution with new technologies, new markets, new opportunities underpinned by confidence by consumers, by market participants. This is a future marked by prosperity for all, in all parts of the country.       </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">M2PW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">M2PW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKW-MB51-JD3Y-Y50T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">162367</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4879\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>M2 PressWIRE</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"21233\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 19, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The rule has had an 8-fold word-count increase.</p><p>The federation now pronounces on details going all the way from maximum dimensions to whether the racket can have communications equipment embedded within it.</p><p>From whether a player can use two rackets at the same time to whether a racket can carry a solar cell or battery. There\u2019s a serious point in all this. Tennis works as a competition because the ITF makes sure that the rules are kept up to date with changes that take place.</p><p>We the public are the ultimate beneficiaries of the wonders of sport at this level and we can enjoy the game decade after decade because the rules keep up with the technology.</p><p>To paraphrase The Leopard, if the game is to stay the same, everything must change.</p><p>And so, I want to argue today, the same is true for competition in the economy.</p><p>If we want to have rivalry, we want to continue to do the unrivalled good that competition has, in the past, done for our economy, we must constantly adapt its rules.</p><p>There are three main reasons that the rules of competition must change:</p><p>First, this is unfinished business from the recent past, we have got to make retail markets in regulated sectors - like energy, finance and telecoms \u2013 work consistently in the interests of all households.</p><p>Second, platforms, big tech, big data are, as everyone knows, disrupting the basic plumbing of markets and, despite the huge benefits they have brought, they sometimes create new forms of harm \u2013 especially for vulnerable consumers. Third, we have a productivity problem to solve and competition policy is one of the really powerful tools for improving the economic performance of firms.</p><p>All over the world, governments and competition authorities have seen that the promises made of the system, that was slowly built over the last 40 years with Britain leading the way consistently, has sometimes fallen short in the face of new threats.</p><p>In this talk, I\u2019d like to take stock of what we\u2019ve achieved in the last three years and to talk a bit about what needs to be done and to communicate why, in my view, it is so urgent we get on with this.</p><p>But before turning to each of these, allow me a brief, historical detour which I hope will show that government shaping of markets has always been with us, and needs to be approached without ideology - pro or contra \u2013 but in a pragmatic and empirical spirit.</p><p>You can go to the British Museum today and see a stamp of King Alfred\u2019s penny on a half-pound lead weight. It had been given the King\u2019s seal of approval, literally. You could buy your grain and the King vouched for the weight you\u2019d get in exchange. And there\u2019s an obvious reason; Alfred needed to regulate markets.</p><p>Just imagine the Monty-Pythonesque scene of a market on the Mercia/Wessex border, circa 880AD, where the miller defends himself against a buyer claiming fraud.</p><p>He claims his weights are right. The baker offers another definition of the pound, and the butcher a third.</p><p>If you think mobile phone tariffs can be confusing, just imagine comparison when different suppliers don\u2019t agree on basic measures of minutes or gigabytes.</p><p>Regulation to make sure that competitive markets can even establish themselves has been the stuff of government forever.</p><p>Our complex modern economies work because we\u2019ve been able to push away the boundaries of mistrust.</p><p>The extraordinary wealth that has been created and spread by national and international markets is underpinned by the countless rules and mechanisms of regulation. Much of it, from the joint stock company to food standards, backed by the force of law.</p><p>But that\u2019s not the only reason that Alfred had to regulate markets. It was also that by unifying Wessex, Anglia and Mercia, that he created a single market and so disrupted older patterns of exchange. And this was very good for all the reasons that we know - insurance, specialisation, etc.</p><p>But it also undermined some of the traditional social mechanisms in which trust was rooted. If you didn\u2019t know people in your town or village or wider area, then the traditional foundations of trust may not be adequate.</p><p>And so, regulation, again, filled the gap and allowed the new markets to flourish.</p><p>If good regulation does not accompany disruptions, then they can be resented, especially by those most reliant on those old social contexts.</p><p>This need to make new retail markets work for all fits, in many respects, the problem we have today.</p><p>I think of it as unfinished business of creating well-functioning consumer markets in the basic utility sectors that have been gradually deregulated over the last 40 years.</p><p>There have been some huge successes in this programme.</p><p>Technological disruption, driven by carefully constructed competition in telecoms, for example, has completely transformed our lives.</p><p>The same scale of transformation cannot yet be claimed for how we use gas, electricity or water.</p><p>The basic philosophy of utility deregulation in domestic retail markets was that we could eventually replicate the sorts of healthy, competitive markets that have evolved in essentials like food.</p><p>This was part of the broader new regulatory philosophy pioneered by Britain 40 years ago and copied all over the world.</p><p>The retail markets piece of this transformation still needs further development.</p><p>First, there\u2019s the relatively slow pace of basic innovation in some of these markets. Second, they have often settled into business models in which many consumers continue to be subjected to higher prices than can be justified, while a savvy minority benefit from very cheap deals.</p><p>The CMA called this to public attention with the problem of default tariffs in energy. Martin Cave, who wrote the dissenting minority opinion to the CMA report is here and now chairs Ofgem.</p><p>This recommendation to impose a retail price cap on default tariffs was made and Citizens Advice followed this up with, in my view, its very welcome \u201cSuper-Complaint\u201d to the CMA, applying this argument to other markets.</p><p>Let me take this moment to thank the Social Market Foundation and James Kirkup, in particular for the traditions and the work that this organisation has done to advance our understanding of the issue and how we can tackle it.</p><p>The \u201cloyalty penalty\u201d has now been extensively analysed by the CMA and other regulators.</p><p>The numbers can be eye-watering.</p><p>A household inactive in all the markets studied risks being over-charged by \u00a31549 per year.</p><p>That is the same amount as the entire, annual discretionary spending of the poorest 10% of households, and often there is a close collaboration between the poorest and those who are paying higher.</p><p>This government has responded extremely supportively to the CMA\u2019s recommendations on the \u201cloyalty penalty\u201d. Business and their regulators must find ways to end the worst effects of these business models and the companies involved should look to the energy industry as a proof of our seriousness in the lengths we need the regulators to go to.</p><p>Luring consumers onto cheap tariffs in the hope that many of them will fail to notice subsequent price rises should be seen as simply bad business.</p><p>Doing everything possible to confuse customers so they don\u2019t notice the rises is even worse. Protecting consumers from sharp practices has been a constant of Government in this country for centuries.</p><p>I\u2019ve mentioned Alfred\u2019s standardisation of weights already. Another example comes in the medieval \u201cAssizes of Bread\u201d. Specialist courts that made sure that bakers and millers were stopped from selling substandard product.</p><p>A home insurance company that gradually turns the screws, an energy company that price-walks you up the curve; they are earning their gains on a sort of asymmetry of power and information in which we have long intervened.</p><p>These are business practices that rely on undermining the trust of the consumer.</p><p>The markets that have really benefited from competition are the ones in which innovation, quality and price are the focus of corporate energies - not the invention of a new pricing practice.</p><p>If the notion generally takes hold that our utility markets are rife with this sort of behaviour then the entire legitimacy, it seems to me, of that sector suffers, and indeed, the whole economy suffers.</p><p>This is a point that has been very eloquently put on many occasions by Lord Andrew Tyrie, with us today, whom I was delighted to appoint to be Chair of the CMA. Andrew\u2019s work before he took up this position as Chair of the Treasury Select Committee between 2010 and 2017 was infused by this very preoccupation. The legitimacy of our financial system being threatened by some, small number of bad apples in finance. And there are places where the same can be true in other household sectors today.</p><p>So, when it came to the decision to appoint a new Chair to the CMA, I knew that Andrew\u2019s combination of passion for the wellbeing of ordinary working people, his rigorous thinking and his ever-effective drive \u2013 having experienced it the other side of the Treasure select committee, being subject to grilling\u2019s from Andrew, I can attest to the rigour of that and thought he was the ideal person for the task.</p><p>And I was delighted that he received the unanimous backing of the BEIS select committee.</p><p>Everything that I see coming from the CMA confirms in my view that Andrew was the right choice.</p><p>Under his watch, the CMA has made it very clear that it would concentrate efforts on tackling consumer harms. The pace of change has been remarkable. From unfair administrative charges in care homes to an investigation of the funeral business. From cleaning up the online-ticketing market to hard-to-reverse subscriptions in online games. From excessive pricing in pharmaceuticals to ensuring merger activity does not undermine lively competition in the retail sector.</p><p>These cases and more in the future, together with a welcome emphasis on strong public communication of the essential work that the CMA does, will both solve immediate problems and tell the general public that when it comes to their lives as consumers the CMA has their back.</p><p>For this, I\u2019d also like \u2013 as well as thanking Andrew \u2013 to commend Andrea Coscelli, the CMA\u2019s Chief Executive whom I also appointed, and to all those in their organisation who have contributed to this excellent work.</p><p>Recognising that competition policy is foundational to our economy and society, the first thing I asked Andrew in his new post was for the CMA\u2019s recommendations on how we should reform the system itself.</p><p>A large number of proposals were put to me in a thoughtful and comprehensive letter that some of you may have seen.</p><p>Let me start by making three points of principle.</p><p>First, the CMA wants its primary duty to be to the welfare of consumers. I have to say that at a philosophical level, I entirely agree.</p><p>Competition should never be seen as an end in itself, except perhaps last Sunday when watching England win the cricket. But normally, it\u2019s as a means to thriving lives on the part of consumers.</p><p>Many of Andrew\u2019s proposals relate to this basic shift in principle and the exact package we opt for will be a very important question to address, and do so urgently.</p><p>Second, the CMA wants the enforcement of consumer law to be as effective as is the enforcement of competition law, and asks for new powers to be shared between itself and the sectoral regulators to make this a reality.</p><p>As I have said already, in our response to the CMA\u2019s loyalty penalty report, I agree with that too.</p><p>This will help not only with the \u201cunfinished business\u201d but will also allow us to shape the new digital markets.</p><p>Third, the CMA is very concerned that the speed of disruption in the economy, from digital markets and big data, means that the current machinery of competition enforcement is too slow.</p><p>It is no good taking a tech company through the courts over many years, when in the meantime another three relevant markets have tipped into a \u201cwinner-takes-all\u201d state.</p><p>Again, I have no doubt that this is true in principle.</p><p>This takes me back to what I said earlier about King Alfred\u2019s need to regulate markets after the unification of markets in Wessex and Mercia.</p><p>Cyberspace is a glorious new space for markets, but it is not in the long-term interest of business or consumers for it to become a low-trust environment, quite the reverse.</p><p>Achieving greater speed and flexibility will require some of the solutions put forward by Jason Furman, especially more principles-based ex ante regulation of platforms.</p><p>It will also require the CMA to be able to act more swiftly and robustly ex post where it finds anti-competitive conduct.</p><p>And I agree with the CMA on this. What is needed now is to find a way of speeding up this work while maintaining the UK\u2019s unparalleled reputation for procedural fairness and legal rights.</p><p>Our reputation is enormously valuable in terms of business confidence, and it must always be maintained. And I have asked my department to prepare advice on the options we have on this.</p><p>I would like to emphasise that these issues are urgent. Consumer mistrust in the economy must not be allowed to grow to be higher.</p><p>The positions of platforms become more entrenched and every day we become more aware of some of the exploitative business practices that have become easy to spread.</p><p>The CMA has produced a menu of reform options. The Furman Review has added to them. Our Smart Data Review has committed to some of these and to Furman\u2019s central recommendation - the establishment of a Digital Markets Unit.</p><p>Today, I am adding to this by publishing our strategic steer to the CMA and the Competition Law Review, a piece of analytical work on the technical performance of the competition regime which will provide important research material for the wider changes ahead.</p><p>Now is the time for industry, the legal profession, economists, consumer groups, regulators and civil society to respond to these initiatives and proposals.</p><p>And in this, I also very much think that we need to understand the views of judges and the judiciary since the appeals system is such an important part of enforcement. That will put all elements in place for a new administration to decide how to act on these pressing matters.</p><p>The power of the CMA\u2019s request for tools that can be used at speed arises, of course, from the spectre haunting all markets today; the disruption that can be associated with big platforms, big tech and big data.</p><p>But what exactly is that spectre?</p><p>Many ordinary consumers feel the pinch of loyalty penalties in recently deregulated sectors, and very few consumers think of the offerings from Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Spotify, Uber, Deliveroo, Ocado or Netflix as anything other than a miraculous revolution in terms of ease, quality and price.</p><p>Hands up here who remembers navigating London with an A to Z? Jumping off the page and having to fumble around the index, the pages becoming detached from the binder, often having to pull over, work out where the join in the pages was and how you transfer over - repeat and repeat and arrive usually very arrive late to your destination. If I were to mention the A to Z to my children, they wouldn\u2019t know what I was talking about.</p><p>Transactional ease is off-the-scale in all sorts of markets compared to where we were, even fewer than 20 years ago.</p><p>And yet the CMA and Jason Furman, who led our review of competition between the Tech Giants, are right that the rules need to be considered and may need to change if competition is to perform its magic there too.</p><p>Consumers may not feel the pinch when they click on that link for a cheaper credit card, but the card-issuer who has to recover the \u00a3100 that this click cost them on the search engine certainly does and will have to recover the cost from consumers somehow.</p><p>The holiday-maker usually does not see any cost from booking the charming B&amp;B by the seaside through Trip-Advisor, but the couple who have to fork out the social media referral fees do have an interest in ensuring that market is competitive.</p><p>Do consumers have effective control over their data and is what is done with it ultimately in their own interest?</p><p>These various, potential harms are only just becoming headline news and we need to make sure that they do not drown out all the good that platforms have brought us and continue to bring us.</p><p>The CMA has just launched a much-needed market study into digital advertising and Professor Furman recommended that we establish a \u201cDigital Markets Unit\u201d that will work to establish and enforce ex ante the principles by which we must shape these markets.</p><p>I trust that the CMA\u2019s analysis will provide some of the knowledge needed to establish the Digital Markets Unit. Some will, no doubt, groan at the suspicion that Government is trying to control cyberspace. There is no scarcity online.</p><p>And that is the reverse of the intention because, it seems to me, that if people are unhappy with how some things are, we should be looking to make sure that level of trust and confidence is maintained. The vision of cyberspace has some connections with American frontier town of the late 19th Century. Cyberspace has followed, in some respects, a similar revolution. It was that very period of expansion and excitement brought with it some of the monopolies that gave rise that the development and the birth of anti-regulation as we know it.</p><p>The power of railroad monopolies in the US led to the birth of anti-trust and sometimes accompanied by populist policies. So we need to make sure that what may have characteristics in digital platforms that could run the risk of sapping innovation, squeezing businesses and raising the prices of goods anticipates some of the problems that may arise. But consumer choice is just a click away, one might think, so what kind of monopoly do the giants really have?</p><p>Here, I would just like to say that one of the best things to have happened in the understanding of markets in the last 10 years, and Martin Cave has written extensively on this, has been the rise of realistic views of how consumers actually behave and not just how they ought to behave.</p><p>In the unfinished business in consumer markets, as well as in the new challenges posed by the oligopolies, and potential oligopolies of cyberspace, we need to guard against an overly-narrow conception of economics that I think has been part of the problem. Something that economics itself, I think, has made great strides in recent days in recognising.</p><p>This is why I have asked, in my steer to the CMA that it makes sure that it update its methodological toolkit, so it\u2019s not just relying on the old economic tools.</p><p>New approaches that use huge, rich datasets, disciplines like behavioural economics, psychology and anthropology all have their part to play in understanding how markets actually work, rather than how regulators have too often hoped they would work.</p><p>The CMA and other future-facing regulators like the FCA, Ofgem and the CAA are embracing these new tools and methodologies. I strongly welcome that and hope to see much more still.</p><p>Let me now turn to competition and productivity.</p><p>There are roughly four ways that changing the conditions of competition affects productivity.</p><p>First there are the direct effects of competition eliminating unearned rents. Prices fall so the real amount each worker can buy with the value created by an hour of work increases. Our energy price cap, for example, means a single person on the minimum wage need work almost two days fewer to pay for their annual energy bill. This is a significant difference to many people in this country.</p><p>What\u2019s more, the people and equipment that were employed in the rent-seeking activity are liberated to do something more productive and that has knock-on effects. Taking unearned rents out of supply chains makes businesses that rely on those inputs more productive. They have more surplus to spread over capital and labour after all inputs have been covered.</p><p>But against all these positive effects there is a potentially trickier relationship between competition and productivity, and specifically, incentives to innovate. Historically, the link between competition and innovation can sometimes be a paradoxical one.</p><p>Patent law is meant to grant inventors temporary monopoly. In that respect, it is an \u201canti-competition\u201d policy.</p><p>There are good arguments to be had about whether patent today is working as it should, but what is clear is that all of us benefit when innovators are rewarded in this way.</p><p>The Nobel prize-winning economist Bill Nordhaus estimated that innovators capture only about 3% of the value that they create. The rest, 97%, goes to society at large, for free. So, it\u2019s strongly in our interest to back and reward innovation.</p><p>That\u2019s why so many elements of our Industrial Strategy put an emphasis on aligning all the strengths of companies, universities and government agencies.</p><p>Innovation is so valuable that we\u2019re happy to see coordination being delivered through public R&amp;D investment, common Grand Challenges that bring together companies, universities, research institutions and businesses, sector deals to line-up the efforts providing common research centres, common infrastructure and investments in education.</p><p>And traditional merger control needs to consider this delicate balance between competition and coordination. When a big pharma company buys the minnow with a promising molecule for a spectacular sum is it helping to get a valuable product to market or is it taking out potential competition against something it has on its own lab-bench? In the first case, a merger authority should OK the deal. In the second, in my view, it should say no.</p><p>Jason Furman wondered about the same effect within Big Tech. When Facebook bought pre-revenue Instagram and WhatsApp for billions, which of these was it doing?</p><p>If the power of innovation is to be fully realised for the general good, our approach to mergers must now ask these hard and detailed questions.</p><p>I was very pleased to see the CMA doing so in its recent decision just last week to examine Amazon\u2019s investment in Deliveroo.</p><p>I\u2019d like to finish this speech with some reflections on an absolutely foundational input which the CMA and this government have put a great deal of effort into improving, and that is audit. Again, one of the foundations of trust and reputation. Audit is the primary mechanism by which management\u2019s assessment of how a business is doing gets challenged, verified and made public.</p><p>We have reason, it seems to me, to have some concerns to be very concerned about the recent quality of audit, and to believe that this has wide repercussions on the performance of the whole economy.</p><p>There have been the high-profile failures that have made headlines. The BHS pension liability, Carillion, of course, and Patisserie Valerie.</p><p>But that\u2019s not all.</p><p>The Financial Reporting Council, our audit regulator, has just reported that one third of Price Waterhouse Cooper\u2019s audits of FTSE 350 companies failed to meet the standard of \u201crequiring only limited improvement\u201d.</p><p>Grant Thornton did even worse with only 50% of audits passing that threshold.</p><p>Not a single top 4 firm met the FRC\u2019s standard for 90% of audits last year.</p><p>Perhaps, even more troubling from an assessment of the state of competition, the CMA found that, between 2014 and 2017 KPMG, for example, grew its market share while also scoring worst of the Big 4 in audit quality.</p><p>And yet audit is a sector that should be ripe for disruptive innovation. Big data and AI could be transforming the practice.</p><p>Without the pressures of competition, will this technology be produce an even better audit? A succession of independent analyses have drawn attention to a systematic problems. Sir John Kingman in the review that I asked him to perform of the sector, the BEIS select committee in their report, the Financial Reporting Council itself and the CMA in its market study - excellent and dependable audit is a public good, the whole economy benefits from the fact that businesses choose to establish themselves in a jurisdiction in which confidence in audit is secured.</p><p>Capital is better allocated and at lower cost, the better quality information is.</p><p>The wide array of users of company accounts, not just shareholders but customers, suppliers, employees, places and civil society organisations too, can all the better rely on complex chains of interdependence when the quality of audit is good.</p><p>Solving the problem of audit quality can therefore bring great productivity benefits to the whole economy and make the UK an even better place to start and grow a business.</p><p>Competition should be central to that.</p><p>Company boards must have meaningful choice of auditors.</p><p>We cannot run the risk of systemic over-reliance on just a few firms that could reduce further.</p><p>The regulator needs to ensure that quality persists, despite the intrinsic problem of incentives in this market.</p><p>So I am pleased to have two important announcements to be able to make today. First, is to announce the appoint of Sir Jonathan Thompson as the new Chief Executive of the Financial Reporting Council. Many of you will know that he has been the recent head of HMRC, someone with a strong and rigorous record.</p><p>He will have the crucial task of transforming the organisation as it becomes the new and strengthened Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority, ARGA, created as recommended in Sir John Kingman\u2019s review.</p><p>And Second, I am publishing our consultation on the CMA\u2019s, in my view, powerful and compelling package of recommendations.</p><p>I believe that we need to act fast before another audit scandal makes headlines. I don\u2019t believe that we should wait for the review that I have asked Sir Donald Brydon to perform on the purpose of audit. Whatever the answer to that question, the mechanism to reach it will necessarily be delivered through a well-functioning market and a strong regulator.</p><p>But I would like to add this.</p><p>The audit sector should be in no doubt about the need and the resolve to make these reforms.</p><p>Audit quality must improve and we will do everything that\u2019s needed.</p><p>But the audit sector itself could do a great deal, now, voluntarily before any legislative change comes and I strongly urge them to do so.</p><p>It is right, it is good for the economy and it will give the sector much more credibility in helping shape the regime of the future.</p><p>Let me end as I started - with the weekend\u2019s sporting triumphs.</p><p>Here, according to the MCC\u2019s rulebook is how we come to know with confidence that last Sunday\u2019s score was actually the score that the umpires judged, and how cricket does its own version of audit, if you like. I quote:</p><p>\u201cTwo scorers shall be appointed to record all runs [\u2026] \u2026The scorers shall frequently check\u2026 \u2026to ensure that their records agree.</p><p>They shall agree with the umpires\u2026 \u2026at least at every interval [\u2026]</p><p>The scorers shall accept all instructions and signals\u2026 \u2026given to them by the umpires\u2026 \u2026and shall immediately acknowledge each separate signal.\u201d</p><p>It is subtle and instructive.</p><p>It is suited to the particulars of the problem being solved.</p><p>Like all rules that evolve to make competition really work, it embodies and distils volumes of collected experience, wisdom and judgement in practice.</p><p>And just as Britain has led the world in codifying the rules of sport, as well as occasionally, and satisfyingly, winning at them, here I must mention for completeness the third of the weekend\u2019s great sporting fixtures and salute the amazing performance of Lewis Hamilton at Silverstone.</p><p>We should have every confidence that we should continue to lead in many ways the similar task, and in which we have long had a world-leading, international reputation of codifying and keeping the most innovative in the world, the rules of market and competition. It\u2019s one of our strongest and proudest exports.</p><p>The CMA, our regulators, government, our Parliament and our people collectively have the knowledge, pragmatism and experience to be winners at the economically crucial, global competition to design the rules of competition.</p><p>Getting this right has a great prize attached, a Fourth Industrial Revolution with new technologies, new markets, new opportunities underpinned by confidence by consumers, by market participants. This is a future marked by prosperity for all, in all parts of the country.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2210035I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKY-CP51-F0YC-N3J4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4914\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 19, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNU3</classCode><className>SPORTING GOODS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001707</classCode><className>TENNIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N813990GM</classCode><className>SPORTS GOVERNING BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A0KP</classCode><className>TENNIS TOURNAMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D2JI</classCode><className>TRANSCRIPTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0009FYB</classCode><className>MATERIALS SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNU3</classCode><className>SPORTING GOODS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DNNA</classCode><className>BATTERIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001912</classCode><className>RETAIL &amp; WHOLESALE TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001878</classCode><className>SOLAR ENERGY</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDlCOTMzNzhGREJBNDJENEEyM0ZGMjVFODI5Nzc4NTE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUzODAyRDk1QzVFNEZGMEJDM0RGMDYxOTlEMEEzRDA</classCode><className>Solar Power Industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001693</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001694</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GX106</classCode><className>LONDON, ENGLAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The rule has had an 8-fold word-count increase.<br/><br/>The federation now pronounces on details going all the way from maximum dimensions to whether the racket can have communications equipment embedded within it.<br/><br/>From whether a player can use two rackets at the same time to whether a racket can carry a solar cell or battery. There's a serious point in all this. Tennis works as a competition because the ITF makes sure that the rules are kept up to date with changes that take place.<br/><br/>We the public are the ultimate beneficiaries of the wonders of sport at this level and we can enjoy the game decade after decade because the rules keep up with the technology.<br/><br/>To paraphrase The Leopard, if the game is to stay the same, everything must change.<br/><br/>And so, I want to argue today, the same is true for competition in the economy.<br/><br/>If we want to have rivalry, we want to continue to do the unrivalled good that competition has, in the past, done for our economy, we must constantly adapt its rules.<br/><br/>There are three main reasons that the rules of competition must change:<br/><br/>First, this is unfinished business from the recent past, we have got to make retail markets in regulated sectors - like energy, finance and telecoms - work consistently in the interests of all households.<br/><br/>Second, platforms, big tech, big data are, as everyone knows, disrupting the basic plumbing of markets and, despite the huge benefits they have brought, they sometimes create new forms of harm - especially for vulnerable consumers. Third, we have a productivity problem to solve and competition policy is one of the really powerful tools for improving the economic performance of firms.<br/><br/>All over the world, governments and competition authorities have seen that the promises made of the system, that was slowly built over the last 40 years with Britain leading the way consistently, has sometimes fallen short in the face of new threats.<br/><br/>In this talk, I'd like to take stock of what we've achieved in the last three years and to talk a bit about what needs to be done and to communicate why, in my view, it is so urgent we get on with this.<br/><br/>But before turning to each of these, allow me a brief, historical detour which I hope will show that government shaping of markets has always been with us, and needs to be approached without ideology - pro or contra - but in a pragmatic and empirical spirit.<br/><br/>You can go to the British Museum today and see a stamp of King Alfred's penny on a half-pound lead weight. It had been given the King's seal of approval, literally. You could buy your grain and the King vouched for the weight you'd get in exchange. And there's an obvious reason; Alfred needed to regulate markets.<br/><br/>Just imagine the Monty-Pythonesque scene of a market on the Mercia/Wessex border, circa 880AD, where the miller defends himself against a buyer claiming fraud.<br/><br/>He claims his weights are right. The baker offers another definition of the pound, and the butcher a third.<br/><br/>If you think mobile phone tariffs can be confusing, just imagine comparison when different suppliers don't agree on basic measures of minutes or gigabytes.<br/><br/>Regulation to make sure that competitive markets can even establish themselves has been the stuff of government forever.<br/><br/>Our complex modern economies work because we've been able to push away the boundaries of mistrust.<br/><br/>The extraordinary wealth that has been created and spread by national and international markets is underpinned by the countless rules and mechanisms of regulation. Much of it, from the joint stock company to food standards, backed by the force of law.<br/><br/>But that's not the only reason that Alfred had to regulate markets. It was also that by unifying Wessex, Anglia and Mercia, that he created a single market and so disrupted older patterns of exchange. And this was very good for all the reasons that we know - insurance, specialisation, etc.<br/><br/>But it also undermined some of the traditional social mechanisms in which trust was rooted. If you didn't know people in your town or village or wider area, then the traditional foundations of trust may not be adequate.<br/><br/>And so, regulation, again, filled the gap and allowed the new markets to flourish.<br/><br/>If good regulation does not accompany disruptions, then they can be resented, especially by those most reliant on those old social contexts.<br/><br/>This need to make new retail markets work for all fits, in many respects, the problem we have today.<br/><br/>I think of it as unfinished business of creating well-functioning consumer markets in the basic utility sectors that have been gradually deregulated over the last 40 years.<br/><br/>There have been some huge successes in this programme.<br/><br/>Technological disruption, driven by carefully constructed competition in telecoms, for example, has completely transformed our lives.<br/><br/>The same scale of transformation cannot yet be claimed for how we use gas, electricity or water.<br/><br/>The basic philosophy of utility deregulation in domestic retail markets was that we could eventually replicate the sorts of healthy, competitive markets that have evolved in essentials like food.<br/><br/>This was part of the broader new regulatory philosophy pioneered by Britain 40 years ago and copied all over the world.<br/><br/>The retail markets piece of this transformation still needs further development.<br/><br/>First, there's the relatively slow pace of basic innovation in some of these markets. Second, they have often settled into business models in which many consumers continue to be subjected to higher prices than can be justified, while a savvy minority benefit from very cheap deals.<br/><br/>The CMA called this to public attention with the problem of default tariffs in energy. Martin Cave, who wrote the dissenting minority opinion to the CMA report is here and now chairs Ofgem.<br/><br/>This recommendation to impose a retail price cap on default tariffs was made and Citizens Advice followed this up with, in my view, its very welcome \"Super-Complaint\" to the CMA, applying this argument to other markets.<br/><br/>Let me take this moment to thank the Social Market Foundation and James Kirkup, in particular for the traditions and the work that this organisation has done to advance our understanding of the issue and how we can tackle it.<br/><br/>The \"loyalty penalty\" has now been extensively analysed by the CMA and other regulators.<br/><br/>The numbers can be eye-watering.<br/><br/>A household inactive in all the markets studied risks being over-charged by \u00a31549 per year.<br/><br/>That is the same amount as the entire, annual discretionary spending of the poorest 10% of households, and often there is a close collaboration between the poorest and those who are paying higher.<br/><br/>This government has responded extremely supportively to the CMA's recommendations on the \"loyalty penalty\". Business and their regulators must find ways to end the worst effects of these business models and the companies involved should look to the energy industry as a proof of our seriousness in the lengths we need the regulators to go to.<br/><br/>Luring consumers onto cheap tariffs in the hope that many of them will fail to notice subsequent price rises should be seen as simply bad business.<br/><br/>Doing everything possible to confuse customers so they don't notice the rises is even worse. Protecting consumers from sharp practices has been a constant of Government in this country for centuries.<br/><br/>I've mentioned Alfred's standardisation of weights already. Another example comes in the medieval \"Assizes of Bread\". Specialist courts that made sure that bakers and millers were stopped from selling substandard product.<br/><br/>A home insurance company that gradually turns the screws, an energy company that price-walks you up the curve; they are earning their gains on a sort of asymmetry of power and information in which we have long intervened.<br/><br/>These are business practices that rely on undermining the trust of the consumer.<br/><br/>The markets that have really benefited from competition are the ones in which innovation, quality and price are the focus of corporate energies - not the invention of a new pricing practice.<br/><br/>If the notion generally takes hold that our utility markets are rife with this sort of behaviour then the entire legitimacy, it seems to me, of that sector suffers, and indeed, the whole economy suffers.<br/><br/>This is a point that has been very eloquently put on many occasions by Lord Andrew Tyrie, with us today, whom I was delighted to appoint to be Chair of the CMA. Andrew's work before he took up this position as Chair of the Treasury Select Committee between 2010 and 2017 was infused by this very preoccupation. The legitimacy of our financial system being threatened by some, small number of bad apples in finance. And there are places where the same can be true in other household sectors today.<br/><br/>So, when it came to the decision to appoint a new Chair to the CMA, I knew that Andrew's combination of passion for the wellbeing of ordinary working people, his rigorous thinking and his ever-effective drive - having experienced it the other side of the Treasure select committee, being subject to grilling's from Andrew, I can attest to the rigour of that and thought he was the ideal person for the task.<br/><br/>And I was delighted that he received the unanimous backing of the BEIS select committee.<br/><br/>Everything that I see coming from the CMA confirms in my view that Andrew was the right choice.<br/><br/>Under his watch, the CMA has made it very clear that it would concentrate efforts on tackling consumer harms. The pace of change has been remarkable. From unfair administrative charges in care homes to an investigation of the funeral business. From cleaning up the online-ticketing market to hard-to-reverse subscriptions in online games. From excessive pricing in pharmaceuticals to ensuring merger activity does not undermine lively competition in the retail sector.<br/><br/>These cases and more in the future, together with a welcome emphasis on strong public communication of the essential work that the CMA does, will both solve immediate problems and tell the general public that when it comes to their lives as consumers the CMA has their back.<br/><br/>For this, I'd also like - as well as thanking Andrew - to commend Andrea Coscelli, the CMA's Chief Executive whom I also appointed, and to all those in their organisation who have contributed to this excellent work.<br/><br/>Recognising that competition policy is foundational to our economy and society, the first thing I asked Andrew in his new post was for the CMA's recommendations on how we should reform the system itself.<br/><br/>A large number of proposals were put to me in a thoughtful and comprehensive letter that some of you may have seen.<br/><br/>Let me start by making three points of principle.<br/><br/>First, the CMA wants its primary duty to be to the welfare of consumers. I have to say that at a philosophical level, I entirely agree.<br/><br/>Competition should never be seen as an end in itself, except perhaps last Sunday when watching England win the cricket. But normally, it's as a means to thriving lives on the part of consumers.<br/><br/>Many of Andrew's proposals relate to this basic shift in principle and the exact package we opt for will be a very important question to address, and do so urgently.<br/><br/>Second, the CMA wants the enforcement of consumer law to be as effective as is the enforcement of competition law, and asks for new powers to be shared between itself and the sectoral regulators to make this a reality.<br/><br/>As I have said already, in our response to the CMA's loyalty penalty report, I agree with that too.<br/><br/>This will help not only with the \"unfinished business\" but will also allow us to shape the new digital markets.<br/><br/>Third, the CMA is very concerned that the speed of disruption in the economy, from digital markets and big data, means that the current machinery of competition enforcement is too slow.<br/><br/>It is no good taking a tech company through the courts over many years, when in the meantime another three relevant markets have tipped into a \"winner-takes-all\" state.<br/><br/>Again, I have no doubt that this is true in principle.<br/><br/>This takes me back to what I said earlier about King Alfred's need to regulate markets after the unification of markets in Wessex and Mercia.<br/><br/>Cyberspace is a glorious new space for markets, but it is not in the long-term interest of business or consumers for it to become a low-trust environment, quite the reverse.<br/><br/>Achieving greater speed and flexibility will require some of the solutions put forward by Jason Furman, especially more principles-based ex ante regulation of platforms.<br/><br/>It will also require the CMA to be able to act more swiftly and robustly ex post where it finds anti-competitive conduct.<br/><br/>And I agree with the CMA on this. What is needed now is to find a way of speeding up this work while maintaining the UK's unparalleled reputation for procedural fairness and legal rights.<br/><br/>Our reputation is enormously valuable in terms of business confidence, and it must always be maintained. And I have asked my department to prepare advice on the options we have on this.<br/><br/>I would like to emphasise that these issues are urgent. Consumer mistrust in the economy must not be allowed to grow to be higher.<br/><br/>The positions of platforms become more entrenched and every day we become more aware of some of the exploitative business practices that have become easy to spread.<br/><br/>The CMA has produced a menu of reform options. The Furman Review has added to them. Our Smart Data Review has committed to some of these and to Furman's central recommendation - the establishment of a Digital Markets Unit.<br/><br/>Today, I am adding to this by publishing our strategic steer to the CMA and the Competition Law Review, a piece of analytical work on the technical performance of the competition regime which will provide important research material for the wider changes ahead.<br/><br/>Now is the time for industry, the legal profession, economists, consumer groups, regulators and civil society to respond to these initiatives and proposals.<br/><br/>And in this, I also very much think that we need to understand the views of judges and the judiciary since the appeals system is such an important part of enforcement. That will put all elements in place for a new administration to decide how to act on these pressing matters.<br/><br/>The power of the CMA's request for tools that can be used at speed arises, of course, from the spectre haunting all markets today; the disruption that can be associated with big platforms, big tech and big data.<br/><br/>But what exactly is that spectre?<br/><br/>Many ordinary consumers feel the pinch of loyalty penalties in recently deregulated sectors, and very few consumers think of the offerings from Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Spotify, Uber, Deliveroo, Ocado or Netflix as anything other than a miraculous revolution in terms of ease, quality and price.<br/><br/>Hands up here who remembers navigating London with an A to Z? Jumping off the page and having to fumble around the index, the pages becoming detached from the binder, often having to pull over, work out where the join in the pages was and how you transfer over - repeat and repeat and arrive usually very arrive late to your destination. If I were to mention the A to Z to my children, they wouldn't know what I was talking about.<br/><br/>Transactional ease is off-the-scale in all sorts of markets compared to where we were, even fewer than 20 years ago.<br/><br/>And yet the CMA and Jason Furman, who led our review of competition between the Tech Giants, are right that the rules need to be considered and may need to change if competition is to perform its magic there too.<br/><br/>Consumers may not feel the pinch when they click on that link for a cheaper credit card, but the card-issuer who has to recover the \u00a3100 that this click cost them on the search engine certainly does and will have to recover the cost from consumers somehow.<br/><br/>The holiday-maker usually does not see any cost from booking the charming BB by the seaside through Trip-Advisor, but the couple who have to fork out the social media referral fees do have an interest in ensuring that market is competitive.<br/><br/>Do consumers have effective control over their data and is what is done with it ultimately in their own interest?<br/><br/>These various, potential harms are only just becoming headline news and we need to make sure that they do not drown out all the good that platforms have brought us and continue to bring us.<br/><br/>The CMA has just launched a much-needed market study into digital advertising and Professor Furman recommended that we establish a \"Digital Markets Unit\" that will work to establish and enforce ex ante the principles by which we must shape these markets.<br/><br/>I trust that the CMA's analysis will provide some of the knowledge needed to establish the Digital Markets Unit. Some will, no doubt, groan at the suspicion that Government is trying to control cyberspace. There is no scarcity online.<br/><br/>And that is the reverse of the intention because, it seems to me, that if people are unhappy with how some things are, we should be looking to make sure that level of trust and confidence is maintained. The vision of cyberspace has some connections with American frontier town of the late 19th Century. Cyberspace has followed, in some respects, a similar revolution. It was that very period of expansion and excitement brought with it some of the monopolies that gave rise that the development and the birth of anti-regulation as we know it.<br/><br/>The power of railroad monopolies in the US led to the birth of anti-trust and sometimes accompanied by populist policies. So we need to make sure that what may have characteristics in digital platforms that could run the risk of sapping innovation, squeezing businesses and raising the prices of goods anticipates some of the problems that may arise. But consumer choice is just a click away, one might think, so what kind of monopoly do the giants really have?<br/><br/>Here, I would just like to say that one of the best things to have happened in the understanding of markets in the last 10 years, and Martin Cave has written extensively on this, has been the rise of realistic views of how consumers actually behave and not just how they ought to behave.<br/><br/>In the unfinished business in consumer markets, as well as in the new challenges posed by the oligopolies, and potential oligopolies of cyberspace, we need to guard against an overly-narrow conception of economics that I think has been part of the problem. Something that economics itself, I think, has made great strides in recent days in recognising.<br/><br/>This is why I have asked, in my steer to the CMA that it makes sure that it update its methodological toolkit, so it's not just relying on the old economic tools.<br/><br/>New approaches that use huge, rich datasets, disciplines like behavioural economics, psychology and anthropology all have their part to play in understanding how markets actually work, rather than how regulators have too often hoped they would work.<br/><br/>The CMA and other future-facing regulators like the FCA, Ofgem and the CAA are embracing these new tools and methodologies. I strongly welcome that and hope to see much more still.<br/><br/>Let me now turn to competition and productivity.<br/><br/>There are roughly four ways that changing the conditions of competition affects productivity.<br/><br/>First there are the direct effects of competition eliminating unearned rents. Prices fall so the real amount each worker can buy with the value created by an hour of work increases. Our energy price cap, for example, means a single person on the minimum wage need work almost two days fewer to pay for their annual energy bill. This is a significant difference to many people in this country.<br/><br/>What's more, the people and equipment that were employed in the rent-seeking activity are liberated to do something more productive and that has knock-on effects. Taking unearned rents out of supply chains makes businesses that rely on those inputs more productive. They have more surplus to spread over capital and labour after all inputs have been covered.<br/><br/>But against all these positive effects there is a potentially trickier relationship between competition and productivity, and specifically, incentives to innovate. Historically, the link between competition and innovation can sometimes be a paradoxical one.<br/><br/>Patent law is meant to grant inventors temporary monopoly. In that respect, it is an \"anti-competition\" policy.<br/><br/>There are good arguments to be had about whether patent today is working as it should, but what is clear is that all of us benefit when innovators are rewarded in this way.<br/><br/>The Nobel prize-winning economist Bill Nordhaus estimated that innovators capture only about 3% of the value that they create. The rest, 97%, goes to society at large, for free. So, it's strongly in our interest to back and reward innovation.<br/><br/>That's why so many elements of our Industrial Strategy put an emphasis on aligning all the strengths of companies, universities and government agencies.<br/><br/>Innovation is so valuable that we're happy to see coordination being delivered through public RD investment, common Grand Challenges that bring together companies, universities, research institutions and businesses, sector deals to line-up the efforts providing common research centres, common infrastructure and investments in education.<br/><br/>And traditional merger control needs to consider this delicate balance between competition and coordination. When a big pharma company buys the minnow with a promising molecule for a spectacular sum is it helping to get a valuable product to market or is it taking out potential competition against something it has on its own lab-bench? In the first case, a merger authority should OK the deal. In the second, in my view, it should say no.<br/><br/>Jason Furman wondered about the same effect within Big Tech. When Facebook bought pre-revenue Instagram and WhatsApp for billions, which of these was it doing?<br/><br/>If the power of innovation is to be fully realised for the general good, our approach to mergers must now ask these hard and detailed questions.<br/><br/>I was very pleased to see the CMA doing so in its recent decision just last week to examine Amazon's investment in Deliveroo.<br/><br/>I'd like to finish this speech with some reflections on an absolutely foundational input which the CMA and this government have put a great deal of effort into improving, and that is audit. Again, one of the foundations of trust and reputation. Audit is the primary mechanism by which management's assessment of how a business is doing gets challenged, verified and made public.<br/><br/>We have reason, it seems to me, to have some concerns to be very concerned about the recent quality of audit, and to believe that this has wide repercussions on the performance of the whole economy.<br/><br/>There have been the high-profile failures that have made headlines. The BHS pension liability, Carillion, of course, and Patisserie Valerie.<br/><br/>But that's not all.<br/><br/>The Financial Reporting Council, our audit regulator, has just reported that one third of Price Waterhouse Cooper's audits of FTSE 350 companies failed to meet the standard of \"requiring only limited improvement\".<br/><br/>Grant Thornton did even worse with only 50% of audits passing that threshold.<br/><br/>Not a single top 4 firm met the FRC's standard for 90% of audits last year.<br/><br/>Perhaps, even more troubling from an assessment of the state of competition, the CMA found that, between 2014 and 2017 KPMG, for example, grew its market share while also scoring worst of the Big 4 in audit quality.<br/><br/>And yet audit is a sector that should be ripe for disruptive innovation. Big data and AI could be transforming the practice.<br/><br/>Without the pressures of competition, will this technology be produce an even better audit? A succession of independent analyses have drawn attention to a systematic problems. Sir John Kingman in the review that I asked him to perform of the sector, the BEIS select committee in their report, the Financial Reporting Council itself and the CMA in its market study - excellent and dependable audit is a public good, the whole economy benefits from the fact that businesses choose to establish themselves in a jurisdiction in which confidence in audit is secured.<br/><br/>Capital is better allocated and at lower cost, the better quality information is.<br/><br/>The wide array of users of company accounts, not just shareholders but customers, suppliers, employees, places and civil society organisations too, can all the better rely on complex chains of interdependence when the quality of audit is good.<br/><br/>Solving the problem of audit quality can therefore bring great productivity benefits to the whole economy and make the UK an even better place to start and grow a business.<br/><br/>Competition should be central to that.<br/><br/>Company boards must have meaningful choice of auditors.<br/><br/>We cannot run the risk of systemic over-reliance on just a few firms that could reduce further.<br/><br/>The regulator needs to ensure that quality persists, despite the intrinsic problem of incentives in this market.<br/><br/>So I am pleased to have two important announcements to be able to make today. First, is to announce the appoint of Sir Jonathan Thompson as the new Chief Executive of the Financial Reporting Council. Many of you will know that he has been the recent head of HMRC, someone with a strong and rigorous record.<br/><br/>He will have the crucial task of transforming the organisation as it becomes the new and strengthened Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority, ARGA, created as recommended in Sir John Kingman's review.<br/><br/>And Second, I am publishing our consultation on the CMA's, in my view, powerful and compelling package of recommendations.<br/><br/>I believe that we need to act fast before another audit scandal makes headlines. I don't believe that we should wait for the review that I have asked Sir Donald Brydon to perform on the purpose of audit. Whatever the answer to that question, the mechanism to reach it will necessarily be delivered through a well-functioning market and a strong regulator.<br/><br/>But I would like to add this.<br/><br/>The audit sector should be in no doubt about the need and the resolve to make these reforms.<br/><br/>Audit quality must improve and we will do everything that's needed.<br/><br/>But the audit sector itself could do a great deal, now, voluntarily before any legislative change comes and I strongly urge them to do so.<br/><br/>It is right, it is good for the economy and it will give the sector much more credibility in helping shape the regime of the future.<br/><br/>Let me end as I started - with the weekend's sporting triumphs.<br/><br/>Here, according to the MCC's rulebook is how we come to know with confidence that last Sunday's score was actually the score that the umpires judged, and how cricket does its own version of audit, if you like. I quote:<br/><br/>\"Two scorers shall be appointed to record all runs [...] ...The scorers shall frequently check... ...to ensure that their records agree.<br/><br/>They shall agree with the umpires... ...at least at every interval [...]<br/><br/>The scorers shall accept all instructions and signals... ...given to them by the umpires... ...and shall immediately acknowledge each separate signal.\"<br/><br/>It is subtle and instructive.<br/><br/>It is suited to the particulars of the problem being solved.<br/><br/>Like all rules that evolve to make competition really work, it embodies and distils volumes of collected experience, wisdom and judgement in practice.<br/><br/>And just as Britain has led the world in codifying the rules of sport, as well as occasionally, and satisfyingly, winning at them, here I must mention for completeness the third of the weekend's great sporting fixtures and salute the amazing performance of Lewis Hamilton at Silverstone.<br/><br/>We should have every confidence that we should continue to lead in many ways the similar task, and in which we have long had a world-leading, international reputation of codifying and keeping the most innovative in the world, the rules of market and competition.

The rule has had an 8-fold word-count increase.</p><p>The federation now pronounces on details going all the way from maximum dimensions to whether the racket can have communications equipment embedded within it.</p><p>From whether a player can use two rackets at the same time to whether a racket can carry a solar cell or battery. There's a serious point in all this. Tennis works as a competition because the ITF makes sure that the rules are kept up to date with changes that take place.</p><p>We the public are the ultimate beneficiaries of the wonders of sport at this level and we can enjoy the game decade after decade because the rules keep up with the technology.</p><p>To paraphrase The Leopard, if the game is to stay the same, everything must change.</p><p>And so, I want to argue today, the same is true for competition in the economy.</p><p>If we want to have rivalry, we want to continue to do the unrivalled good that competition has, in the past, done for our economy, we must constantly adapt its rules.</p><p>There are three main reasons that the rules of competition must change:</p><p>First, this is unfinished business from the recent past, we have got to make retail markets in regulated sectors - like energy, finance and telecoms work consistently in the interests of all households.</p><p>Second, platforms, big tech, big data are, as everyone knows, disrupting the basic plumbing of markets and, despite the huge benefits they have brought, they sometimes create new forms of harm especially for vulnerable consumers. Third, we have a productivity problem to solve and competition policy is one of the really powerful tools for improving the economic performance of firms.</p><p>All over the world, governments and competition authorities have seen that the promises made of the system, that was slowly built over the last 40 years with Britain leading the way consistently, has sometimes fallen short in the face of new threats.</p><p>In this talk, I'd like to take stock of what we've achieved in the last three years and to talk a bit about what needs to be done and to communicate why, in my view, it is so urgent we get on with this.</p><p>But before turning to each of these, allow me a brief, historical detour which I hope will show that government shaping of markets has always been with us, and needs to be approached without ideology - pro or contra but in a pragmatic and empirical spirit.</p><p>You can go to the British Museum today and see a stamp of King Alfred's penny on a half-pound lead weight. It had been given the King's seal of approval, literally. You could buy your grain and the King vouched for the weight you'd get in exchange. And there's an obvious reason; Alfred needed to regulate markets.</p><p>Just imagine the Monty-Pythonesque scene of a market on the Mercia/Wessex border, circa 880AD, where the miller defends himself against a buyer claiming fraud.</p><p>He claims his weights are right. The baker offers another definition of the pound, and the butcher a third.</p><p>If you think mobile phone tariffs can be confusing, just imagine comparison when different suppliers don't agree on basic measures of minutes or gigabytes.</p><p>Regulation to make sure that competitive markets can even establish themselves has been the stuff of government forever.</p><p>Our complex modern economies work because we've been able to push away the boundaries of mistrust.</p><p>The extraordinary wealth that has been created and spread by national and international markets is underpinned by the countless rules and mechanisms of regulation. Much of it, from the joint stock company to food standards, backed by the force of law.</p><p>But that's not the only reason that Alfred had to regulate markets. It was also that by unifying Wessex, Anglia and Mercia, that he created a single market and so disrupted older patterns of exchange. And this was very good for all the reasons that we know - insurance, specialisation, etc.</p><p>But it also undermined some of the traditional social mechanisms in which trust was rooted. If you didn't know people in your town or village or wider area, then the traditional foundations of trust may not be adequate.</p><p>And so, regulation, again, filled the gap and allowed the new markets to flourish.</p><p>If good regulation does not accompany disruptions, then they can be resented, especially by those most reliant on those old social contexts.</p><p>This need to make new retail markets work for all fits, in many respects, the problem we have today.</p><p>I think of it as unfinished business of creating well-functioning consumer markets in the basic utility sectors that have been gradually deregulated over the last 40 years.</p><p>There have been some huge successes in this programme.</p><p>Technological disruption, driven by carefully constructed competition in telecoms, for example, has completely transformed our lives.</p><p>The same scale of transformation cannot yet be claimed for how we use gas, electricity or water.</p><p>The basic philosophy of utility deregulation in domestic retail markets was that we could eventually replicate the sorts of healthy, competitive markets that have evolved in essentials like food.</p><p>This was part of the broader new regulatory philosophy pioneered by Britain 40 years ago and copied all over the world.</p><p>The retail markets piece of this transformation still needs further development.</p><p>First, there's the relatively slow pace of basic innovation in some of these markets. Second, they have often settled into business models in which many consumers continue to be subjected to higher prices than can be justified, while a savvy minority benefit from very cheap deals.</p><p>The CMA called this to public attention with the problem of default tariffs in energy. Martin Cave, who wrote the dissenting minority opinion to the CMA report is here and now chairs Ofgem.</p><p>This recommendation to impose a retail price cap on default tariffs was made and Citizens Advice followed this up with, in my view, its very welcome \"Super-Complaint\" to the CMA, applying this argument to other markets.</p><p>Let me take this moment to thank the Social Market Foundation and James Kirkup, in particular for the traditions and the work that this organisation has done to advance our understanding of the issue and how we can tackle it.</p><p>The \"loyalty penalty\" has now been extensively analysed by the CMA and other regulators.</p><p>The numbers can be eye-watering.</p><p>A household inactive in all the markets studied risks being over-charged by 1549 per year.</p><p>That is the same amount as the entire, annual discretionary spending of the poorest 10% of households, and often there is a close collaboration between the poorest and those who are paying higher.</p><p>This government has responded extremely supportively to the CMA's recommendations on the \"loyalty penalty\". Business and their regulators must find ways to end the worst effects of these business models and the companies involved should look to the energy industry as a proof of our seriousness in the lengths we need the regulators to go to.</p><p>Luring consumers onto cheap tariffs in the hope that many of them will fail to notice subsequent price rises should be seen as simply bad business.</p><p>Doing everything possible to confuse customers so they don't notice the rises is even worse. Protecting consumers from sharp practices has been a constant of Government in this country for centuries.</p><p>I've mentioned Alfred's standardisation of weights already. Another example comes in the medieval \"Assizes of Bread\". Specialist courts that made sure that bakers and millers were stopped from selling substandard product.</p><p>A home insurance company that gradually turns the screws, an energy company that price-walks you up the curve; they are earning their gains on a sort of asymmetry of power and information in which we have long intervened.</p><p>These are business practices that rely on undermining the trust of the consumer.</p><p>The markets that have really benefited from competition are the ones in which innovation, quality and price are the focus of corporate energies - not the invention of a new pricing practice.</p><p>If the notion generally takes hold that our utility markets are rife with this sort of behaviour then the entire legitimacy, it seems to me, of that sector suffers, and indeed, the whole economy suffers.</p><p>This is a point that has been very eloquently put on many occasions by Lord Andrew Tyrie, with us today, whom I was delighted to appoint to be Chair of the CMA. Andrew's work before he took up this position as Chair of the Treasury Select Committee between 2010 and 2017 was infused by this very preoccupation. The legitimacy of our financial system being threatened by some, small number of bad apples in finance. And there are places where the same can be true in other household sectors today.</p><p>So, when it came to the decision to appoint a new Chair to the CMA, I knew that Andrew's combination of passion for the wellbeing of ordinary working people, his rigorous thinking and his ever-effective drive having experienced it the other side of the Treasure select committee, being subject to grilling's from Andrew, I can attest to the rigour of that and thought he was the ideal person for the task.</p><p>And I was delighted that he received the unanimous backing of the BEIS select committee.</p><p>Everything that I see coming from the CMA confirms in my view that Andrew was the right choice.</p><p>Under his watch, the CMA has made it very clear that it would concentrate efforts on tackling consumer harms. The pace of change has been remarkable. From unfair administrative charges in care homes to an investigation of the funeral business. From cleaning up the online-ticketing market to hard-to-reverse subscriptions in online games. From excessive pricing in pharmaceuticals to ensuring merger activity does not undermine lively competition in the retail sector.</p><p>These cases and more in the future, together with a welcome emphasis on strong public communication of the essential work that the CMA does, will both solve immediate problems and tell the general public that when it comes to their lives as consumers the CMA has their back.</p><p>For this, I'd also like as well as thanking Andrew to commend Andrea Coscelli, the CMA's Chief Executive whom I also appointed, and to all those in their organisation who have contributed to this excellent work.</p><p>Recognising that competition policy is foundational to our economy and society, the first thing I asked Andrew in his new post was for the CMA's recommendations on how we should reform the system itself.</p><p>A large number of proposals were put to me in a thoughtful and comprehensive letter that some of you may have seen.</p><p>Let me start by making three points of principle.</p><p>First, the CMA wants its primary duty to be to the welfare of consumers. I have to say that at a philosophical level, I entirely agree.</p><p>Competition should never be seen as an end in itself, except perhaps last Sunday when watching England win the cricket. But normally, it's as a means to thriving lives on the part of consumers.</p><p>Many of Andrew's proposals relate to this basic shift in principle and the exact package we opt for will be a very important question to address, and do so urgently.</p><p>Second, the CMA wants the enforcement of consumer law to be as effective as is the enforcement of competition law, and asks for new powers to be shared between itself and the sectoral regulators to make this a reality.</p><p>As I have said already, in our response to the CMA's loyalty penalty report, I agree with that too.</p><p>This will help not only with the \"unfinished business\" but will also allow us to shape the new digital markets.</p><p>Third, the CMA is very concerned that the speed of disruption in the economy, from digital markets and big data, means that the current machinery of competition enforcement is too slow.</p><p>It is no good taking a tech company through the courts over many years, when in the meantime another three relevant markets have tipped into a \"winner-takes-all\" state.</p><p>Again, I have no doubt that this is true in principle.</p><p>This takes me back to what I said earlier about King Alfred's need to regulate markets after the unification of markets in Wessex and Mercia.</p><p>Cyberspace is a glorious new space for markets, but it is not in the long-term interest of business or consumers for it to become a low-trust environment, quite the reverse.</p><p>Achieving greater speed and flexibility will require some of the solutions put forward by Jason Furman, especially more principles-based ex ante regulation of platforms.</p><p>It will also require the CMA to be able to act more swiftly and robustly ex post where it finds anti-competitive conduct.</p><p>And I agree with the CMA on this. What is needed now is to find a way of speeding up this work while maintaining the UK's unparalleled reputation for procedural fairness and legal rights.</p><p>Our reputation is enormously valuable in terms of business confidence, and it must always be maintained. And I have asked my department to prepare advice on the options we have on this.</p><p>I would like to emphasise that these issues are urgent. Consumer mistrust in the economy must not be allowed to grow to be higher.</p><p>The positions of platforms become more entrenched and every day we become more aware of some of the exploitative business practices that have become easy to spread.</p><p>The CMA has produced a menu of reform options. The Furman Review has added to them. Our Smart Data Review has committed to some of these and to Furman's central recommendation - the establishment of a Digital Markets Unit.</p><p>Today, I am adding to this by publishing our strategic steer to the CMA and the Competition Law Review, a piece of analytical work on the technical performance of the competition regime which will provide important research material for the wider changes ahead.</p><p>Now is the time for industry, the legal profession, economists, consumer groups, regulators and civil society to respond to these initiatives and proposals.</p><p>And in this, I also very much think that we need to understand the views of judges and the judiciary since the appeals system is such an important part of enforcement. That will put all elements in place for a new administration to decide how to act on these pressing matters.</p><p>The power of the CMA's request for tools that can be used at speed arises, of course, from the spectre haunting all markets today; the disruption that can be associated with big platforms, big tech and big data.</p><p>But what exactly is that spectre?</p><p>Many ordinary consumers feel the pinch of loyalty penalties in recently deregulated sectors, and very few consumers think of the offerings from Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Spotify, Uber, Deliveroo, Ocado or Netflix as anything other than a miraculous revolution in terms of ease, quality and price.</p><p>Hands up here who remembers navigating London with an A to Z? Jumping off the page and having to fumble around the index, the pages becoming detached from the binder, often having to pull over, work out where the join in the pages was and how you transfer over - repeat and repeat and arrive usually very arrive late to your destination. If I were to mention the A to Z to my children, they wouldn't know what I was talking about.</p><p>Transactional ease is off-the-scale in all sorts of markets compared to where we were, even fewer than 20 years ago.</p><p>And yet the CMA and Jason Furman, who led our review of competition between the Tech Giants, are right that the rules need to be considered and may need to change if competition is to perform its magic there too.</p><p>Consumers may not feel the pinch when they click on that link for a cheaper credit card, but the card-issuer who has to recover the 100 that this click cost them on the search engine certainly does and will have to recover the cost from consumers somehow.</p><p>The holiday-maker usually does not see any cost from booking the charming BandB by the seaside through Trip-Advisor, but the couple who have to fork out the social media referral fees do have an interest in ensuring that market is competitive.</p><p>Do consumers have effective control over their data and is what is done with it ultimately in their own interest?</p><p>These various, potential harms are only just becoming headline news and we need to make sure that they do not drown out all the good that platforms have brought us and continue to bring us.</p><p>The CMA has just launched a much-needed market study into digital advertising and Professor Furman recommended that we establish a \"Digital Markets Unit\" that will work to establish and enforce ex ante the principles by which we must shape these markets.</p><p>I trust that the CMA's analysis will provide some of the knowledge needed to establish the Digital Markets Unit. Some will, no doubt, groan at the suspicion that Government is trying to control cyberspace. There is no scarcity online.</p><p>And that is the reverse of the intention because, it seems to me, that if people are unhappy with how some things are, we should be looking to make sure that level of trust and confidence is maintained. The vision of cyberspace has some connections with American frontier town of the late 19th Century. Cyberspace has followed, in some respects, a similar revolution. It was that very period of expansion and excitement brought with it some of the monopolies that gave rise that the development and the birth of anti-regulation as we know it.</p><p>The power of railroad monopolies in the US led to the birth of anti-trust and sometimes accompanied by populist policies. So we need to make sure that what may have characteristics in digital platforms that could run the risk of sapping innovation, squeezing businesses and raising the prices of goods anticipates some of the problems that may arise. But consumer choice is just a click away, one might think, so what kind of monopoly do the giants really have?</p><p>Here, I would just like to say that one of the best things to have happened in the understanding of markets in the last 10 years, and Martin Cave has written extensively on this, has been the rise of realistic views of how consumers actually behave and not just how they ought to behave.</p><p>In the unfinished business in consumer markets, as well as in the new challenges posed by the oligopolies, and potential oligopolies of cyberspace, we need to guard against an overly-narrow conception of economics that I think has been part of the problem. Something that economics itself, I think, has made great strides in recent days in recognising.</p><p>This is why I have asked, in my steer to the CMA that it makes sure that it update its methodological toolkit, so it's not just relying on the old economic tools.</p><p>New approaches that use huge, rich datasets, disciplines like behavioural economics, psychology and anthropology all have their part to play in understanding how markets actually work, rather than how regulators have too often hoped they would work.</p><p>The CMA and other future-facing regulators like the FCA, Ofgem and the CAA are embracing these new tools and methodologies. I strongly welcome that and hope to see much more still.</p><p>Let me now turn to competition and productivity.</p><p>There are roughly four ways that changing the conditions of competition affects productivity.</p><p>First there are the direct effects of competition eliminating unearned rents. Prices fall so the real amount each worker can buy with the value created by an hour of work increases. Our energy price cap, for example, means a single person on the minimum wage need work almost two days fewer to pay for their annual energy bill. This is a significant difference to many people in this country.</p><p>What's more, the people and equipment that were employed in the rent-seeking activity are liberated to do something more productive and that has knock-on effects. Taking unearned rents out of supply chains makes businesses that rely on those inputs more productive. They have more surplus to spread over capital and labour after all inputs have been covered.</p><p>But against all these positive effects there is a potentially trickier relationship between competition and productivity, and specifically, incentives to innovate. Historically, the link between competition and innovation can sometimes be a paradoxical one.</p><p>Patent law is meant to grant inventors temporary monopoly. In that respect, it is an \"anti-competition\" policy.</p><p>There are good arguments to be had about whether patent today is working as it should, but what is clear is that all of us benefit when innovators are rewarded in this way.</p><p>The Nobel prize-winning economist Bill Nordhaus estimated that innovators capture only about 3% of the value that they create. The rest, 97%, goes to society at large, for free. So, it's strongly in our interest to back and reward innovation.</p><p>That's why so many elements of our Industrial Strategy put an emphasis on aligning all the strengths of companies, universities and government agencies.</p><p>Innovation is so valuable that we're happy to see coordination being delivered through public RandD investment, common Grand Challenges that bring together companies, universities, research institutions and businesses, sector deals to line-up the efforts providing common research centres, common infrastructure and investments in education.</p><p>And traditional merger control needs to consider this delicate balance between competition and coordination. When a big pharma company buys the minnow with a promising molecule for a spectacular sum is it helping to get a valuable product to market or is it taking out potential competition against something it has on its own lab-bench? In the first case, a merger authority should OK the deal. In the second, in my view, it should say no.</p><p>Jason Furman wondered about the same effect within Big Tech. When Facebook bought pre-revenue Instagram and WhatsApp for billions, which of these was it doing?</p><p>If the power of innovation is to be fully realised for the general good, our approach to mergers must now ask these hard and detailed questions.</p><p>I was very pleased to see the CMA doing so in its recent decision just last week to examine Amazon's investment in Deliveroo.</p><p>I'd like to finish this speech with some reflections on an absolutely foundational input which the CMA and this government have put a great deal of effort into improving, and that is audit. Again, one of the foundations of trust and reputation. Audit is the primary mechanism by which management's assessment of how a business is doing gets challenged, verified and made public.</p><p>We have reason, it seems to me, to have some concerns to be very concerned about the recent quality of audit, and to believe that this has wide repercussions on the performance of the whole economy.</p><p>There have been the high-profile failures that have made headlines. The BHS pension liability, Carillion, of course, and Patisserie Valerie.</p><p>But that's not all.</p><p>The Financial Reporting Council, our audit regulator, has just reported that one third of Price Waterhouse Cooper's audits of FTSE 350 companies failed to meet the standard of \"requiring only limited improvement\".</p><p>Grant Thornton did even worse with only 50% of audits passing that threshold.</p><p>Not a single top 4 firm met the FRC's standard for 90% of audits last year.</p><p>Perhaps, even more troubling from an assessment of the state of competition, the CMA found that, between 2014 and 2017 KPMG, for example, grew its market share while also scoring worst of the Big 4 in audit quality.</p><p>And yet audit is a sector that should be ripe for disruptive innovation. Big data and AI could be transforming the practice.</p><p>Without the pressures of competition, will this technology be produce an even better audit? A succession of independent analyses have drawn attention to a systematic problems. Sir John Kingman in the review that I asked him to perform of the sector, the BEIS select committee in their report, the Financial Reporting Council itself and the CMA in its market study - excellent and dependable audit is a public good, the whole economy benefits from the fact that businesses choose to establish themselves in a jurisdiction in which confidence in audit is secured.</p><p>Capital is better allocated and at lower cost, the better quality information is.</p><p>The wide array of users of company accounts, not just shareholders but customers, suppliers, employees, places and civil society organisations too, can all the better rely on complex chains of interdependence when the quality of audit is good.</p><p>Solving the problem of audit quality can therefore bring great productivity benefits to the whole economy and make the UK an even better place to start and grow a business.</p><p>Competition should be central to that.</p><p>Company boards must have meaningful choice of auditors.</p><p>We cannot run the risk of systemic over-reliance on just a few firms that could reduce further.</p><p>The regulator needs to ensure that quality persists, despite the intrinsic problem of incentives in this market.</p><p>So I am pleased to have two important announcements to be able to make today. First, is to announce the appoint of Sir Jonathan Thompson as the new Chief Executive of the Financial Reporting Council. Many of you will know that he has been the recent head of HMRC, someone with a strong and rigorous record.</p><p>He will have the crucial task of transforming the organisation as it becomes the new and strengthened Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority, ARGA, created as recommended in Sir John Kingman's review.</p><p>And Second, I am publishing our consultation on the CMA's, in my view, powerful and compelling package of recommendations.</p><p>I believe that we need to act fast before another audit scandal makes headlines. I don't believe that we should wait for the review that I have asked Sir Donald Brydon to perform on the purpose of audit. Whatever the answer to that question, the mechanism to reach it will necessarily be delivered through a well-functioning market and a strong regulator.</p><p>But I would like to add this.</p><p>The audit sector should be in no doubt about the need and the resolve to make these reforms.</p><p>Audit quality must improve and we will do everything that's needed.</p><p>But the audit sector itself could do a great deal, now, voluntarily before any legislative change comes and I strongly urge them to do so.</p><p>It is right, it is good for the economy and it will give the sector much more credibility in helping shape the regime of the future.</p><p>Let me end as I started - with the weekend's sporting triumphs.</p><p>Here, according to the MCC's rulebook is how we come to know with confidence that last Sunday's score was actually the score that the umpires judged, and how cricket does its own version of audit, if you like. I quote:</p><p>\"Two scorers shall be appointed to record all runs [...] ...The scorers shall frequently check... ...to ensure that their records agree.</p><p>They shall agree with the umpires... ...at least at every interval [...]</p><p>The scorers shall accept all instructions and signals... ...given to them by the umpires... ...and shall immediately acknowledge each separate signal.\"</p><p>It is subtle and instructive.</p><p>It is suited to the particulars of the problem being solved.</p><p>Like all rules that evolve to make competition really work, it embodies and distils volumes of collected experience, wisdom and judgement in practice.</p><p>And just as Britain has led the world in codifying the rules of sport, as well as occasionally, and satisfyingly, winning at them, here I must mention for completeness the third of the weekend's great sporting fixtures and salute the amazing performance of Lewis Hamilton at Silverstone.</p><p>We should have every confidence that we should continue to lead in many ways the similar task, and in which we have long had a world-leading, international reputation of codifying and keeping the most innovative in the world, the rules of market and competition. It's one of our strongest and proudest exports.</p><p>The CMA, our regulators, government, our Parliament and our people collectively have the knowledge, pragmatism and experience to be winners at the economically crucial, global competition to design the rules of competition.</p><p>Getting this right has a great prize attached, a Fourth Industrial Revolution with new technologies, new markets, new opportunities underpinned by confidence by consumers, by market participants. This is a future marked by prosperity for all, in all parts of the country.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123074551</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKV-DXP1-JCBF-S3CV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4940\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>INTERNATIONAL TENNIS FEDERATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNU3</classCode><className>SPORTING GOODS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001707</classCode><className>TENNIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N813990GM</classCode><className>SPORTS GOVERNING BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A0KP</classCode><className>TENNIS TOURNAMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D2JI</classCode><className>TRANSCRIPTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0009FYB</classCode><className>MATERIALS SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNU3</classCode><className>SPORTING GOODS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001912</classCode><className>RETAIL &amp; WHOLESALE TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001693</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DNNA</classCode><className>BATTERIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001878</classCode><className>SOLAR ENERGY</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDlCOTMzNzhGREJBNDJENEEyM0ZGMjVFODI5Nzc4NTE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUzODAyRDk1QzVFNEZGMEJDM0RGMDYxOTlEMEEzRDA</classCode><className>Solar Power Industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>STX001694</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GX106</classCode><className>LONDON, ENGLAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/07/03/uk-competition-watchdog-probe-facebook-googles-digital-dominance/\">investigation of digital markets</url>, due to be announced this week, is rightly near the top of the in tray for the new government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This work is so fundamental to the future of all kinds of businesses that it is hard to overstate its importance. The dominant online players - Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon - are constantly expanding into more aspects of life and commerce.</p><p>In places, the harm they cause is obvious. They sometimes act as platforms for bullies, terrorists, criminals and disinformation. The Government has already proposed new regulations to tackle such negligence, but it is the CMA's investigation that offers the best chance of getting to the root of the problem.</p><p>Many of the worst aspects of the internet and Big Tech are a result of the incentives baked into the opaque and uncompetitive digital advertising supply chain. Facebook and Google dominate, and the systems they have built reward quantity over quality, both in terms of online content and its audience. As middlemen they hoover up too much of the money advertisers spend.</p><p>These systems were also built by takeovers, particularly in Google's case. Though it came to dominate the consumer search market by investing in innovation and providing a superior service, its advertising technology, where the money is made, was assembled by acquisitions.</p><p>If competition watchdogs, led by the CMA's determined chief executive Andrea Coscelli, can find a way to open the industry to competition, we will be on the road to redemption. When Facebook and Google are forced to compete in a fair market, causing harm and getting away with it will be a lot more difficult.</p><p>This will of course be massively challenging work for competition watchdogs around the world, even as they form alliances. Tax authorities have found how difficult it is to make global tech pay its fair share and the lobbying against measures that threaten their market stranglehold will be just as fierce.</p><p>Intervention must be weighed against the risk of unintended consequences, but the balance has long since tipped too far in favour of Big Tech. People built these systems, and it cannot be beyond the wit of humanity to bring them under control.</p><p>                     No more waiting for steel deal                   </p><p>Barring a last-minute surprise, it looks like the sale of British Steel to the Chinese bidder Jingye is at risk.This represents an early chance for the empowered Conservative Party to prove its value to its new friends in the North.</p><p>Scunthorpe, home of British Steel, was in the Labour \"red wall\". Now it is represented by Holly Mumby-Croft, a local councillor. Her senior colleagues in government must make agreeing a realistic solution for British Steel an urgent priority. It is a grim reality of our recent politics that Scunthorpe's biggest employer has been in limbo partly because of Westminster's paralysis.</p><p>Two exotic bidders - little-known Jingye and Turkey's military pension fund - were selected as preferred bidders; both failed to execute their plans. Hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money has been used to prop up the business.</p><p>Meanwhile Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty House, already heavily invested in what remains of the steel industry and partner of the Scunthorpe works, has been held at bay by ministers.</p><p>Despite Gupta's racy dealmaking of the last few years, which must be a concern, it seems there is nobody better positioned to make a go of British Steel for the long term.</p><p>It is hard to escape the suspicion that there have been some quite cynical politics in play.</p><p>Gupta's turnaround plan, unlike the Chinese and Turks, is said by Whitehall sources to involve immediate pain - job losses. It therefore might have been hard for Tories to claim a 6,451 majority in Scunthorpe had they done a deal with Liberty House before the election. Regardless, the time to end the uncertainty for British Steel and the people of Scunthorpe is now.</p><p>                     Aftershocks ahead for big business                   </p><p>The cliche \"political earthquake\" is well-worn for a reason. This weekend it is doing a good job of describing the seismic shock and tectonic shift that occurred. Jeremy Corbyn must feel like his house has fallen down, or at least he ought to.</p><p>The metaphor also works on a deeper level that should give many businesses pause. The thing about earthquakes is if you live on a faultline they keep happening. Britain and much of the wider world have for years been drifting towards fractures in political and economic systems built in the second half of the last century.</p><p>Johnson's decisive victory in former industrial heartlands is part of a pattern, not an isolated event.</p><p>To assume that the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/07/03/uk-competition-watchdog-probe-facebook-googles-digital-dominance/\">Conservatives' thumping majority</url> means calm will fall over the land, that Brexit might not really mean Brexit and that predictability will return to our political economy seems to deny what are now mountains of rubble from successive tremors.</p><p>Such bias towards the mean will nevertheless be tempting for big corporates and the business elite.</p><p>Instead, they should draw the obvious conclusion that the ground is now shifting constantly and adjust to the risks and opportunities.</p><p>Regressive threats such as nationalisation are gone but real reform in new and unexpected directions is back on the agenda. These are revolutionary times, just very much not as imagined by Corbyn.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-58687409</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRH-2F11-JCJY-G1V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"956\"/><timeReceived>8:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 14, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

These companies may be big and have high market share, but they also offer many services for free, innovate rapidly, and compete vigorously against one another.</p><p>\"Other concerns about big technology companies, including privacy, content moderation, election influence, and even general economic inequality, don't have anything to do with U.S. antitrust law. Unfortunately, that won't stop lawmakers from grandstanding on those emotionally charged issues to score political points - and lay the groundwork for legislation expanding antitrust regulation and spur calls for regulation from the companies' competitors. All this would be to the detriment of the American consumer.\"</p><p>Patrick Hedger, research fellow:</p><p>\"All four companies represented at the hearing compete with one another in countless ways. They all also compete with Microsoft across multiple market segments, a $1.5 trillion company not represented at the hearing. This all goes to show that the conventional antitrust case against these firms does not apply, and the House hearing amounts to an attempt to 'MacGyver' antitrust law to meet other political objectives. Conservatives should not grant legitimacy to this charade, or they will regret the day when antitrust law is used to bludgeon industries into adopting the progressive agenda.\"</p><p>Wayne Crews, vice president for policy and senior fellow:</p><p>\"Congress has no business pressuring media outlets, social media platforms, or the public to promote or curtail politically disfavored viewpoints. Congress's duty is to ensure the First Amendment freedom of competing viewpoints and not allow government to decide what constitutes 'harmful content' and shut down discourse.\"</p><p>[Category: Economics]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7191657 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7191657</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-36V1-JC11-14JW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"427\"/><timeReceived>8:51 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

On so-called Net Neutrality regulations, CEI opposed government interference into technology that was supported by big tech and social media companies because we believe those regulations would harm competitiveness, innovation and, ultimately, consumers. The regulations would obliterate property rights for millions of shareholders in the massive capital investments made to build communications networks and ultimately put power in the hands of government proctors to decide what we see, hear, read, and share on those networks.</p><p>\"For more than 35 years, CEI has advocated against antitrust regulation and advocated free markets rooted in consumer sovereignty. 'Truly competitive markets are inherently free markets, unrestrained by antitrust regulators second-guessing valid business decisions,' CEI senior policy analyst Jule R. Herbert, Jr. wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled 'An Antitrust Route to Re-regulation,' on July 26, 1985. CEI's consistent opposition to antitrust predates many companies that may seem dominant today. A simple search for 'antitrust' on cei.org shows hundreds of publications, commentaries, and media citations criticizing antitrust. It is a legitimate and widely held position undeserving of drive-by smears. Two years before CEI was established in 1984, CEI's founder, Fred L. Smith, Jr., wrote a lengthy analysis titled 'Why Not Abolish Antitrust?', building a persuasive case against antitrust law.</p><p>\"CEI has always sought reform of our nation's regulatory system to promote economic liberty, opportunity, and prosperity and is directed independently by our policy experts and managers, not by outside interests. We proudly seek out allies who share our values and policy priorities, and that includes individuals, businesses, and foundations. And we do not change our positions on public policy issues to suit the politics of the day or please the occupants of powerful offices whose whims can have profound negative effects on American families.\"</p><p>[Category: Economics]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6972244 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6972244</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVN-98B1-DYG2-R2C1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"494\"/><timeReceived>1:17 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 21, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

These companies should be left to innovate and serve consumers as creatively, quickly, and as innovatively as needed./9</p><p>Yet, as large tech companies try to adapt to this new environment, they may hesitate about certain innovations for fear of running afoul of antitrust rules. This provides no benefit to consumers. Therefore, this is no time to hobble tech companies with esoteric regulatory concerns./10</p><p>The real cost of antitrust is the innovation it prevents. The risk of precluding advances, synergies, and solutions that could prove critical to a struggling economy and a stressed people is too high to justify these investigations.</p><p>It is not just a chilling effect on innovative ideas and arrangements that can impair these companies, but also the time and energy required to comply with information requests. For instance, in response to a 48-state investigation led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, Google had provided more than 100,000 pages of information by mid-April 2020.11 Forcing tech companies to use their large, but still limited resources to comply with paperwork requests of myriad antitrust investigations is counterproductive at a time when the company's customers need them most.</p><p>Price Gouging. Price gouging is not typically an antitrust issue, but it has become one during the coronavirus crisis. On March 9, Attorney General William Barr announced:</p><p>\"The Department of Justice stands ready to make sure that bad actors do not take advantage of emergency response efforts, healthcare providers, or the American people during this crucial time.\"12 In addition to federal warnings, 36 states already have price gouging legislation on their books.13</p><p>Other states are considering similar legislation as part of their coronavirus response. There have also been calls for federal price gouging legislation, most prominently from Amazon Vice President for Public Policy Brian Huseman./14</p><p>Such legislation is a bad idea for several reasons. These go well beyond the typical \"price controls make shortages worse\" argument that is taught to every first-year economics undergraduate--and forgotten by many policy makers.</p><p>Non-Regulatory Responses. Calls for price gouging legislation show a lack of creativity. Many companies have already developed effective ways to fight price gouging without regulation. Amazon's Huseman writes, \"We deploy dynamic automated technology to proactively seek out and pull down unreasonably priced offers, and we have a dedicated team focused on identifying and investigating unfairly priced products that are now in high demand, such as protective masks and hand sanitizer.\"/15</p><p>Company-level policies are also more adaptable than federal policies as technology and market circumstances change.</p><p>In fact, anti-price gouging technology could be a profitable business opportunity. If Amazon is not already doing so, it could license or sell its anti-price gouging technology to competitors for a profit. A startup with a killer app for use by online retailers could make a lot of money. Federal price gouging legislation would largely end this competitive behavior--precisely the opposite of antitrust regulators' stated goal.</p><p>Moreover, regulations are made by the government we have, not the government we want. Amazon's technology and in-house policies are almost certainly more effective than what Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi, or Mitch McConnell would enact during an election year that also features a pandemic and civil unrest. The legislation would be enforced by a politicized Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, overseen by a president who frequently threatens legal action against Amazon and other high-profile businesses he dislikes.</p><p>Social Norms. Calls for legislation also ignore the power of social norms. Early in the pandemic, brothers Matt and Noah Colvin drove around Tennessee and Kentucky and bought up 17,700 bottles of sanitizer to try to sell on Amazon for as much as $70 each. Amazon barred them within a day. eBay went further, forbidding all sales of hand sanitizer and masks./16</p><p>Tennessee state authorities got involved, but their actions were likely not necessary. The Colvins managed to avoid being charged and donated all of their stockpiled supplies to nonprofits free of charge./17</p><p>The public shaming that ensued when their actions became public was enough to convince them to stop stockpiling emergency supplies.</p><p>Rent-Seeking. Rent-seeking is economists' term for using government for unfair advantage./18</p><p>Price gouging legislation would allow Amazon and other large companies to raise rivals' costs without having to improve their own offerings.</p><p>One of the strongest arguments against antitrust regulation is that it creates major rent-seeking opportunities./19</p><p>Big companies routinely game the rules to thwart competition. Price gouging legislation is another example of the same rent-seeking process. There is a reason why established companies often favor new regulations--the rules usually keep out competitors. Price gouging regulations are no exception.</p><p>Short-Term Thinking. Amazon's call for a price gouging bill might be part of a larger effort to get itself out of antitrust cross-hairs. But using price gouging legislation as a distraction tactic would only work temporarily. Those who favor expanding antitrust enforcement would gladly accept the price gouging bill, then continue their antitrust campaign the same as before. Both Amazon and the competitive process itself would be better served by avoiding short-term appeasement tactics.</p><p>Other Factors. The timing is as bad as the idea itself. Retail sales declines set new records for two months in a row in March and April, as people locked down nationwide. Despite bouncebacks in subsequent months, spending was still well below pre-COVID levels as of this writing./20</p><p>Retailers have enough to deal with without having to spend resources complying with new rules their competitors helped to write.</p><p>There is a federalism angle, as well. A federal rule would undermine federalism by imposing standards on more than a dozen states that explicitly do not want them.</p><p>Mergers and Acquisitions Are Rarely Anti-Consumer or Anticompetitive. An idea gaining traction among Congressional Democrats is a moratorium on large-scale mergers and acquisitions. In late April, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) announced the Pandemic Anti-Monopoly Act. The bill, among other things, would put a hold on all mergers and acquisitions requiring disclosure to the FTC./21</p><p>Rep. Ocasio-Cortez claims, \"With less competition, the whole country will see job loss and higher costs for consumers.\"/22</p><p>Other congressional Democrats have sent letters to the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department urging officials to halt mergers and acquisitions between major firms that have received government assistance under the various coronavirus-related economic relief laws./23</p><p>A ban on mergers and acquisitions during the coronavirus crisis is unnecessary and would only delay the economic recovery. As FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips told the New York Times:</p><p>[T]here is no evidence that the antitrust agencies are overwhelmed by filings. The Premerger Notification Office estimates a nearly 60 percent reduction in reported transactions during the past month, compared with the historical average. That is consistent with press reports indicating that M.&amp;A. activity is down dramatically because of this crisis. Transactions reported to the F.T.C. also dropped off a cliff during the last recession. The market is funny like that./24</p><p>Mergers and acquisitions are simply another form of investment. In the same way that individual investors can provide needed capital and other resources to struggling businesses, saving jobs, as well as products and services for consumers, mergers and acquisitions do much of the same. A ban on investment, particularly in the middle of an economic crisis, would invite disaster. Mergers and acquisitions are not only a source of new capital, they free up other resources that can go toward serving consumers or developing new products.</p><p>Mergers and acquisitions also enable businesses to achieve economies of scale and other efficiencies. For example, companies that merge may no longer need separate offices or warehouses, so the cost savings can be redirected toward expanding production or service in other areas. In addition, companies that offer different but complementary products and services can combine to provide consumers with a wider range of options and cost savings.</p><p>A good example of the benefits of economies of scale arising from mergers and acquisitions is Facebook's acquisition of Instagram. Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion. At the time, Instagram had just 13 employees/25 and roughly 30 million users./26</p><p>Five years later, Instagram had grown to 450 employees--and undoubtedly many more today./27</p><p>The platform now has over 1 billion users and is valued at over $100 billion./28</p><p>The combined companies can now offer users different, but complementary social media experiences while offering their customers, mostly advertisers, a wider range of products.</p><p>Ultimately, Facebook's decision to purchase Instagram was not about eliminating Instagram as a would-be competitor, but rather to allow Facebook to compete more effectively with its existing rivals. As CNBC reported at the time:</p><p>Several former Facebook employees with knowledge of the Instagram acquisition tell CNBC that the company did not purchase the mobile app to squash a would-be competitor. Rather, the former employees argue, Facebook at the time was much smaller and fending off what threatened to be fierce competition from Twitter, which had already bid for Instagram, and Google's new social network./29</p><p>As this story demonstrates, the extent of competition in the market is not determined by the number of competitors, but by the ability of competitors to challenge one another. Competition quality is far more important than competition quantity.</p><p>Another recent merger illustrates this as well. Mobile carriers Sprint and T-Mobile completed a merger in April 2020. Of the four major carriers in the U.S., Sprint and TMobile were the fourth and third largest, respectively, well behind AT&amp;T and Verizon. AT&amp;T and Verizon have around 150 million subscribers each, compared to T-Mobile's 80 million and Sprint's 50 million./30</p><p>Yet the combined T-Mobile/Sprint boasts a respectable 130 million subscribers, making the company a much more viable competitor to both AT&amp;T and Verizon. What's more, Sprint was unlikely to have survived without a merger, so AT&amp;T and Verizon would have been left with only each other and T-Mobile as viable competitors, with T-Mobile still well behind in terms of subscribers./31</p><p>Healthy competition is not just about bolstering existing competitors, however.</p><p>Exit Promotes Entry. Mergers and acquisitions play a critical role in fostering new market entrants. What attracts entrepreneurs and investors to a given market is the expectation that their hard work and investments will be rewarded one day. Mergers and acquisitions are a key element of that risk/reward structure. Regulations have made public stock offerings increasingly difficult for small and medium-sized firms./32</p><p>The prospect of being bought out by major players in a given market plays an increasingly important role in encouraging investors and entrepreneurs to get into the market in the first place.</p><p>A 2004 academic study that looked at market entry in the banking sector following mergers and acquisitions concluded:</p><p>Our findings are strongly consistent with the hypothesis that M&amp;As are associated with subsequent increases in the probability of entry into the markets in which the M&amp;As occur. The results are both statistically and economically significant. /33</p><p>Relevant to the COVID-19 crisis, there are several examples of significant market entrance during past recessions. Tech giants of today, such as Microsoft, Uber, Airbnb, Venmo, and Square, among others, were all founded during recessions./34</p><p>The companies set to challenge today's major incumbent firms in the future are being founded today. The avenues by which these nascent firms entice prospective and transformational investors must not be closed off.</p><p>Don't Expand Antitrust. The U.S. standard for antitrust law is consumer harm. With prices for many of big tech's services and products at zero, continued innovation in the industry, and companies competing vigorously for consumers' attention, it is hard to imagine the investigations currently underway at the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the House Judiciary Committee, and nearly every state attorney general finding evidence of customers being harmed./35</p><p>So, with little chance of proving illegal monopoly power or consumer harm, some advocates have argued for expanding antitrust enforcement to include data practices, privacy concerns, competitor interests, the environment, economic inequality, and political power, among other sundry causes./36</p><p>That expansion would represent a return to the chaos that antitrust law wreaked on the U.S. economy for much of the 20th century, yielding the opposite of progress for consumers and businesses. The U.S. already ran the experiment of antitrust trying to serve more than one master when it tried to both serve consumers and protect competitors. Antitrust law was full of contradictory court decisions and internal conflicts, and often resulted in protecting competitors over consumers./37</p><p>Furthermore, there is little evidence of dangerous market concentration or insufficient competition in U.S. digital markets. As a recent letter by 23 prominent economists, legal scholars, and practitioners sent to the House Judiciary Committee notes: 6 [T]he weight of the literature today--much of which is no more than a couple years old and some of which is still in working paper form--does not support the conclusion that the economy has been trending inexorably toward increased market power and greater consumer harm, especially for the purpose of justifying dramatic legislative changes to the antitrust framework./38</p><p>The authors cite several economic analyses that reach similar conclusions.39 With little economic evidence of a problem, legislators and agency regulators should reject this expansion of antitrust laws beyond the consumer harm standard. To do otherwise invites compromising consumer welfare and encouraging corporate welfare and rent seeking.</p><p>Conclusion. Antitrust investigations at the federal and state level should be suspended during the COVID-19 crisis and, ideally, abandoned permanently. The unintended consequences of market distortion and chilled innovation are the last thing consumers and businesses need right now--or ever. This is no time for politicians and government lawyers to promote their own careers through the posturing of antitrust enforcement. Consumer benefit and business resiliency must be preserved and antitrust enforcement must not be prioritized or expanded.</p><p>* * *</p><p>STUDY and ENDNOTES: <url normalizedValue=\"https://cei.org/sites/default/files/Ryan_Young_Repeal_NeverNeeded_Antitrust_Laws.pdf\">https://cei.org/sites/default/files/Ryan_Young_Repeal_NeverNeeded_Antitrust_Laws.pdf</url></p><p>[Category: Economics]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7247941 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7247941</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XT-VNH1-DYG2-R4TM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2720\"/><timeReceived>11:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 26, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In anew paper released today, Competitive Enterprise Institute experts encourage lawmakers at the federal and state levels to go further with deregulation efforts in order to spur innovation and opportunity.</p><p>\"Policy makers at the federal, state, and local level have acted swiftly to suspend many regulations that stood in the way of responding to and recovering from the COVID-19 crisis. Now they should take the next step and make those suspensions permanent,\" said paper lead author andassociate director of CEI's Center for Technology and InnovationJessica Melugin. \"Removing rules that serve as obstacles for entrepreneurs looking to adapt their business to the new, post-pandemic reality will only encourage innovation and aid our recovery.\"</p><p>In the latest contribution to CEI's project identifying and removing #NeverNeeded regulations, Melugin, senior fellows Michelle Minton andJohn Berlau, and research fellows Patrick Hedger and Sean Higgins identify several policy areas where permanent deregulation would help economic recovery, including:</p><p>* Suspend Internet Sales Taxes. Small online businesses are struggling to survive during the COVID-19 crisis, despite offering customers a safe way to get goods and services during a deadly pandemic. Suspending or eliminating burdensome state sales tax laws would ease the compliance burden for small online businesses while also providing much-needed tax relief to consumers during difficult economic times.</p><p>* Allow Online Sales and Delivery of Legal but Prohibited Items.Some states have rules prohibiting delivery of alcohol, while others ban delivery of certain tobacco products. Since it is necessary to encourage people to stay at home during the pandemic, all such restrictions should be lifted to allow consumers to safely obtain these legal products.</p><p>* Repeal Price Controls for Debit Cards and Do Not Extend them to Credit Cards. Credit and debit cards have played a critical role in the COVID-19 crisis, allowing consumers to purchase goods and services while minimizing their interactions with merchants. The Dodd-Frank law's Durbin Amendment slapped price controls on fees banks and credit unions charge retailers to process debit card purchases. Unable to charge the full cost of processing transactions, banks and credit unions pass the additional costs onto the consumer. Repealing the price controls on debit card fees, and keeping them away from credit cards, will save consumers' hard-earned money in trying times.</p><p>* Allow Flexible Contracting Work Arrangements. Supporters of laws like California's AB5 claim reclassifying contractors as \"employees\" is intended to protect struggling workers. But in reality, many Californians have found the law actually limits their ability to find work at all - and a bad situation has only been made worse during the COVID-19 crisis. California should repeal AB5, or at least suspend it during the crisis to encourage hiring. Other states and the federal government should avoid passing such counterproductive mandates.</p><p>* End Antitrust Investigations of Successful Tech Companies.Large, innovative tech companies have been invaluable during the COVID-19 crisis, easing the burden of millions of Americans and businesses under quarantine. Unfortunately, politicians on both sides of the aisle see political advantage in trying to \"break up big tech.\" The Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Congress, and many state attorneys general are pursuing antitrust investigations into Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon, casting a destructive shadow of uncertainty over an industry that has proven critical to life during the pandemic. The U.S. standard for antitrust law is consumer harm and the current crisis has proven these companies are a huge benefit to American consumers and businesses. With little chance of proving consumer harm, regulators have argued expanding antitrust enforcement to cover data practices, privacy concerns, and the supposed interests of competing business interests rather than consumers. Policy makers should reject this expansion of antitrust laws beyond the consumer welfare standard and lift the shadow of uncertainty over important American innovators.</p><p>Read the whole report: Repeal of #NeverNeeded Regulations Can Help People Stay Home and Safe During the COVID-19 Crisis (<url normalizedValue=\"https://cei.org/content/repeal-neverneeded-regulations-can-help-people-stay-home-and-safe-during-covid-19-crisis\">https://cei.org/content/repeal-neverneeded-regulations-can-help-people-stay-home-and-safe-during-covid-19-crisis</url>)</p><p>For more on CEI's #NeverNeeded campaign, please visit neverneeded.cei.org.</p><p>[Category: Economics]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7185015 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7185015</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DT-7Y91-DYG2-R1YD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"909\"/><timeReceived>8:52 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Broadband Internet allows people to work from home with relatively little disruption. Electronic payments enable faster online ordering and contactless delivery of needed items, from groceries to prescriptions to takeout meals. Navigation apps allow delivery drivers to navigate their routes much more quickly and efficiently, while flexible hours make it possible to adjust schedules as needed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lawmakers should look to remove barriers to innovation that could yield even greater benefits. Federal and state policy makers have suspended regulations that could hinder response to the crisis. They should go further and make many of those suspensions permanent. Following are some key areas where they should focus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Suspend Internet Sales Taxes. Online small businesses are struggling to survive during the economic shutdown. These retailers provide a safe way to get customers what they need, but they are faced with burdensome state sales tax compliance.[1] Federal and state governments should remove these tax collection obligations for the sake of small online sellers and the consumers who benefit from them staying in business.</p><p>Suspension of state-level taxes for the duration of the coronavirus health crisis would lift the compliance burden on already strained companies. A remote sales tax holiday would encourage Americans to opt for the safer option of buying online, rather than visiting a retailer in person. Now is the time to focus on lightening the load for small businesses and ensuring the physical safety of citizens, not filling the coffers of revenue-hungry states.</p><p>The 2018 South Dakota v. Wayfair Supreme Court decision reversed decades of precedent by allowing states to collect sales taxes on online purchases from businesses located outside their borders. This was a blow to the federalist principle of tax competition.[2] It also has proven to be a practical nightmare for many small and medium-sized businesses that sell online.[3] Compliance costs are burdensome. Figuring out tax obligations in 10,000 distinct taxing jurisdictions--each with its own rates, definitions, and exemptions--is expensive and time-consuming. This problem will only get worse as more small businesses increase their presence online to compensate for shuttered physical locations.[4]</p><p>Federal lawmakers should consider preemption if states do not take action. Congress should pass legislation that prevents states from exporting their sales tax regime to businesses located wholly in other states.[5] An origin-based system preserves the principle of \"no taxation without representation,\" encourages healthy tax competition among the states, and is based on sound constitutional principles.[6] This approach goes from preferable to critical in the current economic environment.</p><p>Allow Online Sales and Delivery of Legal but Prohibited Items. Some states have regulations forbidding delivery of alcohol, others of tobacco products, and there are many other prohibitions of online sales. As it is necessary to encourage people to stay at home, all such restrictions should be lifted.</p><p>Across the country, state and local governments are setting aside rules that ordinarily bar direct delivery of certain products. States like Maryland have temporarily lifted rules that would ordinarily prohibit businesses that make and sell alcoholic beverages from delivering directly to homes.[7] Such allowances are pragmatic attempts to sustain non-essential businesses forced to close, as well as to encourage compliance with social distancing. In Pennsylvania, for example, where all 600 state-controlled liquor stores have been shut down and online sales remain prohibited, residents have been driving to neighboring states to purchase alcohol.[8]</p><p>States have shown less pragmatism with regards to tobacco. While combustible cigarettes remain available for purchase, as they are often sold at establishments deemed essential like supermarkets and gas stations, many consumers are finding themselves suddenly cut off from the lower-risk tobacco alternatives they previously relied on to stay smoke-free. For the most part, vapor shops, which sell non-combustible e-cigarettes, have not been deemed essential. At least six states currently prohibit e-cigarette sellers from delivering devices or liquids directly to residences.[9] Furthermore, federal lawmakers are urging the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ban all e-cigarette sales nationally during the coronavirus outbreak.[10]</p><p>Such policies do not benefit public health under normal circumstances and could prove disastrous during the current pandemic. At worst, e-cigarettes may pose about 5 percent of the risk associated with smoking traditional cigarettes and, according to clinical trials, are at least twice as effective for smoking cessation than other methods.[11]</p><p>Bans on online sales and direct-to-consumer delivery of products that can help reduce the likelihood of smoking-related illness and death for smokers who switch also perpetuate existing health disparities. Smokers at lower socioeconomic levels and disadvantaged populations remain less likely to switch to these reduced-risk products.[12]</p><p>This is likely due to the higher initial cost of purchasing e-cigarettes, as well as the increasingly limited number of outlets selling vapor products. Such hurdles can be insurmountable for those with fewer resources like money, time, or transportation, as well as those who have lower mobility or live in rural areas or on reservations. As a result, many individuals in these populations continue to smoke at disproportionately high rates. The lockdowns, which have shuttered the few retail outlets allowed to sell e-cigarettes, will only exacerbate these problems, leading some existing smokers to continue with their deadly habit and some who had successfully switched to vaping to return to smoking. Worse, unable to obtain vapor products through legal means, some may turn to illicit and foreign sources of dubious quality and safety.</p><p>States that have not already done so ought to immediately lift restrictions on Internet sales and direct-to-consumer delivery of age-restricted products during the coronavirus crisis. Furthermore, they should work to ensure these policies remain in effect after social distancing policies end.</p><p>Repeal Price Controls for Debit Cards and Do Not Extend Them to Credit Cards. Credit and debit cards have played essential roles for countless families during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown by enabling payments for delivery and pickup of groceries and medical products, while minimizing contact between merchants and customers. But, unfortunately, thanks in large part to a destructive provision of Dodd-Frank financial overhaul of 2010, many Americans lack access to the banks and credit unions that issue these payment cards.</p><p>Dodd-Frank's Durbin Amendment, sponsored by then-Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), slapped price controls on the interchange fees that banks and credit unions charge retailers to process debit card purchases. Under the measure, debit card issuers must charge prices the Federal Reserve defines as \"reasonable and proportional to the cost.\" In addition, fees may only cover \"incremental costs,\" a definition that leaves out most fixed costs like computer hardware and software used to process card transactions.</p><p>The Durbin Amendment has resulted in a major windfall for the big retail firms that lobbied for it, such as Walmart, Walgreens, and Home Depot. A Home Depot executive bragged on a 2012 stock analysts' conference call that price controls could add up to $35 million per year to the chain's bottom line.[13]</p><p>The Durbin Amendment restricts banks and credit unions to recouping only \"incremental costs\" in the debit card fees they charge to retailers. That means they cannot recoup from retailers the full cost of many retail debit card transactions. So who pays these costs? Consumers, who have seen costs shifted to them in the form of reduced benefits, fewer free checking account options, and higher fees at banks and credit unions. And data show that the poorest consumers have paid the biggest price.</p><p>In 2009, the year before Dodd-Frank was enacted, 76 percent of checking accounts were free of charge. By 2011, that share had fallen to 45 percent, and by 2012 to 39 percent.[14] Service charges on non-interest-bearing checking accounts have also increased dramatically. A 2014 George Mason University study calculates that the Durbin Amendment contributed to 1 million Americans losing access to the banking system--becoming \"unbanked\"--by 2011.[15]</p><p>Retailers that lobbied for the Durbin Amendment said it would result in savings that would be passed on to consumers, but those savings turned out to be miniscule or nonexistent. Even accounting for some lower prices in highly competitive markets, the public still suffered a net welfare loss of $22 to $25 billion. The amount lost in free checking and imposition of new bank fees exceeded any gains from lower retail prices, according to a 2015 study published in the Oxford Review of Law and Economics.[16]</p><p>Even in normal times, the lack of access to a payment card imposes severe hardship and inconvenience, such as always having to carry cash to make purchases. During crises such as the current one, when stores are closed or have sharply reduced hours, it can literally be an issue of survival, as those without payment cards are locked out of digital purchases. Congress should repeal or at least substantially relax the Durbin Amendment price controls for debit cards, and resist calls from retailer trade associations to extend these price controls to credit cards.[17]</p><p>Allow Permissionless Innovation in Development of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain. When Bitcoin launched as the first cryptocurrency more than a decade ago, it looked like its most valued feature would be its ability to serve as an alternative to central bank currency, especially for people worried about inflation in the wake of massive quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve. Today, given the Fed's actions--which dwarf those of the 2008 financial crisis, but may be more justifiable because of the many businesses and individuals hit by something that was not their fault--there still is some desire to hedge potentially debased national currencies.</p><p>Today, when the public and policy makers are looking to move money faster, cryptocurrencies' potential to enable faster payments may be their biggest draw. The development of \"stablecoins,\" such as Tether and the Facebook-developed Libra, that can be denominated in a single national currency can lower the costs of payment processing for businesses and consumers. It can also increase financial inclusion for the unbanked and underbanked who are currently locked out of digital transactions (though, as noted, government interventions like the Durbin Amendment substantially contributed to the lack of banking access).</p><p>And blockchain technology, initially created as a distributed ledger to record cryptocurrency transactions, may have multiple beneficial uses in the pandemic and recovery. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, blockchain technology was already being utilized in countless new ways, from medical recordkeeping to land titling.[18] Now people are finding many ways that blockchain can be part of the solution to defeat COVID-19. For instance, scholars at Aston University in Birmingham, U.K., are researching a blockchain application to verify that medical equipment came from legitimate factories and is not defective.[19]</p><p>As it did with the development of the Internet, the government should adopt a hands-off approach that can foster an atmosphere of permissionless innovation for electronic payments. Cryptocurrency and blockchain creators should not be burdened by red tape in developing technologies that could greatly contribute to public health and economic recovery. The Securities and Exchange Commission should quit asserting jurisdiction where it has none by claiming that cryptocurrencies should be registered as securities.[20] Congress should pursue bipartisan legislation to create a less intrusive tax and regulatory regime for these technologies.[21]</p><p>Allow Flexible Contracting Work Arrangements. Supporters of California's AB-5 law contend that it is meant to protect struggling workers by ensuring that they are all classified as \"employees,\" not contractors. But many Californians have found that the law limits their ability to find work--and the situation has gotten worse during the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>Since COVID-19 put the country under lockdown, people have turned to app-based companies such as DoorDash, Postmates, and UberEats to get daily essentials like food and prescription drugs. To beleaguered businesses, contractor delivery workers offer a lifeline to stay open and even a way to find new customers. For people left without work, they offer a short-term way to make ends meet. Other people have been able to earn extra cash.</p><p>Californians have not been as lucky, since AB-5 restricts this type of work in numerous ways.[22] The law's supporters have claimed that the \"gig economy\" model had nothing to do with flexibility and was just a convenient excuse to exploit workers and shirk responsibilities, like paying Social Security and payroll taxes, unemployment insurance, and other state and federal requirements.[23]</p><p>In theory, this helped people if they were working jobs full-time for one company. However, those workers represent only a fraction of the ones doing the gig economy jobs. It is little help for the majority of people who only want to work when they need to and do not plan to do it long-term. And limiting freelance work is particularly perverse if workers themselves want to be on their own, or are forced to because of the virus.</p><p>In an open letter to Governor Gavin Newsom, economists and political scientists from across the state's colleges and universities called for AB-5 to be suspended. \"Hiring laws, especially for firms with more than 50 employees, mean that companies are unwilling to make long-term commitments to traditional jobs. We aren't sure what our economic needs and capacities are going to be even two months from now. But hiring someone in a traditional job, with hours and benefit requirements, is too expensive to contemplate given that employers do not know whether they will be able to fill any permanent jobs at all and, if so, when,\" they noted.[24] Social media cites like Twitter were filled with pleas from Californians seeking relief.[25]</p><p>The Golden State's unemployment rate was an estimated 24.4 percent in March.[26] That is nearly 10 percentage points above the national rate of 14.7 percent, in April.[27] How much of that was AB-5's fault is hard to gauge, but the law certainly has not resulted in more hiring--and the national unemployment rate has only continued to increase. To enable more effective responses to the crisis, policy makers should work to allow flexible work arrangements that both enable people to make ends meet while providing access to individual goods and services. State lawmakers should avoid laws like AB5--and California should at least suspend it during the crisis. At the federal level, Congress should not include AB5-style labor provisions in any future COVID-19 relief legislation.</p><p>End Antitrust Investigation of Successful Tech Companies. Big tech has been invaluable in easing the burden of quarantine for millions of consumers[28] and businesses.[29] Unfortunately, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, Congress,[30] and many state attorneys general are continuing their antitrust investigations[31] into major tech firms like Google,[32] Facebook,[33] Apple[34] and Amazon.[35] Such open-ended investigations cast a destructive shadow of uncertainty over a sector that has proven critical in this crisis.</p><p>Facebook helping keep people stay in touch, Apple providing apps for curbside pickup from small businesses, Amazon's deliveries, and Google's tools for keeping informed are all enormously beneficial to consumers. These companies should be left to innovate and serve consumers as creatively, quickly, and as innovatively as needed.[36] Yet, as large tech companies try to adapt to this new environment, they may hesitate about certain innovations for fear of running afoul of antitrust rules. This is no benefit to consumers and no time to hobble tech companies with esoteric regulatory concerns.[37]</p><p>The real cost of antitrust regulation is the innovation it prevents. The risk of precluding advances, synergies, and solutions that could prove critical to a struggling economy and a stressed people is too high to justify these investigations.</p><p>It is not just a chilling effect on innovative ideas and arrangements that can impair these companies, but also the time and energy required to comply with information requests. For instance, in response to a 48-state investigation led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, Google had provided more than 100,000 pages of information by mid-April 2020.[38] Forcing tech companies to use their large, but still limited, resources to comply with paperwork requests of myriad antitrust investigations is counterproductive at a time when the company's customers need them most.</p><p>The U.S. standard for antitrust law is consumer harm. With prices for many of big tech's services and products at zero, continuing strong innovation in the industry, and companies competing for consumers' attention, it is hard to imagine any of these investigations finding evidence of customers being harmed.[39] Antitrust regulators often point to barriers to entry as proof of monopoly power. But the meteoric success of Zoom clearly shows that barriers to entry are low in the tech sector. The startup's newfound dominance of video conferencing renders accusations of big tech holding widespread monopoly power unpersuasive.</p><p>So, with little chance of proving illegal monopoly power or consumer harm, regulators have argued for expanding antitrust enforcement to include data practices, privacy concerns, and the interests of competitors over consumers.[40] That would represent a return to the chaos that antitrust law wreaked on the U.S. economy for much of the 20th century, yielding the opposite of progress for consumers and businesses. Legislators and agency regulators should reject this expansion of antitrust laws beyond the consumer welfare standard.</p><p>Antitrust investigations at the federal and state level should be suspended during the crisis and, ideally, abandoned permanently. The unintended consequences of market distortion and chilled innovation are the last thing consumers and businesses need right now. This is no time for politicians and government lawyers to promote their own careers through antitrust enforcement. Consumer benefit and business resiliency must be paramount.</p><p>Ensure Commercial Access to Spectrum. The Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) grant of Special Temporary Authority to AT&amp;T and Verizon to use spectrum to help meet Americans' wireless broadband needs during the COVID-19 crisis suggests that there is a need to move more spectrum into private hands.[41] That would mean fewer spectrum bands sitting idle, designated for government agency use. Regulatory underbrush at the FCC has put American on a spectrum diet and that is suboptimal even in the best of times, but is even more harmful in a crisis. The FCC should push more spectrum into commercial use with property rights-based arrangements as quickly as possible.</p><p>A major part of the future of the economy, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been the increasing integration of the Internet into more and more devices and machines forming the \"Internet of Things.\" From new powerful handheld smart devices to large machines like driverless cars, an Internet of Things requires strong, safe, and reliable wireless connections. Wireless connections require well-allocated spectrum channels to ensure sufficient signal strength and prevent signals from interfering with one another.</p><p>This is not some far-off reality we can prepare for tomorrow. Today, millions of Americans working remotely or taking on new gig economy jobs rely more than ever on laptop computers connected through Wi-Fi spectrum and smartphones connected through cellular spectrum. Spectrum capacity is also needed to beam wireless broadband to rural and underserved communities that desperately need to stay connected in a world of social distancing.</p><p>The problem is twofold. First, unlike many resources, we simply cannot create more spectrum. This means spectrum policy must be singularly focused on improving the efficiency of its use. Second, virtually all spectrum has been allocated to either a commercial or government use.[42] This means creating new spectrum capacity for growth areas requires shifting or otherwise accommodating incumbents.</p><p>The most efficient way to allocate scarce resources with alternative uses is through markets, price signals, and property rights. The ability to do this with spectrum is limited because the federal government effectively nationalized spectrum in the 1920s and his since allocated it in ways that make potential market-based reallocation more difficult.[43] Government-issued licenses are now the closest thing to property rights in spectrum. In addition, the government has allowed various unlicensed uses of spectrum by certain technologies, constrained by various regulations in order to prevent interference.</p><p>Assuming there will not be a radical shift in this paradigm, there are a few things the government can do to ensure more spectrum is put to use into private hands and used in more economically efficient ways.</p><p>Congress must help clear regulatory uncertainty that exists with regards to spectrum allocation. Under current law, the FCC administers non-federal spectrum while the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) administers federal spectrum.[44] However, the FCC has final say on all spectrum allocation, private or public.[45] Federal agencies are supposed to coordinate their spectrum issues through NTIA, which subsequently coordinates with the FCC. Yet, there have been several recent cases of agencies flouting this system, openly feuding with the FCC in the media and before Congress, and ultimately delaying the reallocation of underutilized federally allocated spectrum to private uses.[46] First and foremost, Congress should work to end this increasingly untenable situation.</p><p>This confusion occurs because of the dearth of market mechanisms in spectrum allocation. Federal agencies that are incumbent spectrum holders face little to no incentive to help facilitate reallocation. Congress can change this.</p><p>First, agencies should be required, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, NTIA, and the FCC to include a value on the spectrum licenses they hold in their annual budgets. Subsequently, the fees charged to each federal agency should be made commensurate with the assessed value of the spectrum. Currently, federal agencies pay just $122 dollars for each assigned frequency they hold.[47] Finally, federal agencies, working with the FCC should be allowed to sell or sublease the licenses they hold to private sector actors.</p><p>Greater commercial access to spectrum will spur major investment in new products and services that harness wireless technology and the network infrastructure that powers them. This investment is not only critical for jumpstarting the post-COVID-19 economy, but also for hardening it against future crises.</p><p>Allow the Development of Private Tech Infrastructure. A major area of growth and investment after the crisis will likely involve products and services that allow more economic activity to move permanently online. As a result, the consequences of the digital divide--the gap between those Americans with reliable high-speed Internet access and those without--will only grow wider. The knee-jerk response to this will be to spend on subsidized or government-owned broadband networks.[48] Such a response will be a drain on needed private-sector investment.</p><p>The federal government already spends billions of dollars annually and automatically on broadband deployment. According to the Congressional Research Service, these programs spent a combined $9.1 billion in 2018.[49] The Federal Communications Commission, which administers roughly 90 percent of this spending through the Universal Service Fund (USF), is already in the process of restructuring broadband spending to ensure it does not lead to what is known as \"overbuilding\" and that such funds only go to truly unserved areas.[50]</p><p>Dr. Mark A. Jamison, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, explained the overbuilding problem in testimony before the Senate last year:</p><p>It is normal in competitive markets for rivals to duplicate each other's infrastructure. This duplication is important for rivals to be able to compete for customers and for companies to test alternative services for the future. This duplication of infrastructure can be wasteful at best, and perhaps even destructive, when the government is subsidizing one of the providers.[51]</p><p>Overbuilding harms investment because private networks struggle with, and often choose not to compete against, subsidized or government-owned networks, which always can afford to undercut competition--ultimately leaving consumers without options if and when service suffers.</p><p>If current programs, such as the USF, already need restructuring to prevent overbuilding, haphazard stimulus funds present a substantial risk of this problem.</p><p>The correct solution is to either clear away or harmonize state and local regulations that impede the ability of private providers to deploy infrastructure to underserved areas. Whether a company is deploying fixed broadband networks, such as cable or fiber, erecting towers for wireless cellular and broadband service, or installing a dense network or small cells for Fifth Generation (5G) cellular service, there are common things they must do. This includes complying with local right-of-way access regulations, utility pole attachment rates, and historical and environmental reviews. Yet these things can vary not just from state to state but from technology to technology.[52]</p><p>These disparities in regulatory treatment--from state to state and even locality to locality across differing, but competing technologies--poses a major impediment to investment and efforts just to close the digital divide and to provide consumers with competitive options in the event that existing providers' service suffers.</p><p>To the extent that access regulations and reviews are necessary, they should be subject to strict cost caps and fixed time periods for review. These measures help potential market entrants approach new infrastructure investments with greater certainty. They further prevent local laws from having impacts on Internet service beyond their borders. A company forced to expend excessive resources in one market will likely divert those resources from serving another.</p><p>The Internet, also known as the World Wide Web, is fundamentally an interstate service, thus warranting federal regulatory oversight. The FCC has already made substantial efforts toward reducing and standardizing local regulatory burdens to 5G deployment.[53] In addition, the FCC recently intervened to prevent state and local governments from exploiting cable franchise rules in ways that harm broadband deployment.[54] The federal government should continue to explore areas where differing but competitive technologies are subject to unnecessary and disparate treatment and work to preempt such rules.</p><p>Finally, a major deterrent to broadband investment has been the specter of \"net neutrality\" regulation. Previously, the federal government sought to implement the amorphous concept of net neutrality through public utility-style regulation of Internet service providers (ISPs). The implementation of this regulatory change had a devastating effect on broadband infrastructure investment. Investment has since rebounded following the reversal of these rules in 2017.[55]</p><p>Despite the federal reversal, several states have begun promulgating their own net neutrality rules.[56] However, a recent ruling at the D.C. Circuit Court largely upheld the FCC's power to preempt state net neutrality laws, albeit on a case-by-case basis rather than via a blanket preemption.[57] Regardless, even if such state laws are likely to be successfully preempted by the federal government, they can still cause unneeded delays and uncertainty when it comes to broadband investment. States should cease pursuing these laws. Further, Congress should enact legislation with blanket preemption of state net neutrality laws while enshrining the existing regulatory status of ISPs as reestablished in 2017.</p><p>Conclusion. An effective response to the COVID-19 crisis requires finding ways to make it easier for people to stay at home. That means facilitating ways to work, shop, and access information and entertainment while sheltering in place. The private sector, especially technology firms, have made great strides in that regard. Government should allow them to continue to do so by removing as many regulatory barriers to innovation as possible.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>[1] Eric Boehm, \"The Supreme Court's Online Sales Tax Ruling Is Already a Hug Headache for Small Businesses, Reason, March 19, 2019,</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://reason.com/2019/03/19/the-supreme-courts-online-sales-tax-ruli/\">https://reason.com/2019/03/19/the-supreme-courts-online-sales-tax-ruli/</url>.</p><p>[2] Jessica Melugin, \"Online Sales Taxes Make Government Bigger and Undermine Federalism,\" Web Memo No. 42, Competitive Enterprise Institute, March 15, 2018,</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cei.org/content/online-sales-taxes-make-government-bigger-and-undermine-federalism\">https://cei.org/content/online-sales-taxes-make-government-bigger-and-undermine-federalism</url>.</p><p>[3] Ruth Simon, \"Sales-Tax Ruling Strains Small Online Sellers,\" Wall Street Journal, December 29, 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/sales-tax-ruling-strains-small-online-sellers-11577615401\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/sales-tax-ruling-strains-small-online-sellers-11577615401</url>.</p><p>[4] Tatiana Walk-Morris, \"EBay Pledges $100M to Help Small Businesses Move Online,\" RetailDive, April 6, 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.retaildive.com/news/ebay-pledges-100m-to-help-small-businesses-move-online/575462/\">https://www.retaildive.com/news/ebay-pledges-100m-to-help-small-businesses-move-online/575462/</url>.</p><p>[5] H.R. 6824, Online Sales Simplicity and Small Business Relief Act of 2018, Introduced September 13, 2018, 115th Congress, Second Session. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6824/text\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6824/text</url>.</p><p>[6] Michael Greve, Sell Globally, Tax Locally (Washington, D.C.: AEI Press, 2003), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aei.org/research-products/book/sell-globally-tax-locally/\">https://www.aei.org/research-products/book/sell-globally-tax-locally/</url>.</p><p>[7] Jacqueline Covey, \"Hogan signs executive order allowing alcohol delivery as Cecil County haunts stick it out,\" Cecil Daily, March 21, 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cecildaily.com/emergency_notice/hogan-signs-executive-order-allowing-alcohol-delivery-as-cecil-county/article_ed101302-5660-5a03-bfd0-b238f10a031f.html\">https://www.cecildaily.com/emergency_notice/hogan-signs-executive-order-allowing-alcohol-delivery-as-cecil-county/article_ed101302-5660-5a03-bfd0-b238f10a031f.html</url>.</p><p>[8] Alisha Ebrahimji, \"Pennsylvanians are driving out of state to buy liquor, so neighboring states are cracking down,\" CNN, April 15, 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/15/us/pennsylvania-liquor-sales-ohio-west-virginia-trnd/index.html\">https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/15/us/pennsylvania-liquor-sales-ohio-west-virginia-trnd/index.html</url>.

CEI experts warn about a real downside for consumers and investors of putting that kind of vast, vague power in the hands of regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>Statement by Patrick Hedger, CEI research fellow:</p><p>\"The Hawley/Warner legislation would do more harm than good to the tech economy because it is vague, arbitrary, picks winners and losers, delegates too much power to agencies, and inserts government into an area where markets are working just fine. It delegates vague authority to the SEC to develop a formula for measuring the value of data collected by social media firms above an arbitrary threshold, in what can only be assumed as a precursor to a new digital tax. It applies monopoly-level scrutiny to several firms that are in direct competition with one another for advertising dollars... a good sign no such monopoly exists.</p><p>\"Unelected bureaucrats don't determine value, markets do. And in this case, hundreds of millions of daily users show that Americans value providing their data rather than dollars in exchange for the services these companies provide. The Hawley/Warner bill seems to entirely ignore the fact that for user data to generate value for the companies, the companies must first generate value for the users.\"</p><p>Statement by John Berlau, CEI senior fellow:</p><p>\"Among the many costs the flawed Hawley-Warner bill will impose is that, due to diversion of SEC resources in enforcing these mandates, middle-class investors will be more vulnerable to fraud. This legislation distracts the SEC from its core mission of pursuing investment scams and ensuring investors have adequate information on the companies they invest in. Like all government agencies, the SEC has limited resources, and the time and money it will have to spend on developing and enforcing a formula for valuing user data of certain tech companies will be diverted from the resources it can spend in pursuing the fraudsters who prey on all investors.</p><p>\"This legislation unfortunately follows in the dubious footsteps of 'feel-good' disclosure mandates like those contained in Dodd-Frank's 'conflict minerals' provision and in proposals for complicated formulas to calculate climate costs that have little to do with ensuring the accuracy of relevant information for investors.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6769473 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6769473</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDS-DDP1-DYG2-R2SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"466\"/><timeReceived>6:51 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 24, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Regulation deters investment and the coronavirus health crisis has revealed that ample bandwidth is vital for working and learning at home. Net neutrality regulations are at odds with encouraging infrastructure investment and with the flexibility of network management that has proved so crucial in keeping Americans online. Additionally, broadband infrastructure is a significant economic contributor and will aid in the country's financial recovery from this unprecedented financial shock.[1]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investment in broadband infrastructure declined beginning in 2015 after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted heavy-handed public utility-style regulation of the Internet, under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.[2] Investment shrunk by $500 million between 2014 and 2015 and by $2.7 billion between 2015 and 2016.[3]</p><p>Investment Rebounds. In late 2017 the FCC reversed course under a new administration and lifted the utility-style regulations. Investment increased by $2.1 billion between 2016 and 2017 and to $3.1 billion between 2017 and 2018. Broadband speeds are up by approximately 85 percent since the end of 2016.[4] Robust spending in the years since regulations were repealed ensured the resiliency of the nation's broadband network under the recent increased demand. Eliminating the threat of investment-deterring regulations would likely spur continued and increased investment in broadband infrastructure.</p><p>Similarly, eliminating the threat of a 50-state patchwork of state net neutrality laws would likely incentivize spending for an even more robust network. More than 30 states have made legislative moves toward instituting their own net neutrality regulations since the federal repeal.[5] Not only are state proposals ripe for interstate commerce challenges, they are a real threat to return on investment for broadband providers.[6] Congress should act to preempt these state laws.</p><p>Light-Touch Regulation Yields More Infrastructure Investment. Much of the broadband industry was ready to trade away the right to employ certain business practices in exchange for regulatory certainty, preemption of state net neutrality laws, and a rejection of utility-style Title II regulations at the federal level.[7] But broadband performance in the United States and the European Union during the health crisis should make both industry and Congress reconsider that tradeoff.</p><p>Europe provides an illuminating contrast to the U.S.'s light-touch regulatory approach. The EU has taken a more utility-style, heavy regulatory approach to broadband.[8] Accordingly, the EU has less per-capita investment in Internet infrastructure.[9] Like Americans across the pond, European citizens stayed home to slow the spread of COVID-19 and increased stress on their telecommunications network. Their regulators began to worry that the broadband infrastructure could not handle the increased demand. At the request of EU officials, Netflix, Facebook, Disney, and Amazon all agreed to reduce the quality of their content or delay launches of new services in order to prevent potential Internet congestion in Europe.[10] Meanwhile, U.S. broadband networks have been handling their demand surge handily.</p><p>The better performance of U.S. networks, as compared to their strained European counterparts, recommend the American light regulatory approach.</p><p>The second insight gleaned from seeing how the two different regulatory approaches play out in a crisis lies in the EU fix. European officials asked content providers to deliberately slow their content. This practice is known as throttling and can be done by edge providers or ISPs. But it is illegal for ISPs to do so under EU net neutrality laws and it is one of the practices that would be outlawed by proposed U.S. net neutrality legislation. Banning ISPs from doing the same thing that regulators would end up asking content providers to do is clearly incoherent public policy. Stateside, politicians and regulators should learn from Europe's mistake and not ban business practices that may come in handy one day, under unforeseen circumstances. Lawmakers cannot see the future, as European regulators have discovered during this crisis.</p><p>And who is to say the same will not be true for the other two practices net neutrality regulations seek to ban, namely, blocking and paid prioritization? Net neutrality regulations would ban Internet providers from blocking any legal content. The reasoning for such a ban is dubious. After all, broadband companies own their private lines and should be able to choose what goes over them. That raises the question: Do consumers really need the government dictating a no-blocking policy that so tramples on Internet service providers property rights?[11] Furthermore, there is scant evidence that ISPs have ever intentionally blocked access to legal content since the practice was legalized in 2017.[12]</p><p>Similarly, net neutrality regulations would prevent broadband companies from accepting payment from content providers in exchange for moving their data across the network more quickly. This is known as paid prioritization. Can we envision how paying more for some critical services to be delivered faster over networks might be beneficial for consumers? Remote surgeries and telehealth applications come to mind these days.[13] Consumers benefit from more options at different price points. Paid prioritization on broadband service is no exception.</p><p>Conclusion. Congress should pass federal legislation preempting state net neutrality regulation and codifying the Internet's classification as an information service, but not outlawing the potentially beneficial practices of blocking, throttling, or paid prioritization. This would encourage investment in U.S. broadband infrastructure by eliminating the threat of state and federal regulation. More robust networks will benefit American citizens and businesses in the difficult struggle for economic recovery ahead.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>[1] Michael Minges, \"Exploring the Relationship Between Broadband and Economic Growth,\" World Development Report, World Bank, January 2015, <url normalizedValue=\"http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/391452529895999/WDR16-BP-Exploring-the-Relationship-between-Broadband-and-Economic-Growth-Minges.pdf\">http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/391452529895999/WDR16-BP-Exploring-the-Relationship-between-Broadband-and-Economic-Growth-Minges.pdf</url>.</p><p>[2] Federal Communications Commission, \"In the Matter of Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet,\"</p><p>GN Docket No. 14-28, FCC 15-24, Report and Order on Remand, Declaratory Ruling, and Order, Adopted: February 26, 2015 Released: March 12, 2015, <url normalizedValue=\"https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0312/FCC-15-24A1.pdf\">https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0312/FCC-15-24A1.pdf</url>.</p><p>[3] Patrick Brogan, \"Broadband Capex Growth Propels Deployment,\" USTELECOM, Broadband Association, July 31, 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ustelecom.org/u-s-broadband-capex-growth-propels-deployment/\">https://www.ustelecom.org/u-s-broadband-capex-growth-propels-deployment/</url>.</p><p>[4] FCC Commissioner Brendoa Carr, Twitter post by @BrendanCarrFCC, February 20, 2020, 2:24 PM, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1232023583569956864?s=20\">https://twitter.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1232023583569956864?s=20</url>.</p><p>[5] Heather Morton, \"Net Neutrality Legislation in States,\" National Conference of State Legislatures, January 23, 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/net-neutrality-legislation-in-states.aspx\">https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/net-neutrality-legislation-in-states.aspx</url>.</p><p>[6] Jessica Melugin, \"U.S. Justice Department Challenges California Net Neutrality Rules,\" OpenMarket, Competitive Enterprise Institute, October 1, 2018,</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cei.org/blog/us-justice-department-challenges-california-net-neutrality-rules\">https://cei.org/blog/us-justice-department-challenges-california-net-neutrality-rules</url>.</p><p>[7] Klint Finley, \"Republicans in Congress Are Talking Net Neutrality;

Regulation deters investment and the coronavirus health crisis has revealed that ample bandwidth is vital for working and learning at home. Net neutrality regulations are at odds with encouraging infrastructure investment and with the flexibility of network management that has proved so crucial in keeping Americans online. Additionally, broadband infrastructure is a significant economic contributor and will aid in the country's financial recovery from this unprecedented financial shock.[1]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investment in broadband infrastructure declined beginning in 2015 after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted heavy-handed public utility-style regulation of the Internet, under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.[2] Investment shrunk by $500 million between 2014 and 2015 and by $2.7 billion between 2015 and 2016.[3]</p><p>Investment Rebounds. In late 2017 the FCC reversed course under a new administration and lifted the utility-style regulations. Investment increased by $2.1 billion between 2016 and 2017 and to $3.1 billion between 2017 and 2018. Broadband speeds are up by approximately 85 percent since the end of 2016.[4] Robust spending in the years since regulations were repealed ensured the resiliency of the nation's broadband network under the recent increased demand. Eliminating the threat of investment-deterring regulations would likely spur continued and increased investment in broadband infrastructure.</p><p>Similarly, eliminating the threat of a 50-state patchwork of state net neutrality laws would likely incentivize spending for an even more robust network. More than 30 states have made legislative moves toward instituting their own net neutrality regulations since the federal repeal.[5] Not only are state proposals ripe for interstate commerce challenges, they are a real threat to return on investment for broadband providers.[6] Congress should act to preempt these state laws.</p><p>Light-Touch Regulation Yields More Infrastructure Investment. Much of the broadband industry was ready to trade away the right to employ certain business practices in exchange for regulatory certainty, preemption of state net neutrality laws, and a rejection of utility-style Title II regulations at the federal level.[7] But broadband performance in the United States and the European Union during the health crisis should make both industry and Congress reconsider that tradeoff.</p><p>Europe provides an illuminating contrast to the U.S.'s light-touch regulatory approach. The EU has taken a more utility-style, heavy regulatory approach to broadband.[8] Accordingly, the EU has less per-capita investment in Internet infrastructure.[9] Like Americans across the pond, European citizens stayed home to slow the spread of COVID-19 and increased stress on their telecommunications network. Their regulators began to worry that the broadband infrastructure could not handle the increased demand. At the request of EU officials, Netflix, Facebook, Disney, and Amazon all agreed to reduce the quality of their content or delay launches of new services in order to prevent potential Internet congestion in Europe.[10] Meanwhile, U.S. broadband networks have been handling their demand surge handily.</p><p>The better performance of U.S. networks, as compared to their strained European counterparts, recommend the American light regulatory approach.</p><p>The second insight gleaned from seeing how the two different regulatory approaches play out in a crisis lies in the EU fix. European officials asked content providers to deliberately slow their content. This practice is known as throttling and can be done by edge providers or ISPs. But it is illegal for ISPs to do so under EU net neutrality laws and it is one of the practices that would be outlawed by proposed U.S. net neutrality legislation. Banning ISPs from doing the same thing that regulators would end up asking content providers to do is clearly incoherent public policy. Stateside, politicians and regulators should learn from Europe's mistake and not ban business practices that may come in handy one day, under unforeseen circumstances. Lawmakers cannot see the future, as European regulators have discovered during this crisis.</p><p>And who is to say the same will not be true for the other two practices net neutrality regulations seek to ban, namely, blocking and paid prioritization? Net neutrality regulations would ban Internet providers from blocking any legal content. The reasoning for such a ban is dubious. After all, broadband companies own their private lines and should be able to choose what goes over them. That raises the question: Do consumers really need the government dictating a no-blocking policy that so tramples on Internet service providers property rights?[11] Furthermore, there is scant evidence that ISPs have ever intentionally blocked access to legal content since the practice was legalized in 2017.[12]</p><p>Similarly, net neutrality regulations would prevent broadband companies from accepting payment from content providers in exchange for moving their data across the network more quickly. This is known as paid prioritization. Can we envision how paying more for some critical services to be delivered faster over networks might be beneficial for consumers? Remote surgeries and telehealth applications come to mind these days.[13] Consumers benefit from more options at different price points. Paid prioritization on broadband service is no exception.</p><p>Conclusion. Congress should pass federal legislation preempting state net neutrality regulation and codifying the Internet's classification as an information service, but not outlawing the potentially beneficial practices of blocking, throttling, or paid prioritization. This would encourage investment in U.S. broadband infrastructure by eliminating the threat of state and federal regulation. More robust networks will benefit American citizens and businesses in the difficult struggle for economic recovery ahead.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>[1] Michael Minges, \"Exploring the Relationship Between Broadband and Economic Growth,\" World Development Report, World Bank, January 2015, <url normalizedValue=\"http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/391452529895999/WDR16-BP-Exploring-the-Relationship-between-Broadband-and-Economic-Growth-Minges.pdf\">http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/391452529895999/WDR16-BP-Exploring-the-Relationship-between-Broadband-and-Economic-Growth-Minges.pdf</url>.</p><p>[2] Federal Communications Commission, \"In the Matter of Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet,\"</p><p>GN Docket No. 14-28, FCC 15-24, Report and Order on Remand, Declaratory Ruling, and Order, Adopted: February 26, 2015 Released: March 12, 2015, <url normalizedValue=\"https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0312/FCC-15-24A1.pdf\">https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0312/FCC-15-24A1.pdf</url>.</p><p>[3] Patrick Brogan, \"Broadband Capex Growth Propels Deployment,\" USTELECOM, Broadband Association, July 31, 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ustelecom.org/u-s-broadband-capex-growth-propels-deployment/\">https://www.ustelecom.org/u-s-broadband-capex-growth-propels-deployment/</url>.</p><p>[4] FCC Commissioner Brendoa Carr, Twitter post by @BrendanCarrFCC, February 20, 2020, 2:24 PM, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1232023583569956864?s=20\">https://twitter.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1232023583569956864?s=20</url>.</p><p>[5] Heather Morton, \"Net Neutrality Legislation in States,\" National Conference of State Legislatures, January 23, 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/net-neutrality-legislation-in-states.aspx\">https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/net-neutrality-legislation-in-states.aspx</url>.</p><p>[6] Jessica Melugin, \"U.S. Justice Department Challenges California Net Neutrality Rules,\" OpenMarket, Competitive Enterprise Institute, October 1, 2018,</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cei.org/blog/us-justice-department-challenges-california-net-neutrality-rules\">https://cei.org/blog/us-justice-department-challenges-california-net-neutrality-rules</url>.</p><p>[7] Klint Finley, \"Republicans in Congress Are Talking Net Neutrality;

New York AG Leticia James announced an investigation into Facebook over control of personal data and privacy concerns, while Texas AG Ken Paxton will look into Google's impact on digital advertising.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Associate Director of CEI's Center for Technology and Innovation Jessica Melugin said:</p><p>\"These state attorneys general are expanding the power of their office and stretching the limits of what constitutes an antitrust violation. This sort of high-profile activism may benefit state AGs' political ambitions, but impose harmful costs on consumers, businesses, and the economy. The mere threat of legal penalties--and the environment of over-caution it engenders--also has a chilling effect on entrepreneurs. Such opportunity costs are impossible to measure.</p><p>\"The only consistency among the various state, federal agency, and congressional antitrust investigations into big tech seems to be that none of them have much to do with the well-established test for antitrust law in the US; consumer harm. It will be just as difficult for state officials to prove that consumers have been harmed by the services, innovations, and conveniences of companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon as it will be for federal regulators to find evidence of customers suffering.\"</p><p>CEI President and CEO Kent Lassman said:</p><p>\"Both Facebook and Google have delivered value for consumers the world over, offer their respective primary services for free, and compete in a multichannel, highly competitive advertising market. A handful of attorneys general have identified a way to keep their names in the news for years to come. Abusive antitrust regulation often appears to be a winner for ambitious politicians. Everyone else -- including new market entrants and small players who get overlooked amid all the shouting -- loses.\"</p><p>CEI Research Fellow Patrick Hedger said:</p><p>\"The term 'monopolies' is an oxymoron. If it's plural, it's not a problem. It is astounding that multiple levels of government are pursuing antitrust investigations against several ferocious competitors in the technology space. These investigations rely on the thinking that Facebook is just social media and Google is just a search engine. Yet these companies compete in advertising, messaging services, artificial intelligence, and an endless list of other visible and invisible areas we take for granted. They also compete for the trust of the American consumer in how they handle issues such as privacy and provide consumers with different trade-offs. Ultimately the bottom line of these companies depends on where Americans choose to spend their time online. Are they watching videos on Google-owned YouTube and messaging their friends on Gmail, or are they scrolling through Facebook and chatting on Messenger? These companies hold each other infinitely more accountable than a handful of politicians could ever hope to.\"</p><p>Read more:</p><p>* Melugin: Why Recent Antitrust Regulation Isn't Really About Consumer Protection (<url normalizedValue=\"https://cei.org/content/why-recent-antitrust-regulation-isnt-really-about-consumer-protection\">https://cei.org/content/why-recent-antitrust-regulation-isnt-really-about-consumer-protection</url>).</p><p>* Hedger: If Facebook and Apple are Feuding, How Are they Monopolies?

There is a bipartisan impulse to exercise control over the Internet, apps, devices, and the algorithms and artificial intelligence that make them possible. This bipartisan \"consensus\" seeks to replace the hands-off approach that has been mostly prevalent since the Internet's inception with one of greater government control.</p><p>While regulatory agencies, rather than Congress, do much of the lawmaking these days, Congress has become ambitious about extending its power over the tech sector. This report spells out how dangerous these ambitions are. Executive and independent agencies have their own plans for encroaching on the Internet. The favorability toward expansion of the administrative state by Republicans in particular--under a supposedly deregulatory Trump administration--heightens the urgency, and demands a fresh look.</p><p>This report was inspired by an earlier report, \"The Digital Dirty Dozen: The Most Destructive High-Tech Legislative Measures of the 107th Congress\" by Wayne Crews and Adam Thierer. As was the case with the original \"Digital Dirty Dozen\" report, the trend toward interventionist policies threatens to lead to legal and regulatory uncertainty for entrepreneurs and potential public harm. That has resulted in new legislation and regulation covering the Internet sector.</p><p>To date, a hands-off regulatory approach has helped fuel an explosion in broadband access innovation, and, barring interference from regulators, will allow a 5G Internet to make a large positive impact on the world. But, unfortunately, there are now dozens of proposed technology-related bills in Congress that threaten to expand the government's reach. Not as paradoxically as it might seem, many big tech companies--seeing their market position as secure and desiring predictability--often support regulation.</p><p>This paper highlights numerous categories of interventionist policies, focuses on some of the most destructive legislative offerings within each category, and settles on the ones we consider to be the worst.</p><p>These bills address broadband deployment and access, antitrust and competition policy, bias and content controls, child protection, cybersecurity, and more.</p><p>Some are retreads, like those on online marketing and privacy. There are measures to increase antitrust intervention and to regulate \"biased,\" \"harmful,\" and other forms of speech.</p><p>The 115th Congress narrowly modified Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act with respect to human trafficking. Now both parties contemplate something more like a purge of Section 230. Section 230 allows social media networks to moderate their content without being held to the liability standards of a traditional publisher or a speaker. It protects platforms from lawsuits about third-party posts by recognizing that these hosts do not supply content like a newspaper or the content's creator does. This enables the mostly permissionless, user-driven Internet experience we enjoy online today. Without this safeguard, platforms would have to vet the enormous amount of user-driven content before displaying it because of the increased liability they would assume. This would be prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. Alternatively, and ironically for conservative critics of Section 230, platforms could take a completely hands-off approach to curating content, but the results would likely be too violent, pornographic, or offensive to attract many eyeballs.</p><p>There are also attempts to set standards for privacy and online advertising and to address online \"addiction\" and hold companies accountable for it. Some seek to bring the gig economy into the regulatory maze of labor law. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve and the Securities Exchange Commission may seek to assert their authority over the payments processing sector just as cryptocurrencies are beginning to emerge.</p><p>The pressure to regulate has intensified thanks to the emergence of two other powerful regulatory centers that are vying with America to set the gold standard for global technological regulation. While the U.S. has traditionally aimed at empowering technology users, it faces competition from two different models. The European Union aims to protect technology users in paternalistic fashion. China wants to control how people use technology. For a global industry, regulations imposed by jurisdictions that encompass a large percentage of global population and GDP will affect American companies and consumers.</p><p>We argue instead for innovation and the separation of technology and state. Policy makers, including Republicans, must pay special attention to how these various proposals would expand invasive administrative bodies like the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other agencies.</p><p>Old-school telecommunications, transportation, and infrastructure have long been highly regulated, with government-supported monopoly in some instances. The Internet still offers an opportunity to show that spontaneous order can work to serve consumers and society better than lawmakers.</p><p>Market solutions, unlike legislation, better lend themselves to address the myriad problems that inevitably arise in a free, competitive economy. The Internet was not initially designed as the mass commercial and consumer medium it is today.</p><p>There is a role for law.

As was the case with the original \"Digital Dirty Dozen\" report, the trend toward interventionist policies threatens to lead to legal and regulatory uncertainty for entrepreneurs and potential public harm. That has resulted in new legislation and regulation covering the Internet sector.</p><p>In the recent past, court decisions also have played a role. For example, in 2018 the Supreme Court, reversing precedent, greatly expanded the power of state governments to tax beyond their borders when it gave the go-ahead to the remote taxation of goods purchased online. Of course, there also have been more encouraging court decisions. For example, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals recently upheld the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) repeal of net neutrality regulations./5</p><p>To date, a hands-off regulatory approach has helped fuel an explosion in broadband access innovation, and, barring interference from regulators, will allow a 5G Internet to make a large positive impact on the world.</p><p>But, unfortunately, there are now dozens of proposed technology-related bills in Congress that threaten to expand the government's reach.</p><p>Meanwhile, tech industry critics complain that we are becoming addicted to our handheld devices and warn that the computer that beat the world champions at the strategic board game, Go, will steal our jobs next./6</p><p>While the FCC has successfully worked to roll back Obama-era net neutrality rules that would regulate the Internet as a public utility, some of the same Big Tech or FAANG--Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google/7-- companies that pushed for net neutrality rules are facing calls from both the left and right for regulation of online content standards on online platforms.

While the U.S. has traditionally aimed at empowering technology users, it faces competition from two different models. The European Union aims to protect technology users in paternalistic fashion. China wants to control how people use technology. A survey of the various regulatory initiatives undertaken by these administrative rivals is beyond the scope of this paper, but for a global industry, regulations imposed by jurisdictions that encompass a large percentage of global population and GDP will affect American companies and consumers./14</p><p>We argue instead for innovation and the separation of technology and state.
