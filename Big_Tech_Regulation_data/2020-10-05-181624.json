President Donald Trump  is looking for unity on tax reform. Earlier today he said that he would be  making some changes to the framework that was originally unveiled last  month. The announcement comes as key senators raise concerns with the  specifics of the plan which includes eliminating the state and local tax  deduction.</p><p> Let's bring in Paul Krugman. He's Nobel Prize-winning economist, columnist  of the New York Times and a professor at the City University of New York.</p><p> Professor Krugman, it's an honor to have you on the show. Thank you so  much.</p><p> PAUL KRUGMAN, PROFESSOR OF ECOMONICS AND NOBEL PRIZE-WINNING ECONOMIST,  UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK: Great to be on.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Prospects for tax reform for this administration?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, you know, I can never - I'm not a legislative expert. I  mean, intellectually it's completely incoherent. They seem to have fallen -  they seem to have lost the thread on what it is they're trying to do. They  have no way to actually accomplish, you know, anything that looks remotely  like deficit neutrality without actually sharply raising taxes on a lot of  middle class people. So, it's a mess. Now, that wouldn't be the first time  that something that was a mess made it through Congress. But, it's not  looking very good.</p><p> JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: When you say that it's completely  incoherent, what do you mean by that? When you look at the range of  policies, what stands out to you as not making any sense?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, first of all, you know, they keep on saying Americans are  overtaxed - the highest taxed country - that's a lie. We're not. Actually,  we're just about the lowest taxed among major countries. But, still they  keep on implying that they're going to do a tax cut for middle income  people. They keep on saying, well, we're not going to - you know, we're  responsible fiscally. And, yet, there's no way you can have what they  really, really want, which is a huge tax cut for businesses - this pass- through thing which would be a huge tax cut for people with high incomes  without somehow or other raising taxes on a lot of people to pay for it.  So, they haven't figured out a way to make the thing hang together at all.</p><p> SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: And, don't forget the middle class tax cut  that they've been promising as well.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, there is no middle class tax cut in there. In fact, there's  a substantial middle class - you know, random pieces of the middle class  tax increase in everything we've seen so far. So, yeah - they - I mean,  they had a couple of ways they thought they were going to be able to pay  for it, one of which involved, you know, repealing the Affordable Care Act  ...</p><p> FU: That didn't go so well.</p><p> KRUGMAN: The other of which involved the border tax adjustment. Since both  of those have died, now they have absolutely no idea how to make the  arithmetic work.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: You just pushed back on the idea that the United States is one  of the highest taxed. You said actually it's one of the lowest.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Yes. If you just take taxes as a share of GDP ...</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Then among advanced countries, we're right at the bottom. Now, you  know, there were - you can try to make some excuses. We have a relatively  high top-line corporate tax rate ...</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p> KRUGMAN: But on the other hand we have lots and lots of deductions and so  on. So, our effective corporate tax rate is only sort of normal and our  individual taxes are definitely low. So, it's amazing that Trump just  repeats this again and again. And, it's as flatly false as anything there  is in the world.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: On the corporate tax side, leaving aside the individual taxes  for the moment - on the corporate tax side, are there ways that you think  that taxes could be reformed in a productive way that would make things  more efficient - more logical?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, it's actually kind of funny. The reform that Paul Ryan  originally floated early this year - the destination-based cash flow tax  which included the border tax adjustment, was a not stupid idea. In fact,  it was one of the few things I've seen from Paul Ryan ...</p><p> WEISENTHAL: This is a big moment where Paul Krugman is praising something  that Paul Ryan ...</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Not stupid.</p><p> KRUGMAN: No. It's actually - in fact it has kind of bipartisan support  among tax experts. People like Alan Auerbach were saying this is a good  idea. I support - so, and of course, it being the one thing that I've seen  from Paul Ryan that was really not a terrible idea, it died instantly in  the political arena. And, without that - without the border tax adjustment  that's a piece of that, there's no way to make a significant corporate -  you know, cut in corporate marginal tax rates that doesn't explode the  deficit.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: I'll ask you about Art Laffer and the Laffer Curve and the  implications for Kansas and what happened there.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Is that a specific example of where something didn't go wrong  because they made mistakes or does that theory just be - has been blown out  of the water by the example?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Oh, it's been blown out of the water by every single example we've  seen, right? There has been not a single case where anything like the  Laffer Curve has seemed to be true. I mean, there was Kansas - I mean a  state level is actually an especially favorable case for it because capital  labor can easily flow into a state. So, the chances that cutting taxes  might actually increase revenue is much higher ...</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p> KRUGMAN: At the level of one state than it is for the United States as a  whole. And, even so, all it did in Kansas was create a fiscal crisis. And,  nothing - look, the Clinton tax hike was supposed to destroy the economy.  Then we had the best boom of the post-war era. Obama substantially  increased taxes in 2013. Nothing terrible happened. So, this is a - there  is nothing supporting this point of view except the fact that some very  rich people would like it to be true.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: So, based on all that, wouldn't (ph) we understand the impact  of tax cuts in aggregate, is that a fair argument to make - a fair point to  make?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, there is very little reason to think that tax cuts matter  much one way or the other for underlying growth. I mean, the (base) would  have to cut taxes is you cut tax collection. That's basically what happens.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: If you're arguing this case, that actually a lot of the  financing is going to be provided by higher growth as a result of the tax  cuts ...</p><p> KRUGMAN: You might as well just assume that unicorns will come and deliver  packages of money, right? There's no reason to believe this.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: OK.</p><p> FU: I need to ask you about healthcare, because the President says that he  plans to sign executive action to allow new health plans outside of  Obamacare, creating more healthcare options for people. That's his sell.  Now, experts say this would destabilize already fragile markets. So, what  happens in the interim? Because, whatever plan he does open this up to  wouldn't take affect right away.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Yes. The thing however is you have - you know insurers have to  make decisions about whether to participate in the market. They have to  submit requests for premiums. So all of this - all of this is uncertainty  is wreaking huge damage already. So, you know, premiums are going way up  for 2018 and most of that - most of that is because of the Trump  administration and the uncertainty it's created.</p><p> FU: So can it survive until 2019?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, yes, because most people - even in the individual market,  most people are receiving subsidies which cushion them from the increases.  And, then there's Medicaid, which is unaffected by all of this. So, it gets  worse but it doesn't collapse.</p><p> FU: Right. Nobel Prize-winning economist Professor Paul Krugman is sticking  with us for the next hour.</p><p> Coming up next we're going to talk about the President's search for the  next fed chair and whether the central banks' independence is perhaps at  risk.</p><p> This is Bloomberg.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> FU: What'd You Miss? Concern that the search for the next fed chair may  take a political turn - Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman wrote in  his column last week \"surely it's possible, even probable that the Federal  Reserve, like other government agencies, is about the get Trumpified, that  one of American policies last remaining havens of competence and expertise  will soon share in the general degradation.\"</p><p> Professor Krugman is back with us and not holding back on opinion here.  What is an example of a Trumpified fed pick versus one that showcases the  fed's competence and expertise?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, there's a very clear dichotomy here, right? We have a  perfectly fine fed chair who could be reappointed. Janet Yellen has  probably every indicator - done a stellar job. Why not just keep her? On  the other hand we - for a while there, the betting (ph) was kind of - the  prediction markets were thinking that the most likely pick was Kevin Warsh,  former fed governor who has - there's a lot of things you can say about  them (ph) - but, one thing is he does have a track record over the past  decade and it's quite consistent. He's been wrong about everything.</p><p> FU: Economic forecast ...</p><p> KRUGMAN: Economic forecast, worried about inflation as the world was  sliding into depression, worried that terrible things - thought that fiscal  policy was going to be - you know, we were going to turn into Greece. It's  amazing. It's kind of almost awesome. You can almost make money by taking  whatever he thinks is going to happen and betting the other way - but,  politically correct from a republican point of view - has some family  connections with Trump. So, that would have been - you know, he might still  be appointed, although apparently his stock has declined a little bit.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: How much do you weigh concern of a - what you would see as a  bad pick, and obviously it sounds like you don't think Kevin Warsh would be  a good pick ...</p><p> KRUGMAN: Right.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: A bad pick versus a pick who is perceived to be at Trump's beck  and call - and so, Trump calling him out - him or her out on Twitter for a  rate hike - stuff like that. Which of those would concern you more?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, boy, both. I mean, in some ways - I think those go together.  I don't think they really separate, because you had somebody who was  actually good and respected within the fed and respects the institution of  the fed - that person is also not going to be particularly pressurable by  the White House. So, it's a - if you had somebody who had no real reason  for being there except the fact that Trump decided that he liked him or  her, although it's going to be a him, if that's who it is - then that would  then be the kind of person you would worry about being politicized.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: We've seen U-turns on many occasions in Donald Trump. Do you  think there's a chance here that his criticism of Janet Yellen was made  perhaps before he'd spoken to people who may have known more about monetary  policy and actually having learned subsequently - he's perhaps realizing  that continuity of the fed might not be a bad thing and actually reappoint  Janet Yellen at the end?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, I'm hoping so. I mean, that would be the best outcome I  think given what's happening right now.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: But, you don't think ...</p><p> KRUGMAN: You know, his U-turns tend to be followed by further U-turns.  Every time you think he's reached a reasonable agreement on something, then  he finds a way to go back on it. So, I worry about that, even here.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Even there.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Speaking of Janet Yellen, and speaking - getting away from the  question of who the next fed chair is going to be, one of the most notable  things going on in the economy is the persistent failure of the fed or the  economy overall to get to 2 percent inflation - to hit the inflation goal  (ph). In light of what we've seen over the last several years - all of the  things that have tried - have you changed or evolved in your thinking of  what the fed can do to hit inflation? What have you learned about the fed  and inflation by watching this persistent short-fall?</p><p> KRUGMAN: OK. There's two different things. One is monetary policy just  doesn't have that much traction when interest rates are very low. That  still remains true. Even though the fed has normalized a little bit, we're  still kind of in that regime ...</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Right.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Where the fed - all of the attention is on the fed and yet the fed  has much less power than it would in what we used to think of as normal  times.</p><p> The other thing is, there is something going on in the inflation process.  It looks as if - you know, whether it's the natural rate of unemployment,  if such a thing exists, is weighed down, or the Phillips Curve has gotten  flatter or there's downward nominal wage rigidity or something. But,  something - clearly the underlying models we were using to try to predict  inflation, which were never very good, are now looking completely useless  (ph).</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Do you have a favorite theory or explanation for what that  something is?</p><p> KRUGMAN: I think it's a mix - there still being pent-up wage cuts that  don't want to happen and there's just sort of - there's still an overhang  from the past. And, I think there's nervousness. I think that people having  been through the Great Recession and the long, slow recovery are just very  reluctant to grant or demand wage increases that might end up being locked  in during the next slump.</p><p> FU: So, does that mean that the Federal Reserve should re-think its  approach to targeting 2 percent inflation? Should it give up that target?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Oh, no, on the contrary. I mean, everything we've seen that says  that 2 percent inflation is if anything, too low, that given that we've  seen how hard it is to get inflation up once it's too low, given that it's  - I'm a secularist stagnation guy - that we really need to have the  opportunity of having significantly negative real interest rates, that the  fed's target should be above 2 percent ...</p><p> FU: What - 3 percent?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, I would - I mean, I would - I'm old enough. I'm older than  all you guys. I remember a 4 percent. I remember Reagan's second term when  we had 4 percent inflation. It wasn't so bad. It gave you a lot more room  for monetary policy. So, I would go there. It's not - it's a long way from  being politically acceptable but, no - by no means to say that because  we're having trouble getting to the 2 percent target which actually looks  too low, that we should give up on even trying to get there.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Could the fed be not hiking right now? If you were a fed chair,  would you not be ...</p><p> KRUGMAN: I would not be hiking right now. I think the fed is trying to  normalize and that version of normality went out the window ten years ago.</p><p> FU: Economist Paul Krugman is sticking with us, because we're talking about  changing political dynamics in the age of Trump.  We can take that in many  directions.</p><p> From New York, this is Bloomberg.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> FU: What'd You Miss? Republican Senator Bob Corker is in open opposition to  the President, calling the White House \"an adult daycare center,\" and  worrying whether President Trump can lead the nation to a Third World War -  or, whether he would. But, perhaps the real battle is within the Republican  Party itself.</p><p> We're back with Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize-winning economist.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Paul, one of the interesting things about Corker's comments is  he said, \"There are a lot of people within my caucus who feel the same way  I do.\" But of course, none of them have really called out Trump to the same  degree. What do you think the reluctance is all about?</p><p> KRUGMAN: It's about their political careers. I mean, you know, I've been  paying attention to this stuff for a long time and I read a lot. Today's  republican legislators - people in the senate and even more so in the  house, they grew up in an era of a monolithic, very tightly organized  Republican Party.</p><p> These are not people who courageously staked out a position that might have  been unpopular. These are people who joined the political machine that  guaranteed them a good living, even if they lost an election, right? We  call it \"wingnut welfare,\" all of that, right? And, so they are not - these  are apparatchiks. These are not people who are going to step out and take a  stand on principle. It's not the kind of people they are. It would require  a lot of - Corker turns out to be a more interesting guy than we thought.  But, it's also he's decided that his political career is over. There are  going to be very few who are willing to do that, even under the most  extreme circumstances.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: But, you've got now Senator John McCain of course as well, who  is getting treatment for brain cancer and you've got Bob Corker - so you've  got two kind of ...</p><p> KRUGMAN: So, people who are on the edge of retirement or possibly don't  have very long to live are willing to say something that I don't think is  going to be enough to be an effectively large caucus.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: But, in terms of trying to get legislation through, losing two  big senators like that actually, is critical for the GOP.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, that's right. And, remember, we already - we already saw  Obamacare repeal crash and burn ...</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Tax reform or tax reform tax or whatever it is they're trying to  do on taxes is in big trouble. So, it's quite possible that they'll have a  completely sterile legislative agenda - and - which, you know, from my  point of view is a good thing. In any case, yes. They don't have the kind  of margin that would allow them to push stuff through if they have even a  few people who decide, oh, the hell with it, I'm just going to say what I  think.</p><p> FU: Well, the party is in a little bit of a dilemma here, because they've  rallied around principles that seem to be in opposition to themselves. For  instance, they want tax cuts on investment income to boost the economy.  They want tax cuts for the middle class, all the while avoiding widening  the budget deficit. You can't have one without the other.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Right.</p><p> FU: Something's got to give and no one is willing to concede any of that.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Yes. We have a phrase that's in other circumstances but it works  in international economics - we talk about the impossible trinity. There  are three different things that everybody wants and you can only have two  of them. And, they've definitely got themselves in the impossible trinity.</p><p> They also have the problem which is that Trump sold himself to his base as  a populist - I'm going to help you against the swamp and against the big  guys and then everything that they're trying to do legislatively is  standard republican - you know, let's give more to the oligarchy.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: How do you think the tension is going to resolve ultimately?  Because, it does seem like there's - you know, the McConnell wing and the  Trump wing are distinct, especially in how they see the economy and  populism - taxes perhaps. Ultimately do you think the old McConnell wing  will just completely be swept out?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Oh, no. If you actually look at concrete legislative measures -  look at what Trump has actually proposed or at least signed on to - first  on healthcare and now on taxes, it's totally been McConnell Ryan wing.  There's been no hint at all of that economic populism in anything he  actually does. He talks a populist game but in fact his populism never  translates into economics.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Right.</p><p> KRUGMAN: He's populist on, you know, race relations. He's populist on  culture war. But, on economics, there's been no - it appears to be entirely  just rhetoric.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: So far he hasn't gotten anything done. So, if he actually tries  to get legislation passed - I mean he called Chuck Schumer apparently on  Friday to try and get something done on healthcare. The risk is that  perhaps he tries to see what he can get away with on tax cuts, if not tax  reform. Does the sort of bipartisan outreach become the end-game here if he  wants to get things done, because he's a deal-maker? He wants action -  results.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, the thing about him as a deal-maker is he tends to re-neg on  all of his deals, right? They thought they had a deal on the dreamers. He  now suddenly ...</p><p> FU: Now they're outraged.</p><p> KRUGMAN: He said, \"I'm willing to deal on healthcare.\" But, you know, now  he seems to be imposing other conditions. So, you know, who's going to make  a deal with him now, really?</p><p> FU: So, what should the democrats do during this time where they may  possibly be working with the President on some kind of deal even though  they're not confident it's going to come to fruition - because they  themselves are at risk of fracturing or splintering into an extreme left  and a shrinking moderate presence (ph)?</p><p> KRUGMAN: I think that's much exaggerated. If you look on policy substance,  there's really not a whole lot of division. You know, we talk about  different wings of the Democratic Party but in fact the whole party is  pretty much unified in anything that involves policy in the medium term.</p><p> FU: Well, right now they're unified against Donald Trump.</p><p> KRUGMAN: And, they're also unified for, you know, we're going to defend  Obamacare - maybe we'd like single-payer eventually, but even if you look  at the standard single-payer plan, most of it is a transition to a public  option. So, I think it's much less real division there. I think what the  democrats probably do is they, you know, sound flexible, they talk with  Trump - they make it clear, we need to talk with Trump, but they don't  actually offer him anything much because, why? They know that they'll get  shafted if they do and they know that the base will be angry if they do.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Sounds like the debt raise (ph), actually, doesn't it? They  actually didn't give up anything and Trump did (ph).</p><p> Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize-winning economist joins us for the market close.  Stay with us. From New York, this is Bloomberg.</p><p> 1556</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> 1559</p><p> CHATTERLEY: What'd You Miss? Stocks climb to a record high, as the dollar  weakens.</p><p> I'm Julia CHATTERLEY.</p><p> FU: I'm Scarlet Fu.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: And, I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p><p> If you're tuning in live on Twitter, we want to welcome you to our closing  bell coverage every weekday from 4 to 5 pm Eastern.</p><p> FU: Let's begin with Market Minutes.  Look, it's another day of record  highs here for the Dow and the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ.  You could see gains of  anywhere from one-tenth of 1 percent to three-tenths of 1 percent. So, the  big tech names are probably lagging behind, given the NASDAQ's smaller gain  than the other two.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Yes, but new highs once again. It's pretty remarkable. The melt-up  ...</p><p> FU: The melt-up continues.</p><p> All right. Let's look at some individual names here - Proctor &amp; Gamble  declaring victory in its bid to keep Nelson Pelts off its board, even as  Nelson Pelts' activist hedge fund try-in (ph) said the vote is still too  close to call. So, that stock is down just by half of 1 percent.</p><p>Wal-Mart gaining almost 5 percent. That's a big move for Wal-Mart after  announcing a $20 billion stock buy-back. Also, it says it expects U.S. e- commerce sales to surge 40 percent in the next fiscal year.</p><p> And, a quick mention here of UAL and American Air. United Continental  surging after bolstering of financial outlook despite hurricanes and a  continued fare war and of course as expert (ph) analysts raise their  earnings forecast you can see American Airlines getting a little bit of a  lift from that as well.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Finally, let's go to the government bond market - very quiet  today - hardly anything going on. Tier (ph) yields unchanged. Ten-year  yields down moderately. Remember bond yields was closed yesterday for  Columbus Day, so this is catch-up - really nothing going on here.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: And, that (inaudible) in what we saw in the FX markets as well.  I'm showing you a seven-day here for the dollar index. That's actually not  a pretty chart, but the dollar is lower for a third day versus most of the  G10 tiers (ph). I mean, we talked about those concerns about tax reform. I  think we just have to take it as a pause, and the recent rallying looking  like its run out of steam.</p><p> I'm showing you what's going on in Euro dollar too. Of course, we have that  Catalonian presidential talk or speech today to Parliament, stepping back  from the prospect of unilateral declaration of independence - he wants to  engage. We have got the Euro there above 118, the figure. I also want to  show you what's going on in that Euro dollar - sorry, in sterling as well.  The rally now that we've seen this week to around 1 percent manufacturing  and construction outcome beating (inaudible). The data is showing a pretty  mixed picture I'd say for the U.S. economy here, but still more chatter  about the Bank of England raising rates in November with a one and done  move.</p><p> FU: And, just a quick update here on stocks, the Dow finished at a record  but the S&amp;P and NASDAQ fell just short.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Finally, on commodities, let's look at oil and gold - oil  gaining nearly 3 percent, rising optimism that more countries are going to  join with OPEC to cut production. So, some hope (ph) diminished supply up -  back up about $50 a barrel in West Texas intermediate to run 51. And, gold  futures, gaining again up to just over 12.90 an ounce.</p><p> And, those are today's Market Minutes.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Well, you may see a post-election market rally that wasn't  predicted. We're still here with Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize-winning  economist.</p><p> Paul, you made the call that markets would tank if President Trump were  elected.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Right. And, I retracted it very soon afterwards. And, you know, I  did what you should never ever do, which is to let your political, you  know, biases, interfere with your judgment. I thought, this is a terrible  thing, which it was, but it isn't necessarily going to be terrible for  every indicator. And, so, this is a mea culpa. I did that already.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Yes, you did.</p><p> KRUGMAN: This was me doing exactly what I tell people not to do. And, you  know, it's going to happen. We're all mortal. One thing is worth saying, by  the way. We talk about there's a Trump bump. There's also a Merkel bump, a  Macron bump, a (inaudible) bump, an (inaudible) bump - stock markets have  been up all around the world. So, something's going on. People like stocks.</p><p> What is the - I always quote my old teacher, Paul Samuelson (ph), who said  that the stock market had predicted nine of the last five recessions.  The  market may not be telling us much of anything at all, except that for some  reason people are liking stocks.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: We have a viewer question actually, and I think you've kind of  already answered it there, asking whether the Trump stock bump reflects a  fundamental change to the economy or just the expectation that business  owners will eat a larger piece of the pie with employees and the public at  large eating less pie and more externalities like dirty air and water?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Yes, or it might just reflect the fact that investors think that  other investors are going to pay more for stocks. I mean, it doesn't have  to mean anything much at all.</p><p> Let me say, just I am little surprised that the market doesn't worry more  about the downside of a totally catastrophic response if something bad  happens, you know? What if we have something really bad happen and they  handle everything the way they handled Puerto Rico? That ought to be some  kind of weight on the market. But, we know that markets tend not to - tend  to ignore those things until they actually do happen.</p><p> FU: You know, I wanted to play for you a comment from Richard Thaler, the  Nobel Prize-winning economist ...</p><p> KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p> FU: On what he thinks about what's going on the stock market.  Take a  listen.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Here he is.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RICHARD THALER, NOBEL PRIZE WINNING ECONOMIST: I don't know about you, but  I'm nervous and it seems like when investors are nervous, they're prone to  being spooked and nothing seems to spook the market. As you said, it just  crawls up, slowly but surely. And, if it's all based on the expectation of  some big tax cut, surely investors should have lost confidence that that  was going to happen, given what's happened so far out of Congress.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> FU: Especially what we've heard of late, Joe, which is the President is  going to back to tweak the tax proposal.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Right. So, there's all this uncertainty as you said, like we've  seen an example of disaster response and ...</p><p> KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Hasn't been impressive. There is active saber rattling about  North Korea now almost every other day - threat of our military conflict.  So, is your theory that basically markets are not really good forward  discounters - basically just take into account what already happened?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Yes. We - it's not - that isn't even a theory. That's an  observation. We know. And, some of us again remember - you know, remember  the housing bubble. And, it was - that was the clearest thing I'd ever seen  in my life. That was just overwhelming in numbers. And, yet, month after  month the prices kept on rising and people kept saying, oh, there's no - if  there were really a bubble, surely it would have burst by now. And, then  one day it did.</p><p> FU: Do you see a bubble right now?</p><p> KRUGMAN: It's much less clear. Let's put it - there were - profits are  high. Interest rates are still very low so it makes kind of sense for stock  prices to be high, given that. It's more - in this case I don't see it's a  really overwhelming bubble. I just think that there's a disaster risk that  the markets are not taking into account.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: When we ask people about this though they say, look, for the  first time in two decades, maybe more, we've got this synchronous growth  pattern when they look around the world and actually that lifts all boats.  Do you buy that?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, not necessarily, because sometimes a synchronous growth  pattern means that interests rates rise which tends to - and, that's not  happening. So, I don't - you know, at some level - look, Bob Schiller  famously - he did a study during the '87 stock crash and he asked people,  why are you selling - in real time, using fax machines, because that's all  you had at the time, and the only answer that appeared with any frequency -  you know, there were all kinds of (inaudible) for rationalizations (ph) -  the only answer was, I'm selling because stocks - because prices are  falling. I think people are buying stocks because prices are rising. And, I  think that's all that's really gone ...</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Well, we have a show, so we have to have better (inaudible)  than that. If only people just gave us those (inaudible).</p><p> CHATTERLEY: We need to (inaudible).</p><p> FU: Now, in terms of the economy, I wanted to get your sense of the labor  market, because you can't really read too much in the latest jobs report.  Yet, people were saying, oh, look at the participation rate, it's gone up.  Look at earnings. It's gone up. What do you take away from the latest  couple of reports and what it says about the economy?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Yes. I'm having a hard time figuring out what the - lately I've  been looking at actually at the QUIPS rate, which is back up to normal  levels. And, that seems to be signaling that we really are kind of - people  seem to feel that it's OK to leave a job because they can find another one,  which suggests that we are kind of at full employment. Earnings are not  really showing that. Wage increases are still sub-par. But, you know, maybe  - and, also it's interesting that prime age labor reports participation is  creeping back up to previous levels. So, all the people who said, this is  structural, it really is nothing - turns out, no, it's just lack of jobs.  So, there's some actual good stuff. And, I wouldn't take one month's number  on the NFP very much.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: And, just a reminder. We're going to get the QUIPS rate  tomorrow - the JOLTS number comes out tomorrow, so something to watch.</p><p> FU: Perfect timing.</p><p> All right.  Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman will be sticking  with us. We're going to talk about urban policy and perhaps how to avoid  disasters like Hurricane Harvey in Houston - or at least it could have been  minimized.</p><p> From New York, this is Bloomberg.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> FU: What'd You Miss? We are back now with Nobel Prize-winning economist,  Paul Krugman. And, we turn our focus to urban policy and infrastructure.</p><p> Professor, you've written about the flooding disaster that was caused by  Hurricane Harvey in Houston and how it was largely due to bad policy,  including unregulated development.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p> FU: Some estimates have the storm causing up to $200 billion dollars in  damage.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p> FU: So, what's the lesson here? What should be done differently?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, in Houston it's pretty clear. People have been warning about  this for a long time, that it essentially - too much of it is paved. You  need to have places to drain. You need to have - you know, you have to -  you cannot just - in (ph) what is very much a place that nature wants to  flood occasionally - even the side (ph) climate change that wants to  happen, even more so now - if you have completely unregulated development  then you end up with no place for water to go.</p><p> Now the funny this is - the thing that makes it agonizing is, on the other  hand, in some ways Houston does it right by not restricting development in  ways that prevent people from building housing. So, you know, you have a  kind of extreme San Francisco-style which is nimbyism gone wild ...</p><p> FU: Yes.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Which is disastrous. And, Houston is a - has much, much cheaper  housing because it didn't do that.</p><p> On the other hand, you have complete, you know, ignoring the environmental  consequences of unrestricted development and we seem to find it very hard  politically to find the balance there.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Right. You know, if you look at all the other boom cities over  the last decade, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco - completely  unaffordable for homeowners for the middle class - Houston has been a  success story on this front - you know, a thriving city economically where  middle class people can afford to buy a home.</p><p> KRUGMAN: That's right. No. If you look at - I mean, when they (ph) ask why  does Texas grow faster in general than the rest of the country, it's none  of the things that the Texans like to boast about. It's not because of low  taxes. It's not because they're cruel to the poor. It's because they have a  housing policy that lets you build houses which the northeast, and even  worse, the far west, do not have. But - so, that's a good thing. But, you  know, you have to have some place for the water to go when there's a  hurricane and they haven't done that.</p><p> So, it's a real - it - no one seems to - I mean, the only city that seems  to have adequate regulation - big city, and affordable housing, is Chicago.  Unfortunately they've also got Chicago winters, so I don't know what you do  about that.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Yes, but can you steal (ph) from them in terms of the way  they've tackled this, because as you say, I mean, it's kind of bad city  planning - the zoning laws - and, we've talked about them on this show  before in Houston, also a huge problem. But, then you compare it to San  Francisco as well and say actually, look at the situation that they've  created, where people have extreme commuting, which actually I've never  even heard about.</p><p> KRUGMAN: No. Well, we have - you know, we have some of that here. I know  people - a couple of people who live in Bucks County and commute to  Manhattan.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: How long does that take?</p><p> KRUGMAN: About two hours.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Wow. (Inaudible) four hours and ...</p><p> KRUGMAN: Yes. No. It's - the thing is, technically there are no problems.  We know how to do this. We know what should be done. It's easy to throw up  a list. The question is, how ...</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Politics.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Politics. And, I don't know if we've found a way to make that  happen. It just seems to be - you know, de Blasio came in with very good  ideas about trying to expand affordable housing and he's done what in  absolute terms is quite a lot in New York. But, of course it's such a huge  city that it's just a drop in the bucket relative to the size of the  problem.</p><p> FU: How much are we going to rely on local politicians, city mayors, state  governors to do a lot of the work here, because everything is so gummed up  at the federal level?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, first of all, this is going to have to be local policy in  any case.</p><p> FU: Sure.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Sure, it is going to require local politicians. The trouble - I  mean, when people talk about decentralization, the fact of the matter is,  by and large, with many - with honorable exceptions, but a lot of local  politicians are really pretty terrible. Not that many people vote in state  and local elections and so you'll often - you have machine politicians.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: You're not getting the best people ...</p><p> KRUGMAN: On the whole, even - you know, much as I can denounce stuff that  goes on in Congress, I'm not sure that there are many state legislatures  (ph) that I would prefer.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Is there something here in New York City when you look at  regulations of the housing marking that you think could be done that a  mayor or city council could do to ease housing crisis?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, sure. I mean, even though we're an enormously enormous city  and very dense, there's still lots of potential building. There's lots of  places where we could still build up. There's still in fact land that is  un-built that could be built without destroying the quality of life. There  is - you know, if you're going to have a city - a metro area with 20 plus  billion (ph) people, you're going to have to have some really dense  developments. And, look, I live - I actually checked - my zip code has got  about 70,000 per square mile. It doesn't feel impossibly overcrowded. You  know, it's high rises. You can live that way and we need more of that.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman is staying with us.</p><p> Up next we get his take on the political uncertainty in Europe. From New  York, this is Bloomberg.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Catalonia backs away from declaring independence outright. The  Catalan president opted for a middle ground in his message to Parliament  today, calling for talks with Spain. But, what will the recent fiscal  uncertainty mean for Europe's economy? Paul Krugman is still with us.</p><p> Paul, let's talk about Spain to start off with. What do you think here?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, not at all familiar. I mean, I don't know Spain. I certainly  don't know Catalonia. I mean, it's odd to have this timing. I mean, if you  were thinking bad things were going to happen in Spain, you would have  expected those three or four years ago when the Spanish economy was really  in the dumps.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Spain is actually making a comeback and a fair bit of that  actually in Catalonia. But, you know, having the auto industry is coming  back - Spain is - it's an enormous, incredibly expensive (ph) process of  internal devaluation (ph). But, they have finally been - you know, there's  some light at the end of the tunnel. So, it's kind of odd to have this  happening now.</p><p> Now, I understand Catalonia has in fact been deeply oppressed culturally,  but you try to think about what it would mean to break Catalonia away from  the rest of Spain now. And, my God, it's like trying to imagine Virginia  seceding again now, right? It would be a really impossible thing to happen.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: But, when you look at Europe optically (ph), I mean we've got -  we've had the Macron victory over in France, Angela Merkel has just come  back in in Germany - yes (ph) we've got these hot spots like Italy and  we've got the tensions now in Spain, but overall what's your sense of  Europe at this moment?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Well, Europe - the Euro continues to function badly, right? The  Euro was a mistake. It has been a big constraint. They paid a huge price in  high unemployment but the political cohesiveness of Europe, with the  exception of Britain, has turned out to be much stronger. I mean, us Anglo- Saxons didn't quite understand just how deep the commitment of much of the  European elite was to it.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: In 10 years will all of the countries that are in the Euro zone  still be there?</p><p> KRUGMAN: You know, if Greece wasn't going to leave the Euro with the 27  percent unemployment and a depression-level slump, who's going to leave? I  think it's very, very hard. People just ...</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Right.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Don't want to do that, even when the economics of it makes a lot  of sense.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: They always said in Brussels, \"don't underestimate Angela  Merkel's will to keep this thing together.\"</p><p> FU: No, that's a really, really good point. Yet, there is an attraction to  populism, right? People in Spain, people in France can't turn away from it  completely. People in Germany with AfDs ...</p><p> KRUGMAN: That's right.</p><p> FU: Strong showing.</p><p> KRUGMAN: There are - everybody's got their little Trumps. Everybody's got  their - and, not necessarily in countries you would think. You know,  Germany - by the way, this is a demonstration that is not - economic  anxiety is a very distinctly secondary thing. Germany has been the great  success story this whole period. Even so, they have a resurgent hard right.</p><p> FU: All right. Well, we want to bring in some viewer questions to wrap it  all up - to wrap up your hour with us.</p><p> Joe, why don't you start with this one on the broken Phillips Curve?</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Yes, so a question about the Phillips Curve - we talked about  it a little bit very earlier on. What do you make of it? Some wondering if  it's the changing nature of the economy from a manufacturing to a service  economy - maybe it was never valid in the first place. What's your take on  that debate?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Yes. My take is that I don't really know. We're trying - look,  some things we can see. We can still see that there's an awful lot - if you  look at the distribution of wage changes, there's a spike at zero, which  tells us that one thing that's still going on is that people - there are  still people who are - really should from a market sense be taking wage  cuts and because they can't, there's kind of a pent up demand for wage  decline that's sitting there.</p><p> Some of it is it may be that expectations - that after years and years of  inflation falling below forecasts that that is starting to get reflected in  expectations. But, I have to say, all of this stuff - I have a feeling that  I'm like a pre-Copernican astronomer, you know, doing epicycles trying to  make this model that really doesn't want to - so, the answer is, at some  level, we don't know.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Hector (ph) is asking if it's related to the transition  mechanism, though - I guess in some sense, did it fall out in the wash at  some point?</p><p> KRUGMAN: I don't think that there's a - I mean, I don't think that the  service economy change or any of the - in general, structural change is  overrated, right? Things like - the fact of the matter - that people  obviously think it's easy to find jobs, should be showing up in higher wage  demands. And, why it isn't showing up is still a puzzle.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: A mystery.</p><p> FU: Janet Yellen has said so as much.</p><p> All right. Final question to you: will the fed be successful in reducing  its balance sheet?</p><p> KRUGMAN: Oh, yes. I don't - that is really not - the idea (ph) that there  was ever going to be a big problem there was always a fundamental  misunderstanding. They have plenty of tools to offset it. If they tried to  dump it all at once it would be a big problem, but I don't see any problem  there.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: One last question. We just have a few seconds left. Years ago  you said that big coin was even and it hasn't died yet. I'm curious whether  you - what you think about it these days, because so many conversations  come back to that.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Yes, I think it's still evil. I don't think that there is any very  legitimate purpose for it. And, yes, it is kind of - it's suspended. I  still think it's a Wiley Coyote thing, right?</p><p> WEISENTHAL: (Inaudible).</p><p> KRUGMAN: You run off the edge of the cliff. One day you look down and  realize there's nothing under you. But, I've been saying that for years and  it's been wrong all along.</p><p> FU: In the meantime, the legs are moving really, really, really fast.</p><p> KRUGMAN: That's right.</p><p> FU: Paul Krugman, thank you so much.</p><p> KRUGMAN: Thanks a lot.</p><p> FU: Thank you for spending the time with us.</p><p> Nobel Prize-winning economist - he's a columnist for the New York Times and  of course, a professor at the City University of New York.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is looking for unity on tax reform. Earlier today he said that he would be making some changes to the framework that was originally unveiled last month. The announcement comes as key senators raise concerns with the specifics of the plan which includes eliminating the state and local tax deduction.</p><p>Let's bring in <person><nameText>Paul Krugman. </nameText></person>He's Nobel Prize-winning economist, columnist of the New York Times and a professor at the City University of New York.</p><p>Professor Krugman, it's an honor to have you on the show. Thank you so much.</p><p><person><nameText>PAUL KRUGMAN, </nameText></person>PROFESSOR OF ECOMONICS AND NOBEL PRIZE-WINNING ECONOMIST, UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK: Great to be on.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Prospects for tax reform for this administration?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, you know, I can never - I'm not a legislative expert. I mean, intellectually it's completely incoherent. They seem to have fallen - they seem to have lost the thread on what it is they're trying to do. They have no way to actually accomplish, you know, anything that looks remotely like deficit neutrality without actually sharply raising taxes on a lot of middle class people. So, it's a mess. Now, that wouldn't be the first time that something that was a mess made it through Congress. But, it's not looking very good.</p><p>JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: When you say that it's completely incoherent, what do you mean by that? When you look at the range of policies, what stands out to you as not making any sense?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, first of all, you know, they keep on saying Americans are overtaxed - the highest taxed country - that's a lie. We're not. Actually, we're just about the lowest taxed among major countries. But, still they keep on implying that they're going to do a tax cut for middle income people. They keep on saying, well, we're not going to - you know, we're responsible fiscally. And, yet, there's no way you can have what they really, really want, which is a huge tax cut for businesses - this pass- through thing which would be a huge tax cut for people with high incomes without somehow or other raising taxes on a lot of people to pay for it. So, they haven't figured out a way to make the thing hang together at all.</p><p>SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: And, don't forget the middle class tax cut that they've been promising as well.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, there is no middle class tax cut in there. In fact, there's a substantial middle class - you know, random pieces of the middle class tax increase in everything we've seen so far. So, yeah - they - I mean, they had a couple of ways they thought they were going to be able to pay for it, one of which involved, you know, repealing the Affordable Care Act ...</p><p>FU: That didn't go so well.</p><p>KRUGMAN: The other of which involved the border tax adjustment. Since both of those have died, now they have absolutely no idea how to make the arithmetic work.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You just pushed back on the idea that the United States is one of the highest taxed. You said actually it's one of the lowest.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. If you just take taxes as a share of GDP ...</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Then among advanced countries, we're right at the bottom. Now, you know, there were - you can try to make some excuses. We have a relatively high top-line corporate tax rate ...</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>KRUGMAN: But on the other hand we have lots and lots of deductions and so on. So, our effective corporate tax rate is only sort of normal and our individual taxes are definitely low. So, it's amazing that Trump just repeats this again and again. And, it's as flatly false as anything there is in the world.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: On the corporate tax side, leaving aside the individual taxes for the moment - on the corporate tax side, are there ways that you think that taxes could be reformed in a productive way that would make things more efficient - more logical?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, it's actually kind of funny. The reform that Paul Ryan originally floated early this year - the destination-based cash flow tax which included the border tax adjustment, was a not stupid idea. In fact, it was one of the few things I've seen from Paul Ryan ...</p><p>WEISENTHAL: This is a big moment where <person><nameText>Paul Krugman </nameText></person>is praising something that Paul Ryan ...</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Not stupid.</p><p>KRUGMAN: No. It's actually - in fact it has kind of bipartisan support among tax experts. People like Alan Auerbach were saying this is a good idea. I support - so, and of course, it being the one thing that I've seen from Paul Ryan that was really not a terrible idea, it died instantly in the political arena. And, without that - without the border tax adjustment that's a piece of that, there's no way to make a significant corporate - you know, cut in corporate marginal tax rates that doesn't explode the deficit.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I'll ask you about Art Laffer and the Laffer Curve and the implications for Kansas and what happened there.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is that a specific example of where something didn't go wrong because they made mistakes or does that theory just be - has been blown out of the water by the example?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Oh, it's been blown out of the water by every single example we've seen, right? There has been not a single case where anything like the Laffer Curve has seemed to be true. I mean, there was Kansas - I mean a state level is actually an especially favorable case for it because capital labor can easily flow into a state. So, the chances that cutting taxes might actually increase revenue is much higher ...</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>KRUGMAN: At the level of one state than it is for the United States as a whole. And, even so, all it did in Kansas was create a fiscal crisis. And, nothing - look, the Clinton tax hike was supposed to destroy the economy. Then we had the best boom of the post-war era. Obama substantially increased taxes in 2013. Nothing terrible happened. So, this is a - there is nothing supporting this point of view except the fact that some very rich people would like it to be true.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, based on all that, wouldn't (ph) we understand the impact of tax cuts in aggregate, is that a fair argument to make - a fair point to make?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, there is very little reason to think that tax cuts matter much one way or the other for underlying growth. I mean, the (base) would have to cut taxes is you cut tax collection. That's basically what happens.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: If you're arguing this case, that actually a lot of the financing is going to be provided by higher growth as a result of the tax cuts ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: You might as well just assume that unicorns will come and deliver packages of money, right? There's no reason to believe this.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: OK.</p><p>FU: I need to ask you about healthcare, because the President says that he plans to sign executive action to allow new health plans outside of Obamacare, creating more healthcare options for people. That's his sell. Now, experts say this would destabilize already fragile markets. So, what happens in the interim? Because, whatever plan he does open this up to wouldn't take affect right away.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. The thing however is you have - you know insurers have to make decisions about whether to participate in the market. They have to submit requests for premiums. So all of this - all of this is uncertainty is wreaking huge damage already. So, you know, premiums are going way up for 2018 and most of that - most of that is because of the Trump administration and the uncertainty it's created.</p><p>FU: So can it survive until 2019?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, yes, because most people - even in the individual market, most people are receiving subsidies which cushion them from the increases. And, then there's Medicaid, which is unaffected by all of this. So, it gets worse but it doesn't collapse.</p><p>FU: Right. Nobel Prize-winning economist Professor <person><nameText>Paul Krugman </nameText></person>is sticking with us for the next hour.</p><p>Coming up next we're going to talk about the President's search for the next fed chair and whether the central banks' independence is perhaps at risk.</p><p>This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU: What'd You Miss? Concern that the search for the next fed chair may take a political turn - Nobel Prize-winning economist <person><nameText>Paul Krugman </nameText></person>wrote in his column last week \"surely it's possible, even probable that the Federal Reserve, like other government agencies, is about the get Trumpified, that one of American policies last remaining havens of competence and expertise will soon share in the general degradation.\"</p><p>Professor Krugman is back with us and not holding back on opinion here. What is an example of a Trumpified fed pick versus one that showcases the fed's competence and expertise?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, there's a very clear dichotomy here, right? We have a perfectly fine fed chair who could be reappointed. Janet Yellen has probably every indicator - done a stellar job. Why not just keep her? On the other hand we - for a while there, the betting (ph) was kind of - the prediction markets were thinking that the most likely pick was Kevin Warsh, former fed governor who has - there's a lot of things you can say about them (ph) - but, one thing is he does have a track record over the past decade and it's quite consistent. He's been wrong about everything.</p><p>FU: Economic forecast ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: Economic forecast, worried about inflation as the world was sliding into depression, worried that terrible things - thought that fiscal policy was going to be - you know, we were going to turn into Greece. It's amazing. It's kind of almost awesome. You can almost make money by taking whatever he thinks is going to happen and betting the other way - but, politically correct from a republican point of view - has some family connections with Trump. So, that would have been - you know, he might still be appointed, although apparently his stock has declined a little bit.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: How much do you weigh concern of a - what you would see as a bad pick, and obviously it sounds like you don't think Kevin Warsh would be a good pick ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: Right.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: A bad pick versus a pick who is perceived to be at Trump's beck and call - and so, Trump calling him out - him or her out on Twitter for a rate hike - stuff like that. Which of those would concern you more?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, boy, both. I mean, in some ways - I think those go together. I don't think they really separate, because you had somebody who was actually good and respected within the fed and respects the institution of the fed - that person is also not going to be particularly pressurable by the White House. So, it's a - if you had somebody who had no real reason for being there except the fact that Trump decided that he liked him or her, although it's going to be a him, if that's who it is - then that would then be the kind of person you would worry about being politicized.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We've seen U-turns on many occasions in <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Do you think there's a chance here that his criticism of Janet Yellen was made perhaps before he'd spoken to people who may have known more about monetary policy and actually having learned subsequently - he's perhaps realizing that continuity of the fed might not be a bad thing and actually reappoint Janet Yellen at the end?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, I'm hoping so. I mean, that would be the best outcome I think given what's happening right now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But, you don't think ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: You know, his U-turns tend to be followed by further U-turns. Every time you think he's reached a reasonable agreement on something, then he finds a way to go back on it. So, I worry about that, even here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Even there.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Speaking of Janet Yellen, and speaking - getting away from the question of who the next fed chair is going to be, one of the most notable things going on in the economy is the persistent failure of the fed or the economy overall to get to 2 percent inflation - to hit the inflation goal (ph). In light of what we've seen over the last several years - all of the things that have tried - have you changed or evolved in your thinking of what the fed can do to hit inflation? What have you learned about the fed and inflation by watching this persistent short-fall?</p><p>KRUGMAN: OK. There's two different things. One is monetary policy just doesn't have that much traction when interest rates are very low. That still remains true. Even though the fed has normalized a little bit, we're still kind of in that regime ...</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Right.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Where the fed - all of the attention is on the fed and yet the fed has much less power than it would in what we used to think of as normal times.</p><p>The other thing is, there is something going on in the inflation process. It looks as if - you know, whether it's the natural rate of unemployment, if such a thing exists, is weighed down, or the Phillips Curve has gotten flatter or there's downward nominal wage rigidity or something. But, something - clearly the underlying models we were using to try to predict inflation, which were never very good, are now looking completely useless (ph).</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Do you have a favorite theory or explanation for what that something is?</p><p>KRUGMAN: I think it's a mix - there still being pent-up wage cuts that don't want to happen and there's just sort of - there's still an overhang from the past. And, I think there's nervousness. I think that people having been through the Great Recession and the long, slow recovery are just very reluctant to grant or demand wage increases that might end up being locked in during the next slump.</p><p>FU: So, does that mean that the Federal Reserve should re-think its approach to targeting 2 percent inflation? Should it give up that target?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Oh, no, on the contrary. I mean, everything we've seen that says that 2 percent inflation is if anything, too low, that given that we've seen how hard it is to get inflation up once it's too low, given that it's - I'm a secularist stagnation guy - that we really need to have the opportunity of having significantly negative real interest rates, that the fed's target should be above 2 percent ...</p><p>FU: What - 3 percent?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, I would - I mean, I would - I'm old enough. I'm older than all you guys. I remember a 4 percent. I remember Reagan's second term when we had 4 percent inflation. It wasn't so bad. It gave you a lot more room for monetary policy. So, I would go there. It's not - it's a long way from being politically acceptable but, no - by no means to say that because we're having trouble getting to the 2 percent target which actually looks too low, that we should give up on even trying to get there.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Could the fed be not hiking right now? If you were a fed chair, would you not be ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: I would not be hiking right now. I think the fed is trying to normalize and that version of normality went out the window ten years ago.</p><p>FU: Economist <person><nameText>Paul Krugman </nameText></person>is sticking with us, because we're talking about changing political dynamics in the age of Trump. We can take that in many directions.</p><p>From New York, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU: What'd You Miss? Republican Senator Bob Corker is in open opposition to the President, calling the White House \"an adult daycare center,\" and worrying whether President Trump can lead the nation to a Third World War - or, whether he would. But, perhaps the real battle is within the Republican Party itself.</p><p>We're back with <person><nameText>Paul Krugman, </nameText></person>Nobel Prize-winning economist.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Paul, one of the interesting things about Corker's comments is he said, \"There are a lot of people within my caucus who feel the same way I do.\" But of course, none of them have really called out Trump to the same degree. What do you think the reluctance is all about?</p><p>KRUGMAN: It's about their political careers. I mean, you know, I've been paying attention to this stuff for a long time and I read a lot. Today's republican legislators - people in the senate and even more so in the house, they grew up in an era of a monolithic, very tightly organized Republican Party.</p><p>These are not people who courageously staked out a position that might have been unpopular. These are people who joined the political machine that guaranteed them a good living, even if they lost an election, right? We call it \"wingnut welfare,\" all of that, right? And, so they are not - these are apparatchiks. These are not people who are going to step out and take a stand on principle. It's not the kind of people they are. It would require a lot of - Corker turns out to be a more interesting guy than we thought. But, it's also he's decided that his political career is over. There are going to be very few who are willing to do that, even under the most extreme circumstances.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But, you've got now Senator John McCain of course as well, who is getting treatment for brain cancer and you've got Bob Corker - so you've got two kind of ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: So, people who are on the edge of retirement or possibly don't have very long to live are willing to say something that I don't think is going to be enough to be an effectively large caucus.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But, in terms of trying to get legislation through, losing two big senators like that actually, is critical for the GOP.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, that's right. And, remember, we already - we already saw Obamacare repeal crash and burn ...</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Tax reform or tax reform tax or whatever it is they're trying to do on taxes is in big trouble. So, it's quite possible that they'll have a completely sterile legislative agenda - and - which, you know, from my point of view is a good thing. In any case, yes. They don't have the kind of margin that would allow them to push stuff through if they have even a few people who decide, oh, the hell with it, I'm just going to say what I think.</p><p>FU: Well, the party is in a little bit of a dilemma here, because they've rallied around principles that seem to be in opposition to themselves. For instance, they want tax cuts on investment income to boost the economy. They want tax cuts for the middle class, all the while avoiding widening the budget deficit. You can't have one without the other.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Right.</p><p>FU: Something's got to give and no one is willing to concede any of that.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. We have a phrase that's in other circumstances but it works in international economics - we talk about the impossible trinity. There are three different things that everybody wants and you can only have two of them. And, they've definitely got themselves in the impossible trinity.</p><p>They also have the problem which is that Trump sold himself to his base as a populist - I'm going to help you against the swamp and against the big guys and then everything that they're trying to do legislatively is standard republican - you know, let's give more to the oligarchy.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: How do you think the tension is going to resolve ultimately? Because, it does seem like there's - you know, the McConnell wing and the Trump wing are distinct, especially in how they see the economy and populism - taxes perhaps. Ultimately do you think the old McConnell wing will just completely be swept out?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Oh, no. If you actually look at concrete legislative measures - look at what Trump has actually proposed or at least signed on to - first on healthcare and now on taxes, it's totally been McConnell Ryan wing. There's been no hint at all of that economic populism in anything he actually does. He talks a populist game but in fact his populism never translates into economics.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Right.</p><p>KRUGMAN: He's populist on, you know, race relations. He's populist on culture war. But, on economics, there's been no - it appears to be entirely just rhetoric.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So far he hasn't gotten anything done. So, if he actually tries to get legislation passed - I mean he called Chuck Schumer apparently on Friday to try and get something done on healthcare. The risk is that perhaps he tries to see what he can get away with on tax cuts, if not tax reform. Does the sort of bipartisan outreach become the end-game here if he wants to get things done, because he's a deal-maker? He wants action - results.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, the thing about him as a deal-maker is he tends to re-neg on all of his deals, right? They thought they had a deal on the dreamers. He now suddenly ...</p><p>FU: Now they're outraged.</p><p>KRUGMAN: He said, \"I'm willing to deal on healthcare.\" But, you know, now he seems to be imposing other conditions. So, you know, who's going to make a deal with him now, really?</p><p>FU: So, what should the democrats do during this time where they may possibly be working with the President on some kind of deal even though they're not confident it's going to come to fruition - because they themselves are at risk of fracturing or splintering into an extreme left and a shrinking moderate presence (ph)?</p><p>KRUGMAN: I think that's much exaggerated. If you look on policy substance, there's really not a whole lot of division. You know, we talk about different wings of the Democratic Party but in fact the whole party is pretty much unified in anything that involves policy in the medium term.</p><p>FU: Well, right now they're unified against <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>KRUGMAN: And, they're also unified for, you know, we're going to defend Obamacare - maybe we'd like single-payer eventually, but even if you look at the standard single-payer plan, most of it is a transition to a public option. So, I think it's much less real division there. I think what the democrats probably do is they, you know, sound flexible, they talk with Trump - they make it clear, we need to talk with Trump, but they don't actually offer him anything much because, why? They know that they'll get shafted if they do and they know that the base will be angry if they do.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Sounds like the debt raise (ph), actually, doesn't it? They actually didn't give up anything and Trump did (ph).</p><p><person><nameText>Paul Krugman, </nameText></person>Nobel Prize-winning economist joins us for the market close. Stay with us. From New York, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>1556</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>1559</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What'd You Miss? Stocks climb to a record high, as the dollar weakens.</p><p>I'm Julia CHATTERLEY.</p><p>FU: I'm Scarlet Fu.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: And, I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p><p>If you're tuning in live on Twitter, we want to welcome you to our closing bell coverage every weekday from 4 to 5 pm Eastern.</p><p>FU: Let's begin with Market Minutes. Look, it's another day of record highs here for the Dow and the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ. You could see gains of anywhere from one-tenth of 1 percent to three-tenths of 1 percent. So, the big tech names are probably lagging behind, given the NASDAQ's smaller gain than the other two.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes, but new highs once again. It's pretty remarkable. The melt-up ...</p><p>FU: The melt-up continues.</p><p>All right. Let's look at some individual names here - Proctor &amp; Gamble declaring victory in its bid to keep Nelson Pelts off its board, even as Nelson Pelts' activist hedge fund try-in (ph) said the vote is still too close to call. So, that stock is down just by half of 1 percent.</p><p>Wal-Mart gaining almost 5 percent. That's a big move for Wal-Mart after announcing a $20 billion stock buy-back. Also, it says it expects U.S. e- commerce sales to surge 40 percent in the next fiscal year.</p><p>And, a quick mention here of UAL and American Air. United Continental surging after bolstering of financial outlook despite hurricanes and a continued fare war and of course as expert (ph) analysts raise their earnings forecast you can see American Airlines getting a little bit of a lift from that as well.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Finally, let's go to the government bond market - very quiet today - hardly anything going on. Tier (ph) yields unchanged. Ten-year yields down moderately. Remember bond yields was closed yesterday for Columbus Day, so this is catch-up - really nothing going on here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And, that (inaudible) in what we saw in the FX markets as well. I'm showing you a seven-day here for the dollar index. That's actually not a pretty chart, but the dollar is lower for a third day versus most of the G10 tiers (ph). I mean, we talked about those concerns about tax reform. I think we just have to take it as a pause, and the recent rallying looking like its run out of steam.</p><p>I'm showing you what's going on in Euro dollar too. Of course, we have that Catalonian presidential talk or speech today to Parliament, stepping back from the prospect of unilateral declaration of independence - he wants to engage. We have got the Euro there above 118, the figure. I also want to show you what's going on in that Euro dollar - sorry, in sterling as well. The rally now that we've seen this week to around 1 percent manufacturing and construction outcome beating (inaudible). The data is showing a pretty mixed picture I'd say for the U.S. economy here, but still more chatter about the Bank of England raising rates in November with a one and done move.</p><p>FU: And, just a quick update here on stocks, the Dow finished at a record but the S&amp;P and NASDAQ fell just short.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Finally, on commodities, let's look at oil and gold - oil gaining nearly 3 percent, rising optimism that more countries are going to join with OPEC to cut production. So, some hope (ph) diminished supply up - back up about $50 a barrel in West Texas intermediate to run 51. And, gold futures, gaining again up to just over 12.90 an ounce.</p><p>And, those are today's Market Minutes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Well, you may see a post-election market rally that wasn't predicted. We're still here with <person><nameText>Paul Krugman, </nameText></person>Nobel Prize-winning economist.</p><p>Paul, you made the call that markets would tank if President Trump were elected.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Right. And, I retracted it very soon afterwards. And, you know, I did what you should never ever do, which is to let your political, you know, biases, interfere with your judgment. I thought, this is a terrible thing, which it was, but it isn't necessarily going to be terrible for every indicator. And, so, this is a mea culpa. I did that already.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you did.</p><p>KRUGMAN: This was me doing exactly what I tell people not to do. And, you know, it's going to happen. We're all mortal. One thing is worth saying, by the way. We talk about there's a Trump bump. There's also a Merkel bump, a Macron bump, a (inaudible) bump, an (inaudible) bump - stock markets have been up all around the world. So, something's going on. People like stocks.</p><p>What is the - I always quote my old teacher, Paul Samuelson (ph), who said that the stock market had predicted nine of the last five recessions. The market may not be telling us much of anything at all, except that for some reason people are liking stocks.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We have a viewer question actually, and I think you've kind of already answered it there, asking whether the Trump stock bump reflects a fundamental change to the economy or just the expectation that business owners will eat a larger piece of the pie with employees and the public at large eating less pie and more externalities like dirty air and water?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes, or it might just reflect the fact that investors think that other investors are going to pay more for stocks. I mean, it doesn't have to mean anything much at all.</p><p>Let me say, just I am little surprised that the market doesn't worry more about the downside of a totally catastrophic response if something bad happens, you know? What if we have something really bad happen and they handle everything the way they handled Puerto Rico? That ought to be some kind of weight on the market. But, we know that markets tend not to - tend to ignore those things until they actually do happen.</p><p>FU: You know, I wanted to play for you a comment from Richard Thaler, the Nobel Prize-winning economist ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p>FU: On what he thinks about what's going on the stock market. Take a listen.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD THALER, NOBEL PRIZE WINNING ECONOMIST: I don't know about you, but I'm nervous and it seems like when investors are nervous, they're prone to being spooked and nothing seems to spook the market. As you said, it just crawls up, slowly but surely. And, if it's all based on the expectation of some big tax cut, surely investors should have lost confidence that that was going to happen, given what's happened so far out of Congress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FU: Especially what we've heard of late, Joe, which is the President is going to back to tweak the tax proposal.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Right. So, there's all this uncertainty as you said, like we've seen an example of disaster response and ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Hasn't been impressive. There is active saber rattling about North Korea now almost every other day - threat of our military conflict. So, is your theory that basically markets are not really good forward discounters - basically just take into account what already happened?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. We - it's not - that isn't even a theory. That's an observation. We know. And, some of us again remember - you know, remember the housing bubble. And, it was - that was the clearest thing I'd ever seen in my life. That was just overwhelming in numbers. And, yet, month after month the prices kept on rising and people kept saying, oh, there's no - if there were really a bubble, surely it would have burst by now. And, then one day it did.</p><p>FU: Do you see a bubble right now?</p><p>KRUGMAN: It's much less clear. Let's put it - there were - profits are high. Interest rates are still very low so it makes kind of sense for stock prices to be high, given that. It's more - in this case I don't see it's a really overwhelming bubble. I just think that there's a disaster risk that the markets are not taking into account.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: When we ask people about this though they say, look, for the first time in two decades, maybe more, we've got this synchronous growth pattern when they look around the world and actually that lifts all boats. Do you buy that?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, not necessarily, because sometimes a synchronous growth pattern means that interests rates rise which tends to - and, that's not happening. So, I don't - you know, at some level - look, Bob Schiller famously - he did a study during the '87 stock crash and he asked people, why are you selling - in real time, using fax machines, because that's all you had at the time, and the only answer that appeared with any frequency - you know, there were all kinds of (inaudible) for rationalizations (ph) - the only answer was, I'm selling because stocks - because prices are falling. I think people are buying stocks because prices are rising. And, I think that's all that's really gone ...</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Well, we have a show, so we have to have better (inaudible) than that. If only people just gave us those (inaudible).</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We need to (inaudible).</p><p>FU: Now, in terms of the economy, I wanted to get your sense of the labor market, because you can't really read too much in the latest jobs report. Yet, people were saying, oh, look at the participation rate, it's gone up. Look at earnings. It's gone up. What do you take away from the latest couple of reports and what it says about the economy?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. I'm having a hard time figuring out what the - lately I've been looking at actually at the QUIPS rate, which is back up to normal levels. And, that seems to be signaling that we really are kind of - people seem to feel that it's OK to leave a job because they can find another one, which suggests that we are kind of at full employment. Earnings are not really showing that. Wage increases are still sub-par. But, you know, maybe - and, also it's interesting that prime age labor reports participation is creeping back up to previous levels. So, all the people who said, this is structural, it really is nothing - turns out, no, it's just lack of jobs. So, there's some actual good stuff. And, I wouldn't take one month's number on the NFP very much.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: And, just a reminder. We're going to get the QUIPS rate tomorrow - the JOLTS number comes out tomorrow, so something to watch.</p><p>FU: Perfect timing.</p><p>All right. Nobel Prize-winning economist <person><nameText>Paul Krugman </nameText></person>will be sticking with us. We're going to talk about urban policy and perhaps how to avoid disasters like Hurricane Harvey in Houston - or at least it could have been minimized.</p><p>From New York, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU: What'd You Miss? We are back now with Nobel Prize-winning economist, <person><nameText>Paul Krugman. </nameText></person>And, we turn our focus to urban policy and infrastructure.</p><p>Professor, you've written about the flooding disaster that was caused by Hurricane Harvey in Houston and how it was largely due to bad policy, including unregulated development.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p>FU: Some estimates have the storm causing up to $200 billion dollars in damage.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes.</p><p>FU: So, what's the lesson here? What should be done differently?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, in Houston it's pretty clear. People have been warning about this for a long time, that it essentially - too much of it is paved. You need to have places to drain. You need to have - you know, you have to - you cannot just - in (ph) what is very much a place that nature wants to flood occasionally - even the side (ph) climate change that wants to happen, even more so now - if you have completely unregulated development then you end up with no place for water to go.</p><p>Now the funny this is - the thing that makes it agonizing is, on the other hand, in some ways Houston does it right by not restricting development in ways that prevent people from building housing. So, you know, you have a kind of extreme San Francisco-style which is nimbyism gone wild ...</p><p>FU: Yes.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Which is disastrous. And, Houston is a - has much, much cheaper housing because it didn't do that.</p><p>On the other hand, you have complete, you know, ignoring the environmental consequences of unrestricted development and we seem to find it very hard politically to find the balance there.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Right. You know, if you look at all the other boom cities over the last decade, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco - completely unaffordable for homeowners for the middle class - Houston has been a success story on this front - you know, a thriving city economically where middle class people can afford to buy a home.</p><p>KRUGMAN: That's right. No. If you look at - I mean, when they (ph) ask why does Texas grow faster in general than the rest of the country, it's none of the things that the Texans like to boast about. It's not because of low taxes. It's not because they're cruel to the poor. It's because they have a housing policy that lets you build houses which the northeast, and even worse, the far west, do not have. But - so, that's a good thing. But, you know, you have to have some place for the water to go when there's a hurricane and they haven't done that.</p><p>So, it's a real - it - no one seems to - I mean, the only city that seems to have adequate regulation - big city, and affordable housing, is Chicago. Unfortunately they've also got Chicago winters, so I don't know what you do about that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, but can you steal (ph) from them in terms of the way they've tackled this, because as you say, I mean, it's kind of bad city planning - the zoning laws - and, we've talked about them on this show before in Houston, also a huge problem. But, then you compare it to San Francisco as well and say actually, look at the situation that they've created, where people have extreme commuting, which actually I've never even heard about.</p><p>KRUGMAN: No. Well, we have - you know, we have some of that here. I know people - a couple of people who live in Bucks County and commute to Manhattan.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How long does that take?</p><p>KRUGMAN: About two hours.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. (Inaudible) four hours and ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. No. It's - the thing is, technically there are no problems. We know how to do this. We know what should be done. It's easy to throw up a list. The question is, how ...</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Politics.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Politics. And, I don't know if we've found a way to make that happen. It just seems to be - you know, de Blasio came in with very good ideas about trying to expand affordable housing and he's done what in absolute terms is quite a lot in New York. But, of course it's such a huge city that it's just a drop in the bucket relative to the size of the problem.</p><p>FU: How much are we going to rely on local politicians, city mayors, state governors to do a lot of the work here, because everything is so gummed up at the federal level?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, first of all, this is going to have to be local policy in any case.</p><p>FU: Sure.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Sure, it is going to require local politicians. The trouble - I mean, when people talk about decentralization, the fact of the matter is, by and large, with many - with honorable exceptions, but a lot of local politicians are really pretty terrible. Not that many people vote in state and local elections and so you'll often - you have machine politicians.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You're not getting the best people ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: On the whole, even - you know, much as I can denounce stuff that goes on in Congress, I'm not sure that there are many state legislatures (ph) that I would prefer.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Is there something here in New York City when you look at regulations of the housing marking that you think could be done that a mayor or city council could do to ease housing crisis?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, sure. I mean, even though we're an enormously enormous city and very dense, there's still lots of potential building. There's lots of places where we could still build up. There's still in fact land that is un-built that could be built without destroying the quality of life. There is - you know, if you're going to have a city - a metro area with 20 plus billion (ph) people, you're going to have to have some really dense developments. And, look, I live - I actually checked - my zip code has got about 70,000 per square mile. It doesn't feel impossibly overcrowded. You know, it's high rises. You can live that way and we need more of that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Nobel Prize-winning economist <person><nameText>Paul Krugman </nameText></person>is staying with us.</p><p>Up next we get his take on the political uncertainty in Europe. From New York, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Catalonia backs away from declaring independence outright. The Catalan president opted for a middle ground in his message to Parliament today, calling for talks with Spain. But, what will the recent fiscal uncertainty mean for Europe's economy? <person><nameText>Paul Krugman </nameText></person>is still with us.</p><p>Paul, let's talk about Spain to start off with. What do you think here?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, not at all familiar. I mean, I don't know Spain. I certainly don't know Catalonia. I mean, it's odd to have this timing. I mean, if you were thinking bad things were going to happen in Spain, you would have expected those three or four years ago when the Spanish economy was really in the dumps.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Spain is actually making a comeback and a fair bit of that actually in Catalonia. But, you know, having the auto industry is coming back - Spain is - it's an enormous, incredibly expensive (ph) process of internal devaluation (ph). But, they have finally been - you know, there's some light at the end of the tunnel. So, it's kind of odd to have this happening now.</p><p>Now, I understand Catalonia has in fact been deeply oppressed culturally, but you try to think about what it would mean to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain now. And, my God, it's like trying to imagine Virginia seceding again now, right? It would be a really impossible thing to happen.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But, when you look at Europe optically (ph), I mean we've got - we've had the Macron victory over in France, Angela Merkel has just come back in in Germany - yes (ph) we've got these hot spots like Italy and we've got the tensions now in Spain, but overall what's your sense of Europe at this moment?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Well, Europe - the Euro continues to function badly, right? The Euro was a mistake. It has been a big constraint. They paid a huge price in high unemployment but the political cohesiveness of Europe, with the exception of Britain, has turned out to be much stronger. I mean, us Anglo- Saxons didn't quite understand just how deep the commitment of much of the European elite was to it.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: In 10 years will all of the countries that are in the Euro zone still be there?</p><p>KRUGMAN: You know, if Greece wasn't going to leave the Euro with the 27 percent unemployment and a depression-level slump, who's going to leave? I think it's very, very hard. People just ...</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Right.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Don't want to do that, even when the economics of it makes a lot of sense.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: They always said in Brussels, \"don't underestimate Angela Merkel's will to keep this thing together.\"</p><p>FU: No, that's a really, really good point. Yet, there is an attraction to populism, right? People in Spain, people in France can't turn away from it completely. People in Germany with AfDs ...</p><p>KRUGMAN: That's right.</p><p>FU: Strong showing.</p><p>KRUGMAN: There are - everybody's got their little Trumps. Everybody's got their - and, not necessarily in countries you would think. You know, Germany - by the way, this is a demonstration that is not - economic anxiety is a very distinctly secondary thing. Germany has been the great success story this whole period. Even so, they have a resurgent hard right.</p><p>FU: All right. Well, we want to bring in some viewer questions to wrap it all up - to wrap up your hour with us.</p><p>Joe, why don't you start with this one on the broken Phillips Curve?</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Yes, so a question about the Phillips Curve - we talked about it a little bit very earlier on. What do you make of it? Some wondering if it's the changing nature of the economy from a manufacturing to a service economy - maybe it was never valid in the first place. What's your take on that debate?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes. My take is that I don't really know. We're trying - look, some things we can see. We can still see that there's an awful lot - if you look at the distribution of wage changes, there's a spike at zero, which tells us that one thing that's still going on is that people - there are still people who are - really should from a market sense be taking wage cuts and because they can't, there's kind of a pent up demand for wage decline that's sitting there.</p><p>Some of it is it may be that expectations - that after years and years of inflation falling below forecasts that that is starting to get reflected in expectations. But, I have to say, all of this stuff - I have a feeling that I'm like a pre-Copernican astronomer, you know, doing epicycles trying to make this model that really doesn't want to - so, the answer is, at some level, we don't know.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Hector (ph) is asking if it's related to the transition mechanism, though - I guess in some sense, did it fall out in the wash at some point?</p><p>KRUGMAN: I don't think that there's a - I mean, I don't think that the service economy change or any of the - in general, structural change is overrated, right? Things like - the fact of the matter - that people obviously think it's easy to find jobs, should be showing up in higher wage demands. And, why it isn't showing up is still a puzzle.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: A mystery.</p><p>FU: Janet Yellen has said so as much.</p><p>All right. Final question to you: will the fed be successful in reducing its balance sheet?</p><p>KRUGMAN: Oh, yes. I don't - that is really not - the idea (ph) that there was ever going to be a big problem there was always a fundamental misunderstanding. They have plenty of tools to offset it. If they tried to dump it all at once it would be a big problem, but I don't see any problem there.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: One last question. We just have a few seconds left. Years ago you said that big coin was even and it hasn't died yet. I'm curious whether you - what you think about it these days, because so many conversations come back to that.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Yes, I think it's still evil. I don't think that there is any very legitimate purpose for it. And, yes, it is kind of - it's suspended. I still think it's a Wiley Coyote thing, right?</p><p>WEISENTHAL: (Inaudible).</p><p>KRUGMAN: You run off the edge of the cliff. One day you look down and realize there's nothing under you. But, I've been saying that for years and it's been wrong all along.</p><p>FU: In the meantime, the legs are moving really, really, really fast.</p><p>KRUGMAN: That's right.</p><p>FU: <person><nameText>Paul Krugman, </nameText></person>thank you so much.</p><p>KRUGMAN: Thanks a lot.</p><p>FU: Thank you for spending the time with us.</p><p>Nobel Prize-winning economist - he's a columnist for the New York Times and of course, a professor at the City University of New York.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

President Donald Trump is looking for unity on tax reform. Earlier today he said that he would be making some changes to the framework that was originally unveiled last month. The announcement comes as key senators raise concerns with the specifics of the plan which includes eliminating the state and local tax deduction.  </p><p>      Let's bring in Paul Krugman. He's Nobel Prize-winning economist, columnist of the New York Times and a professor at the City University of New York.  </p><p>      Professor Krugman, it's an honor to have you on the show. Thank you so much.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Great to be on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Prospects for tax reform for this administration?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, you know, I can never - I'm not a legislative expert. I mean, intellectually it's completely incoherent. They seem to have fallen - they seem to have lost the thread on what it is they're trying to do. They have no way to actually accomplish, you know, anything that looks remotely like deficit neutrality without actually sharply raising taxes on a lot of middle class people. So, it's a mess. Now, that wouldn't be the first time that something that was a mess made it through Congress. But, it's not looking very good.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: When you say that it's completely incoherent, what do you mean by that? When you look at the range of policies, what stands out to you as not making any sense?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, first of all, you know, they keep on saying Americans are overtaxed - the highest taxed country - that's a lie. We're not. Actually, we're just about the lowest taxed among major countries. But, still they keep on implying that they're going to do a tax cut for middle income people. They keep on saying, well, we're not going to - you know, we're responsible fiscally. And, yet, there's no way you can have what they really, really want, which is a huge tax cut for businesses - this pass-through thing which would be a huge tax cut for people with high incomes without somehow or other raising taxes on a lot of people to pay for it. So, they haven't figured out a way to make the thing hang together at all.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: And, don't forget the middle class tax cut that they've been promising as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, there is no middle class tax cut in there. In fact, there's a substantial middle class - you know, random pieces of the middle class tax increase in everything we've seen so far. So, yeah - they - I mean, they had a couple of ways they thought they were going to be able to pay for it, one of which involved, you know, repealing the Affordable Care Act  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: That didn't go so well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: The other of which involved the border tax adjustment. Since both of those have died, now they have absolutely no idea how to make the arithmetic work.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: You just pushed back on the idea that the United States is one of the highest taxed. You said actually it's one of the lowest.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Yes. If you just take taxes as a share of GDP   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Then among advanced countries, we're right at the bottom. Now, you know, there were - you can try to make some excuses. We have a relatively high top-line corporate tax rate   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: But on the other hand we have lots and lots of deductions and so on. So, our effective corporate tax rate is only sort of normal and our individual taxes are definitely low. So, it's amazing that Trump just repeats this again and again. And, it's as flatly false as anything there is in the world.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: On the corporate tax side, leaving aside the individual taxes for the moment - on the corporate tax side, are there ways that you think that taxes could be reformed in a productive way that would make things more efficient - more logical?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, it's actually kind of funny. The reform that Paul Ryan originally floated early this year - the destination-based cash flow tax which included the border tax adjustment, was a not stupid idea. In fact, it was one of the few things I've seen from Paul Ryan   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: This is a big moment where Paul Krugman is praising something that Paul Ryan   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Not stupid.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: No. It's actually - in fact it has kind of bipartisan support among tax experts. People like Alan Auerbach were saying this is a good idea. I support - so, and of course, it being the one thing that I've seen from Paul Ryan that was really not a terrible idea, it died instantly in the political arena. And, without that - without the border tax adjustment that's a piece of that, there's no way to make a significant corporate - you know, cut in corporate marginal tax rates that doesn't explode the deficit.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: I'll ask you about Art Laffer and the Laffer Curve and the implications for Kansas and what happened there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Is that a specific example of where something didn't go wrong because they made mistakes or does that theory just be - has been blown out of the water by the example?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Oh, it's been blown out of the water by every single example we've seen, right? There has been not a single case where anything like the Laffer Curve has seemed to be true. I mean, there was Kansas - I mean a state level is actually an especially favorable case for it because capital labor can easily flow into a state. So, the chances that cutting taxes might actually increase revenue is much higher   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: At the level of one state than it is for the United States as a whole. And, even so, all it did in Kansas was create a fiscal crisis. And, nothing - look, the Clinton tax hike was supposed to destroy the economy. Then we had the best boom of the post-war era. Obama substantially increased taxes in 2013. Nothing terrible happened. So, this is a - there is nothing supporting this point of view except the fact that some very rich people would like it to be true.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: So, based on all that, wouldn't (ph) we understand the impact of tax cuts in aggregate, is that a fair argument to make - a fair point to make?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, there is very little reason to think that tax cuts matter much one way or the other for underlying growth. I mean, the (base) would have to cut taxes is you cut tax collection. That's basically what happens.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: If you're arguing this case, that actually a lot of the financing is going to be provided by higher growth as a result of the tax cuts   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: You might as well just assume that unicorns will come and deliver packages of money, right? There's no reason to believe this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: I need to ask you about healthcare, because the President says that he plans to sign executive action to allow new health plans outside of Obamacare, creating more healthcare options for people. That's his sell. Now, experts say this would destabilize already fragile markets. So, what happens in the interim? Because, whatever plan he does open this up to wouldn't take affect right away.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Yes. The thing however is you have - you know insurers have to make decisions about whether to participate in the market. They have to submit requests for premiums. So all of this - all of this is uncertainty is wreaking huge damage already. So, you know, premiums are going way up for 2018 and most of that - most of that is because of the Trump administration and the uncertainty it's created.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: So can it survive until 2019?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, yes, because most people - even in the individual market, most people are receiving subsidies which cushion them from the increases. And, then there's Medicaid, which is unaffected by all of this. So, it gets worse but it doesn't collapse.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Right. Nobel Prize-winning economist Professor Paul Krugman is sticking with us for the next hour.   </p><p>      Coming up next we're going to talk about the President's search for the next fed chair and whether the central banks' independence is perhaps at risk.  </p><p>      This is Bloomberg.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: What'd You Miss? Concern that the search for the next fed chair may take a political turn - Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman wrote in his column last week \"surely it's possible, even probable that the Federal Reserve, like other government agencies, is about the get Trumpified, that one of American policies last remaining havens of competence and expertise will soon share in the general degradation.\"  </p><p>      Professor Krugman is back with us and not holding back on opinion here. What is an example of a Trumpified fed pick versus one that showcases the fed's competence and expertise?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, there's a very clear dichotomy here, right? We have a perfectly fine fed chair who could be reappointed. Janet Yellen has probably every indicator - done a stellar job. Why not just keep her? On the other hand we - for a while there, the betting (ph) was kind of - the prediction markets were thinking that the most likely pick was Kevin Warsh, former fed governor who has - there's a lot of things you can say about them (ph) - but, one thing is he does have a track record over the past decade and it's quite consistent. He's been wrong about everything.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Economic forecast   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Economic forecast, worried about inflation as the world was sliding into depression, worried that terrible things - thought that fiscal policy was going to be - you know, we were going to turn into Greece. It's amazing. It's kind of almost awesome. You can almost make money by taking whatever he thinks is going to happen and betting the other way - but, politically correct from a republican point of view - has some family connections with Trump. So, that would have been - you know, he might still be appointed, although apparently his stock has declined a little bit.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: How much do you weigh concern of a - what you would see as a bad pick, and obviously it sounds like you don't think Kevin Warsh would be a good pick   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: A bad pick versus a pick who is perceived to be at Trump's beck and call - and so, Trump calling him out - him or her out on Twitter for a rate hike - stuff like that. Which of those would concern you more?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, boy, both. I mean, in some ways - I think those go together. I don't think they really separate, because you had somebody who was actually good and respected within the fed and respects the institution of the fed - that person is also not going to be particularly pressurable by the White House. So, it's a - if you had somebody who had no real reason for being there except the fact that Trump decided that he liked him or her, although it's going to be a him, if that's who it is - then that would then be the kind of person you would worry about being politicized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: We've seen U-turns on many occasions in Donald Trump. Do you think there's a chance here that his criticism of Janet Yellen was made perhaps before he'd spoken to people who may have known more about monetary policy and actually having learned subsequently - he's perhaps realizing that continuity of the fed might not be a bad thing and actually reappoint Janet Yellen at the end?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, I'm hoping so. I mean, that would be the best outcome I think given what's happening right now.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: But, you don't think   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: You know, his U-turns tend to be followed by further U- turns. Every time you think he's reached a reasonable agreement on something, then he finds a way to go back on it. So, I worry about that, even here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Even there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Speaking of Janet Yellen, and speaking - getting away from the question of who the next fed chair is going to be, one of the most notable things going on in the economy is the persistent failure of the fed or the economy overall to get to 2 percent inflation - to hit the inflation goal (ph). In light of what we've seen over the last several years - all of the things that have tried - have you changed or evolved in your thinking of what the fed can do to hit inflation? What have you learned about the fed and inflation by watching this persistent short-fall?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: OK. There's two different things. One is monetary policy just doesn't have that much traction when interest rates are very low. That still remains true. Even though the fed has normalized a little bit, we're still kind of in that regime   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Where the fed - all of the attention is on the fed and yet the fed has much less power than it would in what we used to think of as normal times.  </p><p>      The other thing is, there is something going on in the inflation process. It looks as if - you know, whether it's the natural rate of unemployment, if such a thing exists, is weighed down, or the Phillips Curve has gotten flatter or there's downward nominal wage rigidity or something. But, something - clearly the underlying models we were using to try to predict inflation, which were never very good, are now looking completely useless (ph).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Do you have a favorite theory or explanation for what that something is?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: I think it's a mix - there still being pent-up wage cuts that don't want to happen and there's just sort of - there's still an overhang from the past. And, I think there's nervousness. I think that people having been through the Great Recession and the long, slow recovery are just very reluctant to grant or demand wage increases that might end up being locked in during the next slump.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: So, does that mean that the Federal Reserve should re-think its approach to targeting 2 percent inflation? Should it give up that target?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Oh, no, on the contrary. I mean, everything we've seen that says that 2 percent inflation is if anything, too low, that given that we've seen how hard it is to get inflation up once it's too low, given that it's - I'm a secularist stagnation guy - that we really need to have the opportunity of having significantly negative real interest rates, that the fed's target should be above 2 percent   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: What - 3 percent?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, I would - I mean, I would - I'm old enough. I'm older than all you guys. I remember a 4 percent. I remember Reagan's second term when we had 4 percent inflation. It wasn't so bad. It gave you a lot more room for monetary policy. So, I would go there. It's not - it's a long way from being politically acceptable but, no - by no means to say that because we're having trouble getting to the 2 percent target which actually looks too low, that we should give up on even trying to get there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Could the fed be not hiking right now? If you were a fed chair, would you not be   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: I would not be hiking right now. I think the fed is trying to normalize and that version of normality went out the window ten years ago.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Economist Paul Krugman is sticking with us, because we're talking about changing political dynamics in the age of Trump.  We can take that in many directions.  </p><p>      From New York, this is Bloomberg.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: What'd You Miss? Republican Senator Bob Corker is in open opposition to the President, calling the White House \"an adult daycare center,\" and worrying whether President Trump can lead the nation to a Third World War - or, whether he would. But, perhaps the real battle is within the Republican Party itself.   </p><p>      We're back with Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize-winning economist. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Paul, one of the interesting things about Corker's comments is he said, \"There are a lot of people within my caucus who feel the same way I do.\" But of course, none of them have really called out Trump to the same degree. What do you think the reluctance is all about?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: It's about their political careers. I mean, you know, I've been paying attention to this stuff for a long time and I read a lot. Today's republican legislators - people in the senate and even more so in the house, they grew up in an era of a monolithic, very tightly organized Republican Party.   </p><p>      These are not people who courageously staked out a position that might have been unpopular. These are people who joined the political machine that guaranteed them a good living, even if they lost an election, right? We call it \"wingnut welfare,\" all of that, right? And, so they are not - these are apparatchiks. These are not people who are going to step out and take a stand on principle. It's not the kind of people they are. It would require a lot of - Corker turns out to be a more interesting guy than we thought. But, it's also he's decided that his political career is over. There are going to be very few who are willing to do that, even under the most extreme circumstances.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: But, you've got now Senator John McCain of course as well, who is getting treatment for brain cancer and you've got Bob Corker - so you've got two kind of   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: So, people who are on the edge of retirement or possibly don't have very long to live are willing to say something that I don't think is going to be enough to be an effectively large caucus.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: But, in terms of trying to get legislation through, losing two big senators like that actually, is critical for the GOP.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, that's right. And, remember, we already - we already saw Obamacare repeal crash and burn   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Tax reform or tax reform tax or whatever it is they're trying to do on taxes is in big trouble. So, it's quite possible that they'll have a completely sterile legislative agenda - and - which, you know, from my point of view is a good thing. In any case, yes. They don't have the kind of margin that would allow them to push stuff through if they have even a few people who decide, oh, the hell with it, I'm just going to say what I think.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Well, the party is in a little bit of a dilemma here, because they've rallied around principles that seem to be in opposition to themselves. For instance, they want tax cuts on investment income to boost the economy. They want tax cuts for the middle class, all the while avoiding widening the budget deficit. You can't have one without the other.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Right. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Something's got to give and no one is willing to concede any of that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Yes. We have a phrase that's in other circumstances but it works in international economics - we talk about the impossible trinity. There are three different things that everybody wants and you can only have two of them. And, they've definitely got themselves in the impossible trinity.  </p><p>      They also have the problem which is that Trump sold himself to his base as a populist - I'm going to help you against the swamp and against the big guys and then everything that they're trying to do legislatively is standard republican - you know, let's give more to the oligarchy.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: How do you think the tension is going to resolve ultimately? Because, it does seem like there's - you know, the McConnell wing and the Trump wing are distinct, especially in how they see the economy and populism - taxes perhaps. Ultimately do you think the old McConnell wing will just completely be swept out?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Oh, no. If you actually look at concrete legislative measures - look at what Trump has actually proposed or at least signed on to - first on healthcare and now on taxes, it's totally been McConnell Ryan wing. There's been no hint at all of that economic populism in anything he actually does. He talks a populist game but in fact his populism never translates into economics.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: He's populist on, you know, race relations. He's populist on culture war. But, on economics, there's been no - it appears to be entirely just rhetoric.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: So far he hasn't gotten anything done. So, if he actually tries to get legislation passed - I mean he called Chuck Schumer apparently on Friday to try and get something done on healthcare. The risk is that perhaps he tries to see what he can get away with on tax cuts, if not tax reform. Does the sort of bipartisan outreach become the end-game here if he wants to get things done, because he's a deal-maker? He wants action - results.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, the thing about him as a deal-maker is he tends to re-neg on all of his deals, right? They thought they had a deal on the dreamers. He now suddenly   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Now they're outraged.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: He said, \"I'm willing to deal on healthcare.\" But, you know, now he seems to be imposing other conditions. So, you know, who's going to make a deal with him now, really?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: So, what should the democrats do during this time where they may possibly be working with the President on some kind of deal even though they're not confident it's going to come to fruition - because they themselves are at risk of fracturing or splintering into an extreme left and a shrinking moderate presence (ph)?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: I think that's much exaggerated. If you look on policy substance, there's really not a whole lot of division. You know, we talk about different wings of the Democratic Party but in fact the whole party is pretty much unified in anything that involves policy in the medium term.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Well, right now they're unified against Donald Trump.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: And, they're also unified for, you know, we're going to defend Obamacare - maybe we'd like single-payer eventually, but even if you look at the standard single-payer plan, most of it is a transition to a public option. So, I think it's much less real division there. I think what the democrats probably do is they, you know, sound flexible, they talk with Trump - they make it clear, we need to talk with Trump, but they don't actually offer him anything much because, why? They know that they'll get shafted if they do and they know that the base will be angry if they do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Sounds like the debt raise (ph), actually, doesn't it? They actually didn't give up anything and Trump did (ph).  </p><p>      Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize-winning economist joins us for the market close. Stay with us. From New York, this is Bloomberg.  </p><p>      1556  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      1559  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: What'd You Miss? Stocks climb to a record high, as the dollar weakens.   </p><p>      I'm Julia CHATTERLEY.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: I'm Scarlet Fu.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: And, I'm Joe Weisenthal.  </p><p>      If you're tuning in live on Twitter, we want to welcome you to our closing bell coverage every weekday from 4 to 5 pm Eastern.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Let's begin with Market Minutes.  Look, it's another day of record highs here for the Dow and the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ.  You could see gains of anywhere from one-tenth of 1 percent to three-tenths of 1 percent. So, the big tech names are probably lagging behind, given the NASDAQ's smaller gain than the other two.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Yes, but new highs once again. It's pretty remarkable. The melt-up   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: The melt-up continues.  </p><p>      All right. Let's look at some individual names here - Proctor &amp; Gamble declaring victory in its bid to keep Nelson Pelts off its board, even as Nelson Pelts' activist hedge fund try-in (ph) said the vote is still too close to call. So, that stock is down just by half of 1 percent.  </p><p>Wal-Mart gaining almost 5 percent. That's a big move for Wal-Mart after announcing a $20 billion stock buy-back. Also, it says it expects U.S. e-commerce sales to surge 40 percent in the next fiscal year.  </p><p>      And, a quick mention here of UAL and American Air. United Continental surging after bolstering of financial outlook despite hurricanes and a continued fare war and of course as expert (ph) analysts raise their earnings forecast you can see American Airlines getting a little bit of a lift from that as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Finally, let's go to the government bond market - very quiet today - hardly anything going on. Tier (ph) yields unchanged. Ten-year yields down moderately. Remember bond yields was closed yesterday for Columbus Day, so this is catch-up - really nothing going on here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: And, that (inaudible) in what we saw in the FX markets as well. I'm showing you a seven-day here for the dollar index. That's actually not a pretty chart, but the dollar is lower for a third day versus most of the G10 tiers (ph). I mean, we talked about those concerns about tax reform. I think we just have to take it as a pause, and the recent rallying looking like its run out of steam.   </p><p>      I'm showing you what's going on in Euro dollar too. Of course, we have that Catalonian presidential talk or speech today to Parliament, stepping back from the prospect of unilateral declaration of independence - he wants to engage. We have got the Euro there above 118, the figure. I also want to show you what's going on in that Euro dollar - sorry, in sterling as well. The rally now that we've seen this week to around 1 percent manufacturing and construction outcome beating (inaudible). The data is showing a pretty mixed picture I'd say for the U.S. economy here, but still more chatter about the Bank of England raising rates in November with a one and done move.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: And, just a quick update here on stocks, the Dow finished at a record but the S&amp;P and NASDAQ fell just short.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Finally, on commodities, let's look at oil and gold - oil gaining nearly 3 percent, rising optimism that more countries are going to join with OPEC to cut production. So, some hope (ph) diminished supply up - back up about $50 a barrel in West Texas intermediate to run 51. And, gold futures, gaining again up to just over 12.90 an ounce.  </p><p>      And, those are today's Market Minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Well, you may see a post-election market rally that wasn't predicted. We're still here with Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize- winning economist.  </p><p>      Paul, you made the call that markets would tank if President Trump were elected. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Right. And, I retracted it very soon afterwards. And, you know, I did what you should never ever do, which is to let your political, you know, biases, interfere with your judgment. I thought, this is a terrible thing, which it was, but it isn't necessarily going to be terrible for every indicator. And, so, this is a mea culpa. I did that already.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Yes, you did.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: This was me doing exactly what I tell people not to do. And, you know, it's going to happen. We're all mortal. One thing is worth saying, by the way. We talk about there's a Trump bump. There's also a Merkel bump, a Macron bump, a (inaudible) bump, an (inaudible) bump - stock markets have been up all around the world. So, something's going on. People like stocks.  </p><p>      What is the - I always quote my old teacher, Paul Samuelson (ph), who said that the stock market had predicted nine of the last five recessions.  The market may not be telling us much of anything at all, except that for some reason people are liking stocks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: We have a viewer question actually, and I think you've kind of already answered it there, asking whether the Trump stock bump reflects a fundamental change to the economy or just the expectation that business owners will eat a larger piece of the pie with employees and the public at large eating less pie and more externalities like dirty air and water?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Yes, or it might just reflect the fact that investors think that other investors are going to pay more for stocks. I mean, it doesn't have to mean anything much at all.  </p><p>      Let me say, just I am little surprised that the market doesn't worry more about the downside of a totally catastrophic response if something bad happens, you know? What if we have something really bad happen and they handle everything the way they handled Puerto Rico? That ought to be some kind of weight on the market. But, we know that markets tend not to - tend to ignore those things until they actually do happen.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: You know, I wanted to play for you a comment from Richard Thaler, the Nobel Prize-winning economist ...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: On what he thinks about what's going on the stock market. Take a listen.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Here he is.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARD THALER, NOBEL PRIZE WINNING ECONOMIST</emphasis>: I don't know about you, but I'm nervous and it seems like when investors are nervous, they're prone to being spooked and nothing seems to spook the market. As you said, it just crawls up, slowly but surely. And, if it's all based on the expectation of some big tax cut, surely investors should have lost confidence that that was going to happen, given what's happened so far out of Congress.  </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Especially what we've heard of late, Joe, which is the President is going to back to tweak the tax proposal.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Right. So, there's all this uncertainty as you said, like we've seen an example of disaster response and   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Hasn't been impressive. There is active saber rattling about North Korea now almost every other day - threat of our military conflict. So, is your theory that basically markets are not really good forward discounters - basically just take into account what already happened?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Yes. We - it's not - that isn't even a theory. That's an observation. We know. And, some of us again remember - you know, remember the housing bubble. And, it was - that was the clearest thing I'd ever seen in my life. That was just overwhelming in numbers. And, yet, month after month the prices kept on rising and people kept saying, oh, there's no - if there were really a bubble, surely it would have burst by now. And, then one day it did.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Do you see a bubble right now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: It's much less clear. Let's put it - there were - profits are high. Interest rates are still very low so it makes kind of sense for stock prices to be high, given that. It's more - in this case I don't see it's a really overwhelming bubble. I just think that there's a disaster risk that the markets are not taking into account.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: When we ask people about this though they say, look, for the first time in two decades, maybe more, we've got this synchronous growth pattern when they look around the world and actually that lifts all boats. Do you buy that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, not necessarily, because sometimes a synchronous growth pattern means that interests rates rise which tends to - and, that's not happening. So, I don't - you know, at some level - look, Bob Schiller famously - he did a study during the '87 stock crash and he asked people, why are you selling - in real time, using fax machines, because that's all you had at the time, and the only answer that appeared with any frequency - you know, there were all kinds of (inaudible) for rationalizations (ph) - the only answer was, I'm selling because stocks - because prices are falling. I think people are buying stocks because prices are rising. And, I think that's all that's really gone   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Well, we have a show, so we have to have better (inaudible) than that. If only people just gave us those (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: We need to (inaudible). </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Now, in terms of the economy, I wanted to get your sense of the labor market, because you can't really read too much in the latest jobs report. Yet, people were saying, oh, look at the participation rate, it's gone up. Look at earnings. It's gone up. What do you take away from the latest couple of reports and what it says about the economy?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Yes. I'm having a hard time figuring out what the - lately I've been looking at actually at the QUIPS rate, which is back up to normal levels. And, that seems to be signaling that we really are kind of - people seem to feel that it's OK to leave a job because they can find another one, which suggests that we are kind of at full employment. Earnings are not really showing that. Wage increases are still sub-par. But, you know, maybe - and, also it's interesting that prime age labor reports participation is creeping back up to previous levels. So, all the people who said, this is structural, it really is nothing - turns out, no, it's just lack of jobs. So, there's some actual good stuff. And, I wouldn't take one month's number on the NFP very much.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: And, just a reminder. We're going to get the QUIPS rate tomorrow - the JOLTS number comes out tomorrow, so something to watch.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Perfect timing.  </p><p>      All right.  Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman will be sticking with us. We're going to talk about urban policy and perhaps how to avoid disasters like Hurricane Harvey in Houston - or at least it could have been minimized.  </p><p>      From New York, this is Bloomberg.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: What'd You Miss? We are back now with Nobel Prize-winning economist, Paul Krugman. And, we turn our focus to urban policy and infrastructure.  </p><p>      Professor, you've written about the flooding disaster that was caused by Hurricane Harvey in Houston and how it was largely due to bad policy, including unregulated development.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Some estimates have the storm causing up to $200 billion dollars in damage.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: So, what's the lesson here? What should be done differently?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, in Houston it's pretty clear. People have been warning about this for a long time, that it essentially - too much of it is paved. You need to have places to drain. You need to have - you know, you have to - you cannot just - in (ph) what is very much a place that nature wants to flood occasionally - even the side (ph) climate change that wants to happen, even more so now - if you have completely unregulated development then you end up with no place for water to go.  </p><p>      Now the funny this is - the thing that makes it agonizing is, on the other hand, in some ways Houston does it right by not restricting development in ways that prevent people from building housing. So, you know, you have a kind of extreme San Francisco-style which is nimbyism gone wild   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Which is disastrous. And, Houston is a - has much, much cheaper housing because it didn't do that.   </p><p>      On the other hand, you have complete, you know, ignoring the environmental consequences of unrestricted development and we seem to find it very hard politically to find the balance there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Right. You know, if you look at all the other boom cities over the last decade, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco - completely unaffordable for homeowners for the middle class - Houston has been a success story on this front - you know, a thriving city economically where middle class people can afford to buy a home.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: That's right. No. If you look at - I mean, when they (ph) ask why does Texas grow faster in general than the rest of the country, it's none of the things that the Texans like to boast about. It's not because of low taxes. It's not because they're cruel to the poor. It's because they have a housing policy that lets you build houses which the northeast, and even worse, the far west, do not have. But - so, that's a good thing. But, you know, you have to have some place for the water to go when there's a hurricane and they haven't done that.  </p><p>      So, it's a real - it - no one seems to - I mean, the only city that seems to have adequate regulation - big city, and affordable housing, is Chicago. Unfortunately they've also got Chicago winters, so I don't know what you do about that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Yes, but can you steal (ph) from them in terms of the way they've tackled this, because as you say, I mean, it's kind of bad city planning - the zoning laws - and, we've talked about them on this show before in Houston, also a huge problem. But, then you compare it to San Francisco as well and say actually, look at the situation that they've created, where people have extreme commuting, which actually I've never even heard about.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: No. Well, we have - you know, we have some of that here. I know people - a couple of people who live in Bucks County and commute to Manhattan.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: How long does that take?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: About two hours.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Wow. (Inaudible) four hours and   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Yes. No. It's - the thing is, technically there are no problems. We know how to do this. We know what should be done. It's easy to throw up a list. The question is, how   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Politics.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Politics. And, I don't know if we've found a way to make that happen. It just seems to be - you know, de Blasio came in with very good ideas about trying to expand affordable housing and he's done what in absolute terms is quite a lot in New York. But, of course it's such a huge city that it's just a drop in the bucket relative to the size of the problem.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: How much are we going to rely on local politicians, city mayors, state governors to do a lot of the work here, because everything is so gummed up at the federal level?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, first of all, this is going to have to be local policy in any case.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Sure, it is going to require local politicians. The trouble - I mean, when people talk about decentralization, the fact of the matter is, by and large, with many - with honorable exceptions, but a lot of local politicians are really pretty terrible. Not that many people vote in state and local elections and so you'll often - you have machine politicians.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: You're not getting the best people   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: On the whole, even - you know, much as I can denounce stuff that goes on in Congress, I'm not sure that there are many state legislatures (ph) that I would prefer.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Is there something here in New York City when you look at regulations of the housing marking that you think could be done that a mayor or city council could do to ease housing crisis?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, sure. I mean, even though we're an enormously enormous city and very dense, there's still lots of potential building. There's lots of places where we could still build up. There's still in fact land that is un-built that could be built without destroying the quality of life. There is - you know, if you're going to have a city - a metro area with 20 plus billion (ph) people, you're going to have to have some really dense developments. And, look, I live - I actually checked - my zip code has got about 70,000 per square mile. It doesn't feel impossibly overcrowded. You know, it's high rises. You can live that way and we need more of that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman is staying with us.  </p><p>      Up next we get his take on the political uncertainty in Europe. From New York, this is Bloomberg. </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Catalonia backs away from declaring independence outright. The Catalan president opted for a middle ground in his message to Parliament today, calling for talks with Spain. But, what will the recent fiscal uncertainty mean for Europe's economy? Paul Krugman is still with us.  </p><p>      Paul, let's talk about Spain to start off with. What do you think here?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, not at all familiar. I mean, I don't know Spain. I certainly don't know Catalonia. I mean, it's odd to have this timing. I mean, if you were thinking bad things were going to happen in Spain, you would have expected those three or four years ago when the Spanish economy was really in the dumps.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Spain is actually making a comeback and a fair bit of that actually in Catalonia. But, you know, having the auto industry is coming back - Spain is - it's an enormous, incredibly expensive (ph) process of internal devaluation (ph). But, they have finally been - you know, there's some light at the end of the tunnel. So, it's kind of odd to have this happening now.  </p><p>      Now, I understand Catalonia has in fact been deeply oppressed culturally, but you try to think about what it would mean to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain now. And, my God, it's like trying to imagine Virginia seceding again now, right? It would be a really impossible thing to happen.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: But, when you look at Europe optically (ph), I mean we've got - we've had the Macron victory over in France, Angela Merkel has just come back in in Germany - yes (ph) we've got these hot spots like Italy and we've got the tensions now in Spain, but overall what's your sense of Europe at this moment?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Well, Europe - the Euro continues to function badly, right? The Euro was a mistake. It has been a big constraint. They paid a huge price in high unemployment but the political cohesiveness of Europe, with the exception of Britain, has turned out to be much stronger. I mean, us Anglo-Saxons didn't quite understand just how deep the commitment of much of the European elite was to it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: In 10 years will all of the countries that are in the Euro zone still be there?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: You know, if Greece wasn't going to leave the Euro with the 27 percent unemployment and a depression-level slump, who's going to leave? I think it's very, very hard. People just   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Don't want to do that, even when the economics of it makes a lot of sense. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: They always said in Brussels, \"don't underestimate Angela Merkel's will to keep this thing together.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: No, that's a really, really good point. Yet, there is an attraction to populism, right? People in Spain, people in France can't turn away from it completely. People in Germany with AfDs   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: That's right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Strong showing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: There are - everybody's got their little Trumps. Everybody's got their - and, not necessarily in countries you would think. You know, Germany - by the way, this is a demonstration that is not - economic anxiety is a very distinctly secondary thing. Germany has been the great success story this whole period. Even so, they have a resurgent hard right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: All right. Well, we want to bring in some viewer questions to wrap it all up - to wrap up your hour with us.  </p><p>      Joe, why don't you start with this one on the broken Phillips Curve?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Yes, so a question about the Phillips Curve - we talked about it a little bit very earlier on. What do you make of it? Some wondering if it's the changing nature of the economy from a manufacturing to a service economy - maybe it was never valid in the first place. What's your take on that debate?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Yes. My take is that I don't really know. We're trying - look, some things we can see. We can still see that there's an awful lot - if you look at the distribution of wage changes, there's a spike at zero, which tells us that one thing that's still going on is that people - there are still people who are - really should from a market sense be taking wage cuts and because they can't, there's kind of a pent up demand for wage decline that's sitting there.  </p><p>      Some of it is it may be that expectations - that after years and years of inflation falling below forecasts that that is starting to get reflected in expectations. But, I have to say, all of this stuff - I have a feeling that I'm like a pre-Copernican astronomer, you know, doing epicycles trying to make this model that really doesn't want to - so, the answer is, at some level, we don't know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Hector (ph) is asking if it's related to the transition mechanism, though - I guess in some sense, did it fall out in the wash at some point?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: I don't think that there's a - I mean, I don't think that the service economy change or any of the - in general, structural change is overrated, right? Things like - the fact of the matter - that people obviously think it's easy to find jobs, should be showing up in higher wage demands. And, why it isn't showing up is still a puzzle.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: A mystery.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Janet Yellen has said so as much.   </p><p>      All right. Final question to you: will the fed be successful in reducing its balance sheet?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Oh, yes. I don't - that is really not - the idea (ph) that there was ever going to be a big problem there was always a fundamental misunderstanding. They have plenty of tools to offset it. If they tried to dump it all at once it would be a big problem, but I don't see any problem there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: One last question. We just have a few seconds left. Years ago you said that big coin was even and it hasn't died yet. I'm curious whether you - what you think about it these days, because so many conversations come back to that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Yes, I think it's still evil. I don't think that there is any very legitimate purpose for it. And, yes, it is kind of - it's suspended. I still think it's a Wiley Coyote thing, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: (Inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: You run off the edge of the cliff. One day you look down and realize there's nothing under you. But, I've been saying that for years and it's been wrong all along.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: In the meantime, the legs are moving really, really, really fast.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: That's right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Paul Krugman, thank you so much.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KRUGMAN</emphasis>: Thanks a lot.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Thank you for spending the time with us.  </p><p>      Nobel Prize-winning economist - he's a columnist for the New York Times and of course, a professor at the City University of New York.       </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 percent ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Last month WhatsApp published a statement saying it had filed a complaint in the US federal courts against NSO, drawing heavily on genuine public concerns about privacy.</p><p>\"Mobile phones provide us with great utility, but turned against us they can reveal our locations and our private messages and record sensitive conversations we have with others...governments and companies need to do more to protect vulnerable groups and individuals from these attacks.\"</p><p>But the same accusation could easily be levelled at WhatsApp. Last year, inspired by an interview given by the former director of GCHQ, Robert Hannigan, on the BBC's Today programme, I examined WhatsApp terms and conditions to see exactly what happens when we click to accept. Mr Hannigan's view is that Facebook's primary goal is to squeeze every drop of profit from its users' data.</p><p>\"This isn't a kind of fluffy charity providing free services,\" he said, \"It's a very hardheaded international business and these big tech companies are essentially the world's biggest global advertisers, that's where they make their billions.\"</p><p>I would go further: if we're talking about technology that can be turned against us, then frankly WhatsApp is the world leader in information exploitation and bulk data collection. Most people, of course, don't read the terms and conditions.</p><p>Why would we when WhatsApp's extend to 29 pages of legalese? The first condition we, as users, agree to is that \"WhatsApp works and shares information with other Facebook companies.\"</p><p>This means our details are shared with dozens of other companies, all in the field of data user collection.</p><p>Another reads: \"You provide us ...t he phone number of WhatsApp users and other contacts in your mobile address book on a regular basis.\"</p><p>In other words, this is the entirety of your business and social network, your intellectual property and that of your employers and/or employees.</p><p>This is the reason companies, corporations and governments need to be wary when permitting the use of platforms like WhatsApp - it's all too easy to simply click away company data.</p><p>WhatsApp's privacy policy covers \"the collection, use, processing and sharing of...information to the United States and other countries globally where we have or use facilities, service providers, affiliated companies and partners ... you grant WhatsApp a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty free ... licence to use, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, display and perform the information (including your content) you upload, submit, store, send or receive...\".</p><p>In the US, the lawsuits against Facebook over data privacy issues are piling up, which might explain why it's working so hard to shift the debate in its favour. One, Zellmer vs Facebook, is a class action that highlights the case of Clayton Zellmer who, despite never registering for a Facebook account, says the firm has still built a facial biometric profile for him based on photos uploaded by other users.</p><p>According to the legal papers, Facebook has used advanced facial recognition technology to create and store detailed face templates from more than 1 billion users, potentially putting us at risk from identify theft if these identifiers fall into the wrong hands.</p><p>READ MORE:\u00a0Pochettino plays down team unrest after WhatsApp dinner invite</p><p>All of this hardly makes WhatsApp the protector of privacy and security. But there is another reason Facebook is keen to flex its muscles by taking on NSO. Founder Mark Zuckerberg wants to establish end-to-end encryption across all three of its apps, including Messenger and Instagram, a move which the US and the UK governments warn will allow paedophiles, terrorists and other serious criminals to conceal their activities.</p><p>The US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children have estimated that 70 per cent of the illegal content and activity would be lost with encryption. The simple fact is that all those in Silicon Valley have engineered us to agree, on a mass scale, to the bulk collection of our data. When playing the privacy card to galvanise support, Will Cathcart might start a little closer to home.</p><p>- Paul Manister is a communications security consultant.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HRDSCL-18022857</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HRDSCL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFR-4661-F0JC-M28M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464262</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"906\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Scotland</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2880\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But he said work remains, likely after he leaves office, to rein in health care programs for retirees and the poor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Ryan's remarks came at a Wisconsin Manufacturers &amp; Commerce event in Madison. They were his first in public in his home state since he revealed last week that he won't seek re-election after two decades in Congress.</p><p> A U.S. Senate committee last week held a hearing to grill Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg about data privacy for users, among other topics. Asked what the role of federal government is in online data privacy, Ryan said \"there's clearly a role,\" without naming specific companies.</p><p> \"People's privacy rights are clearly being compromised  \u2014 what do we do about it?\" Ryan said. \"We want to make sure that we get it right without stifling innovation.\"</p><p> Ryan also said he isn't sure what he'll do after he leaves Congress and doesn't know if he'll endorse a candidate to succeed him.</p><p> Ryan did not take questions from reporters but fielded inquiries for about 45 minutes from a friendly crowd. He painted a rosy picture as his party heads into what's expected to be a tough fight to retain control of the U.S. House in the fall midterms.</p><p> \"We see a military that's being rebuilt, an economy that's growing,\" Ryan said.</p><p> Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokeswoman Melanie Conklin said Ryan doesn't understand how dissatisfied voters are.</p><p> \"Speaker Paul Ryan still fails to understand that the work he sees as his legacy \u2014 gifting enormous tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent and giant corporations at the expense of working people and fighting to take health care away from millions of Americans \u2014 is precisely why his Republican Party is so unpopular right now,\" Conklin said.</p><p> For the remainder of 2018, Ryan said he anticipates Congress tackling a rewrite of the Dodd-Frank financial law; the Senate passed a bill last month to ease regulations primarily for smaller banks. Also on tap, Ryan said, are infrastructure measures and a 2018 Farm Bill that would dramatically expand work requirements for food stamp recipients.</p><p> He also called for a bipartisan commission to address health care programs for the retired or poor, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Ryan said spending growth in those programs is by far the main concern in balancing future federal budgets.</p><p> Asked why, with total control of the federal government, Republicans have not done more to scale back spending or reduce the federal debt or deficits, Ryan said the Republican-controlled House has done its job to pass bills to scale back entitlement programs, but the Senate has not.</p><p> \"Remember that?\" Ryan said, mimicking U.S. Sen. John McCain's \"thumbs-down\" gesture to vote against the Obamacare repeal bill that was narrowly defeated in the Senate last year. \"That one move took the biggest opportunity we've ever had on fundamental entitlement reform and killed it by one vote.\"</p><p> Ryan's announcement about his future came months after enactment of one of his careerlong ambitions, overhauling the federal tax code, which passed in December. But his 2\u00bd-year tenure as speaker otherwise was marked by frustrations, legislative and political \u2014 and most recently, his uneasy relationship with President Donald Trump.</p><p> Ryan's announcement set off scrambles to replace him as House Speaker \u2014 and for who will succeed him representing Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District.</p><p> Among the Republican candidates who have registered with the Federal Election Commission are Nick Polce, a Lake Geneva businessman and U.S. Army veteran, and Paul Nehlen, an alt-right social media provocateur who was banned from Twitter for making posts viewed as racist and anti-Semitic, and whom Ryan's campaign criticized for \"bigoted rhetoric.\"</p><p> Bryan Steil, a Janesville attorney and University of Wisconsin System Regent, is considering a GOP bid and is scheduled to make an announcement Sunday about his plans.</p><p> Randy Bryce, a Caledonia ironworker and political activist, and Janesville teacher Cathy Myers are the Democratic candidates. State Rep. Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, the former state Assembly minority leader, also has said he's considering a run.</p><p> Applications engineer Kevin Adam Steen, a Republican, announced his candidacy on Thursday. Jeremy Ryan, a liberal known as a prominent protester in Madison who ran as a Republican against Ryan in 2014 but got only 6 percent of the vote, also registered with the state to run again as a Republican. Christopher Guerrero, of Waukesha, is also registered with the state to run as a Democrat.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKWI-6dc765e8741c8162f7eda5dfb57f20ba4ceffbc1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C918AF8DD94 NWBKWI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S54-7VM1-JBCN-435R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409764</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"796\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Chippewa.com<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The investigation will look into whether the company, which \"dominates all aspects of advertising on the internet and searching on the internet,\" has acted in ways that restricted competition or consumer access, Paxton said at a news conference outside the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday. All states but California and Alabama are involved, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. \"There is nothing wrong with a business becoming the biggest game in town if it does so through free market competition,\" Paxton said in a statement, \"but we have seen evidence that Google's business practices may have undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation, violated users' privacy and put Google in control of the flow and dissemination of online information.\" </p><p>Paxton emphasized that the investigation is not a lawsuit and said investigators have already subpoenaed the company. In a similar move, New York Attorney General Letitia James said Friday that she will lead a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general in an investigation of Facebook. That investigation will examine whether the social media company \"endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices or increased the price of advertising,\" according to a news release . The inquiries come as the Justice Department leads its own antitrust investigation into Google, which the company recently acknowledged. The Federal Trade Commission has been conducting its own competition probe of big tech, as has the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. \"Google's services help people, create more choice and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the United States,\" Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president of global affairs, said in a statement. \"At the same time, it's of course right that governments should have oversight to ensure that all successful companies, including ours, are complying with the law. . We have always worked constructively with regulators, and we will continue to do so.\" The bipartisan nature of the group is a testament to how such an investigation by state attorneys general is a \"no-brainer,\" if for no other reason than a political one, said James Angel, associate professor of finance at Georgetown University. \"It doesn't mean they're actually going to do anything, but given the criticism of Google, it's easy to argue they'd be derelict in their duty if they did not at least investigate,\" Angel said. \"Attorneys general are basically political animals. . They really want to show they're tough, and they're going to go after the bad guys, especially because a lot of them desire to run for governor.\" The attorneys general also have the advantage of investigating under state antitrust laws that may differ from federal laws and give them more latitude, Angel said. It's too soon to say, Paxton said Monday, what potential remedies could be sought with an investigation such as this. Angel said the range of possibilities is broad - from requiring Google to pay penalties, to forcing it to spin off acquisitions such as online advertising company Double Click, to imposing new regulations that would allow more competitors into the market. Google, far and away the largest online advertiser in the world, will control 31.1 percent of digital ad dollars in 2019, or $103.73 billion, according to market research company eMarketer. Facebook, much further behind in second place, will follow with $67.37 billion. Last year, more than 85 percent of the revenue generated by Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., came from advertising, according to company filings . \"This is not anti-tech,\" said Utah's Republican attorney general, Sean Reyes, at Monday's news conference. \"To the opposite. This is actually for the benefit of the tech ecosystem to help level the playing field.\" The search giant has been put under a microscope by government entities several times. The company was fined a record $2.72 billion by European regulators in 2017 for abusing its dominance of the online search market. In the U.S., the FTC investigated the possibility of antitrust action against Google but closed the probe in 2013 without taking action. In 2016, Reyes and Washington, D.C.'s Democratic attorney general, Karl Racine, asked the agency to reopen the inquiry, but it declined at the time. Paxton's office said in a news release that none of the previous investigations \"fully address the source of Google's sustained market power and the ability to engage in serial and repeated business practices with the intention to protect and maintain that power.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SANTEX-MERLIN70530218</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SANTEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1C-G2M1-JC8S-D3RH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">168424</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"814\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

The government must enact these calls from the royal college.' The report's co-author Dr Bernadka Dubicka warned it revealed mounting evidence of a link between social media use and poor mental health.</p><p>She said she had witnessed 'more and more children self-harming and Continued on Page 6 \u00bb \u00bb Continued from Page 1 attempting suicide' as a direct result of their online activity.</p><p>Mr Russell, whose daughter had appeared to be an ordinary 'enthusiastic' teenager before her death in 2017, revealed a note she had left behind.</p><p>The TV producer from north London said she wrote: 'I'm the weird sister, quiet daughter, depressed friend, lonely classmate. I'm nothing, I'm worthless, I'm numb, I'm lost, I'm weak, I'm gone. I'm sorry. I'll see you in a little while.</p><p>'I love you all so much. Have a happy life. Stay strong xxx.' A two per cent levy on UK revenues of global giants such as Instagram's owner Facebook is to be enforced from April in a bid to ensure payments more fairly reflect what they earn here.</p><p>But the RCP is calling for the Digital Services Tax to be applied instead to their international turnover.</p><p>Facebook, which earned \u00a31.6billion in the UK in 2018, would have had to fork out an extra \u00a330million that year under the government's plans.</p><p>But the RCP proposal would have forced it to pay in excess of \u00a3850million from its \u00a342.8billion global revenues.</p><p>That is more than the \u00a3500million that all the big tech firms combined are expected to pay under the current plans.</p><p>The RCP said some of the extra cash should go to fund research and training for professionals working with children.</p><p>It also called for universities to be given access to anonymised data on users, such as how much time they spend on sites.</p><p>Dr Dubicka said: 'We will never understand the risks and benefits of social media use unless the likes of Twitter, Facebook and Instagram share data.' She added: 'Self-regulation is not working. It is time for government to step up.' Facebook told Metro: 'Making sure people are safe on our platforms is the most important work we do and we are already taking a number of the steps recommended in this report.</p><p>'We remove harmful content and provide support for those who search for it.

He says that government itself should help subsidise journalism in the interests of democracy.       Photo: supplied    You might have missed it \u2013 what with the biggest recession since the 1930s and a pandemic going on \u2013 but there may be big, and bad, changes happening to a media landscape near you.    Right now the Australian government is considering amending the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to force Google and Facebook to pay local commercial media organisations for the sharing of their content on the digital platforms.    The News Media and Digital Platforms Bargaining Code proposed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will require the tech and media companies to make terms through \u201cmandatory binding arbitration\u201d. It will also oblige them to divulge parts of their core intellectual property (such Google\u2019s search algorithm).    It has been lauded as a world-first in addressing the power imbalance between the platforms and traditional news organisations.    Champions such as commission chief Rod Sims argue it\u2019s a simple matter of forcing Google and Facebook to pay a fair price for extracting value from journalism for which they pay nothing. As Sims put it :    What this was all about was the imbalance in bargaining power, the market failure that comes from that, and underpayment for news having a detrimental effect on Australian society.    Who could argue with that? Even federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg has described it as \u201ca question of fairness\u201d.    But from an economic standpoint the whole bargaining code is hopelessly confused. It fails to properly understand the source of competitive pressure for media companies, and why they have lost revenues over the last 15 years.    Mandatory binding arbitration between tech and media companies is also a completely inappropriate policy tool to achieve the public policy goal of fostering high-quality journalism.    As I have written about in detail for the Stigler Center at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, making the code law risks doing serious harm to Australian consumers while shovelling money to large media companies like Nine Entertainment and News Corp Australia.    Faced with the prospect of having to divulge key intellectual property, it would not be surprising if Google and Facebook simply prefer not to be in the Australian market. Millions of Australians using Google, YouTube and Facebook will lose out.    Between 2002 and 2018, consulting firm AlphaBeta estimates total annual revenue for Australian newspapers fell from A$4.4 billion to A$3.0 billion. Almost all of this was due to lost classified advertising revenue, worth A$1.5 billion in 2002 but just A$200 million in 2018.    \u201cThat\u2019s Google\u2019s fault,\u201d you might cry.    Actually no. The vast bulk of lost classified advertising revenue was due to online \u201cpure-plays\u201d such as Seek, Domain and Carsales. Google and Facebook took basically none of this revenue.     The media companies were sitting on a gold mine of classified advertising. Then there was massive technological disruption due to the internet and smart phones.    That, as they say in the classics, is show business.    It doesn\u2019t justify making companies who happened to succeed in an adjacent space at the same time fork over a chunk of their revenues.    If big tech companies were somehow allowing you and me free access to content we would otherwise have to pay for, there might be a case to answer.    That would be like Google Maps not only giving you directions to a restaurant but the means to also avoid paying for your meal.    But using a search engine does not allow you to get free meals, nor to get around a news organisation\u2019s pay wall.     In fact, having their content pop up in search results, or shared on social media, helps Australian media companies to attract readers and sell subscriptions \u2013 something that now accounts for roughly half the revenues of some leading players such as The Australian.    All you get for \u201cfree\u201d is a snippet of a line or two from the search.    For instance, when I searched for news about recently deceased US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I got this:     If you can figure out the full content of the article from that snippet, you should be using your superpowers for other, more lucrative purposes.    There is a very real risk this misguided code will end up becoming law.    An overzealous regulator has proposed something that stands to benefit the big media companies, who are \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 strongly for it.    Those same media companies have huge influence over public perceptions and the fate of politicians. It will be a brave elected representative who pushes back on the proposed code and draft legislation.    But if politicians were serious about resolving the real issue at stake in all of this, they would act more directly.      Get InDaily in your inbox. Daily.

Like newspapers all around the world, Australian media and journalists are under pressure \u2013 and one thing most people agree on is that high-quality news and journalism is critical to a well-functioning democracy.     Whatever the market forces that have slashed the funding of such journalism, there is a strong case for government intervention. But if the Australian government wants to subsidise high-quality journalism, it should do it itself.    With the 10-year bond rate less than 1%, it would cost the government just A$18 million a year to fund the interest bill on A$2 billion of media subsidies a year. That\u2019s 72 cents per Australian a year.    And all without driving away the hugely valuable services of companies like Google and Facebook that Australian consumers love.

That's why central and regulatory banks want to be aware of their operation, he said. In the same seminar, sitting to his right, was David Marcus, co-founder of Libra, the cryptoasset that Facebook wants to operate from next year. Marcus said this cryptoagent is developed to solve the big problems that the global financial system presents to users: completing direct transactions between two accounts running across different geographic networks; lower the cost of operation, and make transactions so easily, that they can be completed from a smartphone. \"The current configuration of the financial system is also not great for privacy. Massive data is readily available to card operators and there is an opportunity to operate them better,\" he said. He warned that the Libra consortium is willing to converse with financial system supervisors and regulators to allow crypto-assets to be operated for all users in a simple way.<br/>Libra's approach is to complete low-cost financial operations that can be performed from a smartphone between several countries, for people who are not banked. Marcus said there is no financial system that connects every financial network in the world. There are payment networks such as the European Payments Council, the Global Financial and Interbank Information Exchange Society (SWIFT), among many operating since the 1970s, he said. Direct operations between two accounts on different networks are usually difficult to operate, functioning as separate compartments from each other.<br/>And Libra plans to facilitate this operability to send money. Right there, as an introduction, the fund's deputy managing director, David Lipton, said that the big tech stools that offer financial services are driving a change in the system. But he warned that they should be cared for, regulated and supervised like any other service offering.

PayPal said it would forgo any further participation in the group and would instead focus on its own core businesses. </p><p>'We remain supportive of Libra's aspirations and look forward to continued dialogue on ways to work together in the future,' PayPal said in a statement. In response, Geneva-based Libra Association said it was aware of the challenges lying ahead in its attempts to 'reconfigure' the financial system. 'The type of change that will reconfigure the financial system to be tilted towards people, not the institutions serving them, will be hard. Commitment to that mission is more important to us than anything else. We're better off knowing about this lack of commitment now, rather than later,' Libra Association said in a statement. Facebook declined to comment. Facebook announced plans to launch the digital currency in June 2020 in partnership with other members of Libra Association but the project quickly ran into trouble with skeptical regulators around the world. Reuters reported last week that Facebook could push back the launch of Libra to tackle regulatory concerns[2]. Visa and Mastercard are also reconsidering their involvement in Libra as they do not want to attract regulatory scrutiny, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. France and Germany last month pledged to block Libra from operating in Europe[3] and backed the development of a public cryptocurrency instead. With the exit of PayPal, Libra Association now has 28 members, including Uber, Lyft, and Spotify. 'We look forward to the first Libra Council meeting in 10 days and will be sharing updates following that, including details of the 1,500 entities that have indicated enthusiastic interest to participate,' Libra Association said in a tweet.

This was recommended by the final report of the Murray financial system inquiry.</p><p>\"All financial services providers should be obliged to subscribe to the e-payments code,\" PayPalsenior director customer experience and delivery Kareem Al-Bassam told The Australian Financial Review.</p><p>\"In the spirit of trying to future-proof the economy for digital and mobile, we recommend the e-payments code be extended to digital wallets. A real simple example would be authenticating and paying with your fingerprint. Three years ago it is not something anybody would have thought about.\"</p><p>The e-payments code governs the allocation of liability when there is a fraudulent electronic payment. Generally, when someone uses a stolen or lost credit or debit card in person, the bank takes the liability. If it is an online payment, the bank will reimburse the customer, but then \"chargeback\" the merchant for the loss.</p><p>Reports of identity fraudsters in the US using Apple's iPhone 6 Apple Pay capability and applying for credit card details in someone else's name has made the push to get new players to sign up more urgent.</p><p>Mr Al-Bassam said PayPalis concerned that as new players come in and replace a physical wallet that facilitates the payment and holds multiple payment options, the liability for fraud is unclear and could make consumers shy away from using new payment methods. \"PayPalis a digital wallet provider and an [authorised deposit-taking institution]. But there are a number of digital-wallet-only providers who are not regulated from a consumer perspective in real way,\" he said.</p><p>\"You get into a situation where it is unclear to consumers who is responsible for [covering the fraud]. Is it my bank? Is it my digital wallet? I have all of my credentials from multiple financial institutions on my digital wallet, so they are also the front door to my payments.</p><p>\"We have a vested interest in making sure the massive digital transformation that's occurring right now be successful. In order for that to happen consumers need to feel that they are safe.\"</p><p>Like the banks, PayPalis signed up to the code because it doesn't have direct relationships with banks. Rather it is with merchants and consumers. Credit card companies rely on banks, merchants or consumers that sign up to take liability.</p><p>However, Mr Al-Bassam suggested that with MasterCard and Visa now offering their own digital wallet versions of PayPal- MasterPass and Visa Checkout - the responsibility for fraud had become less clear.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-6jukunsdzt4kheb78fp</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FMP-2F11-F0J6-J062-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"492\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The CMA warned that the deal could lead to a \u201csubstantial lessening of competition in any market or markets in the United Kingdom\u201d and launched a formal merger inquiry one month later. </p><p>On Tuesday the regulator said PayPal had flouted its rules by cross-selling to customers based in the UK, resulting in a \u00a3250,000 fine.</p><p>PayPal had secured permission from the regulator to market iZettle to customers in mainland Europe but not the UK. It launched a campaign targeting customers in France and Germany, but ended up contacting potential customers in the UK too.</p><p>In a penalty notice published online, the CMA said PayPal had \u201cno reasonable excuse for its failure to comply\u201d with the watchdog\u2019s enforcement notice.</p><p>PayPal said it had not deliberately broken the rules but admitted to being \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the CMA\u2019s decision. \u201cThe CMA has confirmed that the alleged infractions that led to this fine were not intentional and did not have any impact in practice and they were remediated as soon as the CMA raised concerns,\u201d the company said. </p><p>\u201cWhile we respectfully disagree with the CMA\u2019s conclusions, we understand the importance of initial enforcement orders in the UK\u2019s merger control regime and treated compliance with the IEO with the utmost importance throughout the merger review.</p><p>\u201cWhile we are disappointed with this outcome, PayPal takes compliance seriously and has learnt from this process.\u201d</p><p>The competition watchdog has grown increasingly concerned about issues stemming from the growing power of digital technology companies in the UK. In July the CMA said it would weigh ideas such as the creation of a new regulator to police the growing power of platforms such as Facebook and Google, as raised in the Furman Review earlier in the year.</p><p>The UK government had hired former Obama adviser Jason Furman to publish a review into competition issues triggered by big tech companies in the UK and suggest potential remedies.</p><p>PayPal said it would not appeal against the fine. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-f3262dd6debd11e9b1129624ec9edc59</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X47-MJJ1-DXP9-9520-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"437\"/><timeReceived>3:25 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 24, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS522320 FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS PROCESSING, RESERVE &amp;

But the ultimate way to pay for purchases is coming. Amazon is already researching in the first phase of biometric payment, consisting of a palm reader who would be connected to the credit card itself to make the subscriptions.</p><p><br/>The company created by Jeff Bezos is preparing payment terminals to be placed in stores that customers come to on a recurring basis, such as fast food restaurants or coffee shops. In this way, consumers would only have to place their palm on a device, which would contact their bank to bring away the amount it owes the trade.<br/>According to the sources cited by The Wall Street Journal, Amazon is already having conversations with Visa and Mastercard to carry out this project, which is in a very early phase.<br/>In this regard, Amazon filed a patent for what it describes as a \"contactless biometric identification system\" that includes \"a handheld scanner that generates images of the user's palm.\"<br/>Google has already made its foray into the banking sector and Apple has a credit card made of titanium<br/>Bezos' company has already implemented a contactless biometric payment system in its New York offices, where it is used by employees in soft drink machines and other supplies. According to the New York Post, this same technology will soon reach the Whole Foods food chain, which will help speed up queues in the boxes.<br/>With this system, Amazon could right-overtake its big tech rivals, Apple and Google, which have their own financial-related services, such as its contactless payment services, Apple's credit card, or the incursion of the search engine company in the banking business. It would also leave Facebook and its controversial cryptocurrency behind, at least for the time being, which continues to face regulatory problems.<br/>On the other hand, in these cases suspicions related to security and privacy are always present. Amazon would store in its cloud the biometric record of the user's hand, as well as the banking information already granted to it by the majority of customers and their consumption habits (whether physical products or audiovisual content streaming).<br/>This proposal, still incipient, can be the first step towards a system so often seen in science fiction, by which purchases are paid by retina scanner, or thanks to a chip implanted in the skin, or even with the person's own record when walking.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-10447502</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1S-3S11-DY1R-B00M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"411\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000266V</classCode><className>VISA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Judy Woodruff.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  On the \"NewsHour\" tonight:  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  MARK ZUCKERBERG, Chairman and CEO, Facebook:  I started Facebook, I  run it, and I am responsible for what happens here.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Mark Zuckerberg in the hot seat.  The Facebook CEO  testifies before senators, amid serious privacy concerns for millions of  users.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Then:  President Trump lashes out at special counsel Robert Mueller,  after an FBI raid on the president's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  And securing schools in the wake of the Parkland shooting -- how a  district in Texas is taking precautionary measures to protect students  against the worst.  </p><p>  ROXANNE GUTIERREZ, Principal, Villarreal Elementary:  I think parents  are open to it.  They have seen that times have changed, unfortunately, and  they do see that we're putting children's safety first.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  All that and more on tonight's \"PBS NewsHour.\"  </p><p>  (BREAK) </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  We have two lead stories tonight.  </p><p>  First, the White House now says that President Trump believes he has  the power to fire the man running the Russia investigation, special counsel  Robert Mueller.  That follows an FBI raid on a member of the Trump inner  circle, his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.  It was based on information  from Mueller's team.  </p><p>  We will have a full report after the news summary.  </p><p>  Meanwhile, the head of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, says his company is  working with the special counsel's probe of the Russian election meddling.   That was one a range of issues raised as Zuckerberg faced off with 44  members of the United States Senate today.  </p><p>  Our Lisa Desjardins begins our coverage.</p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  For the social media maverick who's often behind the  scenes, a very public lesson in scrutiny, as lawmakers grilled Facebook's  Mark Zuckerberg with questions.  </p><p>  SEN. JOHN THUNE (R), South Dakota:  Why should we trust Facebook?  </p><p>  SEN. MARIA CANTWELL (D), Washington:  I believe you have all the  talent.  My question is whether you have all the will.  </p><p>  SEN. BILL NELSON (D), Florida:  How can American consumers trust folks  like your company to be caretakers of their most personal and identifiable  information?</p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  The CEO of one of the Internet's most dominant  companies began with an apology.  </p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG:  We didn't take a broad enough view of our  responsibility, and that was a big mistake.  And it was my mistake, and I'm  sorry.  I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens  here.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  This one week after Facebook revealed up to 87  million users' personal information was improperly accessed by Cambridge  Analytica, a political consulting firm hired by the Trump campaign in 2016.  </p><p>  Cambridge Analytica then used that data to direct Trump campaign  content toward individual users.  Facebook admits it knew about that kind  of data harvesting for at least two years, but only addressed it last  month.  </p><p>  Today's rare joint hearing by the Senate Judiciary and Commerce  Committees was just one sign of the fury over the revelations.  </p><p>  Zuckerberg's message?  His company is changing.  </p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG:  We need to take a more proactive role and a broader  view of our responsibility.  It's not enough to just build tools.  We need  to make sure that they're used for good.  At the end of the day, this is  going to be something where people will measure us by our results.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  But that didn't satisfy senators.  Bill Nelson, a  Democrat from Florida, pressed Zuckerberg about why Facebook waited years  to tell users about the Cambridge Analytica breach.  </p><p>  SEN. BILL NELSON:  You apologized for it, but you didn't notify them.   And do you think that you have an ethical obligation to notify 87 million  Facebook users?  </p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG:  We considered it a closed case.  In retrospect, that  was clearly a mistake.  </p><p> We shouldn't have taken their word for it.  And we have updated our  policies in how we're going to operate the company to make sure that we  don't make that mistake again.  </p><p>  SEN. BILL NELSON:  Did anybody notify the FTC?  </p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG:  No, Senator.</p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  Some also honed in on repeated mistakes and  apologies by Facebook over the years.  </p><p>  Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune:  </p><p>  SEN. JOHN THUNE:  After more than a decade of promises to do better,  how is today's apology different?  </p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG:  So we have made a lot of mistakes running the  company.  </p><p>  I think it's pretty much impossible, I believe, to start a company in  your dorm room and then grow it to be at the scale that we're at now  without making some mistakes.</p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  Other senators, like Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar,  pushed for specific fixes.  </p><p>  SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), Minnesota:  Would you support a rule that  would require you to notify users of a breach within 72 hours?  </p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, that makes sense to me.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  This as Klobuchar and others push something called  the Honest Ads Act, one of a long line of bills now focused on digital  platforms like Facebook.  </p><p>  It requires those companies to make sure no foreign interests can post  campaign ads, and that the public be able to see who is behind every  election ad.  Facebook says it is doing that now, and more, launching  easier ways for users to block access to their information, and promising  to restrict how much data any outside company can access.  </p><p>  But as Facebook tried to look forward, senators pointed back.  </p><p>Connecticut's Richard Blumenthal asked about Facebook's deal with  Alexander Aleksandr Kogan, whose app gave Cambridge Analytica its access.  </p><p>  SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D), Connecticut:  I want to show you the  terms of service that Aleksandr Kogan provided to Facebook, and note for  you that, in fact, Facebook was on notice that he could sell that user  information.  </p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG:  I have not.  </p><p>  SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL:  Who in Facebook was responsible for seeing  those terms of service that put you on notice that that information could  be sold?  </p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, our app review team would be responsible  for that.  </p><p>  SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL:  Has anyone been fired on that app review  team?  </p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, not because of this.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  Illinois Senator Dick Durbin asked about  Zuckerberg's privacy.  </p><p>  SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL), Minority Whip:  Would you be comfortable  sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?  </p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG:  No.  </p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  SEN. RICHARD DURBIN:  If you have messaged anybody this week, would  you share with us the names of the people you have messaged?  </p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, no, I wouldn't choose to do that publicly  here.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  Zuckerberg was twice pressed on whether Facebook  tracks users across devices and after they leave the platform.  He  hesitated to answer.  </p><p>  SEN. ROGER WICKER (R), Mississippi:  There has been reports that  Facebook can track a user's Internet browsing activity even after that user  has logged off the Facebook platform.  Can you confirm whether this is  true?  </p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, I want to make sure I get this accurate.   So, it would probably be better to have my team follow up.  </p><p>  SEN. ROGER WICKER:  You don't know?  </p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG:  I know that people use cookies on the Internet, and  that you can probably correlate activity between sessions.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  Zuckerberg gave more specifics on a different topic,  the threat from Russia.  Facebook has said that Russians sent fake campaign  ads to more than 100 million Facebook users in 2016.  </p><p>  SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D), California:  What is Facebook doing to  prevent foreign actors from interfering in U.S. elections?  </p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG:  This is one of my top priorities in 2018 is to get  this right.  I -- one of my greatest regrets in running the company is that  we were slow in identifying the Russian information operations in 2016.  </p><p>  We expected them to do a number of more traditional cyber-attacks,  which we did identify and notify the companies that they were trying to  hack into them, but we were slow in identifying the type of new information  operations.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  Zuckerberg was also pressed on if his company feeds  global crisis.  The U.N. and human rights groups accuse Facebook of  allowing hateful anti-Muslim videos and other posts that facilitated  violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.  </p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG:  What's happening in Myanmar is a terrible tragedy  and we need to do more.  </p><p>  SEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D), Vermont:  We all agree with that.  </p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG:  OK.  </p><p>  SEN. PATRICK LEAHY:  But U.N. investigators have blamed you, blamed  Facebook for playing a role in that genocide.  We all agree it's terrible.</p><p>  How can you dedicate and will you dedicate resources to make sure such  hate speech is taken down within 24 hours?  </p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG:  One is, we're hiring dozens of more Burmese-language  content reviewers, because hate speech is very language-specific.  It's  hard to do it without people who speak the local language.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  As the hearing ran into the evening, one theme was  constant: Facebook's power and how it handles that power.  Zuckerberg will  be in Washington at least one more night.  He testifies before a House  committee tomorrow.  </p><p>  For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Lisa Desjardins.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  And now our correspondent Amna Nawaz looks further at  some of what we learned today and some questions that remain.</p><p>  AMNA NAWAZ:  And for that, I'm joined by Franklin Foer, a staff writer  for \"The Atlantic,\" and author of \"World Without Mind:  The Existential  Threat of Big Tech.\"  </p><p>  Thanks for being here.  </p><p>  FRANKLIN FOER, \"The Atlantic\":  Pleasure.  </p><p>  AMNA NAWAZ:  You watched the testimony today.  It's fair to say Mark  Zuckerberg went in a bit on the back foot.  How do you think he did?  </p><p>  FRANKLIN FOER:  Well, I think if you look six months ago at Facebook,  Mark Zuckerberg was discussed as a potential presidential candidate,  Facebook disavowed that it was a publisher, that it was the world's biggest  gatekeeper.  </p><p>Facebook pushed back against the prospect of government regulating it.   And if you look at today's performance, while he was technically I think  very proficient in swatting away some of the concerns of senators, their  role in the world has fundamentally changed.  </p><p>  He was conceding that Facebook is going to be regulated by government,  and that regulation might ultimately be good for Facebook and Facebook's  users.  He conceded that Facebook is a publisher, that it has  responsibilities for the content that it publishes.</p><p>  And so the Zeitgeist has shifted dramatically.  His game, I think, is  trying to preserve Facebook's dominant position, its monopoly.  He would  rather have this discussion be about the prospect of the regulation, rather  than the prospect of having a discussion about antitrust and about breaking  up the company.  </p><p>  AMNA NAWAZ:  You mentioned him swatting away some of those questions.   What did he not say or not answer today that you thought he would or should  have?  </p><p>  FRANKLIN FOER:  Yes.  </p><p>  Well, look, he was trying to -- he was disavowing Facebook's role in  collecting people's data.  He portrayed Facebook as being a system where  people were making all sorts of conscious choices to have their data  collected by Facebook.  </p><p>  And so I think that he was being fairly disingenuous.  There was a  question that you just showed where he was saying that Facebook -- he  doesn't know whether Facebook tracks you across all their devices.  </p><p>  Well, of course he knows that.  And one of the issues that I think is  really important that he didn't discuss is the role of manipulation in  Facebook's system.  It came up very narrowly in the case of Cambridge  Analytica, but Facebook is a system that is a feedback loop that is  designed to keep users as engaged as long as possible, which means keeping  them addicted.  </p><p>  And so content on Facebook is arrayed in such fashion as to keep  people addicted.  So he's not feeding people information based on what they  share.  He's not feeding it based on what's good for them or good for  democracy.  He's feeding it based on what will keep them addicted.  </p><p>  AMNA NAWAZ:  He's also feeding it based on some of the data that they  do track.  </p><p>  FRANKLIN FOER:  Exactly.  </p><p>  AMNA NAWAZ:  He was asked specifically about that.  We saw one of  those moments in Lisa's report just now, basically how and when and where  his platform collects data from their users.  </p><p>  What did you make of how he handled those specific questions?  </p><p>  FRANKLIN FOER:  I thought he was pretty effective in dealing with the  senators.  </p><p>  And I think we were at a moment where senators, a lot of the senators  are -- if we're frank, they're older.  They're not necessarily Facebook's  core demographic, or they're senators who are busy who are not necessarily  Facebook power users, so they didn't understand the system.  </p><p>  And so when it came to pressing Zuckerberg on a lot of the questions  about the collection of data, I think Zuckerberg was reasonably effective  in pushing them away, but I think in ways that were ultimately a bit  disingenuous.  </p><p>  AMNA NAWAZ:  There's another specific question, which a few of the  senators zeroed in there, what they knew and when and how they shared it.   They knew back in 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had improperly shared data.  </p><p>  They banned them.  They deleted -- or ask them to delete the data.   But they didn't tell their users and they didn't report it to the FTC.</p><p>  Should they have?  How do you think Zuckerberg handled those questions  today?  </p><p>  FRANKLIN FOER:  I think that they should have.  </p><p>  And I think that part of the issue is when we step become and you look  at these questions, the Cambridge Analytica questions, the questions of  giving access of data to third-party developers, and the questions about  Facebook being careless in their handling of this precious cargo, really  these are systematic problems that Facebook has.  </p><p>  And so this was one glaring example of Facebook screwing up.   Zuckerberg admitted failure.  But really it's part of a systematic failure.  </p><p>  AMNA NAWAZ:  Along those same lines, there is an inherent business  model tension.  Right? </p><p>  FRANKLIN FOER:  Exactly.  Yes.  </p><p>  AMNA NAWAZ:  They're pledging to protect the data.  At the same time,  their business model is built on profiting from it.  Can people trust them  on that moving forward?  </p><p>  FRANKLIN FOER:  Right.  Exactly.  </p><p>  Their business model is always about hijacking, commandeering as much  of the attention of their users as possible.  And so they're always going  to be collecting as much data as possible in order to keep people's  attention for as long as possible, and then to also allow advertisers to  target that attention as much as possible.  </p><p>  And so I don't see how they are ever going to escape this kind of arms  race that they're in, where they are going to have to keep pushing the  boundaries of surveillance on their users.  </p><p>  AMNA NAWAZ:  Franklin Foer, thanks for being here.  </p><p>  FRANKLIN FOER:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  And in the day's other news:  The president of China  renewed offers to lower a series of trade barriers.  His statement eased  fears of a trade war and set off a stock market rally.  Xi Jinping told a  conference in Southern China that Beijing will significantly lower  automobile tariffs this year and strengthen intellectual property  protections.  </p><p>  XI JINPING, Chinese President (through translator):  We are taking  efforts to make the outcomes of opening up benefit Chinese enterprises and  people, as well as enterprises of various countries in the world and their  people in the shortest possible time.  I believe, through these efforts,  the competitiveness of Chinese financial industry will be greatly improved.   China's opening-up will usher in a brand-new prospect.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  China has announced many of the reforms before.  But  in a tweet this afternoon, President Trump said that he is thankful for  what he called Xi's kind words.  </p><p>  Xi's words also played well on Wall Street.  The Dow Jones industrial  average gained nearly 421 points to close at 24408.  The Nasdaq rose almost  144 points, and the S&amp;P 500 added 43.  </p><p>  On Syria, the International Organization for the Prohibition of  Chemical Weapons announced that it will investigate a suspected chemical  attack by the Assad regime.  That came as video on social media purportedly  showed the site of the attack that killed 40 people and a missile that  allegedly contained gas.  </p><p>  Meanwhile, at the United Nations, Russia vetoed a U.S. call for a full  U.N. investigation, and U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley had this reaction:</p><p>  NIKKI HALEY, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations:  Today, some  countries decided to stand up for truth, accountability and justice for the  Syrian people.  History will record that, on this day, Russia chose  protecting a monster over the lives of the Syrian people.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  A competing resolution by Russia also failed.   President Trump said on Monday he is considering a military response in  Syria.  </p><p>  Separately, an aide to Iran's supreme leader warned Israel will pay  for Monday's strike that killed seven Iranians in Syria.  Iran's state  media quoted Ali Akbar Velayati as saying, in Damascus, the crimes will not  remain unanswered.  Israel has not confirmed that it carried out the  missile strike on a Syrian air base.  </p><p>  The U.N. cultural organization UNESCO has condemned Monday's mass  killing at a famed wildlife park in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Five  rangers and a driver were slain at Virunga National Park.  It is home to  about a quarter of the world's mountain gorillas.  The attack, by an armed  militia, was the deadliest since the park was established in 1925.  </p><p>  In Britain, one of two victims of a nerve agent attack was released  from the hospital today.  Yulia Skripal was taken to a secure location.   Her father, Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent, remains  hospitalized.  Britain, the U.S., Germany and France all blame Russia for  the attack.  </p><p>  Back in this country, the president's homeland security adviser, Tom  Bossert, resigned unexpectedly, in the latest in a string of White House  departures.  It came a day after John Bolton took over as the newest  national security adviser.  He said he is planning to put his own stamp on  that part of the White House apparatus.  </p><p>  And National Guard troops from three states have begun arriving at the  U.S.-Mexico border, answering President Trump's call.  As of today,  Republican governors from Arizona, Texas and New Mexico had committed 1,600  Guard members.  The president says that he wants 2,000 to 4,000.   California's Democratic Governor Jerry Brown has not said if he will also  deploy the Guard.  </p><p>  Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": the latest on the FBI raid of  President Trump's lawyer's office and residence; how one school district is  taking measures to sure its students; a new book chronicles the human toll  of the Syrian civil war; and much more.  </p><p>  We return to our second lead story now, the fallout after FBI agents  raid the office and the home of President Trump's personal lawyer.  </p><p>  John Yang begins with what we know about this unusual step and the  many questions swirling around how Mr. Trump might respond.  </p><p>  QUESTION:  Are you thinking about firing Deputy Attorney General Rod  Rosenstein?  </p><p>  JOHN YANG:  Today, President Trump wasn't speaking to television  cameras about the fate of the Russia investigation.  But White House Press  Secretary Sarah Sanders said the president thinks it's gone too far, and  that he has the power to end it.  </p><p>  QUESTION:  Does the president believe he have the power to fire  special counsel Robert Mueller?  Does he believe that is within his power?</p><p>  SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, White House Press Secretary:  He certainly  believes he has the power to do so.  </p><p>  JOHN YANG:  The president triggered speculation about special counsel  Robert Mueller last night:  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:  Why don't I just fire  Mueller?  Well, I think it is a disgrace what is going on.  We will see  what happens.  And many people have said, you should fire him.  </p><p>  JOHN YANG:  Mr. Trump's anger was sparked by FBI raids on the  Manhattan office and hotel room of Michael Cohen, the president's longtime  personal attorney.  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP:  I just heard that they broke into the office of one of  my personal attorneys, a good man, and it's a disgraceful situation.  </p><p>  It's a total witch-hunt.  </p><p>  JOHN YANG:  It's widely reported the FBI seized thousands of Cohen's  records dealing with two women who say they had sexual affairs with Mr.  Trump in 2006.  </p><p>  In 2016, Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stephanie Clifford,  known as Stormy Daniels, as part of a nondisclosure agreement.  The other  woman, Karen McDougal, was paid $150,000 for her story by The National  Enquirer's parent company, even though it never reported it.  </p><p>  Some of the documents are said to involve Mr. Trump's communications  with Cohen.  The disclosure prompted the president to protest today that  attorney-client privilege is dead. </p><p>  In fact, not all communications between lawyers and their clients are  privileged.  There's the so-called crime fraud exception, for  communications made with the intention of covering up a crime.  A third- party team of investigators will likely be tasked to decide whether Cohen's  messages with the president are protected or not.  </p><p>  In a statement, Cohen's lawyer said the raids were carried out by the  U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, based on a referral by Mueller.  The  searches were authorized by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is  overseeing the special counsel's investigation.  </p><p>  Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called it a  seismic step.  </p><p>  SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D), Connecticut:  This kind of raid is  extraordinary.  It could not have been done if there were not near- certainty that he was going to either destroy evidence, or plan or commit a  crime that involved obstruction of justice, and that there was evidence  that would be destroyed.  </p><p>  JOHN YANG:  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  brushed aside speculation that the president would try to dismiss the  special counsel, but added a word of warning.  </p><p>  SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South Carolina:  I'm not concerned that he  will fire Mueller.  I don't think he will fire Rosenstein.  That would be  the beginning of the end of his presidency, and he's not going to do that.  </p><p>  JOHN YANG:  Legislation to protect Mueller has stalled in the Senate,  and Leader Mitch McConnell says he sees no need to act on it.  </p><p>  For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm John Yang.</p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Our White House correspondent, Yamiche Alcindor, is  here with me now to help fill in the picture.  </p><p>  So, Yamiche, you have been reporting on this all day.  Where do things  stand right now with regard to Michael Cohen and what he's been -- this FBI  raid?  </p><p>  YAMICHE ALCINDOR:  Well, Michael Cohen and his lawyer have been very  tight-lipped all day.  </p><p>  I called his personal cell phone today, Michael's personal cell phone,  and someone literally hung up on me when I introduced myself.  But we now  know that Michael Cohen has spoken to CNN.  And he told CNN that he is very  worried about the raids that happened.  </p><p>  He said that he really wants all of this to be over.  He said that, if  he had to do it again, he might have handled that $130,000 payment to  Stormy Daniels differently.  But there is this idea that Sarah Sanders also  said that the president is growing very weary of Mueller's investigation  and kind of thinks that he's going too far.</p><p>  So, as things stand right now, the president is tired of what's going  on, and that these raids could be something that's really scary for Michael  Cohen.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  But it's interesting that he's saying that he would  have done it another way.  I think that's first time we have heard him say  that.  </p><p>  YAMICHE ALCINDOR:  It's first time we have heard him say that.</p><p>  And unlike in the past, where the president is kind of doubling down  and saying that the FBI's is breaking into his -- broke into his offices,  Michael Cohen has actually said that they were very courteous to him and  that he really is just very worried.  He said he's worried about his family  and how this could affect them.  </p><p>  He's not someone that is saying, I did everything right.  He did say  that he believes that he did everything legally right, but there is this  idea that he feels that something could go wrong.  And these investigations  don't have to just focus on collusion.  They don't have to just focus on  Russia.  If they find something that's impropriety, if they find something  that is wrong financially, and of course that could also hurt the president  if he's involved.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  So, separately from all this, there has been talk,  Yamiche, you know, about whether the president -- what the president is  thinking about Robert Mueller, a lot of speculation about whether he may  fire him.</p><p>  What are you sources telling you about that?</p><p>  YAMICHE ALCINDOR:  My sources are telling me, and Sarah Sanders said  today, that the president believes he has the power to fire Robert Mueller  and that he has been advised that he can do that.  </p><p>  That's very, very important, because the White House has always said  that the president wasn't thinking about firing Robert Mueller, but that is  confirmation that he's been advised about how he could do it.  </p><p>  The problem is that could set off a constitutional crisis.  Legal  experts that I have talked to say that the DOJ rules show that the  president himself cannot directly fire Robert Mueller, that he would have  to go through a chain of command at the DOJ to do that.  </p><p>  So, if he didn't do that, that could be a really big problem.  And  Sarah Sanders said that she didn't think that he was going to have any  intention of firing Robert Mueller right now, but she did say that he's  frustrated with both the FBI director and Jeff Sessions, so there could be  still changes to come.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  A lot to follow.  </p><p>  Yamiche Alcindor, thank you.  </p><p>  YAMICHE ALCINDOR:  Thank you.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Well, to answer some of the legal questions involved  in this raid on the office and home of the president's lawyer, I spoke a  short time ago to Paul Butler.  He's a former federal prosecutor and law  professor at Georgetown University.  And to Mark Zaid.  He's a Washington,  D.C. attorney who specializes in government investigations.  </p><p>  We started with Mr. Butler on how this kind of raid is extraordinary.  </p><p>  PAUL BUTLER, Professor, George Washington University School of Law:   Judy, barging into a lawyer's office and his residence, looking through all  of his papers and e-mail and documents relevant to his representation of a  client is among the most sensitive things a federal prosecutor can do.</p><p>  And for that reason, the Department of Justice has very high levels of  authority for who has to approve it.  It has to go through an assistant  attorney general.  In this case, reportedly, it was the deputy attorney  general, Rod Rosenstein.  And then there has to be a showing made to a  federal judge that there is probable cause to think there is evidence of a  crime that will be uncovered where FBI wants to look.  </p><p>  It's extraordinary.  In years of federal practice as a prosecutor, I  never did this.  You rarely see it in a case, because it really impinges  the heart of our adversarial system.  It's almost like cheating.  There are  very serious concerns about attorney-client privilege that have to be  respected.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Mark Zaid, why is it so different?  What is so special  about attorney-client privilege?  </p><p>MARK ZAID, Attorney:  Well, it is one of the sacrosanct privileges,  rabbi-priest privilege, marital privilege, attorney-client privilege.  </p><p>  The fact is that we as attorneys know a lot of things that our clients  do, good and bad, and in order to be able to properly defend them under our  Constitution, we need to be able to keep that away from the prying eyes of  the government.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  So, Paul Butler, does this mean the prosecutor would  have had to present to the Justice Department, present to the judge  evidence, whatever evidence there was, that something was wrong, that  either a crime was committed or could be about to be committed?  </p><p>  PAUL BUTLER:  Yes.  </p><p>  So, reportedly, they have said that Mr. Cohen is a subject of the  grand jury investigation, which means that he has not formally been charged  with a crime, but he's under serious investigation.  And so they'd have to  make that showing.  </p><p>  And then they have to establish how they're protecting attorney-client  privilege.  And usually it's done by one set of investigators and  prosecutors who are called the tank team or dirty team.  So they actually  conduct the investigation.  They go in, they seize the documents, and then  they review them.  </p><p>  They remove the privileged documents, and then they turn it over to a  clean team.  That's a separate set of investigators who actually pursue the  case.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  But just to back just up a moment, Mark Zaid, Michael  Cohen and his attorney have been saying, well, we have been cooperating  fully with the investigation, with the Mueller investigation, so we don't  understand why they would need to do this.  </p><p>MARK ZAID:  Yes, you would think, and I'm sure to the public that  resonates a great deal, but I can tell you from practice it really doesn't  make a difference.  </p><p>  I had a case involving a CIA case officer a couple years ago, and we  were fully cooperating with the FBI, coming in for every meeting they  requested, telling them and answering every question they asked.  And, lo  and behold, they show with a no-knock warrant, meaning they just barge into  the house at 6:30 a.m. in the morning.</p><p>  So this is common.  Sometimes, it comes up because there are concerns  that there might be destruction of evidence, that it might be occurring,  but there could be a number of reasons why.  But that by itself is not  unusual at all.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Paul Butler, there is reporting that the special  counsel, Robert Mueller, referred this case, well, and we read this, to the  attorney, the prosecutor for the Southern District of New York.  </p><p>  What does this say, do you think, about the Mueller investigation,  what it is or is not pursuing itself?  </p><p>  PAUL BUTLER:  So, what's been reported is that special counsel Mueller  uncovered evidence that Michael Cohen might be involved in criminal  activity</p><p>  And he went to Rod Rosenstein, and apparently Rod Rosenstein's  decision was to refer it to the New York federal prosecutor.  So it may  have been that they thought it was outside of the purview of the special  counsel investigation, which is about collusion and obstruction of justice.</p><p>  Or, on the other hand they may just be going to New York for this  clean team, so it may be that New York reviews the documents, removes all  of the privileged documents, and then actually turn over the non-privileged  documents back to Mueller.  We just don't know.  </p><p>  Again, special counsel Mueller seems to be doing a very good job at  avoiding leaks, so we really have limited information about this.  It may  be about bank fraud.  It may be about Stormy Daniels.  We will have to wait  and see.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Yes.  </p><p>Mark Zaid, what would you add to that in terms of what this may or may  not say about the Mueller investigation, understanding there have been very  few leaks?  </p><p>MARK ZAID:  There is more than just the Mueller investigation that is  touching upon parallel issues involving Russia, for example.</p><p>  So, the FBI is conducting a number of investigations that are parallel  to what Mueller is doing.  So it is possible, as was said, that the --  whatever was going on with Michael Cohen might fall outside, so it was sent  to the Southern District of New York.  </p><p>  I think one of the things that both Michael Cohen and the president  perhaps have to be concerned about might not be what actually the FBI was  searching for specifically, as we will see one day in the affidavit that  was used before the judge, but what they actually might find, because, very  often, if they can separate the privilege issue through the dirty team and  give it to the clean teams, there may very well be evidence of other crimes  that the FBI wasn't even aware was going on.</p><p>  And, oftentimes, that can be the worst and most dangerous part for  someone who has their house or office raided.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Paul Butler, your...</p><p>  PAUL BUTLER:  Judy, if I could...  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Go ahead.  </p><p>  PAUL BUTLER:  Yes, I'm nodding, because that could be a relationship  between the Michael Cohen investigation and Robert Mueller's investigation.  </p><p>  We have seen that special counsel Robert Mueller, one of his tactics  is to get incriminating information about somebody who might be a witness  against President Trump or someone higher up in his campaign, get that  person to plead guilty, and essentially flip that person.  </p><p>  So if the investigation uncovers substantial evidence of wrongdoing by  Michael Cohen, again, he reportedly is President Trump's fix-it.  He didn't  take the loyalty pledge.  So he may have lots of information about  President Trump that special counsel Mueller would like to know.</p><p>  And prosecutors share information all the time.  So even if there is  one prosecution or investigation of Cohen and another about collusion that  is operated by Mueller, they could share information and possibly use the  information about Cohen to flip, to get him to turn on his client,  President Trump.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  So many strands here to follow.  </p><p>  Gentlemen, thank you both very much.  Paul Butler, Mark Zaid, we thank  you.  </p><p>MARK ZAID:  Thank you.  </p><p>  PAUL BUTLER:  Great to be here.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  In the wake of the school shooting in Parkland,  Florida, that left 17 students and educators dead, there is a growing  effort to make sure schools are better protected.  </p><p>  Such shootings are actually rare.  Statistically speaking, the chance  a student will die at school from murder or suicide is nearly one in two  million.  </p><p>  But school officials know they have to plan for the worst, and are  under increasing pressure to add physical security measures and armed  staff.  </p><p>  Correspondent Lisa Stark of our partner Education Week reports from  San Antonio, Texas, for this week's segment on Making the Grade.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  It's a typical day at Harlan High, on the outskirts of  San Antonio, a bustling lunchroom, A.P. classes, sports teams working out.  </p><p>  But just like every other day, security cameras, classroom doors that  lock from inside, armed officers keeping watch, and a single open entrance  into the sprawling building.   </p><p>  SHANE ALLARD, Police Officer, Northside Independent School District:   We don't live in Mayberry anymore.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  Officer Shane Allard oversees safety and security for the  Northside Independent School District.  </p><p>  SHANE ALLARD:  We know that there's a more violent world out there,  and we have to do what we can to ensure the safety of our staff and  students.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  Here at Northside, they even have their own police force,  more than 100 armed officer covering 117 schools and 106,000 students.  </p><p>  Is this office up and running 24/7?  </p><p>  CHARLIE CARNES, Police Chief, Northside Independent School District:   Twenty-four/seven.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  Chief Charles Carnes say dispatchers can monitor any of  the district's 7,500 cameras.  Two officers are assigned to every high  school, one at each middle school, and roving officers make checks at  elementary schools.  </p><p>  CHARLIE CARNES:  We want to present a hard target.  That's why we  expressed to our officers, you make foot patrols around your school.  You  park your patrol vehicle in a highly visible place and let people know that  there are police here.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  While most districts don't have a dedicated police force,  48 percent of schools do have sworn law enforcement officers on campus at  least once a week, up from 36 percent a decade ago.  </p><p>  Now, after the Parkland tragedy, calls for adding more armed officers.   Civil rights groups worry that will hurt poorer black and Latino students  especially, who are more likely to face arrest at school.  </p><p>  In some districts, there's talk of adding metal detectors or even  arming teachers, an idea touted by the president.  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:  If you had a teacher  with -- who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very  quickly.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  But a recent Gallup poll found 73 percent of teachers are  opposed to carrying guns.  </p><p>  Travis Weissler teaches history at Harlan High.  </p><p>  TRAVIS WEISSLER, Teacher:  Personally, I am a gun owner, but I just  feel like that there's too many what-if scenarios that could happen if you  add teachers having weapons in the classroom.  The amount of training that  a police officer gets in how to respond to a situation is above and beyond  what a teacher could learn.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  Northside Superintendent Brian Woods says any new  security measures must be carefully thought out.  </p><p>  BRIAN WOODS, Superintendent, Northside Independent School District:   There's always a reaction after a really scary incident like Parkland for  the pendulum to swing towards a much more hardened building, and that is  completely understandable.  </p><p>  But I think we have always got to balance that with, what's the core  mission of this space, and what can we do that's reasonable and yet keeps  the school not a prison?</p><p>  LISA STARK:  Chief Carnes agrees.  </p><p>  CHARLIE CARNES:  In a free America, you know, do we put serpentine  wire around our schools?  Do we put bars on our windows?  Do we put  soldiers out front on the front doorstep and question everybody that  approaches?  No, we don't do that.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  Michele Gay learned firsthand how school security can  fail.  She lost her daughter Josephine at Sandy Hook Elementary.  </p><p>  MICHELE GAY, Safe and Sound Schools:  She still, to this day, is the  light of our lives and the center of our family.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  After Sandy Hook, Gay co-founded Safe and Sound Schools.   Its purpose?  </p><p>  MICHELE GAY:  Making sure that we have reasonable precautions, that we  have layers of security in place.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  Gay bristles at the term hardening schools, saying  schools can be welcoming and still use commonsense measures to help protect  students.  </p><p>  MICHELE GAY:  Is there a gate there?  Is there a camera that will  alert the office staff that someone is now coming onto the campus?  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  And at the school entrance:</p><p>  MICHELE GAY:  It needs to be locked.  It's not open.  It's not open to  the public.  It has to be a system whereby you are granted access.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  That's what they're doing at Northside's elementary  schools.  </p><p>  At Villarreal Elementary, everyone is screened, every parent, every  visitor, asked the reason for their visit, kept in a secure lobby while  I.D.s are checked, a photo badge issued.  Then staffers must unlock the  doors to the school hallways.  </p><p>  Nationwide, 94 percent of schools now report they control access  during the school day.  </p><p>  Does it make the school less welcoming at all, do you think?  </p><p>  ROXANNE GUTIERREZ, Principal, Villarreal Elementary:  No, I think  parents are open to it.  They have seen that times have changed,  unfortunately, and they do see we're putting children's safety first.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  And principal Roxanne Gutierrez says there's another new  layer of security here, the lobby itself, renovated to withstand bullets.  </p><p>  ROXANNE GUTIERREZ:  Before this, we still had this entrance, but it  was made out of glass.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  So it wasn't bullet-resistant?  </p><p>  ROXANNE GUTIERREZ:  No, it wasn't.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  And this glass is bullet-resistant?</p><p>  ROXANNE GUTIERREZ:  Yes, it is.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  The idea?  To try to prevent another Sandy Hook, where  the gunman shot his way into the locked school.  Northside has spent nearly  $4 million for bullet-resistant lobbies at about half its 78 elementary  schools.  It's asking voters in May to OK money for the other half.  </p><p>  Meantime, other security measures are required.  The district conducts  lockdown drills, as do 95 percent of schools nationwide.  Here, securing  the classroom takes seconds.  </p><p>  ROXANNE GUTIERREZ:  The all-call is made for lockdown.  This window is  covered.  The teacher does come over here and remove this.  And then the  door is locked.  And if someone is on the outside, they are not able to  gain entry.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  Adding modern security measures to schools can be costly,  by one estimate, a minimum of $10 billion nationwide.  </p><p>  Security experts will tell you that technology only goes so far, that  what schools really need to do is create a climate where students feel  welcome and respected, and willing to flag anything that seems threatening.  </p><p>  Harlan high principal Robert Harris says, that's key.  </p><p>  ROBERT HARRIS, Principal, John Marshall Harlan High School:  I think  creating that culture where it's OK to communicate to adults, create a  culture where it's OK to call the safe line is something that we try to do  from day one.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  The Northside District has a 24-hour tip line, but it's  only as good as the follow-up.  </p><p>  How do you determine if something is really a threat or not a threat?  </p><p>  ROBERT HARRIS:  It's always real.  If it's a threat, it's taken  seriously.  It's taken as if it's real.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  After Parkland, schools around the country faced a flood  of shooting threats.  Harlan ROTC student Kendall Duepner says her school  was targeted.  </p><p>  KENDALL DUEPNER, Student:  There was a fake Instagram page made, and  it said that they were going to shoot up the school.  Kids came across  this, and they were reporting it to the safe line and e-mailing the  principal.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  The district and school police scrambled to investigate.  </p><p>  Junior James Williams picks up the story.  </p><p>  JAMES WILLIAMS, Student:  Turns out that it wasn't true.  It was  false.  They did announce it to every family, that it wasn't credible, and  that it's OK to come to school.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  Despite that, some 40 percent of Harlan students stayed  home.  </p><p>  Did you come to school that day?  </p><p>  JAMES WILLIAMS:  I didn't come to school that day.</p><p>  LISA STARK:  You didn't.  Why not?</p><p>  JAMES WILLIAMS:  Because I feel like, fake or not, you never know  what's going to happen.  Like, any past shootings, I'm pretty sure they  didn't go to school thinking, oh, I might lose my life today, because you  never truly know when someone's joking, when someone is serious.  </p><p>  So, any chance like that, you want to make sure you're in the safest  position possible.  </p><p>  LISA STARK:  The uncomfortable fact is that schools and students can  never be 100 percent safe, but districts say they're always looking for  ways to surround students with security.  </p><p>  For Education Week and the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Lisa Stark in San  Antonio, Texas.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  As President Trump weighs a potential response to the  chemical weapons attack in Syria last weekend, it is worth remembering how  this disastrous war began seven years ago.  </p><p>  William Brangham talks with the author of a new book that takes a very  intimate look at this most-brutal conflict.  </p><p>  WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  From the very beginning of the Syrian uprising,  Rania Abouzeid has been one of the conflict's earliest and closest  chroniclers.  </p><p>  She witnessed the first days of peaceful civilian protests against  Bashar al-Assad, and then his government's brutal crackdown.  She was there  for the rise of groups like the Islamic State, saw how the intervention of  the Russians changed the tide of the conflict, and witnessed the  transformation of a hopeful revolution into a grinding seven-year war.  </p><p>  She's now published a new book called \"No Turning Back: Life, Loss and  Hope in Wartime Syria,\" and it tells the story of this conflict through the  eyes of those who endure it and those who fight in it.  </p><p>  Rania Abouzeid joins me now.  </p><p>  Welcome to the \"NewsHour.\"  </p><p>  RANIA ABOUZEID, Author, \"No Turning Back: Life, Loss, and Hope in  Wartime Syria\":  Thank you very much.  </p><p>  WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  So, let's start at the very beginning.  </p><p>  You open the book with the story of a young man named Suleiman who is  benefiting from all the privileges of life in Assad's Syria.  This is in  2011.  </p><p>  And yet, as the protests start to begin and his moment comes, he  chooses to join the protests.  I wonder, explain why?  What was driving  even men like him to rise up against the government?  </p><p>  RANIA ABOUZEID:  Suleiman was a man with everything, as you say.  He  had connections to the regime.  He came from family that had money.  He had  a great job.  He had prospects.</p><p>  But he was very aware of his privilege, and he knew that most Syrians  didn't have the opportunities that he had.  And for Suleiman, that was  enough to get out on the streets.  </p><p>  And I chose Suleiman because there is a misconception perhaps that  only people with nothing to lose are the ones who take to the streets, but  that's not often the case.  </p><p>  WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  As you document in the book, it seemed apparent to  both sides, the protesters and to the government, that right away this was  a very serious matter, this was no idle protest.  </p><p>  RANIA ABOUZEID:  No, it was existential from the very beginning.  </p><p>  The protesters knew that, when they went out on the streets, like one  of the protest, told me, we will be hunted.  They will be hunted if they  don't succeed, if they lose.  And the regime knew that it was also a fight  for its survival.  </p><p>  WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  The way you tell this story is through a dozen or  so different characters.  And you toggle between them in time,  chronologically.</p><p>  And I'm just curious, when you set out to do this, did you know that  that was how you would tell this story, through so many different vignettes  of so many different people?</p><p>  RANIA ABOUZEID:  I knew that I wanted to show how history shaped  people and how people shaped history.  </p><p>  All of these different elements of the uprising were happening  concurrently.  So, we had people out on the streets.  We also had some  Islamists who were planning, who saw -- who had darker motivations, and  they planning for their moment when they could come forward and bring about  some of the plans that they had for Syria.  </p><p>  WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  Very early on in the process, the Syrian government  blacklisted you and said you can't enter the country.  </p><p>  So, that must have complicated the whole process for you.  </p><p>  RANIA ABOUZEID:  Yes.  </p><p>  In the summer of 2011, I learned -- the Syrian government didn't even  tell me and I don't even know why was I blacklisted, but I learned through  human rights organizations who had leaked lists of Syrian activist that my  name was on that list.  So, that's how I learned of it.  </p><p>  I don't know why.  I have no way to appeal it, but I know that I am  banned from the country.  That's information that the regime -- some  members of the regime whom I know have also confirmed -- and wanted by  three of the state's four intelligence agencies.</p><p>  But it's also an indication of how the Syrian state operates, that  somebody can be branded a spy and can be wanted without any means of  recourse and without any understanding of why.  </p><p>  WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  One of the characters, very, very striking  character, is this 9-year-old girl.  Rouha (ph)?  Am I pronouncing it  correctly?</p><p>  RANIA ABOUZEID:  Yes, yes.  </p><p>  WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  Why did you want her in this story?  </p><p>  RANIA ABOUZEID:  I wanted to show how war can affect a regular family.</p><p>  And I wanted to tell it through this little girl's eyes, because she  just was so precocious, and she was so aware of what was happening around  her.  And she would explain that in ways that would stump me.  She would  really leave me speechless in some of the phrases that she would use to  describe what was happening around her.  </p><p>  And I followed Rouha and her family for six years.  I followed many  families, but I wanted to focus on her.  And I saw how she changed and how  war affected even little girls.  </p><p>  WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  For Americans who have been following this  conflict, largely through newspapers and television, can you help them  understand why this conflict has been going on for so long?  </p><p>  RANIA ABOUZEID:  The Syrian war has ceased to be about Syrians.  It's  an international proxy war with the Russians and Iranians, Lebanese  Hezbollah on the regime side.  And you have the Saudis, the Qataris, the  Turks, the Gulf states, the U.S. and Europe on the opposition side.  </p><p>  So it's much bigger than Syria, and it's much bigger than Syrians.   And that is helping to fuel the conflict.  </p><p>  WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  Do you think that there is a time where something  could have been done, that this could have been different, that the outcome  for the Syrian people could have been different?  </p><p>  RANIA ABOUZEID:  When I speak to Syrians who are in the opposition,  they point to their demand for a no-fly zone, for example.  That's what  they say.</p><p>  They say that had a no-fly zone been placed in parts of Northern  Syria, that perhaps the institutions of the opposition could have started  to take form, hospitals could have operated without fear of airstrikes,  that some of the millions of refugees who fled Syria could have found safe  haven within their own borders.  That's what some of the people in the  opposition point to as a possible turning point, in addition to the red  line comments about the use of chemical weapons.</p><p>  Syrians in the opposition also point to that as an example of a time  when pressure could have been put on the regime.  It could have been held  accountable for its alleged chemical weapons use.  So, there were moments,  and before it became such a complicated battlefield, when perhaps something  could have been different.  </p><p>  WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  Syria, as you describe it, is a deeply broken place  today.  </p><p>  But yet, in the title of your book, there is still the word hope.  Do  the Syrians that you know and you are still in touch with have hope that  something can come of this horrible conflict?  </p><p>  RANIA ABOUZEID:  The hope is in the people.  And there is always hope.   It's in Syrians who can survive hell and emerge on the other side.  And  they don't have bitterness.  </p><p>  It's in Syrians who can lose loved ones, but who still say that they  can forgive.  It's in Syrian physicians who could be anywhere.  They could  be in Turkey or elsewhere, yet they stay in their country to treat everyone  under conditions would make World War I battlefield medicine look pretty  sophisticated.  </p><p>  The hope is in little girls like Rouha who just want to be home and  who cling to the idea of family, which is one of the building blocks of  Syrian society.  So, it's in -- the hope is in Syrians who still see a  Syrian-ness that transcends politics and who just want to go back home and  send their kids to school and know that they will be safe and that they  will come home.  </p><p>  It's in the small things.  But that's where it starts.  </p><p>  WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  All right, the book is \"No Turning Back: Life,  Loss, and Hope in Wartime Syria.\"</p><p>  Rania Abouzeid, thank you very much.  </p><p>  RANIA ABOUZEID:  Thank you.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Now, a special series on the future of work that comes  from our Student Reporting Labs.  </p><p>  Tonight: a new program to make computer coding part of elementary  education.  </p><p>  It was produced by students at Dominion High School in Sterling,  Virginia.  </p><p>  STUDENT:  It's this unicorn full of magic and rainbows and butterflies  and a whole bunch of awesome stuff.  </p><p>  NARRATOR:  Code to the Future is a nationwide computer science  immersion program that has set up shop at three Loudoun County elementary  schools in Virginia.  </p><p>  Joshua Johnson is an instructional coach and curriculum designer for  the organization.  </p><p>  JOSHUA JOHNSON, Code to the Future:  Our main goal is to provide  students kind of that spark early on in grades K through 5 to get them  excited about coding, excited about computer science, and hopefully open  some doors for them to pursue computer science in their future.  </p><p>  NARRATOR:  At Round Hill Elementary School, students showcased their  first projects at Epic Build Night, a community event where family and  friends are invited to come in and see what kids have been working on.  </p><p>  Andrew Davis is the school's principal.  </p><p>  ANDREW DAVIS, Principal, Round Hill Elementary School:  The fact of  the matter is, we cannot continue to do things the same way, and expect our  students to be any more prepared for the world that's awaiting them.  </p><p>  WALID AYYAS, Student:  Pretty much coding, to me, is an endless world,  where you can, like, change everything and so many different combinations  to make new video games.  </p><p>  NARRATOR:  Principal Herman Mizell at Meadowland Elementary School  values the positive impact of coding beyond the classroom.  </p><p>  HERMAN MIZELL, Principal, Meadowland Elementary School:  In order to  prepare our students to access and navigate the world, and not only that,  but to compete globally, we want to make sure that our students are  embracing coding and that they have that experience.  </p><p>  NARRATOR:  Students Kate Taylor and Xander Bush were surprised to find  that coding is fun. </p><p>  KATE TAYLOR, Student:  It has a lot to do with other jobs, and I think  even if I get a job someday and it doesn't incorporate code, then I would  still like to have the talent to code.  </p><p>  XANDER BUSH, Student:  I think I would do it not for the fame, but  more as in something doing I love, and it's like a passion.  </p><p>  NARRATOR:  Back at Round Hill Elementary School, Omari Faulkner has  seen the positive impact of the coding program on his son.  </p><p>  OMARI FAULKNER, Parent:  In an environment of everyone is all hands  in, all hands on deck, learning new things, and you can start to see the  students are becoming the leaders.  </p><p>  NARRATOR:  School leaders say the benefits for students participating  in the program are limitless.  </p><p>  HERMAN MIZELL:  Kids need to be able to articulate their ideas and  thoughts.  And, to me, coding provides that opportunity.  You want your  students to be able to compete in this global society.  You want your  students to be able to access and navigate the world, and coding is a great  start.  </p><p>  NARRATOR:  For the \"PBS NewsHour\" Student Reporting Labs, I'm Grace  Aprahamian (ph) in Sterling, Virginia.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  What a great project.  </p><p>  And later tonight on PBS, \"Frontline' presents \"Trump's Takeover,\"  which goes behind the scenes in Washington's corridors of power, examining  the tension between the White House and Republican members of Congress.  </p><p>  One illuminating example was the attempted repeal of Obamacare.  </p><p>  NARRATOR:  The bill was stopped.  The president increasingly taking  the blame.  </p><p>  MAN:  Can he get enough Republican votes?  </p><p>  NARRATOR:  Frustrated, he headed to Capitol Hill to confront his  party.  </p><p>  WOMAN:  Conservative Republicans are now warning does not...</p><p>  NARRATOR:  No more backslapping and cheerleading, now an ultimate.  </p><p>  QUESTION:  Do you have the votes, Mr. President?  </p><p>  MAN:  Finally, Trump kind of just throws up his hands and says, you  know what, this is the ultimatum.  You have until this day, you have this  deadline, and if you can't get it done, we're moving on.  </p><p>  QUESTION:  Mr. President, did you make a persuasive case?  </p><p>  NARRATOR:  It was classic Donald trump.  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:  We had a great meeting.  </p><p>  NARRATOR:  The Freedom Caucus would either get on board or the  president would walk away from the effort to repeal Obamacare and make sure  they got the blame.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  The pressure was so massive, and this was the  atmosphere that the Freedom Caucus was in.  They knew the spotlight was  theirs.  </p><p>  NARRATOR:  At the deadline, they decided to call the president's  bluff.  Ryan headed to the White House to warn Trump that they had failed.  </p><p>  ROBERT COSTA:  I'm told Ryan was ice cold, very calm throughout the  whole car ride and the visit to the White House, because he had to convey a  simple message.  He did what he could, but the votes weren't there.  </p><p>  KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Senior Adviser:  I was there.  I was in the  Oval Office when he arrived.  Speaker Ryan was very candid and very  forthright.  He said: \"We're going to pull the bill.  We don't have the  votes.\"</p><p>  MAN:  Donald Trump is man who expects action.  This notion of pulling  the bill was unacceptable.  You told me we're going to get it done.  We  promised the American people we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare,  So, when he hears we have to pull the bill because we don't have the votes,  he's beside himself.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF: \"Frontline\" airs tonight on most PBS stations.  </p><p>  And that's the \"NewsHour\" for tonight.  I'm Judy Woodruff.  </p><p>  Join us online and again right here tomorrow evening.  For all of us  at the \"PBS NewsHour,\" thank you, and we'll see you soon.  </p><p> END </p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 MacNeil/Lehrer Productions.  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

It was based on information from Mueller`s team.</p><p>We will have a full report after the news summary.</p><p>Meanwhile, the head of <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person><person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>says his company is working with the special counsel`s probe of the Russian election meddling. That was one a range of issues raised as <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>faced off with 44 members of the United States Senate today.</p><p>Our Lisa Desjardins begins our coverage.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: For the social media maverick who`s often behind the scenes, a very public lesson in scrutiny, as lawmakers grilled Facebook`s <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>with questions.</p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE (R), South Dakota: Why should we trust <person><nameText>Facebook?</nameText></person></p><p>SEN. MARIA CANTWELL (D), Washington: I believe you have all the talent. My question is whether you have all the will.</p><p>SEN. BILL NELSON (D), Florida: How can American consumers trust folks like your company to be caretakers of their most personal and identifiable information?</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: The CEO of one of the Internet`s most dominant companies began with an apology.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: We didn`t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. And it was my mistake, and I`m sorry. I started <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>I run it, and I`m responsible for what happens here.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: This one week after <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>revealed up to 87 million users` personal information was improperly accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm hired by the Trump campaign in 2016.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica then used that data to direct Trump campaign content toward individual users. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>admits it knew about that kind of data harvesting for at least two years, but only addressed it last month.</p><p>Today`s rare joint hearing by the Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees was just one sign of the fury over the revelations.</p><p>Zuckerberg`s message? His company is changing.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: We need to take a more proactive role and a broader view of our responsibility. It`s not enough to just build tools. We need to make sure that they`re used for good. At the end of the day, this is going to be something where people will measure us by our results.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: But that didn`t satisfy senators. Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida, pressed <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>about why <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>waited years to tell users about the Cambridge Analytica breach.</p><p>SEN. BILL NELSON: You apologized for it, but you didn`t notify them. And do you think that you have an ethical obligation to notify 87 million <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: We considered it a closed case. In retrospect, that was clearly a mistake.</p><p>We shouldn`t have taken their word for it. And we have updated our policies in how we`re going to operate the company to make sure that we don`t make that mistake again.</p><p>SEN. BILL NELSON: Did anybody notify the FTC?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: No, Senator.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: Some also honed in on repeated mistakes and apologies by <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>over the years.</p><p>Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune:</p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE: After more than a decade of promises to do better, how is today`s apology different?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: So we have made a lot of mistakes running the company.</p><p>I think it`s pretty much impossible, I believe, to start a company in your dorm room and then grow it to be at the scale that we`re at now without making some mistakes.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: Other senators, like Minnesota`s Amy Klobuchar, pushed for specific fixes.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), Minnesota: Would you support a rule that would require you to notify users of a breach within 72 hours?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Senator, that makes sense to me.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: This as Klobuchar and others push something called the Honest Ads Act, one of a long line of bills now focused on digital platforms like <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>It requires those companies to make sure no foreign interests can post campaign ads, and that the public be able to see who is behind every election ad. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>says it is doing that now, and more, launching easier ways for users to block access to their information, and promising to restrict how much data any outside company can access.</p><p>But as <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>tried to look forward, senators pointed back.</p><p>Connecticut`s Richard Blumenthal asked about Facebook`s deal with Alexander Aleksandr Kogan, whose app gave Cambridge Analytica its access.</p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D), Connecticut: I want to show you the terms of service that Aleksandr Kogan provided to <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>and note for you that, in fact, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>was on notice that he could sell that user information.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: I have not.</p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Who in <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>was responsible for seeing those terms of service that put you on notice that that information could be sold?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Senator, our app review team would be responsible for that.</p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Has anyone been fired on that app review team?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Senator, not because of this.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: Illinois Senator Dick Durbin asked about Zuckerberg`s privacy.</p><p>SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL), Minority Whip: Would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: No.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SEN. RICHARD DURBIN: If you have messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the names of the people you have messaged?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Senator, no, I wouldn`t choose to do that publicly here.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>was twice pressed on whether <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>tracks users across devices and after they leave the platform. He hesitated to answer.</p><p>SEN. ROGER WICKER (R), Mississippi: There has been reports that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>can track a user`s Internet browsing activity even after that user has logged off the <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>platform. Can you confirm whether this is true?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Senator, I want to make sure I get this accurate. So, it would probably be better to have my team follow up.</p><p>SEN. ROGER WICKER: You don`t know?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: I know that people use cookies on the Internet, and that you can probably correlate activity between sessions.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>gave more specifics on a different topic, the threat from Russia. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has said that Russians sent fake campaign ads to more than 100 million <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users in 2016.</p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D), California: What is <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>doing to prevent foreign actors from interfering in U.S. elections?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: This is one of my top priorities in 2018 is to get this right. I -- one of my greatest regrets in running the company is that we were slow in identifying the Russian information operations in 2016.</p><p>We expected them to do a number of more traditional cyber-attacks, which we did identify and notify the companies that they were trying to hack into them, but we were slow in identifying the type of new information operations.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>was also pressed on if his company feeds global crisis. The U.N. and human rights groups accuse <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>of allowing hateful anti-Muslim videos and other posts that facilitated violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: What`s happening in Myanmar is a terrible tragedy and we need to do more.</p><p>SEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D), Vermont: We all agree with that.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: OK.</p><p>SEN. PATRICK LEAHY: But U.N. investigators have blamed you, blamed <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>for playing a role in that genocide. We all agree it`s terrible.</p><p>How can you dedicate and will you dedicate resources to make sure such hate speech is taken down within 24 hours?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: One is, we`re hiring dozens of more Burmese-language content reviewers, because hate speech is very language-specific. It`s hard to do it without people who speak the local language.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: As the hearing ran into the evening, one theme was constant: Facebook`s power and how it handles that power. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>will be in Washington at least one more night. He testifies before a House committee tomorrow.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Lisa Desjardins.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And now our correspondent Amna Nawaz looks further at some of what we learned today and some questions that remain.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: And for that, I`m joined by Franklin Foer, a staff writer for \"The Atlantic,\" and author of \"World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech.\"</p><p>Thanks for being here.</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER, \"The Atlantic\": Pleasure.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: You watched the testimony today. It`s fair to say <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>went in a bit on the back foot. How do you think he did?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Well, I think if you look six months ago at <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person><person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>was discussed as a potential presidential candidate, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>disavowed that it was a publisher, that it was the world`s biggest gatekeeper.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>pushed back against the prospect of government regulating it. And if you look at today`s performance, while he was technically I think very proficient in swatting away some of the concerns of senators, their role in the world has fundamentally changed.</p><p>He was conceding that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is going to be regulated by government, and that regulation might ultimately be good for <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Facebook`s users. He conceded that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is a publisher, that it has responsibilities for the content that it publishes.</p><p>And so the Zeitgeist has shifted dramatically. His game, I think, is trying to preserve Facebook`s dominant position, its monopoly. He would rather have this discussion be about the prospect of the regulation, rather than the prospect of having a discussion about antitrust and about breaking up the company.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: You mentioned him swatting away some of those questions. What did he not say or not answer today that you thought he would or should have?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Yes.</p><p>Well, look, he was trying to -- he was disavowing Facebook`s role in collecting people`s data. He portrayed <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>as being a system where people were making all sorts of conscious choices to have their data collected by <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>And so I think that he was being fairly disingenuous. There was a question that you just showed where he was saying that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>-- he doesn`t know whether <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>tracks you across all their devices.</p><p>Well, of course he knows that. And one of the issues that I think is really important that he didn`t discuss is the role of manipulation in Facebook`s system. It came up very narrowly in the case of Cambridge Analytica, but <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is a system that is a feedback loop that is designed to keep users as engaged as long as possible, which means keeping them addicted.</p><p>And so content on <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is arrayed in such fashion as to keep people addicted. So he`s not feeding people information based on what they share. He`s not feeding it based on what`s good for them or good for democracy. He`s feeding it based on what will keep them addicted.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: He`s also feeding it based on some of the data that they do track.</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Exactly.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: He was asked specifically about that. We saw one of those moments in Lisa`s report just now, basically how and when and where his platform collects data from their users.</p><p>What did you make of how he handled those specific questions?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: I thought he was pretty effective in dealing with the senators.</p><p>And I think we were at a moment where senators, a lot of the senators are -- if we`re frank, they`re older. They`re not necessarily Facebook`s core demographic, or they`re senators who are busy who are not necessarily <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>power users, so they didn`t understand the system.</p><p>And so when it came to pressing <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>on a lot of the questions about the collection of data, I think <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>was reasonably effective in pushing them away, but I think in ways that were ultimately a bit disingenuous.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: There`s another specific question, which a few of the senators zeroed in there, what they knew and when and how they shared it. They knew back in 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had improperly shared data.</p><p>They banned them. They deleted -- or ask them to delete the data. But they didn`t tell their users and they didn`t report it to the FTC.</p><p>Should they have? How do you think <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>handled those questions today?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: I think that they should have.</p><p>And I think that part of the issue is when we step become and you look at these questions, the Cambridge Analytica questions, the questions of giving access of data to third-party developers, and the questions about <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>being careless in their handling of this precious cargo, really these are systematic problems that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has.</p><p>And so this was one glaring example of <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>screwing up. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>admitted failure. But really it`s part of a systematic failure.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Along those same lines, there is an inherent business model tension. Right?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Exactly. Yes.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: They`re pledging to protect the data. At the same time, their business model is built on profiting from it. Can people trust them on that moving forward?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Right. Exactly.</p><p>Their business model is always about hijacking, commandeering as much of the attention of their users as possible. And so they`re always going to be collecting as much data as possible in order to keep people`s attention for as long as possible, and then to also allow advertisers to target that attention as much as possible.</p><p>And so I don`t see how they are ever going to escape this kind of arms race that they`re in, where they are going to have to keep pushing the boundaries of surveillance on their users.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Franklin Foer, thanks for being here.</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Thank you so much.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And in the day`s other news: The president of China renewed offers to lower a series of trade barriers. His statement eased fears of a trade war and set off a stock market rally. Xi Jinping told a conference in Southern China that Beijing will significantly lower automobile tariffs this year and strengthen intellectual property protections.</p><p>XI JINPING, Chinese President (through translator): We are taking efforts to make the outcomes of opening up benefit Chinese enterprises and people, as well as enterprises of various countries in the world and their people in the shortest possible time. I believe, through these efforts, the competitiveness of Chinese financial industry will be greatly improved. China`s opening-up will usher in a brand-new prospect.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: China has announced many of the reforms before. But in a tweet this afternoon, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>said that he is thankful for what he called Xi`s kind words.</p><p>Xi`s words also played well on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average gained nearly 421 points to close at 24408. The Nasdaq rose almost 144 points, and the S&amp;P 500 added 43.</p><p>On Syria, the International Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons announced that it will investigate a suspected chemical attack by the Assad regime. That came as video on social media purportedly showed the site of the attack that killed 40 people and a missile that allegedly contained gas.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the United Nations, Russia vetoed a U.S. call for a full U.N. investigation, and U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley had this reaction:</p><p>NIKKI HALEY, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations: Today, some countries decided to stand up for truth, accountability and justice for the Syrian people. History will record that, on this day, Russia chose protecting a monster over the lives of the Syrian people.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: A competing resolution by Russia also failed. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>said on Monday he is considering a military response in Syria.</p><p>Separately, an aide to Iran`s supreme leader warned Israel will pay for Monday`s strike that killed seven Iranians in Syria. Iran`s state media quoted Ali Akbar Velayati as saying, in Damascus, the crimes will not remain unanswered. Israel has not confirmed that it carried out the missile strike on a Syrian air base.</p><p>The U.N. cultural organization UNESCO has condemned Monday`s mass killing at a famed wildlife park in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Five rangers and a driver were slain at Virunga National Park. It is home to about a quarter of the world`s mountain gorillas. The attack, by an armed militia, was the deadliest since the park was established in 1925.</p><p>In Britain, one of two victims of a nerve agent attack was released from the hospital today. Yulia Skripal was taken to a secure location. Her father, Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent, remains hospitalized. Britain, the U.S., Germany and France all blame Russia for the attack.</p><p>Back in this country, the president`s homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, resigned unexpectedly, in the latest in a string of White House departures. It came a day after John Bolton took over as the newest national security adviser. He said he is planning to put his own stamp on that part of the White House apparatus.</p><p>And National Guard troops from three states have begun arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, answering President Trump`s call. As of today, Republican governors from Arizona, Texas and New Mexico had committed 1,600 Guard members. The president says that he wants 2,000 to 4,000. California`s Democratic Governor Jerry Brown has not said if he will also deploy the Guard.</p><p>Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": the latest on the <person><nameText>FBI </nameText></person>raid of President Trump`s lawyer`s office and residence; how one school district is taking measures to sure its students; a new book chronicles the human toll of the Syrian civil war; and much more.</p><p>We return to our second lead story now, the fallout after <person><nameText>FBI </nameText></person>agents raid the office and the home of President Trump`s personal lawyer.</p><p>John Yang begins with what we know about this unusual step and the many questions swirling around how Mr. Trump might respond.</p><p>QUESTION: Are you thinking about firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?</p><p>JOHN YANG: Today, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>wasn`t speaking to television cameras about the fate of the Russia investigation. But White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the president thinks it`s gone too far, and that he has the power to end it.</p><p>QUESTION: Does the president believe he have the power to fire special counsel <person><nameText>Robert Mueller? </nameText></person>Does he believe that is within his power?</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, White House Press Secretary: He certainly believes he has the power to do so.</p><p>JOHN YANG: The president triggered speculation about special counsel <person><nameText>Robert Mueller </nameText></person>last night:</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>President of the United States: Why don`t I just fire Mueller? Well, I think it is a disgrace what is going on. We will see what happens. And many people have said, you should fire him.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump`s anger was sparked by <person><nameText>FBI </nameText></person>raids on the Manhattan office and hotel room of Michael Cohen, the president`s longtime personal attorney.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: I just heard that they broke into the office of one of my personal attorneys, a good man, and it`s a disgraceful situation.</p><p>It`s a total witch-hunt.</p><p>JOHN YANG: It`s widely reported the <person><nameText>FBI </nameText></person>seized thousands of Cohen`s records dealing with two women who say they had sexual affairs with Mr. Trump in 2006.</p><p>In 2016, Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, as part of a nondisclosure agreement. The other woman, Karen McDougal, was paid $150,000 for her story by The National Enquirer`s parent company, even though it never reported it.</p><p>Some of the documents are said to involve Mr. Trump`s communications with Cohen. The disclosure prompted the president to protest today that attorney-client privilege is dead.</p><p>In fact, not all communications between lawyers and their clients are privileged. There`s the so-called crime fraud exception, for communications made with the intention of covering up a crime. A third- party team of investigators will likely be tasked to decide whether Cohen`s messages with the president are protected or not.</p><p>In a statement, Cohen`s lawyer said the raids were carried out by the U.S. attorney`s office in Manhattan, based on a referral by Mueller. The searches were authorized by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing the special counsel`s investigation.</p><p>Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called it a seismic step.</p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D), Connecticut: This kind of raid is extraordinary. It could not have been done if there were not near- certainty that he was going to either destroy evidence, or plan or commit a crime that involved obstruction of justice, and that there was evidence that would be destroyed.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina brushed aside speculation that the president would try to dismiss the special counsel, but added a word of warning.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South Carolina: I`m not concerned that he will fire Mueller. I don`t think he will fire Rosenstein. That would be the beginning of the end of his presidency, and he`s not going to do that.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Legislation to protect Mueller has stalled in the Senate, and Leader Mitch McConnell says he sees no need to act on it.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m John Yang.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Our White House correspondent, Yamiche Alcindor, is here with me now to help fill in the picture.</p><p>So, Yamiche, you have been reporting on this all day. Where do things stand right now with regard to Michael Cohen and what he`s been -- this <person><nameText>FBI </nameText></person>raid?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Well, Michael Cohen and his lawyer have been very tight-lipped all day.</p><p>I called his personal cell phone today, Michael`s personal cell phone, and someone literally hung up on me when I introduced myself. But we now know that Michael Cohen has spoken to CNN. And he told CNN that he is very worried about the raids that happened.</p><p>He said that he really wants all of this to be over. He said that, if he had to do it again, he might have handled that $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels differently. But there is this idea that Sarah Sanders also said that the president is growing very weary of Mueller`s investigation and kind of thinks that he`s going too far.</p><p>So, as things stand right now, the president is tired of what`s going on, and that these raids could be something that`s really scary for Michael Cohen.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: But it`s interesting that he`s saying that he would have done it another way. I think that`s first time we have heard him say that.</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: It`s first time we have heard him say that.</p><p>And unlike in the past, where the president is kind of doubling down and saying that the FBI`s is breaking into his -- broke into his offices, Michael Cohen has actually said that they were very courteous to him and that he really is just very worried. He said he`s worried about his family and how this could affect them.</p><p>He`s not someone that is saying, I did everything right. He did say that he believes that he did everything legally right, but there is this idea that he feels that something could go wrong. And these investigations don`t have to just focus on collusion. They don`t have to just focus on Russia. If they find something that`s impropriety, if they find something that is wrong financially, and of course that could also hurt the president if he`s involved.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, separately from all this, there has been talk, Yamiche, you know, about whether the president -- what the president is thinking about <person><nameText>Robert Mueller, </nameText></person>a lot of speculation about whether he may fire him.</p><p>What are you sources telling you about that?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: My sources are telling me, and Sarah Sanders said today, that the president believes he has the power to fire <person><nameText>Robert Mueller </nameText></person>and that he has been advised that he can do that.</p><p>That`s very, very important, because the White House has always said that the president wasn`t thinking about firing <person><nameText>Robert Mueller, </nameText></person>but that is confirmation that he`s been advised about how he could do it.</p><p>The problem is that could set off a constitutional crisis. Legal experts that I have talked to say that the DOJ rules show that the president himself cannot directly fire <person><nameText>Robert Mueller, </nameText></person>that he would have to go through a chain of command at the DOJ to do that.</p><p>So, if he didn`t do that, that could be a really big problem. And Sarah Sanders said that she didn`t think that he was going to have any intention of firing <person><nameText>Robert Mueller </nameText></person>right now, but she did say that he`s frustrated with both the <person><nameText>FBI </nameText></person>director and Jeff Sessions, so there could be still changes to come.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot to follow.</p><p>Yamiche Alcindor, thank you.</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Thank you.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, to answer some of the legal questions involved in this raid on the office and home of the president`s lawyer, I spoke a short time ago to Paul Butler. He`s a former federal prosecutor and law professor at Georgetown University. And to Mark Zaid. He`s a Washington, D.C. attorney who specializes in government investigations.</p><p>We started with Mr. Butler on how this kind of raid is extraordinary.</p><p>PAUL BUTLER, Professor, George Washington University School of Law: Judy, barging into a lawyer`s office and his residence, looking through all of his papers and e-mail and documents relevant to his representation of a client is among the most sensitive things a federal prosecutor can do.</p><p>And for that reason, the Department of Justice has very high levels of authority for who has to approve it. It has to go through an assistant attorney general. In this case, reportedly, it was the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein. And then there has to be a showing made to a federal judge that there is probable cause to think there is evidence of a crime that will be uncovered where <person><nameText>FBI </nameText></person>wants to look.</p><p>It`s extraordinary. In years of federal practice as a prosecutor, I never did this. You rarely see it in a case, because it really impinges the heart of our adversarial system. It`s almost like cheating. There are very serious concerns about attorney-client privilege that have to be respected.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Zaid, why is it so different? What is so special about attorney-client privilege?</p><p>MARK ZAID, Attorney: Well, it is one of the sacrosanct privileges, rabbi-priest privilege, marital privilege, attorney-client privilege.</p><p>The fact is that we as attorneys know a lot of things that our clients do, good and bad, and in order to be able to properly defend them under our Constitution, we need to be able to keep that away from the prying eyes of the government.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Paul Butler, does this mean the prosecutor would have had to present to the Justice Department, present to the judge evidence, whatever evidence there was, that something was wrong, that either a crime was committed or could be about to be committed?</p><p>PAUL BUTLER: Yes.</p><p>So, reportedly, they have said that Mr. Cohen is a subject of the grand jury investigation, which means that he has not formally been charged with a crime, but he`s under serious investigation. And so they`d have to make that showing.</p><p>And then they have to establish how they`re protecting attorney-client privilege. And usually it`s done by one set of investigators and prosecutors who are called the tank team or dirty team. So they actually conduct the investigation. They go in, they seize the documents, and then they review them.</p><p>They remove the privileged documents, and then they turn it over to a clean team. That`s a separate set of investigators who actually pursue the case.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: But just to back just up a moment, Mark Zaid, Michael Cohen and his attorney have been saying, well, we have been cooperating fully with the investigation, with the Mueller investigation, so we don`t understand why they would need to do this.</p><p>MARK ZAID: Yes, you would think, and I`m sure to the public that resonates a great deal, but I can tell you from practice it really doesn`t make a difference.</p><p>I had a case involving a CIA case officer a couple years ago, and we were fully cooperating with the <person><nameText>FBI, </nameText></person>coming in for every meeting they requested, telling them and answering every question they asked. And, lo and behold, they show with a no-knock warrant, meaning they just barge into the house at 6:30 a.m. in the morning.</p><p>So this is common. Sometimes, it comes up because there are concerns that there might be destruction of evidence, that it might be occurring, but there could be a number of reasons why. But that by itself is not unusual at all.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Paul Butler, there is reporting that the special counsel, <person><nameText>Robert Mueller, </nameText></person>referred this case, well, and we read this, to the attorney, the prosecutor for the Southern District of New York.</p><p>What does this say, do you think, about the Mueller investigation, what it is or is not pursuing itself?</p><p>PAUL BUTLER: So, what`s been reported is that special counsel Mueller uncovered evidence that Michael Cohen might be involved in criminal activity</p><p>And he went to Rod Rosenstein, and apparently Rod Rosenstein`s decision was to refer it to the New York federal prosecutor. So it may have been that they thought it was outside of the purview of the special counsel investigation, which is about collusion and obstruction of justice.</p><p>Or, on the other hand they may just be going to New York for this clean team, so it may be that New York reviews the documents, removes all of the privileged documents, and then actually turn over the non-privileged documents back to Mueller. We just don`t know.</p><p>Again, special counsel Mueller seems to be doing a very good job at avoiding leaks, so we really have limited information about this. It may be about bank fraud. It may be about Stormy Daniels. We will have to wait and see.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.</p><p>Mark Zaid, what would you add to that in terms of what this may or may not say about the Mueller investigation, understanding there have been very few leaks?</p><p>MARK ZAID: There is more than just the Mueller investigation that is touching upon parallel issues involving Russia, for example.</p><p>So, the <person><nameText>FBI </nameText></person>is conducting a number of investigations that are parallel to what Mueller is doing. So it is possible, as was said, that the -- whatever was going on with Michael Cohen might fall outside, so it was sent to the Southern District of New York.</p><p>I think one of the things that both Michael Cohen and the president perhaps have to be concerned about might not be what actually the <person><nameText>FBI </nameText></person>was searching for specifically, as we will see one day in the affidavit that was used before the judge, but what they actually might find, because, very often, if they can separate the privilege issue through the dirty team and give it to the clean teams, there may very well be evidence of other crimes that the <person><nameText>FBI </nameText></person>wasn`t even aware was going on.</p><p>And, oftentimes, that can be the worst and most dangerous part for someone who has their house or office raided.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Paul Butler, your...</p><p>PAUL BUTLER: Judy, if I could...</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.</p><p>PAUL BUTLER: Yes, I`m nodding, because that could be a relationship between the Michael Cohen investigation and Robert Mueller`s investigation.</p><p>We have seen that special counsel <person><nameText>Robert Mueller, </nameText></person>one of his tactics is to get incriminating information about somebody who might be a witness against <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>or someone higher up in his campaign, get that person to plead guilty, and essentially flip that person.</p><p>So if the investigation uncovers substantial evidence of wrongdoing by Michael Cohen, again, he reportedly is President Trump`s fix-it. He didn`t take the loyalty pledge. So he may have lots of information about <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>that special counsel Mueller would like to know.</p><p>And prosecutors share information all the time. So even if there is one prosecution or investigation of Cohen and another about collusion that is operated by Mueller, they could share information and possibly use the information about Cohen to flip, to get him to turn on his client, <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So many strands here to follow.</p><p>Gentlemen, thank you both very much. Paul Butler, Mark Zaid, we thank you.</p><p>MARK ZAID: Thank you.</p><p>PAUL BUTLER: Great to be here.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: In the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 students and educators dead, there is a growing effort to make sure schools are better protected.</p><p>Such shootings are actually rare. Statistically speaking, the chance a student will die at school from murder or suicide is nearly one in two million.</p><p>But school officials know they have to plan for the worst, and are under increasing pressure to add physical security measures and armed staff.</p><p>Correspondent Lisa Stark of our partner Education Week reports from San Antonio, Texas, for this week`s segment on Making the Grade.</p><p>LISA STARK: It`s a typical day at Harlan High, on the outskirts of San Antonio, a bustling lunchroom, A.P. classes, sports teams working out.</p><p>But just like every other day, security cameras, classroom doors that lock from inside, armed officers keeping watch, and a single open entrance into the sprawling building.</p><p>SHANE ALLARD, Police Officer, Northside Independent School District: We don`t live in Mayberry anymore.</p><p>LISA STARK: Officer Shane Allard oversees safety and security for the Northside Independent School District.</p><p>SHANE ALLARD: We know that there`s a more violent world out there, and we have to do what we can to ensure the safety of our staff and students.</p><p>LISA STARK: Here at Northside, they even have their own police force, more than 100 armed officer covering 117 schools and 106,000 students.</p><p>Is this office up and running 24/7?</p><p>CHARLIE CARNES, Police Chief, Northside Independent School District: Twenty-four/seven.</p><p>LISA STARK: Chief Charles Carnes say dispatchers can monitor any of the district`s 7,500 cameras. Two officers are assigned to every high school, one at each middle school, and roving officers make checks at elementary schools.</p><p>CHARLIE CARNES: We want to present a hard target. That`s why we expressed to our officers, you make foot patrols around your school. You park your patrol vehicle in a highly visible place and let people know that there are police here.</p><p>LISA STARK: While most districts don`t have a dedicated police force, 48 percent of schools do have sworn law enforcement officers on campus at least once a week, up from 36 percent a decade ago.</p><p>Now, after the Parkland tragedy, calls for adding more armed officers. Civil rights groups worry that will hurt poorer black and Latino students especially, who are more likely to face arrest at school.</p><p>In some districts, there`s talk of adding metal detectors or even arming teachers, an idea touted by the president.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>President of the United States: If you had a teacher with -- who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly.</p><p>LISA STARK: But a recent Gallup poll found 73 percent of teachers are opposed to carrying guns.</p><p>Travis Weissler teaches history at Harlan High.</p><p>TRAVIS WEISSLER, Teacher: Personally, I am a gun owner, but I just feel like that there`s too many what-if scenarios that could happen if you add teachers having weapons in the classroom. The amount of training that a police officer gets in how to respond to a situation is above and beyond what a teacher could learn.</p><p>LISA STARK: Northside Superintendent Brian Woods says any new security measures must be carefully thought out.</p><p>BRIAN WOODS, Superintendent, Northside Independent School District: There`s always a reaction after a really scary incident like Parkland for the pendulum to swing towards a much more hardened building, and that is completely understandable.</p><p>But I think we have always got to balance that with, what`s the core mission of this space, and what can we do that`s reasonable and yet keeps the school not a prison?</p><p>LISA STARK: Chief Carnes agrees.</p><p>CHARLIE CARNES: In a free America, you know, do we put serpentine wire around our schools? Do we put bars on our windows? Do we put soldiers out front on the front doorstep and question everybody that approaches? No, we don`t do that.</p><p>LISA STARK: Michele Gay learned firsthand how school security can fail. She lost her daughter Josephine at Sandy Hook Elementary.</p><p>MICHELE GAY, Safe and Sound Schools: She still, to this day, is the light of our lives and the center of our family.</p><p>LISA STARK: After Sandy Hook, Gay co-founded Safe and Sound Schools. Its purpose?</p><p>MICHELE GAY: Making sure that we have reasonable precautions, that we have layers of security in place.</p><p>LISA STARK: Gay bristles at the term hardening schools, saying schools can be welcoming and still use commonsense measures to help protect students.</p><p>MICHELE GAY: Is there a gate there? Is there a camera that will alert the office staff that someone is now coming onto the campus?</p><p>LISA STARK: And at the school entrance:</p><p>MICHELE GAY: It needs to be locked. It`s not open. It`s not open to the public. It has to be a system whereby you are granted access.</p><p>LISA STARK: That`s what they`re doing at Northside`s elementary schools.</p><p>At Villarreal Elementary, everyone is screened, every parent, every visitor, asked the reason for their visit, kept in a secure lobby while I.D.s are checked, a photo badge issued. Then staffers must unlock the doors to the school hallways.</p><p>Nationwide, 94 percent of schools now report they control access during the school day.</p><p>Does it make the school less welcoming at all, do you think?</p><p>ROXANNE GUTIERREZ, Principal, Villarreal Elementary: No, I think parents are open to it. They have seen that times have changed, unfortunately, and they do see we`re putting children`s safety first.</p><p>LISA STARK: And principal Roxanne Gutierrez says there`s another new layer of security here, the lobby itself, renovated to withstand bullets.</p><p>ROXANNE GUTIERREZ: Before this, we still had this entrance, but it was made out of glass.</p><p>LISA STARK: So it wasn`t bullet-resistant?</p><p>ROXANNE GUTIERREZ: No, it wasn`t.</p><p>LISA STARK: And this glass is bullet-resistant?</p><p>ROXANNE GUTIERREZ: Yes, it is.</p><p>LISA STARK: The idea? To try to prevent another Sandy Hook, where the gunman shot his way into the locked school. Northside has spent nearly $4 million for bullet-resistant lobbies at about half its 78 elementary schools. It`s asking voters in May to OK money for the other half.</p><p>Meantime, other security measures are required. The district conducts lockdown drills, as do 95 percent of schools nationwide. Here, securing the classroom takes seconds.</p><p>ROXANNE GUTIERREZ: The all-call is made for lockdown. This window is covered. The teacher does come over here and remove this. And then the door is locked. And if someone is on the outside, they are not able to gain entry.</p><p>LISA STARK: Adding modern security measures to schools can be costly, by one estimate, a minimum of $10 billion nationwide.</p><p>Security experts will tell you that technology only goes so far, that what schools really need to do is create a climate where students feel welcome and respected, and willing to flag anything that seems threatening.</p><p>Harlan high principal Robert Harris says, that`s key.</p><p>ROBERT HARRIS, Principal, John Marshall Harlan High School: I think creating that culture where it`s OK to communicate to adults, create a culture where it`s OK to call the safe line is something that we try to do from day one.</p><p>LISA STARK: The Northside District has a 24-hour tip line, but it`s only as good as the follow-up.</p><p>How do you determine if something is really a threat or not a threat?</p><p>ROBERT HARRIS: It`s always real. If it`s a threat, it`s taken seriously. It`s taken as if it`s real.</p><p>LISA STARK: After Parkland, schools around the country faced a flood of shooting threats. Harlan ROTC student Kendall Duepner says her school was targeted.</p><p>KENDALL DUEPNER, Student: There was a fake Instagram page made, and it said that they were going to shoot up the school. Kids came across this, and they were reporting it to the safe line and e-mailing the principal.</p><p>LISA STARK: The district and school police scrambled to investigate.</p><p>Junior James Williams picks up the story.</p><p>JAMES WILLIAMS, Student: Turns out that it wasn`t true. It was false. They did announce it to every family, that it wasn`t credible, and that it`s OK to come to school.</p><p>LISA STARK: Despite that, some 40 percent of Harlan students stayed home.</p><p>Did you come to school that day?</p><p>JAMES WILLIAMS: I didn`t come to school that day.</p><p>LISA STARK: You didn`t. Why not?</p><p>JAMES WILLIAMS: Because I feel like, fake or not, you never know what`s going to happen. Like, any past shootings, I`m pretty sure they didn`t go to school thinking, oh, I might lose my life today, because you never truly know when someone`s joking, when someone is serious.</p><p>So, any chance like that, you want to make sure you`re in the safest position possible.</p><p>LISA STARK: The uncomfortable fact is that schools and students can never be 100 percent safe, but districts say they`re always looking for ways to surround students with security.</p><p>For Education Week and the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Lisa Stark in San Antonio, Texas.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: As <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>weighs a potential response to the chemical weapons attack in Syria last weekend, it is worth remembering how this disastrous war began seven years ago.</p><p>William Brangham talks with the author of a new book that takes a very intimate look at this most-brutal conflict.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: From the very beginning of the Syrian uprising, Rania Abouzeid has been one of the conflict`s earliest and closest chroniclers.</p><p>She witnessed the first days of peaceful civilian protests against Bashar al-Assad, and then his government`s brutal crackdown. She was there for the rise of groups like the Islamic State, saw how the intervention of the Russians changed the tide of the conflict, and witnessed the transformation of a hopeful revolution into a grinding seven-year war.</p><p>She`s now published a new book called \"No Turning Back: Life, Loss and Hope in Wartime Syria,\" and it tells the story of this conflict through the eyes of those who endure it and those who fight in it.</p><p>Rania Abouzeid joins me now.</p><p>Welcome to the \"NewsHour.\"</p><p>RANIA ABOUZEID, Author, \"No Turning Back: Life, Loss, and Hope in Wartime Syria\": Thank you very much.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, let`s start at the very beginning.</p><p>You open the book with the story of a young man named Suleiman who is benefiting from all the privileges of life in Assad`s Syria. This is in 2011.</p><p>And yet, as the protests start to begin and his moment comes, he chooses to join the protests. I wonder, explain why? What was driving even men like him to rise up against the government?</p><p>RANIA ABOUZEID: Suleiman was a man with everything, as you say. He had connections to the regime. He came from family that had money. He had a great job. He had prospects.</p><p>But he was very aware of his privilege, and he knew that most Syrians didn`t have the opportunities that he had. And for Suleiman, that was enough to get out on the streets.</p><p>And I chose Suleiman because there is a misconception perhaps that only people with nothing to lose are the ones who take to the streets, but that`s not often the case.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As you document in the book, it seemed apparent to both sides, the protesters and to the government, that right away this was a very serious matter, this was no idle protest.</p><p>RANIA ABOUZEID: No, it was existential from the very beginning.</p><p>The protesters knew that, when they went out on the streets, like one of the protest, told me, we will be hunted. They will be hunted if they don`t succeed, if they lose. And the regime knew that it was also a fight for its survival.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The way you tell this story is through a dozen or so different characters. And you toggle between them in time, chronologically.</p><p>And I`m just curious, when you set out to do this, did you know that that was how you would tell this story, through so many different vignettes of so many different people?</p><p>RANIA ABOUZEID: I knew that I wanted to show how history shaped people and how people shaped history.</p><p>All of these different elements of the uprising were happening concurrently. So, we had people out on the streets. We also had some Islamists who were planning, who saw -- who had darker motivations, and they planning for their moment when they could come forward and bring about some of the plans that they had for Syria.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Very early on in the process, the Syrian government blacklisted you and said you can`t enter the country.</p><p>So, that must have complicated the whole process for you.</p><p>RANIA ABOUZEID: Yes.</p><p>In the summer of 2011, I learned -- the Syrian government didn`t even tell me and I don`t even know why was I blacklisted, but I learned through human rights organizations who had leaked lists of Syrian activist that my name was on that list. So, that`s how I learned of it.</p><p>I don`t know why. I have no way to appeal it, but I know that I am banned from the country. That`s information that the regime -- some members of the regime whom I know have also confirmed -- and wanted by three of the state`s four intelligence agencies.</p><p>But it`s also an indication of how the Syrian state operates, that somebody can be branded a spy and can be wanted without any means of recourse and without any understanding of why.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the characters, very, very striking character, is this 9-year-old girl. Rouha (ph)? Am I pronouncing it correctly?</p><p>RANIA ABOUZEID: Yes, yes.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Why did you want her in this story?</p><p>RANIA ABOUZEID: I wanted to show how war can affect a regular family.</p><p>And I wanted to tell it through this little girl`s eyes, because she just was so precocious, and she was so aware of what was happening around her. And she would explain that in ways that would stump me. She would really leave me speechless in some of the phrases that she would use to describe what was happening around her.</p><p>And I followed Rouha and her family for six years. I followed many families, but I wanted to focus on her. And I saw how she changed and how war affected even little girls.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For Americans who have been following this conflict, largely through newspapers and television, can you help them understand why this conflict has been going on for so long?</p><p>RANIA ABOUZEID: The Syrian war has ceased to be about Syrians. It`s an international proxy war with the Russians and Iranians, Lebanese Hezbollah on the regime side. And you have the Saudis, the Qataris, the Turks, the Gulf states, the U.S. and Europe on the opposition side.</p><p>So it`s much bigger than Syria, and it`s much bigger than Syrians. And that is helping to fuel the conflict.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you think that there is a time where something could have been done, that this could have been different, that the outcome for the Syrian people could have been different?</p><p>RANIA ABOUZEID: When I speak to Syrians who are in the opposition, they point to their demand for a no-fly zone, for example. That`s what they say.</p><p>They say that had a no-fly zone been placed in parts of Northern Syria, that perhaps the institutions of the opposition could have started to take form, hospitals could have operated without fear of airstrikes, that some of the millions of refugees who fled Syria could have found safe haven within their own borders. That`s what some of the people in the opposition point to as a possible turning point, in addition to the red line comments about the use of chemical weapons.</p><p>Syrians in the opposition also point to that as an example of a time when pressure could have been put on the regime. It could have been held accountable for its alleged chemical weapons use. So, there were moments, and before it became such a complicated battlefield, when perhaps something could have been different.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Syria, as you describe it, is a deeply broken place today.</p><p>But yet, in the title of your book, there is still the word hope. Do the Syrians that you know and you are still in touch with have hope that something can come of this horrible conflict?</p><p>RANIA ABOUZEID: The hope is in the people. And there is always hope. It`s in Syrians who can survive hell and emerge on the other side. And they don`t have bitterness.</p><p>It`s in Syrians who can lose loved ones, but who still say that they can forgive. It`s in Syrian physicians who could be anywhere. They could be in Turkey or elsewhere, yet they stay in their country to treat everyone under conditions would make World War I battlefield medicine look pretty sophisticated.</p><p>The hope is in little girls like Rouha who just want to be home and who cling to the idea of family, which is one of the building blocks of Syrian society. So, it`s in -- the hope is in Syrians who still see a Syrian-ness that transcends politics and who just want to go back home and send their kids to school and know that they will be safe and that they will come home.</p><p>It`s in the small things. But that`s where it starts.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, the book is \"No Turning Back: Life, Loss, and Hope in Wartime Syria.\"</p><p>Rania Abouzeid, thank you very much.</p><p>RANIA ABOUZEID: Thank you.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, a special series on the future of work that comes from our Student Reporting Labs.</p><p>Tonight: a new program to make computer coding part of elementary education.</p><p>It was produced by students at Dominion High School in Sterling, Virginia.</p><p>STUDENT: It`s this unicorn full of magic and rainbows and butterflies and a whole bunch of awesome stuff.</p><p>NARRATOR: Code to the Future is a nationwide computer science immersion program that has set up shop at three Loudoun County elementary schools in Virginia.</p><p>Joshua Johnson is an instructional coach and curriculum designer for the organization.</p><p>JOSHUA JOHNSON, Code to the Future: Our main goal is to provide students kind of that spark early on in grades K through 5 to get them excited about coding, excited about computer science, and hopefully open some doors for them to pursue computer science in their future.</p><p>NARRATOR: At Round Hill Elementary School, students showcased their first projects at Epic Build Night, a community event where family and friends are invited to come in and see what kids have been working on.</p><p>Andrew Davis is the school`s principal.</p><p>ANDREW DAVIS, Principal, Round Hill Elementary School: The fact of the matter is, we cannot continue to do things the same way, and expect our students to be any more prepared for the world that`s awaiting them.</p><p>WALID AYYAS, Student: Pretty much coding, to me, is an endless world, where you can, like, change everything and so many different combinations to make new video games.</p><p>NARRATOR: Principal Herman Mizell at Meadowland Elementary School values the positive impact of coding beyond the classroom.</p><p>HERMAN MIZELL, Principal, Meadowland Elementary School: In order to prepare our students to access and navigate the world, and not only that, but to compete globally, we want to make sure that our students are embracing coding and that they have that experience.</p><p>NARRATOR: Students Kate Taylor and Xander Bush were surprised to find that coding is fun.</p><p>KATE TAYLOR, Student: It has a lot to do with other jobs, and I think even if I get a job someday and it doesn`t incorporate code, then I would still like to have the talent to code.</p><p>XANDER BUSH, Student: I think I would do it not for the fame, but more as in something doing I love, and it`s like a passion.</p><p>NARRATOR: Back at Round Hill Elementary School, Omari Faulkner has seen the positive impact of the coding program on his son.</p><p>OMARI FAULKNER, Parent: In an environment of everyone is all hands in, all hands on deck, learning new things, and you can start to see the students are becoming the leaders.</p><p>NARRATOR: School leaders say the benefits for students participating in the program are limitless.</p><p>HERMAN MIZELL: Kids need to be able to articulate their ideas and thoughts. And, to me, coding provides that opportunity. You want your students to be able to compete in this global society. You want your students to be able to access and navigate the world, and coding is a great start.</p><p>NARRATOR: For the \"PBS NewsHour\" Student Reporting Labs, I`m Grace Aprahamian (ph) in Sterling, Virginia.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: What a great project.</p><p>And later tonight on PBS, \"Frontline` presents \"Trump`s Takeover,\" which goes behind the scenes in Washington`s corridors of power, examining the tension between the White House and Republican members of Congress.</p><p>One illuminating example was the attempted repeal of Obamacare.</p><p>NARRATOR: The bill was stopped. The president increasingly taking the blame.</p><p>MAN: Can he get enough Republican votes?</p><p>NARRATOR: Frustrated, he headed to Capitol Hill to confront his party.</p><p>WOMAN: Conservative Republicans are now warning does not...</p><p>NARRATOR: No more backslapping and cheerleading, now an ultimate.</p><p>QUESTION: Do you have the votes, Mr. President?</p><p>MAN: Finally, Trump kind of just throws up his hands and says, you know what, this is the ultimatum. You have until this day, you have this deadline, and if you can`t get it done, we`re moving on.</p><p>QUESTION: Mr. President, did you make a persuasive case?</p><p>NARRATOR: It was classic <person><nameText>Donald trump.</nameText></person></p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>President of the United States: We had a great meeting.</p><p>NARRATOR: The Freedom Caucus would either get on board or the president would walk away from the effort to repeal Obamacare and make sure they got the blame.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: The pressure was so massive, and this was the atmosphere that the Freedom Caucus was in. They knew the spotlight was theirs.</p><p>NARRATOR: At the deadline, they decided to call the president`s bluff. Ryan headed to the White House to warn Trump that they had failed.</p><p>ROBERT COSTA: I`m told Ryan was ice cold, very calm throughout the whole car ride and the visit to the White House, because he had to convey a simple message. He did what he could, but the votes weren`t there.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Senior Adviser: I was there. I was in the Oval Office when he arrived. Speaker Ryan was very candid and very forthright. He said: \"We`re going to pull the bill. We don`t have the votes.\"</p><p>MAN: <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is man who expects action. This notion of pulling the bill was unacceptable. You told me we`re going to get it done. We promised the American people we`re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, So, when he hears we have to pull the bill because we don`t have the votes, he`s beside himself.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: \"Frontline\" airs tonight on most PBS stations.</p><p>And that`s the \"NewsHour\" for tonight. I`m Judy Woodruff.</p><p>Join us online and again right here tomorrow evening.

We discuss the president`s economic record with a top campaign adviser amid the historic recession wrought by COVID-19.</p><p>STEVE CORTES, Trump 2020 Campaign Senior Adviser: I`m not Pollyanna. I don`t think things are fine, by any stretch. But there are reasons, legitimate reasons, for optimism.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more on tonight`s \"PBS NewsHour.\"</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Catastrophe is blowing out of the Gulf of Mexico tonight, upstaging night three of the Republican Convention.</p><p>Hurricane Laura has morphed into a Category 4 monster, with winds that could reach 145 miles an hour. Officials are warning of extreme damage as it slams into the Texas-Louisiana coastline.</p><p>In coastal communities along the Louisiana and Texas Gulf Coast, floodwaters began creeping in throughout the day. But experts tracking the storm have issued a dire warning: This is only the beginning.</p><p>GOV. JOHN BEL EDWARDS (D-LA): You`re going to hear ranges of storm surges we haven`t heard in Louisiana since Hurricane Audrey in 1957. You`re going to hear the word unsurvivable to describe the storm surge that we are expecting.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Hurricane Laura grew in intensity as it reached the Gulf Coast, and officials are warning of potential catastrophe. The National Hurricane Center said storm surges could reach 20 feet in parts of Texas and Louisiana.</p><p>GOV. JOHN BEL EDWARDS: The worst thing you can do is, when that storm really starts beating at your door at 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning, is to decide, well, I`m going to leave now, because that will be the absolute worst decision you can make at that point.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: The storm has prompted the largest evacuation since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. More than half-a-million people near the Texas-Louisiana border have been ordered to leave their homes.</p><p>Adding to the concern, the region has been hit hard by the coronavirus and is still suffering from the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey three years ago.</p><p>If the current projections hold, Hurricane Laura would be the fiercest storm to hit the Gulf Coast in over a decade.</p><p>Let`s get the latest on all of this with Ken Graham. He`s the director of the National Hurricane Center. And he`s in Miami.</p><p>Ken Graham, thank you so much for talking with us.</p><p>So, give us the latest on where this storm is.</p><p>KEN GRAHAM, Director, National Hurricane Center: Yes, Judy, we`re right here in operations.</p><p>The hurricane forecasters and specialists are right behind me constantly getting the latest information. The brand-new information we have, 145 mile-an-hour winds. And we`re about 155 miles south of Lake Charles, Louisiana, so just a giant storm, pronounced eye, and all those impacts headed for Louisiana and Texas tonight.</p><p>We expect a landfall overnight tonight.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, give us a sense of where you expect it to hit at this point. Between where and where?</p><p>KEN GRAHAM: Yes, it looks like, right now, we`re looking at right around the Lake Charles, Beaumont, Port Arthur area with a major hurricane, just extreme winds, hurricane-force winds.</p><p>Judy, the tropical-storm-force winds alone stretch out 205 miles out from the center, so extreme rainfall. And the big thing here is, well outside the cone well, away from the center, the storm surge, unsurvivable storm surges, just incredible amounts of water here, 10 to 15 feet, some areas, 15 to 20 feet, and not just along the coast, but some of this storm surge could stretch even up to 50 miles north of the coast.</p><p>That`s just an incredible amount of storm surge, a dangerous situation for so many people.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And we`re talking about a huge population.</p><p>Ken Graham, when we hear you use the word unsurvivable, that is frightening. I mean, you mean that literally?</p><p>KEN GRAHAM: I do.</p><p>Looking for the words to describe this situation, when you start thinking about 10 to 15 foot of storm surge, 20 foot of storm surge, Judy, the waves are on top of that. So, in addition to that, you still have the waves.</p><p>And well north -- I mean, this is I-10 -- you start thinking about north of I-10, every one of these rivers and bayous and canals that normally drain all that rain to the Gulf, the surge is coming up those same areas. They`re going to flow backward, and that`s what`s going to cause this flooding.</p><p>That amount, that`s higher than many rooftops, a dangerous situation.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you`re telling people, get out of the way, or else?</p><p>KEN GRAHAM: That`s what`s happening here, because, if you think about those type of values, yes, evacuations, everything. We have been encouraging everybody to listen to those local officials.</p><p>If they tell you to leave, you have to be able to do that, because these impacts -- these impacts are well before landfall. And we`re already starting to see some areas with the rising water.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there a chance -- or what is the chance that this could weaken before it hits populated areas?</p><p>KEN GRAHAM: Well, what happens in this case is, you start getting a large storm like this.</p><p>So, even if you get five miles an hour more or less, it`s not going to change these impacts at this stage, because a lot of the storm surge, it has to do with the structure of the storm, the size of the storm.</p><p>So, even if the winds fluctuate some, it`s not going to change these big impacts.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And, again, you`re looking at direction, you`re looking at the wind, and you`re looking at the rain that it`s bringing with it.</p><p>KEN GRAHAM: Yes, absolutely, the storm surge and also the rainfall.</p><p>And it`s not just coastal. I mean, if you look northward, just an incredible amount of rain, five to eight inches of rain, some areas maybe even up to 15 inches of rain stretching from portions of East Texas, portions of Louisiana, even up to Arkansas, as the system continues to move inland.</p><p>So it`s not just a coastal threat. Even well inland, you can get those high winds, and you can get the flooding rains.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Ken Graham, it`s going to be a busy night, another busy night at the National Hurricane Center. Thank you very much.</p><p>KEN GRAHAM: Thank you.</p><p>Now let`s check in on the ground with preparations and concerns. I`m joined on the phone from Galveston, Texas, with its mayor pro tem. He is Craig Brown.</p><p>Mayor Brown, thank you for talking with us.</p><p>So, based on what you know, what sort of preparations have you made?</p><p>CRAIG BROWN, Mayor Pro Tem of Galveston, Texas: Well, we have been planning for a number of days for Hurricane Laura.</p><p>We have been following it closely. We called a mandatory evacuation yesterday for our citizens. And we assisted those that needed assistance to move them off the island and into safe housing.</p><p>We`re currently watching this hurricane. We`re watching the intensity. I understand it`s now a Category 4 and could get even stronger, which is extremely concerning for us. It looks like we may -- it may go to our east a little bit, but it could come right in here. And, if it did, it could be devastating for our community.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: What are you mainly worried about? Is it the storm surge, the water that is your main concern?</p><p>CRAIG BROWN: I think both storm surge and the wind.</p><p>When you have -- it`s coming to us, it comes to us, 145-mile-per-hour sustained winds could be just devastating. The storm surge is always the concern. We`re a barrier island here off the coast of Texas, and if we get a storm surge that`s associated with this with a direct hit, it would inundate our entire island.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Are people heeding the evacuation order? Is everybody leaving?</p><p>CRAIG BROWN: They -- many are.</p><p>Now, some have elected to stay on the island here. We have already informed our citizens, if they do stay, that they may not get any emergency services provided, because of the conditions may not allow that.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: How worried are you about that?</p><p>CRAIG BROWN: Quite a bit.</p><p>We would love for our citizens to evacuate. Those that did not, though, we are telling them to shelter in place and stay safe. We do have -- we`re on the island now. Our first responders and city personnel are at our command center here on the island.</p><p>We will be out all night, until the conditions allow us not to be. Once the storm passes through, we will be out assessing damage, and then start our cleanup, if it`s needed.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And where will you be monitoring all this? And do you have the resources from other governments to support you?</p><p>CRAIG BROWN: We do.</p><p>We feel -- we have been through many hurricanes, as most coastal cities have, but here in Galveston, we have been through many hurricanes. We`re prepared. Our state government, the Texas Department of Emergency Management, has been extremely cooperative, our county and our federal government.</p><p>They contacted us today, offered any type of assistance they could. And so we feel very comfortable we have good support.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Mayor Craig Brown, mayor pro tem of Galveston, we certainly wish you the very best with all that you`re dealing with.</p><p>Thank you so much.</p><p>CRAIG BROWN: You`re welcome. Thank you.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Vice President Mike Pence is set to take the stage at the Republican Convention and formally accept his party`s renomination.</p><p>His speech comes after a night in which Republicans went out of their way to draw stark differences with the Democrats.</p><p>Amna Nawaz has the story.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: A Trump campaign looking to shore up its base leaned hard into social issues.</p><p>NARRATOR: Some look at American opportunity and see only problems.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: And at times ignored political precedent, even the president`s own policies, to message directly to his base.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States: We believe that each person is made by God for a purpose.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Among his strongest supporters, white evangelicals, and their core issues, front and center throughout the program, from Billy Graham`s granddaughter, Cissie Graham--.</p><p>CISSIE GRAHAM LYNCH, Billy Graham Evangelistic Association: Our founders did not envision a quiet, hidden faith.

I encourage people to focus on our future, while still learning from our past.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: -- and the devastation brought by the pandemic, as the U.S. death toll topped 178,000 people.</p><p>MELANIA TRUMP: My prayers are with those who are ill or suffering.</p><p>I know many people are anxious, and some feel helpless. I want you to know, you are not alone.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), Vice Presidential Candidate: When we vote, things change.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Meanwhile, today, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, worked to bolster the support of black voters at a virtual campaign event in Michigan.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS: Have a plan to vote, and be sure to vote, and to talk to all of your family members.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Her Republican ticket counterpart, Vice President Mike Pence, will be among those speaking tonight, as his party continues to make its pitch to the American people.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Amna Nawaz.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to share her reporting, I`m joined by our White House correspondent, Yamiche Alcindor.</p><p>So, Yamiche, hello.</p><p>As we just heard, the first lady did address some of the suffering that`s taken place, great suffering among the American people, over this virus, but we don`t hear that, we haven`t heard that from other speakers at the convention. What more are you learning about that?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: That`s right.</p><p>The tone of first lady Melania Trump`s speech was vastly different from what we have heard from the RNC over the last week. She started off by expressing sympathy for people who have been infected by the coronavirus or who have died. She said she understood that some Americans felt helpless because of the virus, and said that you are not alone.</p><p>That said, there were other speakers, most notably, Larry Kudlow, a top White House economic adviser, who talked about the virus as if it was in the past tense, as if it was somehow behind the U.S., and that we -- this is all in the rearview mirror.</p><p>So, I want to put up for some people -- for people and our viewers numbers that show where we are when it comes to this pandemic. The daily new cases in the United States has decreased in the last month in the United States.</p><p>But this country is seeing 42,000 new cases per day on average during the last week. Also, the U.S. has the second highest average of new cases after India. And, Judy, people in the United States are more -- way more people in the United States are dying from the coronavirus than in modernized industrialized countries.</p><p>Another thing to note, a recent poll, a CBS poll, found that Democrats and Republicans see the pandemic in vastly different terms. Republican said that they thought it was acceptable to have about 170,000 Americans die because we are in the midst of a pandemic. But about 90 percent of Democrats said that that number was unacceptable.</p><p>That`s just one way that we see this polarized society impacting how people view the coronavirus.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Yamiche, it`s also interesting to look at how the Republicans are talking about the president`s record, compared to the actual record, I mean, for example, on the issues of immigration, on race.</p><p>And we know the president even conducted the naturalization ceremony. That was in Amna`s report just a moment ago.</p><p>How does all this square with each other?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Well, first lady Melania Trump talked about how she, as an immigrant woman, saw the president as wanting to welcome in a lot of immigrants and wanting to tackle issues of racial strife in this country.</p><p>But when you look at the president`s actual immigration policies, they are a lot different. And I should note, also, as we were talking about first lady Melania Trump, she was someone who was perpetuating the racist idea that former President Barack Obama was not born in this country.</p><p>But to look at the president`s own record, in addition to what he said in his rhetoric, let`s look at them.</p><p>When you look at the president`s own things that have been happening during the pandemic, he`s been detaining immigrant children and families at hotels during the pandemic. Also, 100,000 migrants have been expelled from the U.S. since the virus outbreak.</p><p>And according to analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy, as a result of President Trump`s policies, there will be an estimated 49 percent reduction in legal immigration by 2021, Judy.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, finally, Yamiche, what else would you say stood out for you about last night, and what should we look for tonight?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Well, what stood out was that you saw a lot of speakers really trying to make an emotional connection between President Trump and everyday Americans.</p><p>The president was out talking to people. You saw a lot of videos with him interacting with people. But, as you noted, and as Amna noted, also, the White House was being used in a very central way, in a way that`s very untraditional. A lot of people found it to be unethical.</p><p>There is a Hatch Act that`s supposed to really keep the campaign and the White House separate. But, yesterday, we really saw the blurring of the lines.</p><p>The other thing to note is that we`re going to see a number of White House officials speak tonight. There`s Vice President Mike Pence, who is going to be giving the keynote address. There`s also Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary. And there`s going to be Kellyanne Conway.</p><p>One other thing to note, there were a lot of misleading statements that have been said over the last week, including first lady Melania Trump. She said that there was an unprecedented number of women serving in the Trump administration.</p><p>That simply isn`t true, Judy. If you look at the numbers, the key executive nominees, the number of women in those positions in the Trump administration is much lower than when President Obama was in office.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Such important reporting.</p><p>Yamiche Alcindor, thank you, and you`re going to be with us tonight, of course, watching it all very closely.</p><p>Yamiche, thank you.</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Thank you.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Ronna McDaniel has played a key role planning this week`s convention. She is the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.</p><p>And she joins us now from her party`s headquarters in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Ronna McDaniel, thank you very much for being here.</p><p>So, you`re now at the halfway point. How do you feel the takeaway is so far? What do you think people are taking away from this convention?</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL, Chair, Republican National Committee: I think people are recognizing that we`re telling the story of real Americans in their own words and how the policies of this administration have impacted their lives directly, the farmer, the person who had a business where the PPP loan helped them, a child who benefited from the right-to-try executive order, the lobstermen from Maine.</p><p>So, that was our hope, is that it would be about the people of America and telling their stories.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: We notice the people who calculate TV audiences say the number watching the first night was, overall, less than it was for the Democratic Convention.</p><p>Last night, you were a lot closer. It was very close. But do you think you`re reaching not just the base you want to reach, but are you also reaching persuadable voters, do you think?</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL: I do. I do think we`re reaching persuadable voters.</p><p>I was listening to comments on C-SPAN last night after the programming was done, and there were many voters calling in and saying: I`m switching to Republican.</p><p>There was one Democrat from Lorain, Ohio, who said: I am so pleased with what I`m seeing, I`m switching my vote.</p><p>Those are the things we`re hearing. If you count our digital channels, which, of course, the RNC and the Trump campaign are pushing this out on our digital channels as well, the viewership is incredibly high.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: There is a fair amount of commentary out there about what is perceived as a disconnect about some of President Trump`s record and what is being said at the convention, I mean, with regard to the pandemic, with regard to the economy.</p><p>But even with regard to opioid addiction, just for example, one speaker described a decrease in opioid death in 2018. But we looked at federal, preliminary data from the CDC, and, in 2019, fatalities were up.</p><p>So, how much fact-checking is going on with your speakers?</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL: Well, there`s always going to be fact-checking. And you can`t deny the Trump administration has invested heavily, $6 billion, into the opioid pandemic.</p><p>You saw those numbers. The president has tackled this head on, and we`re talking about what the administration is doing every day to fight a crisis.</p><p>And I think the first lady made a good point last night. And I appreciate you bringing this up. Let`s not talk about gossip as much as in our headlines. Let`s talk about the opioid crisis. The president has declared it a public health emergency.</p><p>We have people from all walks of life continuing to pass away and be afflicted by this terrible crisis, yet it doesn`t give -- isn`t given the headlines that it deserves.</p><p>But we`re really pleased. And, again, these are stories told by people in their own words. I don`t think you can fact-check somebody who is saying, this is what happened for me, and this is why my life is better because of this policy. That`s just the truth.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: There`s been -- separately, there`s been a pretty dark picture painted at the convention of what Vice President Biden would do if he were elected president.</p><p>He`s been called a socialist, and worse, somebody who`s embraced the Bernie Sanders agenda. We know Joe Biden is clearly to the left of President Trump, but he has not embraced defunding the police. He has not embraced government-paid Medicare for all, for example.</p><p>So, do you owe your viewers a more realistic description of what Joe Biden stands for?</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL: Well, Joe Biden actually has said he would redirect funds from the police. I consider that defunding.</p><p>If somebody says, I`m going to take funds away from you and redirect them somewhere else, that means you`re not getting the funding. He`s picked a running mate in Kamala Harris who absolutely has embraced Medicare for all and a government takeover of health care.</p><p>And if you look at the platform of the party, which he combined with Bernie Sanders to create, there`s a lot in there that has shown that Joe Biden has lurched very leftward in his party and embraced many of the policies of Bernie Sanders.</p><p>And you know who said that at the convention? Bernie Sanders. He said: I ran on things that were out of the mainstream four years ago that are now part of our party.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to ask you very quickly, Ronna McDaniel, about former President George W. Bush.</p><p>Is he going to appear at the convention? And what about your own uncle, your former Republican nominee for president Senator Mitt Romney? Are they going to be there? And, if not, why not?</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL: Well, it is a different convention, Judy.</p><p>And I think you recognize that. It`s a virtual convention, so it`s not the same as crowds in Charlotte, like we were hoping to have, with the candidates parading across the stage.</p><p>So, we have two hours of programming that`s covered every night, and the president made a decision: I want this to be about the American people.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: But they`re not -- but they`re also not appearing in videos at the convention. And you have had two iconic Republican leaders pass away since the last convention, former President George H.W. Bush, John McCain.</p><p>What does it say, I think, about the party, Republican Party of today, that none of these figures is involved?</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL: Well, I don`t know if you have looked at the Democrat Convention and how many politicians they omitted.</p><p>I mean, we obviously at the RNC recognize the passing of our former president and our former nominee. But, right now, this convention is about nominating Donald Trump for president.</p><p>And with the restrictions that COVID has placed on our convention, I think most Americans recognize that the limited programming we have is going to be focused on why we need to reelect President Trump.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, well, we`re going to leave it there. We will be watching tonight and tomorrow night.</p><p>Republican Party Chair Ronna McDaniel, thank you very much.</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL: Thank you.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: A chaotic night in Kenosha, Wisconsin, one that led to two deaths after protests and confrontations, and after several days of anger, frustration and unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a black man. Authorities still have released few details about that shooting.</p><p>John Yang has the latest.</p><p>MAN: He shot him, man. He shot him.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Two people were shot to death, while another was wounded, as protests flared for a third night in Kenosha. Cell phone video appeared to capture a young white man firing a rifle in the street.</p><p>As the crowd scattered, the man walked down the middle of the street with his hands up as police arrived, though officers did not challenge or apprehend him. This afternoon, police in Illinois said they arrested 17- year-old Kyle Rittenhouse of Antioch, Illinois, which is about 20 miles from Kenosha.</p><p>Court filings say he`s being held on a charge of first-degree intentional homicide in Wisconsin.</p><p>Kenosha authorities said they`re looking into reports that he was part of a vigilante group patrolling the city.</p><p>DANIEL MISKINIS, Kenosha, Wisconsin, Police Chief: It`s a very active investigation. And we have a person in custody out of state.</p><p>Obviously, I will be working to bring that person to Wisconsin to face appropriate charges.</p><p>What I can`t tell you is what led to the disturbance that led to the use of deadly force by this person, and if both deaths are related to the same person. I don`t know that at this point.</p><p>JOHN YANG: The shootings horrified witnesses.</p><p>PAT, Shooting Witness: The man was laying on his stomach. He turns around, and first shot was fired. And that went straight into the guy. The second shot was fired. That went into another gentleman.</p><p>I ran inside. We got everyone away from the windows, got everyone down. And this gentleman stood up again, backing up, firing just down the street.</p><p>MAN: Was he a homeowner protecting his property? Was he someone against the Black Lives movement? What was he? We don`t know. It`s just crazy. It`s chaos, total chaos.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Outrage has filled the city`s streets since Sunday, when Kenosha police shot Jacob Blake, who is black, multiple times from behind at close range and in front of his three children.</p><p>His attorney said it would take a miracle for the 29-year-old to walk again.</p><p>Blake`s mother, Julia Jackson, today on \"CBS This Morning.\"</p><p>JULIA JACKSON, Mother of Jacob Blake: I feel like I`m in a bad dream. Never in a million years did I think -- we think that we would be here in this place. Him being alive is just a miracle in itself.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Last night`s protest began peacefully. Crowds gathered outside the Kenosha County Courthouse. Riot police stood guard and tactical vehicles patrolled the area.</p><p>The situation escalated when some demonstrators shook a protective fence and threw fireworks at police. Officers responded with tear gas to disperse the crowds to enforce an 8:00 p.m. curfew. Daylight revealed the extent of the damage, as crews cleared away rubble.</p><p>This afternoon, President Trump tweeted that federal law enforcement was on the way: \"We will not stand for looting, arson, violence, and lawlessness on American streets.\" He vowed to \"restore law and order.\"</p><p>Separately, Wisconsin Governor Tony Ever again redoubled the number of state National Guard troops deployed in Kenosha to 500, still short of the 1,500 troops Kenosha County officials called for.</p><p>ZACH RODRIGUEZ, Kenosha, Wisconsin, County Board of Supervisors: We need more National Guardsman on the ground. What the governor sent to us originally did not suffice. It didn`t even -- it didn`t put a dent in the damage that we were seeing happen to our community.</p><p>PROTESTERS: No justice, no peace!</p><p>JOHN YANG: Blake`s shooting reignited protests over police use of deadly force nationwide and through the NBA. The league postponed the three playoff games scheduled for today after the Milwaukee Bucks refused to take the court for their contest against the Orlando Magic.</p><p>In Kenosha, authorities are bracing for another night of protests, hoping that an earlier 7:00 p.m. curfew and the increased security will help keep the peace.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m John Yang.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to Stephanie Sy with the rest of the day`s headlines -- Stephanie.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: Thank you, Judy.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention drew new criticism today for saying people without COVID-19 symptoms do not need to get tested, even if they have been exposed. That reversed previous policy, and a number of public health experts warned it flies in the face of science.</p><p>We will get into this in detail after the news summary.</p><p>In Belarus, police broke up new demonstrations in Minsk and detained dozens of protesters who say the presidential election was rigged. Authorities also called in Nobel-winning author Svetlana Alexievich for questioning. She is part of an opposition council trying to negotiate a transition of power.</p><p>Police in Hong Kong arrested 16 people today on rioting charges tied to pro-democracy demonstrations in July of last year. Two opposition lawmakers were among those detained. They said they were the ones attacked by agitators in white shirts. Their party accused police of an anti-democratic crackdown.</p><p>WU CHI-WAI, Chair, Hong Kong Democratic Party (through translator): The police have committed a situation of abuse. This lets the public see what the government`s attitude towards the entire protest movement is. It`s clear that the government has no intention of trying to fix the administration`s mistakes and police abuse in the movement.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: Some 9,000 people have been arrested in Hong Kong since protests began in June of 2019.</p><p>We will talk to a leading Hong Kong democracy advocate later in the program.</p><p>U.S. and Russian forces have had their most serious confrontation in months in Eastern Syria in months. The National Security Council says a Russian military vehicle struck a U.S. vehicle, injuring four Americans. The Americans patrol the area against Islamic State fighters. The Russians support Syria`s regime.</p><p>At least 100 people have died in heavy flooding in Northern and Eastern Afghanistan. Strong seasonal rains brought mudslides that filled streets, submerged cars and destroyed more than 2,000 homes. Bulldozers and volunteers dug for survivors today.</p><p>Back in this country, evacuations ended for 35,000 people in Northern California, as cooler humid weather helped firefighters battling those huge fires. They made more progress, extending containment lines around the flames. But estimates of homes and other buildings destroyed rose sharply to well over 1,700.</p><p>U.S. intelligence officials say they have seen no sign that foreign countries are working to sabotage mail-in voting. They also report no evidence of any effort to commit widespread fraud with mailed ballots. President Trump has warned that both problems will be rampant this fall. But several intelligence agencies said today they have no evidence to support the claim.</p><p>And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 83 points to close near 28332. The Nasdaq rose 198 points, and the S&amp;P 500 added 35.</p><p>Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": concerns remain in the U.S. that politics trumps science as we battle COVID-19 and a rising death toll; the former owner of a pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong discusses his arrest under a new Chinese law; and, as he makes the case for reelection, we examine the president`s economic record amid the historic recession brought on by COVID-19.</p><p>Two recent moves, one by the Food and Drug Administration, the other by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have again raised questions about whether the Trump administration is injecting politics into the nation`s pandemic response.</p><p>William Brangham has the latest.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The first instance happened on Sunday night, when President Trump and the head of the FDA, Dr. Stephen Hahn, came forward to announce the emergency approval of convalescent plasma as a COVID-19 treatment.</p><p>Hahn overstated how effective the treatment was and, after much criticism, had to walk back his comments.</p><p>Then yesterday, the CDC changed its guidance on who should be getting tested for coronavirus. Without explanation, it removed its earlier advice that people with no symptoms get tested, even if they have been exposed to the virus.</p><p>I`m joined now by Dr. Thomas Frieden. He ran the CDC for eight years, and he`s now the head of a global health initiative called Resolve to Save Lives.</p><p>Dr. Frieden, great to see you again.</p><p>Could you just -- what is your sense? What do you make of these two changes? Is this just par for the course for science, or is there something more troubling going on here?</p><p>DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN, Former Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: This is not par for the course. This is unprecedented.</p><p>And, William, the fact is that the virus does not respond to spin. The virus responds to science. And these two moves taken together are very concerning.</p><p>They`re concerning in particular for what`s going to happen in the coming weeks and months with the rollout of a vaccine against COVID, because although a vaccine is the single most important thing we can have to protect ourselves against the virus, it`s not going to be quick, it`s not going to be simple, and getting people to take a vaccine requires a lot of trust and confidence.</p><p>And these are two moves that have undermined confidence of the public health community, of the scientific community, and I`m afraid of the broader community as well.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: On this issue of the testing change with the CDC, as I mentioned, you ran the CDC for many years.</p><p>Two news outlets today reported that pressure from the Trump administration came down to make that change. Do you really believe, knowing the men and women who run the CDC and make up its scientific cadre, that that`s really possible that that kind of pressure could be exerted and would have this effect?</p><p>DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN: I cannot a remember a single incident in my nearly eight years running the CDC or nearly 20 years working at the CDC where any entity other than the CDC got something put on the CDC Web site.</p><p>Unfortunately, that has happened repeatedly in the current administration. And that`s dangerous, because it undermines confidence in what has been one of our most trusted and trustworthy public health institutions.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Admiral Brett Giroir, who is running the testing, sort of the testing czar for the Trump administration`s Coronavirus Task Force, said today that there was no pressure involved.</p><p>I`m going to read a quote from him.</p><p>He said: \"There was no weight on the scales by the president or the vice president or Secretary Azar\" of HHS.</p><p>He says: \"This was a product produced by the scientific and medical people that was discussed extensively at the task force.\"</p><p>So, if we take him at his word and there wasn`t pressure, do you believe the science merits not testing people who are asymptomatic? That, thus far, has been a public health strategy that we all know.</p><p>DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN: Let`s be frank. We don`t have enough tests. The administration perhaps doesn`t want to say that, but there aren`t enough tests that can come back in a meaningful time frame, one or two days.</p><p>Therefore, we have to prioritize. That`s reasonable. Symptomatic people, people who are in congregate facilities, like nursing homes, homeless shelters, correctional facilities, meatpacking plants, where you can have massive outbreaks, are higher priority.</p><p>Some asymptomatic people are at lower priority. If a college wants to test every kid coming back to campus, that`s not a high priority when we have limited tests.</p><p>But a contact of someone who has COVID is high priority, because they may have the infection without having symptoms. They may actually be the source of the infection, without knowing that they have it. And you can`t stop chains of transmission unless you can find chains s of transmission.</p><p>So it`s really not defensible to say that asymptomatic contacts should not be tested.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let`s turn to this issue of convalescent plasma and Dr. Hahn seemingly to make a fairly basic scientific mistake in overstating the effectiveness of that.</p><p>He later, as I mentioned, walked that statement back.</p><p>Do you just chalk that up to a mistake, or, again, with that particular issue, do you see something else afoot?</p><p>DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN: There`s no question that there was a desire to describe this as a major breakthrough, when, in fact, what we have is a 100-year-old treatment that may work somewhat for some patients.</p><p>And whether or not an emergency use authorization is justified, the bottom line is, we`re not going to be able to learn how to help patients most if this kind of politics is played with science. We have to do careful studies. Maybe certain antibodies work better than others. Maybe certain patients will be benefited more than others.</p><p>Maybe it`s only useful in the first day or two after people get sick. We don`t know that. And now we may not know it for even longer. This is about figuring out how to control COVID, not how to control the news cycle.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Dr. Thomas Frieden, former head of the CDC, and now CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, thank you very much again.</p><p>DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN: Thank you, William.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: As we reported, there were more arrests in Hong Kong today, part of an ongoing campaign targeting pro-democracy activists.</p><p>Beijing now has a powerful new weapon to punish its critics in Hong Kong: a national security law passed in late June that allows authorities to sentence demonstrators to life in prison.</p><p>Nick Schifrin sits down with one of the law`s most prominent targets.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Two months ago, Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong that promised to punish not only people for what they did, but also what they said. Anyone who participates in any action that calls for separating Hong Kong from China, anyone who receives support from a foreign country, even anyone who provokes hatred of Beijing can be arrested and sentenced to life in prison.</p><p>The most prominent person arrested, 72-year-old Jimmy Lai, outspoken pro- democracy voice, billionaire media tycoon. He came to Hong Kong when he was 12, stowed away on a fishing boat, worked his way up from the bottom to found a clothing chain and then Hong Kong`s largest newspaper.</p><p>Earlier this month, Hong Kong police arrested him and frog-marched him through his own newsroom. He`s now been accused of colluding with foreign countries.</p><p>And now Jimmy Lai joins me from Hong Kong.</p><p>Jimmy Lai, welcome to the \"NewsHour.\"</p><p>What is the message that Hong Kong police are trying to send to everyone when they arrest you so publicly?</p><p>JIMMY LAI, Founder, Next Digital: It probably is the intention of showing the teeth of the national security law, because they already have had a very powerful, intimidating effect in Hong Kong`s resistance movement.</p><p>A lot of those young people or even some of the older ones who were involved in the movement either have left or leaving. A lot of them who are staying have sidestepped the movement.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: If that`s the case of the impact of the crackdown by Beijing, what is the state of press freedom, what is the state of freedom of speech today in Hong Kong?</p><p>JIMMY LAI: As long as people are becoming more cautious, what they write, what they say, and in fear of violating the national security law, the freedom of speech is not there.</p><p>Yes, we are still doing what we are supposed to do. But we don`t know when there will be a clampdown again on us. So, just because of this apprehension has made the freedom of speech not so free.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Do you believe you were arrested because, last summer, you met with Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo?</p><p>JIMMY LAI: They are very strict about collusion with a foreign power.</p><p>Even now, accepting your interview could be collusion with foreign power. So, I have to be cautious of what I say, you know? So this is the fact of life here now.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Do you feel that you`re already self-censoring?</p><p>JIMMY LAI: Well, no, no. If I`m self-censoring, I wouldn`t accept the interview.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: What can the U.S. do in order to try and guarantee that Hong Kong at least maintains some of its freedoms?</p><p>JIMMY LAI: If I tell you what they should do, I will be in violation of the national security law, which I will avoid.</p><p>But I think the most important thing is, like, accepting your interview now. Hong Kong is a very unique place. People here share the same value as you guys in the U.S.</p><p>We are very different from the Chinese in China, because they have a totally different value. We have a value as the legacy of our past colonial time. The British did not give us democracy, but the British gave us the rule of law, the private property, the freedom of speech, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom of religion.</p><p>If the American people know that we are being attacked, they can resonate with us, and the support will be very important to us.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Beijing says that it passed the national security law because it needed to because of violence last year in Hong Kong. We did see violence in protests.</p><p>I have to ask, were you at any point during some of these violent protests worried about security being eroded in Hong Kong?</p><p>JIMMY LAI: Well, I was worried about the violence, because violence is not our power. We can`t be more violent than the CCP, who has guns and tanks.</p><p>Our power is our moral authority. We have to stay in the nonviolent and peaceful resistance.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: And, finally, Jimmy Lai, you are, as we talked about earlier, accused of colluding with a foreign power.</p><p>Are you resigned, on a personal level, to being found guilty and spending a long time, even perhaps the rest of your life, in prison?</p><p>JIMMY LAI: I don`t think about this, because I don`t want to put the psychological burden on myself until the time comes.</p><p>You know, I`m not worried, just because, if my life is about myself, it would be meaningless. Only when I detach from myself and thinking of my life is about something bigger, and not about myself, that my life becomes meaningful. And that makes me going every day.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Jimmy Lai, joining us from Hong Kong, thank you very much.</p><p>JIMMY LAI: Thank you.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: That`s all from here -- Judy.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, Stephanie.</p><p>So, throughout this week, Republicans have cited President Trump`s economic policies as one key reason they believe he should be reelected.</p><p>One important question for voters: What would a second-term agenda look like for President Trump, even as COVID continues to drag on the economy?</p><p>Paul Solman is back tonight with a look at the Trump plan and his record so far.</p><p>It`s part of our series, Making Sense.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States: We did it. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now I have to do it again. That`s God testing me.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: President Trump`s pitch to voters: Under his watch, the economy was heaven until his COVID test, and though almost 30 million Americans are on unemployment right now:</p><p>STEVE CORTES, Trump 2020 Campaign Senior Adviser: He is the right leader to create the conditions for the Trump boom 2.0.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: And boom 2.0 is just around the corner, says campaign adviser Steve Cortes.</p><p>STEVE CORTES: Recent economic data in the last few weeks has really been quite fantastic. Housing starts are soaring, existing home sales off the charts, biggest month ever, last month, industrial production picking up.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: The president sees a so-called V-shaped recovery, a steep economic decline followed quickly by a strong rebound.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP: The V is turning out to be true. I was saying a V, and everybody was saying, a V is impossible. But the V is -- it`s beyond a V. It`s a super V, based on the numbers that we have now.</p><p>Over the past three months, we have gained nine million jobs nationwide, which is a new record.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: But after having lost 22 million jobs the two months prior.</p><p>You`re talking about from a historically low point, right?</p><p>STEVE CORTES: Sure. We have a long way to go. We`re all aware of that. I`m not Pollyanna. I don`t think things are fine, by any stretch. But there are reasons, legitimate reasons, for optimism.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: On top of the several trillions in government spending bills to resurrect the economy, passed in Congress, signed by the president, he has issued new executive actions, one, to continue extra unemployment benefits.</p><p>STEVE CORTES: For those who are looking for work or who don`t have enough work, because of the president`s strong executive action, they`re going to get $400 per week, $300 of it coming from the federal government, $100 being matched by the states, and make sure that they can pay their bills while they`re still looking.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: So far, 32 states have been approved to offer the benefits, but just two have begun distributing funds, and only three will contribute the $100 state match.</p><p>Other executive actions: Direct government officials to identify funds to prevent evictions, though it`s unclear they have the authority. Defer student loan payments through 2020. Provide a payroll tax holiday through the end of the year to those with income of $104,000 or less -- and so President Trump`s economic platform to address the immediate economic crisis.</p><p>STEVE CORTES: Near-term, I think the helps will be tax cut, regulatory relief on the one hand, and then, on the other side, for people still looking, continued enhanced unemployment, which the president is providing through executive order.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: But relief through executive action raises legal questions, since the Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power of the purse.</p><p>STEVE CORTES: It`s regrettable. Look, I`m a constitutionalist. I don`t love the idea of presidents using aggressive executive action often. But these are incredibly unusual circumstances. It`s a crisis in our country right now. And the president felt compelled to take strong leadership.</p><p>And, in this case, unfortunately, he had to do it unilaterally.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Unilaterally, the Democrats argue, because Republicans won`t give enough aid to workers and states, won`t fund the post office, in order to jeopardize the electoral process. and, says former Vice President Joe Biden, even if Trump could manage to make the payroll tax holiday permanent, it would cripple Social Security.</p><p>JOSEPH BIDEN (D), Presidential Candidate: He`s proposing to eliminate a tax that pays for almost half the Social Security, without any way of making up for that lost revenue, resulting in cuts.</p><p>STEVE CORTES: The president has been incredibly clear about this, that Social Security is not in any way at risk. He is not in any way targeting Social Security.</p><p>No senior, nobody who gets Social Security payments -- because it`s not only seniors -- nobody who gets those payments should feel it in any way threatened by this move.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: In other words, President Trump, with a second term, would be committed to funding Social Security out of general funds?</p><p>STEVE CORTES: That is correct.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Biden also criticized the tax cuts Trump signed in 2017, calling them:</p><p>JOSEPH BIDEN: The president`s $1.3 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest 1 percent and the biggest, most profitable corporations, some of which do not pay any tax at all.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: While high earners and companies were the biggest winners, most Americans did get a tax cut. The law may have boosted the economy in the short-run, but it failed to stimulate significant growth over time.</p><p>Still, Trump maintains:</p><p>DONALD TRUMP: I will always put American workers first, always.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: A key strategy of the president`s: trade wars with China and others.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP: I love properly put-on tariffs, because they bring unfair competitors from foreign countries to do whatever you want them to do.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: In a second term, Trump would remain tough on trade, bring business back to America, says Cortes.</p><p>STEVE CORTES: How do we do that? I think it`s two ways. Number one, we continue to negotiate smarter trade deals, as we did with the USMCA with our neighbors and allies Mexico and Canada. We need to use that as a template for other countries, like the U.K., Japan, et cetera.</p><p>Number two, I think we encourage onshoring by being very tough with China. It is very clear that China has been abusing and exploiting the United States in trade for decades.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: In the president`s first term, the China trade war arguably slowed growth and cost jobs. But, in a second term, a renewed onshoring push will spur hiring, says Cortes.</p><p>STEVE CORTES: We`re for onshoring generally, but most specifically for critical areas of our economy that relate to our national security, things like supplies of medicines.</p><p>I think it`s critical for the United States that sensitive supply lines for things like medicine be brought back to the United States, that we cannot be dependent upon other countries.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: This is Paul Solman.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And, before we go, Amna Nawaz is back with what we can expect from tonight`s Republican Convention.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: That`s right, Judy.</p><p>Well, women will once again feature prominently in the lineup of speakers for tonight`s Republican National Convention. We are going to hear from female members of the Republican Caucus, including Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa.</p><p>Also delivering remarks tonight, some of the women who work with President Trump in the West Wing, like his senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany.</p><p>Later in the evening, we will hear from second lady Karen Pence. And tonight`s keynote will come from her husband, Vice President Mike Pence. He will be formally accepting the Republican Party`s nomination.</p><p>We`re going to hear from them, Judy, and a host of others. That`s tonight, on the third night of the Republican National Convention.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And we have got a lot to look forward to, and you will be with us, Amna. Thank you.</p><p>And a news update before we go there.</p><p>The only Native American on federal death row was executed today.</p><p>Lezmond Mitchell was put to death in a federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, despite objections from the leaders of the Navajo Nation, citing violations of tribal sovereignty. Mitchell was convicted in connection to the slayings in 2001 of a 9-year-old and her grandmother.</p><p>And that`s the \"NewsHour\" for tonight.</p><p>Please join us starting at 8:00 Eastern tonight for our special coverage of the Republican National Convention. We will have a panel of experts and be speaking with Republican Congressman Tom Cole of Oklahoma.</p><p>I`m Judy Woodruff.</p><p>For all of us at the \"PBS NewsHour,\" thank you, and we will see you shortly.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSHR-2020082601cb112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSHR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P6-7S91-JB20-G488-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152462</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8711\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MacNeil/Lehrer Productions All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>PBS NewsHour (formerly The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 26, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL &amp;

You say, I want to shut down the government. We don`t.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: Welcome to divided government in the era of Trump. The president, as he has done before, opened a tense high-stakes and traditionally private meeting to the cameras.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>President of the United States: I would like to not to see a government closing, a shutdown.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: But never before have we seen this kind of real-time look at negotiations between branches of government, with <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>looking to press his case for billions in funding for a border wall.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: We need border security. The wall is a part of border security. You can`t have very good border security without the wall.</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>NANCY PELOSI </nameText></person>(D-CA), House Minority Leader: That`s simply not true, because that is a political promise. Border security is a way to effectively honor our responses.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>CHUCK SCHUMER</nameText></person>: And the experts say you can do border security without a wall, which is wasteful and doesn`t solve the problem.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: It totally solves the problem.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: And Democrats looking to highlight Mr. Trump`s threat to partially shut down government over this.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>CHUCK SCHUMER</nameText></person>: One thing I think we can agree on is we shouldn`t shut down the government over a dispute. And you want to shut it down. You keep talking about.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: Yes. If we don`t get what we want one way or the other, whether it`s through you, through a military, through anything you want to call, I will shut down the government, absolutely.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>CHUCK SCHUMER</nameText></person>: Okay, fair enough. We disagree. We disagree.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: And I will tell you what, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don`t want criminals and people that have lots of problems, and drugs pouring into our country.</p><p>So I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I`m not going to blame you for it. The last time you shut it down, it didn`t work. I will take the mantle of shutting down, and I`m going to shut it down for border security.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>CHUCK SCHUMER</nameText></person>: But we believe you shouldn`t shut it down.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: Congress has a long to-do list before the December 21 deadline to pass more funding. But the most stubborn block on that goal is the president`s demand for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.</p><p>In the next spending bill, he wants $5 billion for the wall. Democrats currently are offering $1.3 billion, not for the wall, but for border security.</p><p>But the real math problem is about votes. Any funding bill needs support of Democrats in the Senate, led by <person><nameText>Chuck Schumer. </nameText></person>But House Democratic Leader Pelosi questioned if Mr. Trump`s plan even has enough Republican support in the House.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: If I needed the votes for the wall in the House, I would have them in one session. It would be done.</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>NANCY PELOSI</nameText></person>: Well, then go do it. Go do it.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: It doesn`t help, because we need 10 Democrats in the Senate.</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>NANCY PELOSI</nameText></person>: No, don`t put it on the Senate; put it on -- put it on the negotiation.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: OK, let me ask you this, just -- and we`re doing this in a very friendly manner. It doesn`t help for me to take a vote in the House, where I will win easily with the Republicans.</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>NANCY PELOSI</nameText></person>: You will not win.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: It doesn`t help to take the vote, because I`m not going to vote the vote of the Senate.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: I need 10 senators. That`s the problem.</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>NANCY PELOSI</nameText></person>: Mr. President, you have the White House, you have the Senate.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: I have the White House. The White House is done.</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>NANCY PELOSI</nameText></person>: You have the House.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: And the House would give me the vote if I wanted it. But I can`t because I need...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: Nancy, I need 10 votes from Chuck.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>CHUCK SCHUMER</nameText></person>: All right, let me say something here.</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>NANCY PELOSI</nameText></person>: Let me -- let me say one thing. The fact is that you do not have the votes in the House.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: Nancy, I do, and we need border security.</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>NANCY PELOSI</nameText></person>: Well, let`s take the vote, and we`ll find out.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: Nancy -- Nancy, we need border security. It`s very simple.</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>NANCY PELOSI</nameText></person>: Of course we do.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: And the politics are even more complicated. As Democrats prepare to take over the House of Representatives, Pelosi is vying to be speaker of the House, though she has yet to clearly clinch all the votes needed.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>seemed to nod to that, evoking fast response.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: I also know that, you know, Nancy`s in a situation where it`s not easy for her to talk right now, and I understand, and I fully understand that. We`re going to have a good discussion, and we`re going to see what happens. But we have to have border security.</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>NANCY PELOSI</nameText></person>: Mr. President -- Mr. President, please don`t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>CHUCK SCHUMER</nameText></person>: Elections have consequences, Mr. President.</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>NANCY PELOSI</nameText></person>: Let me just -- let me just...</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: While few Republicans echoed the president`s shutdown push, they did charge that Democrats are not serious about border security.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reacted.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority Leader: It would be truly bizarre for them to decide they prefer a partial government shutdown to reasonable funding for national security. I would seem as through their party is more committed to political spite for the president than to the public interest.</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>NANCY PELOSI</nameText></person>: Good afternoon. We just had a meeting of which you saw the introduction to.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: Schumer and Pelosi reconvened outside the White House after their meeting.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>CHUCK SCHUMER</nameText></person>: The bottom line is simple. The president made clear that he wants a shutdown. If he sticks to his position for a $5 billion wall, he will get no wall and he will get a shutdown.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: The shutdown would impact about a quarter of U.S. government agencies, including the State Department and USDA. It would mean the closure of national parks and forced time off for thousands of U.S. federal employees.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And Lisa joins me now, along with our White House correspondent, Yamiche Alcindor.</p><p>Hello to both of you. I think we have just been watching a White House meeting that went off the rails.</p><p>Yamiche, how do you understand that the president was so willing to air his strong differences with Democrats in front of the public, the American people?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Well, the president wanted to make his position crystal clear, and he wanted transparency. He wanted to look strong before cameras.</p><p>And this is a president who understands the media. He understands those moments are going to be played over and over again, and he was hoping he could punch hard and he could then come out and look on top and look like he was someone who was fighting hard for border security.</p><p>Of course, what he got instead was Democrats who were pushing back just as hard. I think the key moment there was when he was talking to <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi, </nameText></person>and he was mocking her, almost saying, look, you`re not speaker of the House yet, you can`t be candid.</p><p>But instead of backing down, <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi </nameText></person>said, hey, guess what, we had a big election victory. And that went straight to the president`s heart. So I think the president is in some ways feeling a little wounded tonight, as he thinks about how this coverage, how this really affects his White House.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, what was the reaction at the Capitol from Republicans and Democrats?</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: There`s plenty of it.</p><p>Let`s start with Republicans. Interesting, Judy. There`s only one Republican I spoken to on the Hill, Senator Lindsey Graham, who is on the side of the president in everything he`s saying. Graham is saying, yes, he should talk about a shutdown, that it is worth it.</p><p>But, otherwise, Judy, Republicans very along a spectrum that I would say ranges from stoic observation of the fact that the president operates like this often, to those who are openly uncomfortable with the president taking blame, as a Republican, for a potential shutdown at Christmas.</p><p>Now, they also all admit that he`s someone who operate outside of space and time politically. So perhaps this is a case where the base is happy. Unclear.</p><p>Democrats, Judy, they think this is a win universally for them. But, however, they have to make some real strategic decisions coming off that they think the fact that president talked about owning a shutdown. That`s what they wanted out of this meeting, and they got it.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Yamiche, we noted the president said he would be proud to own a shutdown. Do we understand his thinking there? And is he willing at all to consider compromise?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: The president thinks a government shutdown will help him politically. He`s not willing to back down, from all the sourcing that I have been able to gather today.</p><p>The president has been pitting Americans against immigrants. Today, he said over and over again, immigrants are going to bring drugs to this country, they`re going to be criminals. He said -- quote -- \"They`re going to bring diseases to this country.\"</p><p>So this is a president that`s hoping that if he takes jobs from thousands of people and shuts down the government, that he can do it in the name of pitting Americans vs. immigrants.</p><p>And this is something that worked at times during the midterms. You think of what he said in Florida during the midterms and this idea that he ran that ad that was deemed almost two racist for both FOX News and CNN and other networks to really put on their network.</p><p>So what you have is a president who`s doubling down on his strategy and hoping that this political bet is going to pay off.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa, I know you have been doing some reporting on whether there`s room, if there`s any room for compromise around the Capitol. What are you hearing?</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: Well, think about this strange situation we`re in, Judy.</p><p>This argument is really over about $3.5 billion, which is a fraction of 1 percent of the total federal budget. So it`s really mostly a symbolic battle. And we also heard the president perhaps tip off what many people, both parties, think could be the pivot point here. What defines wall funding?</p><p>Today in this meeting, he said, wall funding is important. And then he stopped and said, but I want to say, let`s say border security funding is important.</p><p>So if the money goes to something like fencing or cyber-technology, those are the kinds of things that Democrats are happy to pay for and very likely, I think, to increase the funding for.</p><p>One more thing, Judy, one X-factor next week, already members of Congress are leaving town for good. I spoke to one member who took her final vote today. So it`s not clear who would even be voting on this bill. And I also think, to the president`s assertion that he has the votes to pass $5 billion in wall funding, it is not clear that he does.</p><p>And Speaker Ryan himself would not directly say if Republicans have those votes in the House. So that`s another problem for the president.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Very interesting.</p><p>And, very quickly -- we have only got about 30 seconds, Lisa.</p><p>There was significant movement, an announcement today from the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, that he is willing to put criminal justice reform up for a vote. Tell us just quickly what happened there.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: This could move very quickly. This is historic reform on criminal justice.</p><p>It does deal some with sentencing. It is not as far as many Democrats would like to go, but it is farther than we have seen Congress go ever before. Expect it to move fast and expect us to talk a lot more about it on this show.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Lisa Desjardins and Yamiche Alcindor watching all these important things, thank you all. Thank you both very much.</p><p>And now for a Republican point of view from the Capitol, Representative Doug Collins from Georgia. He`s also the House Republican Conference vice chair.</p><p>Representative Collins, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>So, we heard the president today say that he`s proud to own a government shutdown. Are congressional Republicans proud to own the shutdown, if it happens?</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (R), Georgia: Well, let`s frame this the way the president did.</p><p>When he was confronted with <person><nameText>Chuck Schumer, </nameText></person>who didn`t want any part of his own responsibility in this, the fact that he was putting American citizens below a caravan and other immigrants who are willing to grow under and over walls and through borders through previous countries, he is simply saying, I`m willing to have the argument about, who is -- who`s been what here?</p><p>He said, I`m putting the American citizen first, I`m putting our security first, I`m putting the willingness to negotiate and say, let`s find a deal. And Mr. Schumer is simply saying, we`re not going to go any further. We have made our last remarks.</p><p>So I think it`s a matter of how we actually parse what the president is saying. He said, I will have this argument. I will own that part.</p><p>But <person><nameText>Chuck Schumer, </nameText></person>again, like he did back in January, he`s got to realize he`s putting Americans below folks who are trying to basically break into this country.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: What about your own view, though, Congressman Collins? Do you think a government shutdown -- that it`s worth a government shutdown to get $5 billion or whatever the president`s asking for, for a border wall?</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS: I think it`s a time for us to come to this table and say, we need a serious discussion about this issue.</p><p>We have punted on this one for a while. We have talked about this before. This is one piece of what is broken about our immigration system. You cannot have a fix, whether it be issues of DACA, issues of guest workers, issues of other things that we need in our immigration system that are viable, legal functions, without having to deal with how we handle our security.</p><p>This has become an important part. And, unfortunately, we have had a discussion of one or the other, but not both. I think this is something it`s now time to have. It provides a discussion point for us to jump off to.</p><p>And nobody would ever say that the best way to find this is to do a shutdown. But I think, at some point in time, we also have to come up to the reality of, these are deadlines that need to be met. And if they`re not met, the president is saying, we need to have this discussion now.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, even if it means a shutdown?</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS: I think, at some point, that is what we`re leading to. I don`t think anybody would want that.</p><p>Let`s also remember, this is the first round of them sitting down. This is the first round of a president who is a negotiator, who is a dealer, who`s wanting to put things out there.</p><p>I`m going to give him the credit to say, let`s start this process. Look, everybody wants to have a clock somewhere. They want to have a clock saying the shutdown is so much.</p><p>It`s the way, unfortunately, this town has learned to operate. I`m ready to see us break out of this and have honest discussions about issues. And I think the president laid that on the table today, and it was sort of interesting when you saw that Mr. Schumer was one willing to negotiate, while Ms. Pelosi was wanting to move the cameras out. That`s not transparency.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you about what the president is saying, though. He says he wants a wall. He wants $5 billion, give or take for that wall.</p><p>Democrats are now saying -- and we did an interview this evening with Congressman Steny Hoyer, the number two Democrat in the House -- saying they -- he thinks there could be movement on money, in other words, for border security, but not for a wall.</p><p>Would that be acceptable to congressional Republicans?</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS: I think the president has made his point that we need the wall, we need that security. This is about border security. Let`s keep it where it`s at.</p><p>And if that`s the wall part of it, if that`s the other functions of it, then we`re glad to see that Mr. Hoyer is willing to come to the table and discuss the fact that security is needed.</p><p>I think at this point in time, what we have really got to focus on is, we`re in the phases of where we have time to fix this. It`s time for the president, as he has done today, just take that step forward and say, here`s my negotiating point.</p><p>Now, where do we go from here? If the Democrats simply come to the table and said, no, Mr. President, we`re not going to do that, and if Ms. Pelosi is worried about her position or even her newfound possibility of being speaker, then we were not coming at it from a position of strength from either side.</p><p>So we need to make sure that the president, who has made it very clear what he wants -- we`re standing behind him. We`re -- we have done this in the House, and it`s now time for the Senate to also decide who they`re going to support as well.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: But do I hear you saying, though, this is all the Democrats` doing, that the president doesn`t bear some responsibility for what transpired today?</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS: We all bear responsibility.</p><p>I think what the president did was really interesting. How many times have the media said, we would love to know what goes on behind closed doors? Why don`t you tell us what goes on?</p><p>And what was really interesting for me today is, the president made his position. This is not something that`s normal. This president likes to talk about it. He likes to have it out in public.</p><p>What I noticed was interesting was is, as we discuss this, these are valid things to discuss. Now, once the press left, they had more discussions about that. But it was interesting to me that they would discuss this back and forth, but yet, at the same time, there was also some -- Ms. Pelosi in particular, who was saying, shouldn`t we have these off camera?</p><p>I think part of that is some of the issues that we need to have. There`s always negotiations that need to be in private. Those are things. But I think laying out the framework of where parties are was important in this part. And I think the president was right for that.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: I`m thinking of the musical \"Hamilton\" and the song \"I want to be in the room where it happened.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: But just very quickly, do you see compromise coming here?</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS: I think there`s room for an opening.</p><p>The president has always been one -- I mean, it`s sort of been his trademark throughout his career. It`s the art of the deal. It`s trying to find that way forward to make sure that we get -- his first commitment was always to border security and to Americans and making sure that we have what we need, to then fix the other problems.</p><p>I think there is room here. I think we`re going to see the administration work toward this. I know us on -- the folks up here on Capitol Hill are willing to work toward that. We need to make sure that we`re putting the American people first.</p><p>I believe the president is. It`s now time for the Congress to get on this negotiation.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Representative Doug Collins, thank you very much.</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS: It`s always good to see you, Judy. Take care.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: As we just heard, for the Democrats` perspective, I did speak just a short time ago to Maryland Congressman Steny Hoyer. He is Nancy Pelosi`s deputy. He`s the incoming majority leader.</p><p>We went over where things go from here after today`s Oval Office meeting.</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER (D-MD), Minority Whip: He likes theater. He likes playing for the camera.</p><p>And very difficult to have any serious negotiations when you`re, in effect, speaking to millions of people, as opposed to just the president or the person you`re negotiating with.</p><p>But it`s a -- it`s a tactic of his, and I think it`s not particularly productive.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: It looks as if this is at an impasse until the last minute. Is that what`s going on now?</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER: Well, it appears to be.</p><p>You know, the president has said last year, he`s repeated this year, and he repeated three times today how he would be proud to shut down the government, that he was looking forward, and he would shut down the government. And if he didn`t get what he wanted, he would shut down the government.</p><p>I think that`s awfully unfortunate, for a president of the United States, who is responsible for the executive department, saying, I`m going to shut down government if I don`t get exactly what I want.</p><p>None of us get exactly what we want, and shutting down the government shouldn`t be an alternative. And, as a matter of fact, I think almost every Republican leader has urged the president not to shut down the government.</p><p>We are prepared to fund border security. We believe in border security. We need to make our country safe. What we don`t believe in is that the wall that the president proposes to build, which he said was going to be paid for by the Mexican government, we don`t believe that`s a very effective tool.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: But...</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER: And, as a matter of fact, we think there are a lot of Republicans who share that view. So, it is very, very unfortunate.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: But if I could just interrupt, there is still a gap, though, a significant gap between what the president is asking for, over $5 billion. Democrats are saying 1-point-something-billion.</p><p>Democrats have a responsibility here, too, as you just said, both sides. Why not give more in order to reach an agreement?</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER: Well, I think, frankly, if we had those discussions about, give me some more money, if that would be focused on border security, and making sure the border is secure -- I mean, he sent thousands of troops to the border to make it secure, which was very, very costly.</p><p>So that I think that would be a discussion we could have. But Leader Schumer and Leader Pelosi made it very clear that the wall is not an option that we`re going to vote for.</p><p>Now, he -- his party controls the House of Representatives. It controls the United States Senate. And if they can pass it, fine. That`s -- they`re in the majority. But if they can`t pass it, or if we can`t pass something, then we need to compromise.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: I do want to quote something that Leader Pelosi said in a report back to colleagues at the Capitol after the meeting. It`s been reported she was talking about the president.</p><p>She said: \"It`s like a manhood thing for him, as if manhood could ever be associated with him\" -- end quote.</p><p>Were you there when this was said?</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER: I wasn`t there, Judy. I didn`t hear that quote.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: If she said this, is this the kind of thing that do you think affects the working relationship between Democrats and the president?</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER: Well, I think there`s nobody who uses rhetoric in a harsher way than the president of the United States and makes it more difficult to reach compromise, frankly, than <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>But having said that, hopefully -- this is bigger than Nancy or bigger than the president. This is talking about the United States government staying operative, serving the American people, staying on guard for the people`s safety and service.</p><p>And we ought not we ought -- we ought not to get into that rhetoric. What we ought to get into is, you said he can`t pass this bill because he can`t get enough votes in the Senate. I agree with that. That`s correct. He`s correct on that point.</p><p>Therefore, he wants something, and it`s necessary for him to compromise. He says he wants something to keep the border secure. We are for that. I`m sure we will agree to additional -- additions to the budget to better secure the borders.</p><p>What we don`t believe is, the wall is good policy. And it won`t work. And experts make that point to us. And, therefore, we are prepared to compromise on money, but we`re not prepared to compromise on the end that he wants to seek. And, if he had the votes, he could do it. He doesn`t have the votes. He needs to compromise.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: House Minority Whip Representative Steny Hoyer, thank you very much.</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER: Thank you very much, Judy.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day`s other news: The U.S. Senate passed a farm bill worth $867 billion over 10 years, after months of stalled negotiations. It includes billions for farm subsidies, and it reauthorizes conservation programs. But it also rejects stricter limits on food stamps. The House could vote as soon as tomorrow.</p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency called today for rolling back federal protections for thousands of waterways and wetlands. Farmers, developers and energy companies had sought the move. Environmental groups condemned it. It is aimed at Obama era rules that greatly expanded the reach of the Clean Water Act.</p><p>We will have the details later in the program.</p><p>In Charlottesville, Virginia, a jury recommended a life sentence, plus 419 years for a man who killed a counterprotester and injured dozens at a white supremacist rally. James Fields was convicted last week of first- degree murder. He drove a car into a crowd at the 2017 rally.</p><p>The mother of Heather Heyer, the protester who was killed, spoke outside the courtroom today.</p><p>SUSAN BRO, Mother of Heather Heyer: I`m kind of running through about 50 different emotions all at once. Bottom line is, justice has him where he needs to be, and my daughter is still not here and the other survivors still have their wounds to deal with. So we have all been damaged permanently, but we do survive, we do move forward.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: A judge will issue the final sentence at a hearing in March.</p><p>Britain`s Prime Minister Theresa May began a mission today to rescue her Brexit deal in Parliament. It faces strong opposition over a so-called backstop provision that could leave Britain subject to European Union customs rules indefinitely. May sought reassurances on that point today from Dutch, German and E.U. leaders.</p><p>James Mates of Independent Television News reports.</p><p>JAMES MATES: Stop three on a frantic, some might even say desperate, diplomatic dash across Europe.</p><p>In a parallel universe this evening, she would have been celebrating victory in Parliament and a triumphant and orderly Brexit. Instead, she is now pleading with leaders in Brussels for something, anything they can give her to stave off humiliation.</p><p>THERESA MAY, British Prime Minister: Whatever outcome you want, whatever relationship you want with Europe in the future, there`s no deal available that doesn`t have a backstop in it. But we don`t want the backstop to be used. As it is, we want to be certain that it is only temporary.</p><p>JAMES MATES: At crack of dawn this morning, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte had jumped on his bike and peddled over to meet her. It`s fair to say no one had quite been expecting to be dealing with Brexit again today.</p><p>The greeting from perhaps Britain`s most sympathetic ally on the continent was warm, but little was on offer. \"Well, you can`t refuse someone a cup of coffee,\" said the country`s foreign minister, rather pointedly.</p><p>By lunchtime, it was Berlin and a red carpet hastily rolled out by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The message from the Germans, as relayed through their Europe minister: \"It`s good to talk, but there definitely won`t be any reopening of negotiations.\"</p><p>At the European Parliament in Strasbourg, almost word for word the same from the commission president.</p><p>JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER, President, European Commission: There is no room whatsoever for renegotiation. But, of course, there is room -- if used intelligently, there is room to give further clarification.</p><p>JAMES MATES: If the British strategy is once again to try to win concessions in other European capitals that they have failed to win in Brussels, it`s likely to meet with the same failure as it`s done throughout this two-year Brexit process.</p><p>When they all meet together in a single room at the summit on Thursday, Mrs. May seems certain to face once more an E.U.-27 speaking with a single voice.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: That report from James Mates of Independent Television News.</p><p>In France, a gunman killed at least four people and wounded 11 near a world-renowned Christmas market in Strasbourg. Ambulances rushed to the scene and police spread out looking for the gunman. They identified him as a possible extremist with a criminal record.</p><p>The United States today returned three revered bells to the Philippines 117 years after they were seized during the Philippine-American War. They were taken from a church in Balangiga. That`s in 1901, when villagers killed 48 American soldiers. The U.S. Army killed thousands of Filipinos in retaliation.</p><p>Today, a U.S. military cargo plane unloaded the bronze bells at a base in Manila. The U.S. ambassador there said it closes a painful chapter.</p><p>SUNG KIM, U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines: The bells of Balangiga are now home in the Philippines, where they belong. Secretary Lorenzana, please take them to the people of Balangiga, to the Church of San Lorenzo. May they ring in peace and bear testament to the ties and values which bind our two great nations for generations to come.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. captured the Philippines in 1898 during the Spanish-American War, but Filipinos fought for independence for several more years. The country gained independence finally in 1946.</p><p>A Canadian judge has granted bail today to Meng Wanzhou. That is the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei. She now faces possible extradition to the U.S. for allegedly violating sanctions on Iran. The judge set bail at $7.5 million and ordered Meng to surrender her passport and agree to electronic monitoring.</p><p>Meanwhile, Canadian officials confirmed that a former Canadian diplomat has been detained in Beijing, apparently in retaliation.</p><p>And back in this country, Wall Street had another seesaw day.

JERROLD NADLER (D), New York: What is Google doing to combat the spread of white supremacy and right-wing extremism across YouTube?</p><p>JOHN YANG: In his opening statement, Pichai quickly fought back against accusations of bias.</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, Google: I lead this company without political bias, and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way. To do otherwise would be against our core principles and our business interests.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Republicans weren`t buying it.</p><p>Steve Chabot of Ohio described searching for articles on a Republican health care bill.</p><p>REP. STEVE CHABOT (R), Ohio: I Googled American Health Care Act. And virtually every article was an attack on our bill.</p><p>But it wasn`t until you got to the third or fourth page of search results before you found anything remotely positive about our bill. How do you explain this apparent bias on Google`s part against conservative points of view, against conservative policies?</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI: What is important here is, we use a robust methodology to reflect what is being said about any given topic at any particular time.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte pushed Pichai about the way Google handles political ads. Television and radio stations must give political candidates their lowest ad rates, but Internet advertising is not subject to those rules.</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R), Virginia: Should a competing political candidates be charged the same effective ad rates to reach prospective voters?</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI: Our advertising products are built without any bias, and the rates are comparative, set by a live auction process.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Pichai seemed to struggle at times to persuade lawmakers.</p><p>For their part, Democrats had their own line of questioning. Eric Swalwell of California focused on efforts to stop misinformation.</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D), California: Mr. Pichai, as part of Russia`s attack our democracy in 2016, it used ads on your platform, on Facebook`s platform, on Twitter`s platform. And money was provided in rubles and from Russian addresses.</p><p>What has Google done to make sure this doesn`t happen again?</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI: We did see limited improper activity, and, obviously, we learned from that. We have been very transparent with our findings.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Pichai downplayed bipartisan concerns that Google is exploring ways to reenter the Chinese market. The company is working on a search engine that would reportedly allow for Chinese censorship of the Web.</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D), Rhode Island: Are any employees having product meetings on this Chinese project?</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI: We have undertaken an internal effort, but, right now, there are no plans to launch a search service in China.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Privacy concerns were also very much on the minds of lawmakers, especially apps that allow location tracking.</p><p>Ted Poe is a Republican from Texas.</p><p>REP. TED POE (R), Texas: So Google knows that I am moving over there. It`s not a trick question. You know, you make $100 million a year. You ought to be able to answer that question. Does Google know, through this phone, that I am moving over there and sitting next to Mr. Johnson?</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI: I wouldn`t be able to answer without looking at the iPhone.</p><p>REP. TED POE: You can`t say yes or no?</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI: Not without knowing more details, sir.</p><p>JOHN YANG: The hearing ends a year in which lawmakers have scrutinized several of the big tech giants, and indications are that that will continue next year.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m John Yang.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: The <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>proposed the biggest rollback today in water protection since the Clean Water Act was passed in 1972.</p><p>The move would reduce safeguards to millions of acres of wetlands and thousands of streams as well. This follows an expansion of water regulations under President Obama that was hugely controversial.</p><p>Under the prior administration, the government expanded the type of waterways that fall under federal protection to include smaller streams and tributaries that feed into larger bodies of water. Farmers, ranchers and developers say that resulted in essentially a federal land grab.</p><p>The new rules will limit oversight substantially, so that it will protect large bodies of water, the rivers that drain into them and nearby wetlands.</p><p>Environmentalists are responding that this is a big blow against clean water.</p><p>Coral Davenport has been following the latest developments for The New York Times, and she joins me now.</p><p>Welcome back to the \"NewsHour.\"</p><p>So, Coral, remind us, what were the expanded regulations under President Obama?</p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT, The New York Times: So, the Obama regulation, it was called Waters of the U.S., would have extended federal protections beyond just these large bodies of water to pretty much every wetland, to small streams, to streams that didn`t run year-round.</p><p>And it would have required the users of land around that water to -- it would have put a lot of restrictions on what they could do with that land. It would have created new restrictions on using chemical fertilizers and pesticides for farmers and for land developers, because those things, of course, can run off into the water bodies.</p><p>It would have created limitations on certain kinds of plowing that farmers could do, how deeply they could plow, what kind of crops they could plow. So, it would really have -- it would have required farmers to get permits from the EPA to use their land in certain ways.</p><p>So farmers, rural land owners, real estate developers, all of them kind of said, look, this is -- this puts a big, you know, burden of federal regulation on how we do business.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, environmentalists liked it, but there was a lot of pushback.</p><p>So what exactly is the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>doing? How much of all that are they pulling back?</p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT: So, the new Trump -- the proposed Trump replacement water rule would keep in place federal protection for major bodies of water, like the Chesapeake Bay or the Mississippi River. That`s still covered.</p><p>So are the major rivers that drain into it and, as you mentioned before, large wetlands that are directly adjacent to these large bodies of water. So a wetland that is, you know, right next a beach on the Atlantic Ocean would still be protected.</p><p>Stripped away, removed from federal protection are millions and millions of acres of wetlands that don`t meet that criteria, and many of these smaller streams that don`t run year-round, that sort of fill up when there`s a rainfall, dry up. None of those are subject to federal protections anymore.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And so the folks who were critical of what happened under President Obama, they -- what are they saying right now?</p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT: They are overjoyed.</p><p>You know, farmers and rural land owners who also, of course, make up President Trump`s political base, this is exactly what they asked for. And they said, we feel like now we can do what we want with our land. We don`t have to go to the federal government and ask for permission. So they got exactly what they asked for, and they`re really happy.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, environmentalists, coming from a different perspective, they are saying, not only is this a rollback of what President Obama did, but it`s taking it back to what both Presidents Bush had done under their administrations.</p><p>How do you explain that?</p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT: Yes, so something that the first President Bush in particular doesn`t always get a lot of credit for is that he did actually pass a lot of environmentalist initiatives.</p><p>And he campaigned -- he was an avid fisherman.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.</p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT: And he campaigned on protecting wetlands. And he put in place some policies that were designed to make sure that -- specifically that there was no loss of wetlands protection.</p><p>And that policy was sort of further strengthened by his son, President George W. Bush. This strips away all of those protections.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, including what happened under President George H.W. Bush and his son, George.</p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT: Yes, and Obama.</p><p>So it`s a very significant rollback that lifts federal protections, particularly on wetlands, you know, back to what it was more than 20 years ago.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what happens now after -- this is a proposal. What happens next?</p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT: Right.</p><p>So this is a proposal. It`s open for public comment for 60 days. The <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>will then take that public comment under consideration. It could revise or make changes to the rule. And at some point next year, they are expected to then issue a final rule.</p><p>And then it`s done. And then I would expect the moment that it`s completed, probably in the first half of 2019, we will start to see major lawsuits on behalf of environmental groups, states, you know, groups saying, this is going to lead to major pollution of wetlands and waterways.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And you were telling us the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>expects that to happen. Do they expect they can win in court?</p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT: They absolutely do.</p><p>But the timing of this rule is not accidental. The expectation is that they want to, you know, put out the final rule in 2019. Lawsuits get filed then. First, it will go to a federal court. And the expectation is that it will go before the Supreme Court sometime in 2020, and this administration very much wants that to happen during the first term of <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>They want to be able to -- this administration wants to be able to be the ones to defend this in front of the Supreme Court. But there is an expectation that this current Supreme Court, now with justices selected by <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and a conservative leaning, you know, there is a confidence that they will uphold this rollback and a lot of other similar environmental rollbacks that we have seen.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Interesting that they`re thinking it through...</p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT: Yes.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: ... to 2020.</p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT: The timing, the timing is absolutely a part of the thinking.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Coral Davenport with The New York Times, thank you so much.</p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT: Great to be here.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Across the country, teachers have been protesting for better working conditions and better pay.</p><p>Teaching still ranks among the lowest paid professions in America. Back in 2007, the Department of Education launched a program to help offset the cost of college or graduate school for teachers.</p><p>But, as William Brangham reports, the program instead turned into an economic trap.</p><p>It`s part of our weekly education series, Making the Grade.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The program is called the TEACH Grant program. And the idea was simple. Teachers get a grant to pay for college or graduate school, and, in exchange, they agree to teach for four years in places where they`re needed.</p><p>But according to an investigation by National Public Radio earlier this year, some inflexible rules turned those free grants into very costly loans. Thousands of teachers suddenly found themselves facing potentially ruinous debt.</p><p>One of the NPR reporters on that series, Cory Turner, joins me now with an update to their reporting.</p><p>Cory, thank you so much for being here.</p><p>Before we get to the update, explain a little bit more. What was the idea behind the TEACH Grant program?</p><p>CORY TURNER, NPR: Sure.</p><p>I mean, when Congress passed and created this program, the intentions were good. The point was to try to get more young talented teachers into schools that need the most, low-income schools.</p><p>And so what the program did was to offer federal grants to aspiring teachers to help pay for college or a master`s degree. And, in return, these teachers promised to do a couple of things: to teach a high-needs subject like math or science in a school that serves lots of low-income families, and they`d have to do it for four years.</p><p>The trick is, there was one requirement that has really caused a lot of the trouble, and that was that teachers also had to prove they were doing this every year by submitting paperwork.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And, roughly, how big were these grants?</p><p>CORY TURNER: So, we`re talking about generally, for a year, roughly $4,000. We talked to a lot of teachers. Some got $1,000 or $2,000. We talked to several teachers who got $4,000. So we`re talking $16,000.</p><p>But once they`re converted then from grants to loans, interest is added on. So, oftentimes, teachers would find themselves suddenly -- instead of grants, they would be in debt to the Education Department $20,000.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, you featured one teacher in Tennessee, Kaitlyn McCollum, who had this, where she took out these grants that then, unbeknownst to her, converted into loans.</p><p>Tell us about her. And tell us what happened with her.</p><p>CORY TURNER: Yes.</p><p>So, Kaitlyn lives in Columbia, Tennessee, and she had a problem that thousands of teachers had, which is, as I said, with this paperwork, it had to be sent in on time. Often it was due, though, in the middle of summer, when principals who have to sign it are away on vacation.</p><p>The paperwork was really fairly complicated. We even found an internal memo from the Ed Department where they called it complicated and confusing. Sometimes, reminders to fill it out were sent to the wrong address.</p><p>So, Kaitlyn, when she did the paperwork, she faxed it from her school with her principal. The loan servicing company said they never got it. She mailed it in, but the mailed-in copy arrived several days late. She appealed. She even got her principal to write her a letter saying, we faxed this paperwork in on time.</p><p>But these rules are really inflexible. They always have been. This program has been in place for a decade. And so her appeal was denied, and suddenly she found herself indebted more than $20,000. And she`s been in forbearance, because she and her husband who are -- you know, they`re rule followers.</p><p>He used to be a teacher, too. They`re doing their best. They just couldn`t afford to pay this back. So they went into forbearance. We said in our story, they even sold their house, because they did the math and they couldn`t afford it. They downsized, even though they have a 19-month- old, because they wanted to be able to pay this back.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let`s listen to a little bit of how she described the feeling of this debt.</p><p>KAITLYN MCCOLLUM, Teacher: And then it all just hit me like a ton of bricks, like, oh, my God, I owe all of that money. And it`s like a knee- buckling moment of panic all over again.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Your reporting showed that this was -- really opened the floodgates of teachers all over the country complaining about this happening to them.</p><p>And the Department of Ed promised that they were going to fix it. What did they do?</p><p>CORY TURNER: Yes, so the Department of Ed has offered a number of different fixes here.</p><p>For teachers like Kaitlyn, again, she had to serve four years. They all do. She made it three years filing her paperwork. She got converted in her last year.</p><p>Teachers like Kaitlyn, as long as they can prove retroactively that they met the teaching requirements of the program, regardless of what happened with the paperwork, they will be made whole.</p><p>If they paid interest, the Ed Department assures us the interest will also be refunded. We should also say teachers who can maybe only prove retroactively one, two, or three years of service, as long as there is still time for them, they can get back on track and potentially be made whole as well.</p><p>So, a couple of days ago, as we learned this news, my reporting partner, Chris Arnold, and I, we actually called Kaitlyn McCollum up because we wanted to share the news. She was the first teacher we called.</p><p>KAITLYN MCCOLLUM: Sorry. I`m...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KAITLYN MCCOLLUM: Oh, goodness, that is such good news. That`s such good news.</p><p>We get to go back to living life like we did prior. Thank you.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That really is a wonderful, wonderful outcome to all of your good, hard journalism.</p><p>For teachers who are curious how they might proceed, where do they go? What do they do?</p><p>CORY TURNER: First, they need to be patient. The Education Department is still ironing out the details of this fix. They have assured us they will post them on their Web site by January -- by the end of January.</p><p>I think the best thing to do would be to go to our Web site NPR.org/TeachGRANT. In our latest story, we actually have a link to the Ed Department page where they`re going to post all of this information.</p><p>We also encourage teachers, if you want to go through this reconsideration process, share your story with us. There is a link in our story for you to do that as well. We`d love to hear from you and to follow you as you go through this process.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Cory Turner of National Public Radio, thank you so much.</p><p>CORY TURNER: Thank you.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: A new play on Broadway is drawing lots of attention this winter, and not just because of its famous leading star.</p><p>It`s a new drama that explores big issues about race, class, criminal justice, and what it`s like to raise a black son in America.</p><p>Jeffrey Brown has a look at the intense story of \"American Son.\"</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Four a.m., the waiting room of a Miami police station, a storm raging outside.</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON, Actress: Jamal, damn it, where are you? I have sent you four texts, now five. You can`t text me back? Call me.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: As the play \"American Son\" opens, Kendra Ellis-Connor is desperately seeking news of her missing 18-year-old son, Jamal.</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON: There`s almost like a cage element. It`s this room that we`re trapped in, the bit of the nightmare of the play.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Kerry Washington plays Kendra, a psychology professor and a mother who`s long lived with the fear of the dangers facing young black men in America today.</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON: Grow the hell up, because that is how it is!</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Washington is best-known for her role as the political fixer Olivia Pope in the long-running TV series \"Scandal.\"</p><p>She`s also known for her off-camera activism, speaking out on violence against women and other issues.</p><p>Talking with her recently at the famed Sardi`s Restaurant on Broadway, Washington said she felt a need to take on the role after reading the script by playwright Christopher Demos-Brown.</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON: I know Kendras. I have been a version of Kendra. But I have never seen her, you know, in our canon. I never -- there was so much about the play that I had never seen or heard before, that I thought that, yes, this has to be part of our country`s theatrical tradition.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Co-star Steven Pasquale, who plays Kendra`s estranged husband, Scott, an FBI agent, also sees higher-than-usual stakes in this play.</p><p>STEVEN PASQUALE, Actor: In America, I want to be doing work that sparks a conversation politically, you know, because I think we`re on the wrong track. And I think this play asks all the right and hard questions of everyone who sees it.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: \"American Son\" unfolds all in one sparse room in the police station. It`s a story of anger and pain now all-too-familiar.</p><p>There`s been a confrontation between a young black man and police. Something bad, very bad, may have happened.</p><p>And, as in this early scene between Kendra and a young officer, the racial divide is ever-present.</p><p>ACTOR: I am doing the best I can.</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON: Do you have a black son?</p><p>ACTOR: Wow, we`re really going to go there, huh?</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON: Oh, we have been there for a while.</p><p>We have been there a while.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: We have been there.</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON: Uh-huh.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: That`s what you`re saying. It`s always there. We don`t often talk about it.</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON: That`s right. And I think the play is such a great opportunity to be able to talk about it.</p><p>It`s always J. this, J. that.</p><p>STEVEN PASQUALE: Oh, come on. I got a nickname for my son. That`s just a male bonding thing.</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON: This thing happens with the audience where you can really hear kind of the white audience, and you can hear the African- American or other-identifying audience at times.</p><p>STEVEN PASQUALE: On a scale from Eric Holder to Darnell Jackson, Jamal is brushing right up against Darnell.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON: Because people laugh at different things. And the way that the character of Jamal is written...</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: We never see Jamal, of course.</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON: We don`t, but he belongs to everyone. We actually are reminded that, within him, we all have a place in this story of this American son.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: It`s a complicated place, though, with an interracial marriage that`s fallen apart, husband and wife brought together out of concern for their son, but tangled in old tensions.</p><p>STEVEN PASQUALE: The play can`t succeed if you don`t believe that the marriage was real.</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON: And good at some point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEVEN PASQUALE: Yes, and good for a long time, yes.</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON: Yes.</p><p>STEVEN PASQUALE: And that the wheels come off when dealing with this issue of how to parent a biracial child in America.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Also here, as we learn more about Jamal and the events of that night, the values of both black and blue lives.</p><p>We won`t give away more here. The play is directed by Tony Award- winning Broadway and film director Kenny Leon, with a prominent team of producers, including Shonda Rhimes, a top TV producer of \"Scandal\" and other series.</p><p>Reviews so far have been mixed, with some critics praising the performances and timeliness, while others have cited weakness in the writing and structure.</p><p>For these two actors, though, \"American Son\" taps into something personal.</p><p>STEVEN PASQUALE: I have been working on and off Broadway for 20 years, and Broadway is really changing. And it`s scary to me the direction it`s going. It tends to be a lot more family-friendly. It tends to be a lot more sort of light.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: And big.</p><p>STEVEN PASQUALE: And so to be in something that feels like a serious piece of work, that asks serious questions, in a serious venue, feels really important to a theater artist.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: In the bio in the playbill, it says actor, producer, and activist.</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON: Mm-hmm.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Do they go together for you? Are they all of a piece?</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON: I have always found a very organic connection between the work that I do as an actor and the work that I do as an activist, I think, probably because our jobs involve stepping into somebody else`s shoes, and -- and that exercise of is what leads to greater empathy and respect for humanity.</p><p>That comes with the desire to make the world a better place for all of us.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: \"American Son\" is scheduled to run through January 27.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Jeffrey Brown on Broadway.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight: Author Margaret Atwood has just announced she`s writing a sequel to her blockbuster novel \"The Handmaid`s Tale.\"</p><p>In this preview from \"That Moment When,\" \"NewsHour\"`s weekly Facebook Watch show, Atwood speaks about her parameters for writing the original work.</p><p>MARGARET ATWOOD, Author: Well, the rule that I set myself for \"The Handmaid`s Tale\" was that nothing goes in this that doesn`t have a precedent somewhere in history or in real life right now.</p><p>And, typically, they`d like to get their hands on the levers of democracy, and then cancel them or subvert them. Hitler was elected, but that was kind of it for elections.</p><p>QUESTION: I have heard you say that before, that there had to be a precedent for everything, that this had to be within the human smorgasbord of things we do.</p><p>MARGARET ATWOOD: That`s right.</p><p>QUESTION: Why was that an important rule for you?</p><p>MARGARET ATWOOD: Because I wasn`t writing science fiction fantasy. I was writing speculative fiction like \"1984.\" I made it a rule for myself that I wasn`t going to make stuff up.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: You can find all episodes of \"That Moment When\" on Facebook @thatmomentwhenshow.</p><p>And that is the \"NewsHour\" for tonight. I`m Judy Woodruff.</p><p>Join us online and again here tomorrow evening.

CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority Leader:  But we believe you  shouldn't shut it down.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JUDY WOODRUFF:  An extraordinary exchange in the Oval Office.   President Trump spars openly with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer over a  government shutdown and funding the border wall.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then:  The Trump administration proposes to rolls back clean water  rules designed to protect streams and wetlands.  </p><p>And we go behind the scenes of a new Broadway play offering a unique  look at the daunting realities of raising a biracial child.  </p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON, Actress:  There was so much about the play that I  had never seen or heard before, that I thought that, yes, this has to be  part of our country's theatrical tradition.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  All that and more on tonight's \"PBS NewsHour.\"  </p><p>(BREAK) </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  A televised tussle over a border wall.  </p><p>President Trump got into it today with the top two congressional  Democrats, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.  The fight may push the federal  government closer to a shutdown later this month.  </p><p>Congressional correspondent Lisa Desjardins begins our coverage.  </p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority Leader:  You have called 20 times  to shut down the government.  You say, I want to shut down the government.   We don't.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  Welcome to divided government in the era of Trump.   The president, as he has done before, opened a tense high-stakes and  traditionally private meeting to the cameras.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:  I would like to not to  see a government closing, a shutdown.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  But never before have we seen this kind of real-time  look at negotiations between branches of government, with President Trump  looking to press his case for billions in funding for a border wall.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  We need border security.  The wall is a part of border  security.  You can't have very good border security without the wall.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House Minority Leader:  That's simply not  true, because that is a political promise.  Border security is a way to  effectively honor our responses. </p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER:  And the experts say you can do border security  without a wall, which is wasteful and doesn't solve the problem. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  It totally solves the problem. </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  And Democrats looking to highlight Mr. Trump's  threat to partially shut down government over this.  </p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER:  One thing I think we can agree on is we shouldn't  shut down the government over a dispute.  And you want to shut it down.   You keep talking about. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  Yes.  If we don't get what we want one way or the  other, whether it's through you, through a military, through anything you  want to call, I will shut down the government, absolutely. </p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER:  Okay, fair enough.  We disagree.  We disagree. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  And I will tell you what, I am proud to shut down the  government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country  don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems, and drugs  pouring into our country. </p><p>So I will take the mantle.  I will be the one to shut it down.  I'm  not going to blame you for it.  The last time you shut it down, it didn't  work.  I will take the mantle of shutting down, and I'm going to shut it  down for border security. </p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER:  But we believe you shouldn't shut it down. </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  Congress has a long to-do list before the December  21 deadline to pass more funding.  But the most stubborn block on that goal  is the president's demand for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.  </p><p>In the next spending bill, he wants $5 billion for the wall.   Democrats currently are offering $1.3 billion, not for the wall, but for  border security.  </p><p>But the real math problem is about votes.  Any funding bill needs  support of Democrats in the Senate, led by Chuck Schumer.  But House  Democratic Leader Pelosi questioned if Mr. Trump's plan even has enough  Republican support in the House.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  If I needed the votes for the wall in the House, I  would have them in one session.  It would be done. </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI:  Well, then go do it.  Go do it. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  It doesn't help, because we need 10 Democrats in the  Senate. </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI:  No, don't put it on the Senate; put it on -- put  it on the negotiation. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  OK, let me ask you this, just -- and we're doing this  in a very friendly manner.  It doesn't help for me to take a vote in the  House, where I will win easily with the Republicans. </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI:  You will not win. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  It doesn't help to take the vote, because I'm not going  to vote the vote of the Senate. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  I need 10 senators.  That's the problem. </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI:  Mr. President, you have the White House, you have  the Senate.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  I have the White House.  The White House is done. </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI:  You have the House. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  And the House would give me the vote if I wanted it.   But I can't because I need...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  Nancy, I need 10 votes from Chuck. </p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER:  All right, let me say something here. </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI:  Let me -- let me say one thing.  The fact is that  you do not have the votes in the House. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  Nancy, I do, and we need border security. </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI:  Well, let's take the vote, and we'll find out. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  Nancy -- Nancy, we need border security.  It's very  simple. </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI:  Of course we do. </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  And the politics are even more complicated.  As  Democrats prepare to take over the House of Representatives, Pelosi is  vying to be speaker of the House, though she has yet to clearly clinch all  the votes needed.  </p><p>President Trump seemed to nod to that, evoking fast response.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  I also know that, you know, Nancy's in a situation  where it's not easy for her to talk right now, and I understand, and I  fully understand that.  We're going to have a good discussion, and we're  going to see what happens.  But we have to have border security. </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI:  Mr. President -- Mr. President, please don't  characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the  House Democrats, who just won a big victory. </p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER:  Elections have consequences, Mr. President. </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI:  Let me just -- let me just...</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  While few Republicans echoed the president's  shutdown push, they did charge that Democrats are not serious about border  security.  </p><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reacted.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority Leader:  It would be truly  bizarre for them to decide they prefer a partial government shutdown to  reasonable funding for national security.  I would seem as through their  party is more committed to political spite for the president than to the  public interest.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI:  Good afternoon.  We just had a meeting of which  you saw the introduction to.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  Schumer and Pelosi reconvened outside the White  House after their meeting.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER:  The bottom line is simple.  The president made  clear that he wants a shutdown.  If he sticks to his position for a $5  billion wall, he will get no wall and he will get a shutdown.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  The shutdown would impact about a quarter of U.S.  government agencies, including the State Department and USDA.  It would  mean the closure of national parks and forced time off for thousands of  U.S. federal employees.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And Lisa joins me now, along with our White House  correspondent, Yamiche Alcindor.  </p><p>Hello to both of you.  I think we have just been watching a White  House meeting that went off the rails.  </p><p>Yamiche, how do you understand that the president was so willing to  air his strong differences with Democrats in front of the public, the  American people?  </p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR:  Well, the president wanted to make his position  crystal clear, and he wanted transparency.  He wanted to look strong before  cameras.  </p><p>And this is a president who understands the media.  He understands  those moments are going to be played over and over again, and he was hoping  he could punch hard and he could then come out and look on top and look  like he was someone who was fighting hard for border security.  </p><p>Of course, what he got instead was Democrats who were pushing back  just as hard.  I think the key moment there was when he was talking to  Nancy Pelosi, and he was mocking her, almost saying, look, you're not  speaker of the House yet, you can't be candid.  </p><p>But instead of backing down, Nancy Pelosi said, hey, guess what, we  had a big election victory.  And that went straight to the president's  heart.  So I think the president is in some ways feeling a little wounded  tonight, as he thinks about how this coverage, how this really affects his  White House.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  So, Lisa, what was the reaction at the Capitol from  Republicans and Democrats?  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  There's plenty of it.  </p><p>Let's start with Republicans.  Interesting, Judy.  There's only one  Republican I spoken to on the Hill, Senator Lindsey Graham, who is on the  side of the president in everything he's saying.  Graham is saying, yes, he  should talk about a shutdown, that it is worth it.  </p><p>But, otherwise, Judy, Republicans very along a spectrum that I would  say ranges from stoic observation of the fact that the president operates  like this often, to those who are openly uncomfortable with the president  taking blame, as a Republican, for a potential shutdown at Christmas.  </p><p>Now, they also all admit that he's someone who operate outside of  space and time politically.  So perhaps this is a case where the base is  happy.  Unclear.</p><p>Democrats, Judy, they think this is a win universally for them.  But,  however, they have to make some real strategic decisions coming off that  they think the fact that president talked about owning a shutdown.  That's  what they wanted out of this meeting, and they got it.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  So, Yamiche, we noted the president said he would be  proud to own a shutdown.  Do we understand his thinking there?  And is he  willing at all to consider compromise?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR:  The president thinks a government shutdown will  help him politically.  He's not willing to back down, from all the sourcing  that I have been able to gather today.</p><p>The president has been pitting Americans against immigrants.  Today,  he said over and over again, immigrants are going to bring drugs to this  country, they're going to be criminals.  He said -- quote -- \"They're going  to bring diseases to this country.\"</p><p>So this is a president that's hoping that if he takes jobs from  thousands of people and shuts down the government, that he can do it in the  name of pitting Americans vs. immigrants.</p><p>And this is something that worked at times during the midterms.  You  think of what he said in Florida during the midterms and this idea that he  ran that ad that was deemed almost two racist for both FOX News and CNN and  other networks to really put on their network.  </p><p>So what you have is a president who's doubling down on his strategy  and hoping that this political bet is going to pay off.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And, Lisa, I know you have been doing some reporting  on whether there's room, if there's any room for compromise around the  Capitol.  What are you hearing?</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  Well, think about this strange situation we're in,  Judy.</p><p>This argument is really over about $3.5 billion, which is a fraction  of 1 percent of the total federal budget.  So it's really mostly a symbolic  battle.  And we also heard the president perhaps tip off what many people,  both parties, think could be the pivot point here.  What defines wall  funding?</p><p>Today in this meeting, he said, wall funding is important.  And then  he stopped and said, but I want to say, let's say border security funding  is important.  </p><p>So if the money goes to something like fencing or cyber-technology,  those are the kinds of things that Democrats are happy to pay for and very  likely, I think, to increase the funding for.</p><p>One more thing, Judy, one X-factor next week, already members of  Congress are leaving town for good.  I spoke to one member who took her  final vote today.  So it's not clear who would even be voting on this bill.   And I also think, to the president's assertion that he has the votes to  pass $5 billion in wall funding, it is not clear that he does.</p><p>And Speaker Ryan himself would not directly say if Republicans have  those votes in the House.  So that's another problem for the president.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Very interesting.  </p><p>And, very quickly -- we have only got about 30 seconds, Lisa.</p><p>There was significant movement, an announcement today from the Senate  majority leader, Mitch McConnell, that he is willing to put criminal  justice reform up for a vote.  Tell us just quickly what happened there.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  This could move very quickly.  This is historic  reform on criminal justice.  </p><p>It does deal some with sentencing.  It is not as far as many Democrats  would like to go, but it is farther than we have seen Congress go ever  before.  Expect it to move fast and expect us to talk a lot more about it  on this show.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  All right, Lisa Desjardins and Yamiche Alcindor  watching all these important things, thank you all.  Thank you both very  much.  </p><p>And now for a Republican point of view from the Capitol,  Representative Doug Collins from Georgia.  He's also the House Republican  Conference vice chair.</p><p>Representative Collins, thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>So, we heard the president today say that he's proud to own a  government shutdown.  Are congressional Republicans proud to own the  shutdown, if it happens?</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (R), Georgia:  Well, let's frame this the way the  president did.</p><p>When he was confronted with Chuck Schumer, who didn't want any part of  his own responsibility in this, the fact that he was putting American  citizens below a caravan and other immigrants who are willing to grow under  and over walls and through borders through previous countries, he is simply  saying, I'm willing to have the argument about, who is -- who's been what  here?  </p><p>He said, I'm putting the American citizen first, I'm putting our  security first, I'm putting the willingness to negotiate and say, let's  find a deal.  And Mr. Schumer is simply saying, we're not going to go any  further.  We have made our last remarks.  </p><p>So I think it's a matter of how we actually parse what the president  is saying.  He said, I will have this argument.  I will own that part.  </p><p>But Chuck Schumer, again, like he did back in January, he's got to  realize he's putting Americans below folks who are trying to basically  break into this country.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  What about your own view, though, Congressman Collins?   Do you think a government shutdown -- that it's worth a government shutdown  to get $5 billion or whatever the president's asking for, for a border  wall?</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS:  I think it's a time for us to come to this table  and say, we need a serious discussion about this issue.</p><p>We have punted on this one for a while.  We have talked about this  before.  This is one piece of what is broken about our immigration system.   You cannot have a fix, whether it be issues of DACA, issues of guest  workers, issues of other things that we need in our immigration system that  are viable, legal functions, without having to deal with how we handle our  security.  </p><p>This has become an important part.  And, unfortunately, we have had a  discussion of one or the other, but not both.  I think this is something  it's now time to have.  It provides a discussion point for us to jump off  to.</p><p>And nobody would ever say that the best way to find this is to do a  shutdown.  But I think, at some point in time, we also have to come up to  the reality of, these are deadlines that need to be met.  And if they're  not met, the president is saying, we need to have this discussion now.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  So, even if it means a shutdown?</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS:  I think, at some point, that is what we're leading  to.  I don't think anybody would want that.  </p><p>Let's also remember, this is the first round of them sitting down.   This is the first round of a president who is a negotiator, who is a  dealer, who's wanting to put things out there.</p><p>I'm going to give him the credit to say, let's start this process.   Look, everybody wants to have a clock somewhere.  They want to have a clock  saying the shutdown is so much.</p><p>It's the way, unfortunately, this town has learned to operate.  I'm  ready to see us break out of this and have honest discussions about issues.   And I think the president laid that on the table today, and it was sort of  interesting when you saw that Mr. Schumer was one willing to negotiate,  while Ms. Pelosi was wanting to move the cameras out.  That's not  transparency.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Let me ask you about what the president is saying,  though.  He says he wants a wall.  He wants $5 billion, give or take for  that wall.  </p><p>Democrats are now saying -- and we did an interview this evening with  Congressman Steny Hoyer, the number two Democrat in the House -- saying  they -- he thinks there could be movement on money, in other words, for  border security, but not for a wall.</p><p>Would that be acceptable to congressional Republicans?</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS:  I think the president has made his point that we  need the wall, we need that security.  This is about border security.   Let's keep it where it's at.  </p><p>And if that's the wall part of it, if that's the other functions of  it, then we're glad to see that Mr. Hoyer is willing to come to the table  and discuss the fact that security is needed.  </p><p>I think at this point in time, what we have really got to focus on is,  we're in the phases of where we have time to fix this.  It's time for the  president, as he has done today, just take that step forward and say,  here's my negotiating point.  </p><p>Now, where do we go from here?  If the Democrats simply come to the  table and said, no, Mr. President, we're not going to do that, and if Ms.  Pelosi is worried about her position or even her newfound possibility of  being speaker, then we were not coming at it from a position of strength  from either side.  </p><p>So we need to make sure that the president, who has made it very clear  what he wants -- we're standing behind him.  We're -- we have done this in  the House, and it's now time for the Senate to also decide who they're  going to support as well.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  But do I hear you saying, though, this is all the  Democrats' doing, that the president doesn't bear some responsibility for  what transpired today?</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS:  We all bear responsibility.  </p><p>I think what the president did was really interesting.  How many times  have the media said, we would love to know what goes on behind closed  doors?  Why don't you tell us what goes on?</p><p>And what was really interesting for me today is, the president made  his position.  This is not something that's normal.  This president likes  to talk about it.  He likes to have it out in public.  </p><p>What I noticed was interesting was is, as we discuss this, these are  valid things to discuss.  Now, once the press left, they had more  discussions about that.  But it was interesting to me that they would  discuss this back and forth, but yet, at the same time, there was also some  -- Ms. Pelosi in particular, who was saying, shouldn't we have these off  camera?  </p><p>I think part of that is some of the issues that we need to have.   There's always negotiations that need to be in private.  Those are things.   But I think laying out the framework of where parties are was important in  this part.  And I think the president was right for that.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  I'm thinking of the musical \"Hamilton\" and the song \"I  want to be in the room where it happened.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  But just very quickly, do you see compromise coming  here?  </p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS:  I think there's room for an opening.</p><p>The president has always been one -- I mean, it's sort of been his  trademark throughout his career.  It's the art of the deal.  It's trying to  find that way forward to make sure that we get -- his first commitment was  always to border security and to Americans and making sure that we have  what we need, to then fix the other problems.  </p><p>I think there is room here.  I think we're going to see the  administration work toward this.  I know us on -- the folks up here on  Capitol Hill are willing to work toward that.  We need to make sure that  we're putting the American people first.</p><p>I believe the president is.  It's now time for the Congress to get on  this negotiation.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Representative Doug Collins, thank you very much.  </p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS:  It's always good to see you, Judy.  Take care.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  As we just heard, for the Democrats' perspective, I  did speak just a short time ago to Maryland Congressman Steny Hoyer.  He is  Nancy Pelosi's deputy.  He's the incoming majority leader.</p><p>We went over where things go from here after today's Oval Office  meeting.  </p><p>REP. STENY HOYER (D-MD), Minority Whip:  He likes theater.  He likes  playing for the camera.  </p><p>And very difficult to have any serious negotiations when you're, in  effect, speaking to millions of people, as opposed to just the president or  the person you're negotiating with.  </p><p>But it's a -- it's a tactic of his, and I think it's not particularly  productive.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  It looks as if this is at an impasse until the last  minute.  Is that what's going on now?  </p><p>REP. STENY HOYER:  Well, it appears to be.  </p><p>You know, the president has said last year, he's repeated this year,  and he repeated three times today how he would be proud to shut down the  government, that he was looking forward, and he would shut down the  government.  And if he didn't get what he wanted, he would shut down the  government.  </p><p>I think that's awfully unfortunate, for a president of the United  States, who is responsible for the executive department, saying, I'm going  to shut down government if I don't get exactly what I want.  </p><p>None of us get exactly what we want, and shutting down the government  shouldn't be an alternative.  And, as a matter of fact, I think almost  every Republican leader has urged the president not to shut down the  government.  </p><p>We are prepared to fund border security.  We believe in border  security.  We need to make our country safe.  What we don't believe in is  that the wall that the president proposes to build, which he said was going  to be paid for by the Mexican government, we don't believe that's a very  effective tool.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  But...</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER:  And, as a matter of fact, we think there are a lot  of Republicans who share that view.  So, it is very, very unfortunate.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  But if I could just interrupt, there is still a gap,  though, a significant gap between what the president is asking for, over $5  billion.  Democrats are saying 1-point-something-billion.  </p><p>Democrats have a responsibility here, too, as you just said, both  sides.  Why not give more in order to reach an agreement?  </p><p>REP. STENY HOYER:  Well, I think, frankly, if we had those discussions  about, give me some more money, if that would be focused on border  security, and making sure the border is secure -- I mean, he sent thousands  of troops to the border to make it secure, which was very, very costly.  </p><p>So that I think that would be a discussion we could have.  But Leader  Schumer and Leader Pelosi made it very clear that the wall is not an option  that we're going to vote for.  </p><p>Now, he -- his party controls the House of Representatives.  It  controls the United States Senate.  And if they can pass it, fine.  That's  -- they're in the majority.  But if they can't pass it, or if we can't pass  something, then we need to compromise.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  I do want to quote something that Leader Pelosi said  in a report back to colleagues at the Capitol after the meeting.  It's been  reported she was talking about the president.  </p><p>She said: \"It's like a manhood thing for him, as if manhood could ever  be associated with him\" -- end quote.  </p><p>Were you there when this was said?  </p><p>REP. STENY HOYER:  I wasn't there, Judy.  I didn't hear that quote.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  If she said this, is this the kind of thing that do  you think affects the working relationship between Democrats and the  president?  </p><p>REP. STENY HOYER:  Well, I think there's nobody who uses rhetoric in a  harsher way than the president of the United States and makes it more  difficult to reach compromise, frankly, than President Trump.  </p><p>But having said that, hopefully -- this is bigger than Nancy or bigger  than the president.  This is talking about the United States government  staying operative, serving the American people, staying on guard for the  people's safety and service.  </p><p>And we ought not we ought -- we ought not to get into that rhetoric.   What we ought to get into is, you said he can't pass this bill because he  can't get enough votes in the Senate.  I agree with that.  That's correct.   He's correct on that point.  </p><p>Therefore, he wants something, and it's necessary for him to  compromise.  He says he wants something to keep the border secure.  We are  for that.  I'm sure we will agree to additional -- additions to the budget  to better secure the borders.  </p><p>What we don't believe is, the wall is good policy.  And it won't work.   And experts make that point to us.  And, therefore, we are prepared to  compromise on money, but we're not prepared to compromise on the end that  he wants to seek.  And, if he had the votes, he could do it.  He doesn't  have the votes.  He needs to compromise.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  House Minority Whip Representative Steny Hoyer, thank  you very much.  </p><p>REP. STENY HOYER:  Thank you very much, Judy.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  In the day's other news:  The U.S. Senate passed a  farm bill worth $867 billion over 10 years, after months of stalled  negotiations.  It includes billions for farm subsidies, and it reauthorizes  conservation programs.  But it also rejects stricter limits on food stamps.   The House could vote as soon as tomorrow.  </p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency called today for rolling back  federal protections for thousands of waterways and wetlands.  Farmers,  developers and energy companies had sought the move.  Environmental groups  condemned it.  It is aimed at Obama era rules that greatly expanded the  reach of the Clean Water Act.  </p><p>We will have the details later in the program.  </p><p>In Charlottesville, Virginia, a jury recommended a life sentence, plus  419 years for a man who killed a counterprotester and injured dozens at a  white supremacist rally.  James Fields was convicted last week of first- degree murder.  He drove a car into a crowd at the 2017 rally.  </p><p>The mother of Heather Heyer, the protester who was killed, spoke  outside the courtroom today.  </p><p>SUSAN BRO, Mother of Heather Heyer:  I'm kind of running through about  50 different emotions all at once.  Bottom line is, justice has him where  he needs to be, and my daughter is still not here and the other survivors  still have their wounds to deal with.  So we have all been damaged  permanently, but we do survive, we do move forward.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  A judge will issue the final sentence at a hearing in  March.  </p><p>Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May began a mission today to rescue  her Brexit deal in Parliament.  It faces strong opposition over a so-called  backstop provision that could leave Britain subject to European Union  customs rules indefinitely.  May sought reassurances on that point today  from Dutch, German and E.U. leaders.  </p><p>James Mates of Independent Television News reports.  </p><p>JAMES MATES:  Stop three on a frantic, some might even say desperate,  diplomatic dash across Europe.  </p><p>In a parallel universe this evening, she would have been celebrating  victory in Parliament and a triumphant and orderly Brexit.  Instead, she is  now pleading with leaders in Brussels for something, anything they can give  her to stave off humiliation.  </p><p>THERESA MAY, British Prime Minister:  Whatever outcome you want,  whatever relationship you want with Europe in the future, there's no deal  available that doesn't have a backstop in it.  But we don't want the  backstop to be used.  As it is, we want to be certain that it is only  temporary.  </p><p>JAMES MATES:  At crack of dawn this morning, Dutch Prime Minister Mark  Rutte had jumped on his bike and peddled over to meet her.  It's fair to  say no one had quite been expecting to be dealing with Brexit again today.  </p><p>The greeting from perhaps Britain's most sympathetic ally on the  continent was warm, but little was on offer.  \"Well, you can't refuse  someone a cup of coffee,\" said the country's foreign minister, rather  pointedly.  </p><p>By lunchtime, it was Berlin and a red carpet hastily rolled out by the  German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  The message from the Germans, as relayed  through their Europe minister: \"It's good to talk, but there definitely  won't be any reopening of negotiations.\"</p><p>At the European Parliament in Strasbourg, almost word for word the  same from the commission president.  </p><p>JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER, President, European Commission:  There is no room  whatsoever for renegotiation.  But, of course, there is room -- if used  intelligently, there is room to give further clarification.  </p><p>JAMES MATES:  If the British strategy is once again to try to win  concessions in other European capitals that they have failed to win in  Brussels, it's likely to meet with the same failure as it's done throughout  this two-year Brexit process.  </p><p>When they all meet together in a single room at the summit on  Thursday, Mrs. May seems certain to face once more an E.U.-27 speaking with  a single voice.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  That report from James Mates of Independent Television  News.  </p><p>In France, a gunman killed at least four people and wounded 11 near a  world-renowned Christmas market in Strasbourg.  Ambulances rushed to the  scene and police spread out looking for the gunman.  They identified him as  a possible extremist with a criminal record.  </p><p>The United States today returned three revered bells to the  Philippines 117 years after they were seized during the Philippine-American  War.  They were taken from a church in Balangiga.  That's in 1901, when  villagers killed 48 American soldiers.  The U.S. Army killed thousands of  Filipinos in retaliation.  </p><p>Today, a U.S. military cargo plane unloaded the bronze bells at a base  in Manila.  The U.S. ambassador there said it closes a painful chapter.  </p><p>SUNG KIM, U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines:  The bells of Balangiga  are now home in the Philippines, where they belong.  Secretary Lorenzana,  please take them to the people of Balangiga, to the Church of San Lorenzo.   May they ring in peace and bear testament to the ties and values which bind  our two great nations for generations to come.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  The U.S. captured the Philippines in 1898 during the  Spanish-American War, but Filipinos fought for independence for several  more years.  The country gained independence finally in 1946.  </p><p>A Canadian judge has granted bail today to Meng Wanzhou.  That is the  chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei.  She now faces  possible extradition to the U.S. for allegedly violating sanctions on Iran.   The judge set bail at $7.5 million and ordered Meng to surrender her  passport and agree to electronic monitoring.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Canadian officials confirmed that a former Canadian  diplomat has been detained in Beijing, apparently in retaliation.  </p><p>And back in this country, Wall Street had another seesaw day.  In the  end, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 53 points to close at 24370.   The Nasdaq rose 11 points, and the S&amp;P 500 slipped one point.  </p><p>Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": the CEO of Google faces congressional  questions about privacy and its relations with China; the EPA moves to  drastically roll back water pollution regulations; how the Department of  Education aims to correct paperwork errors that left teachers with  thousands in debt; and a look behind the scenes of a new play about the  challenges of raising a biracial child in America.  </p><p>For the better part of a year, lawmakers have been waiting for a  chance to question the head of Google, much like they have done with  Facebook and other tech giants.  </p><p>But Google's CEO has eluded that moment, until today, when, as John  Yang reports, he faced a grilling on Capitol Hill.  </p><p>JOHN YANG:  When the House Judiciary Committee finally had a chance to  question Google CEO Sundar Pichai, lawmakers from both parties quickly hit  him with a wave of criticism, from the right, allegations of anti- conservative bias affecting Google's search results.</p><p>MAN:  What actions are you going to take to try to counter the  political bias in some of those examples that I just gave?</p><p>JOHN YANG:  And from the left, questions about the tech giant's  commitment to stopping foreign misinformation and hate speech.  </p><p>REP. JERROLD NADLER (D), New York:  What is Google doing to combat the  spread of white supremacy and right-wing extremism across YouTube?  </p><p>JOHN YANG:  In his opening statement, Pichai quickly fought back  against accusations of bias.  </p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, Google:  I lead this company without political  bias, and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way.   To do otherwise would be against our core principles and our business  interests.  </p><p>JOHN YANG:  Republicans weren't buying it.  </p><p>Steve Chabot of Ohio described searching for articles on a Republican  health care bill.</p><p>REP. STEVE CHABOT (R), Ohio:  I Googled American Health Care Act.  And  virtually every article was an attack on our bill.  </p><p>But it wasn't until you got to the third or fourth page of search  results before you found anything remotely positive about our bill.  How do  you explain this apparent bias on Google's part against conservative points  of view, against conservative policies?  </p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI:  What is important here is, we use a robust methodology  to reflect what is being said about any given topic at any particular time.  </p><p>JOHN YANG:  Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte pushed Pichai about the  way Google handles political ads.  Television and radio stations must give  political candidates their lowest ad rates, but Internet advertising is not  subject to those rules.  </p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R), Virginia:  Should a competing political  candidates be charged the same effective ad rates to reach prospective  voters?  </p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI:  Our advertising products are built without any bias,  and the rates are comparative, set by a live auction process.  </p><p>JOHN YANG:  Pichai seemed to struggle at times to persuade lawmakers.  </p><p>For their part, Democrats had their own line of questioning.  Eric  Swalwell of California focused on efforts to stop misinformation.  </p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D), California:  Mr. Pichai, as part of Russia's  attack our democracy in 2016, it used ads on your platform, on Facebook's  platform, on Twitter's platform.  And money was provided in rubles and from  Russian addresses.  </p><p>What has Google done to make sure this doesn't happen again?  </p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI:  We did see limited improper activity, and, obviously,  we learned from that.  We have been very transparent with our findings.  </p><p>JOHN YANG:  Pichai downplayed bipartisan concerns that Google is  exploring ways to reenter the Chinese market.  The company is working on a  search engine that would reportedly allow for Chinese censorship of the  Web.  </p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D), Rhode Island:  Are any employees having  product meetings on this Chinese project?  </p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI:  We have undertaken an internal effort, but, right now,  there are no plans to launch a search service in China.  </p><p>JOHN YANG:  Privacy concerns were also very much on the minds of  lawmakers, especially apps that allow location tracking.  </p><p>Ted Poe is a Republican from Texas.  </p><p>REP. TED POE (R), Texas:  So Google knows that I am moving over there.   It's not a trick question.  You know, you make $100 million a year.  You  ought to be able to answer that question.  Does Google know, through this  phone, that I am moving over there and sitting next to Mr. Johnson?  </p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI:  I wouldn't be able to answer without looking at the  iPhone.  </p><p>REP. TED POE:  You can't say yes or no?  </p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI:  Not without knowing more details, sir.  </p><p>JOHN YANG:  The hearing ends a year in which lawmakers have  scrutinized several of the big tech giants, and indications are that that  will continue next year.  </p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm John Yang.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  The Trump administration proposed the biggest rollback  today in water protection since the Clean Water Act was passed in 1972.  </p><p>The move would reduce safeguards to millions of acres of wetlands and  thousands of streams as well.  This follows an expansion of water  regulations under President Obama that was hugely controversial.  </p><p>Under the prior administration, the government expanded the type of  waterways that fall under federal protection to include smaller streams and  tributaries that feed into larger bodies of water.  Farmers, ranchers and  developers say that resulted in essentially a federal land grab.  </p><p>The new rules will limit oversight substantially, so that it will  protect large bodies of water, the rivers that drain into them and nearby  wetlands.  </p><p>Environmentalists are responding that this is a big blow against clean  water.  </p><p>Coral Davenport has been following the latest developments for The New  York Times, and she joins me now.  </p><p>Welcome back to the \"NewsHour.\"  </p><p>So, Coral, remind us, what were the expanded regulations under  President Obama?</p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT, The New York Times:  So, the Obama regulation, it was  called Waters of the U.S., would have extended federal protections beyond  just these large bodies of water to pretty much every wetland, to small  streams, to streams that didn't run year-round.</p><p>And it would have required the users of land around that water to --  it would have put a lot of restrictions on what they could do with that  land.  It would have created new restrictions on using chemical fertilizers  and pesticides for farmers and for land developers, because those things,  of course, can run off into the water bodies.  </p><p>It would have created limitations on certain kinds of plowing that  farmers could do, how deeply they could plow, what kind of crops they could  plow.  So, it would really have -- it would have required farmers to get  permits from the EPA to use their land in certain ways.  </p><p>So farmers, rural land owners, real estate developers, all of them  kind of said, look, this is -- this puts a big, you know, burden of federal  regulation on how we do business.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  So, environmentalists liked it, but there was a lot of  pushback.  </p><p>So what exactly is the Trump administration doing?  How much of all  that are they pulling back?  </p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT:  So, the new Trump -- the proposed Trump replacement  water rule would keep in place federal protection for major bodies of  water, like the Chesapeake Bay or the Mississippi River.  That's still  covered.  </p><p>So are the major rivers that drain into it and, as you mentioned  before, large wetlands that are directly adjacent to these large bodies of  water.  So a wetland that is, you know, right next a beach on the Atlantic  Ocean would still be protected.  </p><p>Stripped away, removed from federal protection are millions and  millions of acres of wetlands that don't meet that criteria, and many of  these smaller streams that don't run year-round, that sort of fill up when  there's a rainfall, dry up.  None of those are subject to federal  protections anymore.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And so the folks who were critical of what happened  under President Obama, they -- what are they saying right now?  </p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT:  They are overjoyed.  </p><p>You know, farmers and rural land owners who also, of course, make up  President Trump's political base, this is exactly what they asked for.  And  they said, we feel like now we can do what we want with our land.  We don't  have to go to the federal government and ask for permission.  So they got  exactly what they asked for, and they're really happy.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Now, environmentalists, coming from a different  perspective, they are saying, not only is this a rollback of what President  Obama did, but it's taking it back to what both Presidents Bush had done  under their administrations.  </p><p>How do you explain that?  </p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT:  Yes, so something that the first President Bush in  particular doesn't always get a lot of credit for is that he did actually  pass a lot of environmentalist initiatives.  </p><p>And he campaigned -- he was an avid fisherman.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Right.  </p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT:  And he campaigned on protecting wetlands.  And he  put in place some policies that were designed to make sure that --  specifically that there was no loss of wetlands protection.  </p><p>And that policy was sort of further strengthened by his son, President  George W. Bush.  This strips away all of those protections.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  So, including what happened under President George  H.W. Bush and his son, George.</p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT:  Yes, and Obama.  </p><p>So it's a very significant rollback that lifts federal protections,  particularly on wetlands, you know, back to what it was more than 20 years  ago.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  So, what happens now after -- this is a proposal.   What happens next?  </p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT:  Right.  </p><p>So this is a proposal.  It's open for public comment for 60 days.  The  Trump administration will then take that public comment under  consideration.  It could revise or make changes to the rule.  And at some  point next year, they are expected to then issue a final rule.  </p><p>And then it's done.  And then I would expect the moment that it's  completed, probably in the first half of 2019, we will start to see major  lawsuits on behalf of environmental groups, states, you know, groups  saying, this is going to lead to major pollution of wetlands and waterways.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And you were telling us the Trump administration  expects that to happen.  Do they expect they can win in court?  </p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT:  They absolutely do.  </p><p>But the timing of this rule is not accidental.  The expectation is  that they want to, you know, put out the final rule in 2019.  Lawsuits get  filed then.  First, it will go to a federal court.  And the expectation is  that it will go before the Supreme Court sometime in 2020, and this  administration very much wants that to happen during the first term of  President Trump.  </p><p>They want to be able to -- this administration wants to be able to be  the ones to defend this in front of the Supreme Court.  But there is an  expectation that this current Supreme Court, now with justices selected by  President Trump and a conservative leaning, you know, there is a confidence  that they will uphold this rollback and a lot of other similar  environmental rollbacks that we have seen.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Interesting that they're thinking it through... </p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT:  Yes.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  ... to 2020.  </p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT:  The timing, the timing is absolutely a part of the  thinking.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Coral Davenport with The New York Times, thank you so  much.  </p><p>CORAL DAVENPORT:  Great to be here.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Across the country, teachers have been protesting for  better working conditions and better pay.  </p><p>Teaching still ranks among the lowest paid professions in America.   Back in 2007, the Department of Education launched a program to help offset  the cost of college or graduate school for teachers.  </p><p>But, as William Brangham reports, the program instead turned into an  economic trap.  </p><p>It's part of our weekly education series, Making the Grade.  </p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  The program is called the TEACH Grant program.  And  the idea was simple.  Teachers get a grant to pay for college or graduate  school, and, in exchange, they agree to teach for four years in places  where they're needed.</p><p>But according to an investigation by National Public Radio earlier  this year, some inflexible rules turned those free grants into very costly  loans.  Thousands of teachers suddenly found themselves facing potentially  ruinous debt.  </p><p>One of the NPR reporters on that series, Cory Turner, joins me now  with an update to their reporting.  </p><p>Cory, thank you so much for being here.  </p><p>Before we get to the update, explain a little bit more.  What was the  idea behind the TEACH Grant program?  </p><p>CORY TURNER, NPR:  Sure.  </p><p>I mean, when Congress passed and created this program, the intentions  were good.  The point was to try to get more young talented teachers into  schools that need the most, low-income schools.  </p><p>And so what the program did was to offer federal grants to aspiring  teachers to help pay for college or a master's degree.  And, in return,  these teachers promised to do a couple of things: to teach a high-needs  subject like math or science in a school that serves lots of low-income  families, and they'd have to do it for four years.  </p><p>The trick is, there was one requirement that has really caused a lot  of the trouble, and that was that teachers also had to prove they were  doing this every year by submitting paperwork.  </p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  And, roughly, how big were these grants?  </p><p>CORY TURNER:  So, we're talking about generally, for a year, roughly  $4,000.  We talked to a lot of teachers.  Some got $1,000 or $2,000.  We  talked to several teachers who got $4,000.  So we're talking $16,000.  </p><p>But once they're converted then from grants to loans, interest is  added on.  So, oftentimes, teachers would find themselves suddenly --  instead of grants, they would be in debt to the Education Department  $20,000.  </p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  So, you featured one teacher in Tennessee, Kaitlyn  McCollum, who had this, where she took out these grants that then,  unbeknownst to her, converted into loans.  </p><p>Tell us about her.  And tell us what happened with her.  </p><p>CORY TURNER:  Yes.  </p><p>So, Kaitlyn lives in Columbia, Tennessee, and she had a problem that  thousands of teachers had, which is, as I said, with this paperwork, it had  to be sent in on time.  Often it was due, though, in the middle of summer,  when principals who have to sign it are away on vacation.  </p><p>The paperwork was really fairly complicated.  We even found an  internal memo from the Ed Department where they called it complicated and  confusing.  Sometimes, reminders to fill it out were sent to the wrong  address.  </p><p>So, Kaitlyn, when she did the paperwork, she faxed it from her school  with her principal.  The loan servicing company said they never got it.   She mailed it in, but the mailed-in copy arrived several days late.  She  appealed.  She even got her principal to write her a letter saying, we  faxed this paperwork in on time.</p><p>But these rules are really inflexible.  They always have been.  This  program has been in place for a decade.  And so her appeal was denied, and  suddenly she found herself indebted more than $20,000.  And she's been in  forbearance, because she and her husband who are -- you know, they're rule  followers.  </p><p>He used to be a teacher, too.  They're doing their best.  They just  couldn't afford to pay this back.  So they went into forbearance.  We said  in our story, they even sold their house, because they did the math and  they couldn't afford it.  They downsized, even though they have a 19-month- old, because they wanted to be able to pay this back.  </p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  Let's listen to a little bit of how she described  the feeling of this debt.  </p><p>KAITLYN MCCOLLUM, Teacher:  And then it all just hit me like a ton of  bricks, like, oh, my God, I owe all of that money.  And it's like a knee- buckling moment of panic all over again.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  Your reporting showed that this was -- really  opened the floodgates of teachers all over the country complaining about  this happening to them.  </p><p>And the Department of Ed promised that they were going to fix it.   What did they do?  </p><p>CORY TURNER:  Yes, so the Department of Ed has offered a number of  different fixes here.</p><p>For teachers like Kaitlyn, again, she had to serve four years.  They  all do.  She made it three years filing her paperwork.  She got converted  in her last year.  </p><p>Teachers like Kaitlyn, as long as they can prove retroactively that  they met the teaching requirements of the program, regardless of what  happened with the paperwork, they will be made whole.  </p><p>If they paid interest, the Ed Department assures us the interest will  also be refunded.  We should also say teachers who can maybe only prove  retroactively one, two, or three years of service, as long as there is  still time for them, they can get back on track and potentially be made  whole as well.  </p><p>So, a couple of days ago, as we learned this news, my reporting  partner, Chris Arnold, and I, we actually called Kaitlyn McCollum up  because we wanted to share the news.  She was the first teacher we called.   </p><p>KAITLYN MCCOLLUM:  Sorry.  I'm...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KAITLYN MCCOLLUM:  Oh, goodness, that is such good news.  That's such  good news.  </p><p>We get to go back to living life like we did prior.  Thank you. </p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  That really is a wonderful, wonderful outcome to  all of your good, hard journalism.  </p><p>For teachers who are curious how they might proceed, where do they go?   What do they do?  </p><p>CORY TURNER:  First, they need to be patient.  The Education  Department is still ironing out the details of this fix.  They have assured  us they will post them on their Web site by January -- by the end of  January.  </p><p>I think the best thing to do would be to go to our Web site  NPR.org/TeachGRANT.  In our latest story, we actually have a link to the Ed  Department page where they're going to post all of this information.  </p><p>We also encourage teachers, if you want to go through this  reconsideration process, share your story with us.  There is a link in our  story for you to do that as well.  We'd love to hear from you and to follow  you as you go through this process.  </p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:  All right, Cory Turner of National Public Radio,  thank you so much.  </p><p>CORY TURNER:  Thank you.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  A new play on Broadway is drawing lots of attention  this winter, and not just because of its famous leading star.  </p><p>It's a new drama that explores big issues about race, class, criminal  justice, and what it's like to raise a black son in America.  </p><p>Jeffrey Brown has a look at the intense story of \"American Son.\"  </p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  Four a.m., the waiting room of a Miami police station,  a storm raging outside.  </p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON, Actress:  Jamal, damn it, where are you?  I have  sent you four texts, now five.  You can't text me back?  Call me.  </p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  As the play \"American Son\" opens, Kendra Ellis-Connor  is desperately seeking news of her missing 18-year-old son, Jamal.  </p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON:  There's almost like a cage element.  It's this room  that we're trapped in, the bit of the nightmare of the play.  </p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  Kerry Washington plays Kendra, a psychology professor  and a mother who's long lived with the fear of the dangers facing young  black men in America today.  </p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON:  Grow the hell up, because that is how it is!</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  Washington is best-known for her role as the political  fixer Olivia Pope  in the long-running TV series \"Scandal.\"</p><p>She's also known for her off-camera activism, speaking out on violence  against women and other issues.  </p><p>Talking with her recently at the famed Sardi's Restaurant on Broadway,  Washington said she felt a need to take on the role after reading the  script by playwright Christopher Demos-Brown.  </p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON:  I know Kendras.  I have been a version of Kendra.   But I have never seen her, you know, in our canon.  I never -- there was so  much about the play that I had never seen or heard before, that I thought  that, yes, this has to be part of our country's theatrical tradition.  </p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  Co-star Steven Pasquale, who plays Kendra's estranged  husband, Scott, an FBI agent, also sees higher-than-usual stakes in this  play.  </p><p>STEVEN PASQUALE, Actor:  In America, I want to be doing work that  sparks a conversation politically, you know, because I think we're on the  wrong track.  And I think this play asks all the right and hard questions  of everyone who sees it.  </p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: \"American Son\" unfolds all in one sparse room in the  police station.  It's a story of anger and pain now all-too-familiar.  </p><p>There's been a confrontation between a young black man and police.   Something bad, very bad, may have happened.  </p><p>And, as in this early scene between Kendra and a young officer, the  racial divide is ever-present.  </p><p>ACTOR:  I am doing the best I can.</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON:  Do you have a black son?</p><p>ACTOR:  Wow, we're really going to go there, huh?</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON:  Oh, we have been there for a while.  </p><p>We have been there a while.  </p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  We have been there.  </p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON:  Uh-huh.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  That's what you're saying.  It's always there.  We  don't often talk about it.  </p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON:  That's right.  And I think the play is such a great  opportunity to be able to talk about it.  </p><p>It's always J. this, J. that.</p><p>STEVEN PASQUALE:  Oh, come on.  I got a nickname for my son.  That's  just a male bonding thing.</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON:  This thing happens with the audience where you can  really hear kind of the white audience, and you can hear the African- American or other-identifying audience at times.</p><p>STEVEN PASQUALE:  On a scale from Eric Holder to Darnell Jackson,  Jamal is brushing right up against Darnell.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON:  Because people laugh at different things.  And the  way that the character of Jamal is written...</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  We never see Jamal, of course.</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON:  We don't, but he belongs to everyone.  We actually  are reminded that, within him, we all have a place in this story of this  American son.  </p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  It's a complicated place, though, with an interracial  marriage that's fallen apart, husband and wife brought together out of  concern for their son, but tangled in old tensions.  </p><p>STEVEN PASQUALE:  The play can't succeed if you don't believe that the  marriage was real.  </p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON:  And good at some point.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEVEN PASQUALE:  Yes, and good for a long time, yes.</p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON:  Yes.  </p><p>STEVEN PASQUALE:  And that the wheels come off when dealing with this  issue of how to parent a biracial child in America.  </p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  Also here, as we learn more about Jamal and the events  of that night, the values of both black and blue lives.  </p><p>We won't give away more here.  The play is directed by Tony Award- winning Broadway and film director Kenny Leon, with a prominent team of  producers, including Shonda Rhimes, a top TV producer of \"Scandal\" and  other series.  </p><p>Reviews so far have been mixed, with some critics praising the  performances and timeliness, while others have cited weakness in the  writing and structure.  </p><p>For these two actors, though, \"American Son\" taps into something  personal.  </p><p>STEVEN PASQUALE:  I have been working on and off Broadway for 20  years, and Broadway is really changing.  And it's scary to me the direction  it's going.  It tends to be a lot more family-friendly. It tends to be a  lot more sort of light.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  And big.</p><p>STEVEN PASQUALE:  And so to be in something that feels like a serious  piece of work, that asks serious questions, in a serious venue, feels  really important to a theater artist.  </p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  In the bio in the playbill, it says actor, producer,  and activist.  </p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON:  Mm-hmm.  </p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  Do they go together for you?  Are they all of a piece?  </p><p>KERRY WASHINGTON:  I have always found a very organic connection  between the work that I do as an actor and the work that I do as an  activist, I think, probably because our jobs involve stepping into somebody  else's shoes, and -- and that exercise of is what leads to greater empathy  and respect for humanity.  </p><p>That comes with the desire to make the world a better place for all of  us.  </p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: \"American Son\" is scheduled to run through January 27.  </p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Jeffrey Brown on Broadway.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Finally tonight:  Author Margaret Atwood has just  announced she's writing a sequel to her blockbuster novel \"The Handmaid's  Tale.\"  </p><p>In this preview from \"That Moment When,\" \"NewsHour\"'s weekly Facebook  Watch show, Atwood speaks about her parameters for writing the original  work.  </p><p>MARGARET ATWOOD, Author:  Well, the rule that I set myself for \"The  Handmaid's Tale\" was that nothing goes in this that doesn't have a  precedent somewhere in history or in real life right now.  </p><p>And, typically, they'd like to get their hands on the levers of  democracy, and then cancel them or subvert them.  Hitler was elected, but  that was kind of it for elections.  </p><p>QUESTION:  I have heard you say that before, that there had to be a  precedent for everything, that this had to be within the human smorgasbord  of things we do.  </p><p>MARGARET ATWOOD:  That's right.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Why was that an important rule for you?  </p><p>MARGARET ATWOOD:  Because I wasn't writing science fiction fantasy.  I  was writing speculative fiction like \"1984.\"  I made it a rule for myself  that I wasn't going to make stuff up.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  You can find all episodes of \"That Moment When\" on  Facebook @thatmomentwhenshow.  </p><p>And that is the \"NewsHour\" for tonight.  I'm Judy Woodruff.  </p><p>Join us online and again here tomorrow evening.  For all of us at the  \"PBS NewsHour,\" thank you, and we'll see you soon.  </p><p>END </p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 MacNeil/Lehrer Productions.  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

JAMES BAKER, Maxwell F. Baker Foundation:  The first thing that you do  when you feel that problem is there, please don't judge.  Recognize that  that person inside of that addiction is still your son or daughter or  brother.  And they have behaviors that they can't control.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> HARI SREENIVASAN:  And the year in technology.  We review a turning point  in our lives online and in social media.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> FARHAD MANJOO, The New York Times:  I think we got, justifiably, a lot less  optimistic about tech, and a lot more worried about the implications of a  few big tech companies kind of taking over much of the world.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  All that and more on tonight's \"PBS NewsHour.\"  </p><p> (BREAK) </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  A cold wave kept the nation's Midwest and Northeast in  the deep freeze today.  Windchill warnings and advisories stretched from  North Dakota to New Hampshire, as arctic winds dropped temperatures to 37  below zero in some places.  </p><p> Officials warned of the risk of frostbite with less than 30 minutes of  exposure, and they went on alert.  </p><p> ED HASSAN, Boston EMS:  Any time that we have an extreme in weather, be it  cold or hot, it taxes the EMS system as a whole.  Look for people who may  need assistance maybe before they're so bad off that they require an  ambulance to go to the hospital.  And they will get them services like a  shelter, a detox, and things like that.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  As the cold set in, Erie, Pennsylvania, declared a state  of emergency, with a record 65 inches of snow.  More snow was falling  today.  </p><p> In Syria, critically ill patients are finally being evacuated from a rebel- held area near Damascus.  Hundreds of sick people in eastern Ghouta have  been unable to get treatment at area hospitals.  But now government troops  are letting aid groups evacuate nearly 30 critically ill patients.  In  return, the rebels want a like number of captive fighters released.  </p><p> Also today, Russia declared the main battle with the Islamic State in Syria  is now over.  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Syrian army and its  allies must turn their focus to hunting down the Nusra Front group, linked  to al-Qaida.  </p><p> Russian leader Vladimir Putin has officially registered to run for his  fourth term as president.  In Moscow today, Putin handed in his papers in  person to the nation's election commission.  Early polls show he's likely  to be reelected in the March vote.  Opposition leader Alexei Navalny is  urging a boycott of the election after he was banned from running.  </p><p> Today, he called for nationwide protests next month.  </p><p> ALEXEI NAVALNY, Russian Opposition Leader (through translator):  Let's come  out to the street for yourselves, for your rights, for your future, for the  fact that we do not want to lose another six years.  We will start a big  campaign on one hand to persuade everyone to participate in the boycott and  not to take part in the election, and on the other hand to count how many  people really come to the polling stations, and not let Putin fabricate  that number.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  Putin is 65 years old and has already led Russia as  prime minister and now president for a total of 18 years.  </p><p> Former President Obama is urging leaders to be careful in their online  statements.  He spoke with Britain's Prince Harry in an interview that  aired today on the BBC.  The former president didn't directly mention  President Trump, but he did voice concern about social media's effect on  politics.  </p><p> BARACK OBAMA, Former President of the United States:  All of us in  leadership have to find ways in which we can recreate a common space on the  Internet.  </p><p> One of the dangers of the Internet is, is that people can have entirely  different realities.  They can be just cocooned in information that  reinforces their current biases.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  Mr. Obama also said he considers the Affordable Care  Act, widely known as Obamacare, one of his greatest achievements.  </p><p> The Library of Congress says it will no longer archive every public tweet,  including the president's.  Instead, starting in the new year, it will be  more selective.  The library cites the growing volume in tweets and the  increase in characters from 140 to 280.  The National Archives keeps all  presidential tweets, and will continue to do so.  </p><p> And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 28 points to  close at 24774.  The Nasdaq rose three points, and the S&amp;P 500 added two.  </p><p> Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": should you pay your property taxes early?  -- we look at the pros and cons under the new tax law; a nation divided, a  review of the year in politics from the right and the left; America  Addicted, a doctor's personal loss to opioids; and much more.  </p><p> The new tax laws are set to take effect on Monday.  </p><p> Given that the president and Republicans in Congress just passed and signed  the legislation days ago, some taxpayers are scrambling to try to squeeze  in deductions, some for next year, before 2017 ends.  </p><p> That's especially true in a number of municipalities, where people are  standing in line to prepay their property taxes for 2018.  </p><p> Let's look at what you need to know, and begin with this field report by  Brenda Flanagan of New Jersey public television.  </p><p> (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p> BRENDA FLANAGAN:  While Republicans celebrated and called their tax bill  historic, homeowners panicked and called their accountants in high- property-tax states like New York, California and New Jersey.  </p><p> GAIL ROSEN, CPA:  Phones and e-mails have been going off crazy, because a  lot of people are hearing about the real estate tax deduction, hearing  about all the changes, and wanting to know what to do.  </p><p> BRENDA FLANAGAN:  That's because, in 2018, the Republican bill will cap  property tax deductions at $10,000.  But in Jersey, average property taxes  exceed $10,000 in four counties.  In fact, homeowners here pay the highest  property taxes in the nation, more than $8,500, on average.  </p><p> WAYNE DEFEO, New Jersey:  Anyone in New Jersey, that's got to be scary.  </p><p> BRENDA FLANAGAN:  So, many homeowners, like Wayne DeFeo, are meeting with  CPAs, looking to prepay next year's property taxes, to take advantage of  the full deduction before it expires.  It's kind of a loophole.  </p><p> WAYNE DEFEO:  If I could prepay half of my property taxes for next year, to  take advantage of it this tax year, based on what my accountant's told me,  is I would save almost $1,000.  And that goes to my pocket.  </p><p> GAIL ROSEN:  It's up to each and every taxpayer to make a decision how  comfortable they feel paying real estate taxes in advance.  But you should  look at it.  Everyone should look at it, because it's a one-time  opportunity by December 31.  It's a lot of money to leave on the table.  </p><p> BRENDA FLANAGAN:  How much?  Say you're single, with no kids, making  $75,000.  Your property taxes are $20,000.  We figured that, for 2017, you  will owe the IRS about $8,500.  But prepaying the first two-quarters of  your 2018 property taxes could knock that IRS bill down to about $6,000.   You would save almost $2,500.  </p><p> But accountants advise it won't work for everyone.  </p><p> DAN CONNOLLY, CPA:  For people that make more than $200,000, they're caught  up in Alternate Minimum tax, which basically disallows income and real  estate taxes to get you back to a minimum level.  </p><p> BRENDA FLANAGAN:  CPA Dan Connolly also warns some people may be tempted to  borrow money to make those prepayments.  </p><p> DAN CONNOLLY:  Some people are going on credit lines to pay for them, and  then they're going to have to pay interest on the money that they borrow to  prepay the tax.  So the calculation is not that simple.  </p><p> BRENDA FLANAGAN:  Regardless, municipalities from Elizabeth to Alpine, and  here in the shore town of Belmar report residents are showing up with  checkbooks to prepay at least the first two quarters of next year's  property taxes.  </p><p> MATT DOHERTY, Mayor of Belmar, New Jersey:  We're walking them through the  process of prepayment.  We have our staff ready to accept those  prepayments, process them properly, make sure it's all documented for  anyone who comes in, so they're able to take advantage of the deduction  this year in 2017.  </p><p> BRENDA FLANAGAN:  Mayor Matt Doherty's prepaying his taxes.  But besides  working the loophole, lawmakers in several states are also looking for  other ways to soften the blow. </p><p> Here in Jersey, one bill would increase property tax deductions for  homeowners.  But it'd cost the state $170 million in revenues.  </p><p> RAY LESNIAK (D), New Jersey State Senator:  Well, the bill would allow full  deductibility of homeowners' property taxes on their state income taxes.   And that will cut in half for most people the hit they're going to get by  the Trump bill, which doesn't allow deductibility for property taxes over  $10,000.  </p><p> BRENDA FLANAGAN:  For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Brenda Flanagan, reporting  from Elizabeth, New Jersey.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  Some more questions and perspective about the changes to  the tax code and end-of-the-year decision on property tax deductions.  </p><p> Mark Steber is a CPA and chief tax officer for Jackson Hewitt Tax Service.</p><p> So, Mark, what are some of the factors that should go into figuring out  whether you should make these payments now vs. later?  </p><p> MARK STEBER, Jackson Hewitt Tax Service:  Well, your piece was excellent  and spot on with several of the observations from some of your  professionals.  </p><p> Basically, don't think that one size fits all on this opportunity.  It  certainly works where it works, but where it doesn't, it can have the  benefit of biting you pretty badly on the back end.  </p><p> So the two things that I'm telling folks on this property tax acceleration  idea is, one, make sure you have the money.  Borrowing money to do a tax  planning idea that might change even after the 1st of the year, not my best  advice.  </p><p> And the second thing is watch out for that Alternative Minimum Tax.  Your  other featured speaker said that these taxes are not deductible when you go  in and compute that, as are not mortgage interest and a whole host of other  items that you do to calculate Alt Min that.</p><p> So if you make this accelerated deduction, throws you into Alternative  Minimum Tax, and you don't get a benefit, all might have been for naught.</p><p> So, have the cash.  Watch out for Alt Min, but, most importantly, what we  are telling our clients at Jackson Hewitt is consult with your tax adviser.   Only they know your facts and circumstances and what to watch for and what  your tax profile will look like for 2017 and for 2018, even given the new  limitation on the property taxes.  </p><p> There is a lot to look at, and you certainly don't want to run afoul of a  benefit that you might need next year, even if you are in a high property  tax area.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  One of the things we have heard is that this is going to  affect states like California and New Jersey, but this isn't a blue  state/red state thing, is it?  </p><p> MARK STEBER:  No, it's not, and that is really kind of a  mischaracterization.</p><p> Those states that you name certainly do have high property taxes, but I'm  from Florida and I have friends in all the different states in the country,  and many of them have high property tax locations.  So it's really for  anybody who has high property taxes.  They should look at this.</p><p> But they should also look at their other factors as well.  But this is not  solely a New Jersey issue or a California issue or a New York issue.  It's  a whoever has property taxes more than $10,000, the new limit, that is  where this is kind of applicable, because that is where you are going to  get capped out in 2018.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  What about the possibility that Congress could move  forward to try to close this loophole retroactively, saying that everybody  that went out of their way to stand in line and pay these now might not  actually see the benefit?</p><p> MARK STEBER:  Well, that is certainly a possibility, with the corrections  bill that will come in after the fact to tweak up some of the areas that  were not absolutely looked at in totality when they passed the law.  </p><p> But I really wouldn't worry too much about a retroactive change, unless  there is a great deal of abuse.  And I think once folks take a look at this  and see what some of the risks are, what some of the costs are, I don't see  this really being an overwhelming opportunity for folks to take advantage  of.</p><p> It is a lot of money up front for a tax benefit arguably in 2019, when do  you your taxes.  You really have to have a compelling set of facts and  circumstances to do that.  And some will do it, and it will make sense, but  most people are taking a cautious look at the idea.  </p><p> But where it makes sense, it makes sense.  But it's not for everybody.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  All right, Mark Steber of Jackson Hewitt, thanks so  much.  </p><p> MARK STEBER:  Thank you.    </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  Taxes were just one of the top political stories of  2017.  </p><p> John Yang now takes a deeper look at President Trump's first year and  what's in store for 2018 from two different perspectives.  </p><p> JOHN YANG:  Hari, we are joined Karine Jean-Pierre, who is a senior adviser  to MoveOn.org a and contributing editor to the online women's magazine  \"Bustle.\"  She also served in the Obama White House.  And from Phoenix,  Chris Buskirk is a radio host out there and editor of the conservative blog  AmericanGreatness.org.  </p><p> Chris, Karine, thanks for being with us.</p><p> Chris, I want to start with you.  </p><p> You talk to folks out there on your radio show every day.  As we end the  year, what is the -- sort of the state of the Trump base, of Trump  supporters out there now?  </p><p> CHRIS BUSKIRK, AmericanGreatness.org:  Well, a lot happier than I think  folks were maybe even two, three weeks ago.  </p><p> I think the fact that the tax bill passed was a welcome balm at the end of  the year.  And there are two elements of that.  One is that people  generally supported the tax bill.  They think it was good policy.  And  that's a big part of it.</p><p> The other part is just seeing a Republican Congress, for whom so many Trump  voters had very, very high hopes at the beginning of this year, and seeing  that Congress actually do something.</p><p> You know, I called it a do-nothing Congress for months and months and  months, primarily because it was a do-nothing Congress.  But they did  something.  And I think it was good policy from our perspective.  And as we  are wrapping up the year here, the Trump voters are looking and saying, you  know what, the president did a lot of things he promised to, and now we are  actually seeing Congress get on board too.  </p><p> JOHN YANG:  Chris, I want to continue with you.</p><p> As you pointed out, there was a lot of unhappiness about Congress.  People  were still supporting the president and they were blaming Congress for  inaction.  Has this solved all that?  And, also, has the gap between the  president's supporters and, for a lack of a better term, the elected  officials in Washington, the Speaker Ryans, the Leader McConnells, has that  been healed over by this?  </p><p> CHRIS BUSKIRK:  You know, I don't know if it healed over, but it's a good  start.  </p><p> I guess I would put it that way.  There has been a sort of changing of the  guard going on, on the American right among conservatives over the past  year or two or even three, I guess, if we go back to 2015.  And is  everything brushed under the carpet?  No.  </p><p> But you know what?  That is OK.  What is important here, from my  perspective, I think from a lot of people's perspective on the right, is  that different factions within the Republican Party are figuring out,  number one, that they need to work together, and, number two, how to do it.  </p><p> And so, as we go into 2018, that is a reason for people on the right to  have some optimism.  </p><p> JOHN YANG:  Karine, conversely, what is sort of the state of the loyal  opposition at the end of the year?</p><p> KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, Democratic Strategist:  Yes, conversely, indeed.  </p><p> Look, I think that Republicans passed an unpopular bill, now that they have  to go into 2018 trying to sell it.  Not only that.  They have a president  that is historically unpopular.  The Republican Congress is unpopular.  So  they are facing potentially a blue wave next year from the Democrats.</p><p> And I just don't understand how they even think this is a good thing, when  you see the polling after polling that says people hate the GOP tax plan,  and also the intensity.  There is an intensity on the Democratic side that  we have not seen in a long time.  They are unified, they are energized.  </p><p> Democrats won a Senate seat in a ruby-red state of Alabama.  That is  unheard of.  People would say we had no business even going into that state  and trying to fight and win that race.  And so I think that Republicans  have a tough fight against them -- ahead of them in 2018.  And I just don't  see how they even stop that.</p><p> Unifying right now doesn't even make sense either, because they have an  unpopular president.  Congress is unpopular.  And let's not forget there is  DACA that needs to be taken care of.  There is CHIP that needs to be  reauthorized, both bipartisan policies, programs that are popular.  </p><p> JOHN YANG:  Chris, what about that?</p><p> The Democrats -- there is a lot of talk about whether the Democrats have --  there is an enthusiasm gap with the Democrats, that they are more  enthusiastic, more fired up going into 2018, going into the midterms.  What  about that?  </p><p> CHRIS BUSKIRK:  Well, there is something to it.  There really is.  </p><p> And I think this is going to be a hard-fought election year.  There is no  doubt about it.  Look, there is something about being opposition that tends  to galvanize the people who are in the opposition.  </p><p> Republicans just had eight years of it and I think, by a lot of measures  were more successful -- as the old mantra goes, the Republicans were the  party of no.  Republicans were pretty -- got pretty good at being the party  of no during the Obama years, and because there is something that brings  people together when you think that you are -- or actually are in the  reality in the minority in Congress.  </p><p> So, as we look at the elections coming up next year, yes, Republicans do  need to figure how to, number one, stick together, and, number two, how to  make the case.  </p><p> I am happy to make the case that says, look, we have a booming stock  market, we have got low unemployment, we have got a tax bill that allows  people to keep more of what they earn.  We have got more or less peace  abroad, and make that case to the American people in 2018.   But you know what?  You have to make the case.  And that is going to be the  challenge for Republican candidates all over the country next year, because  there is a lot of enthusiasm on the left.  And so I say, let's have at it.  </p><p> JOHN YANG:  Karine, that is the -- making a case for the Republicans in  2018.  </p><p> For the Democrats, do they have to say -- I mean, what is the better  politics for them, to stand and say no to the president, to be the  opposition, literally the opposition, or do they look to work with him on  the issues you talked about, DACA, the dreamers, the children's health  insurance, infrastructure?</p><p> KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:  Right.</p><p> So what I say to DACA and CHIP is that, look, it is a bipartisan support --  has bipartisan support, is very popular with the public.  So it should be  able to be fixed easily.  It's not very difficult.  </p><p> And not only that.  Republicans control all three branches, so they should  be able to do that.  And if they don't, it's not the Democrats' fault.  It  is the Republicans' fault.  So, that is that point there.  </p><p> But I do agree that Democrats need to not just be anti-Trump.  They need to  also offer something as well, which is, OK, let's lift minimum wage.  Let's  fight on that.  Let's make sure we expand Medicare, expand Medicaid, expand  Social Security.  Let's be about something, not just anti-Trump.  </p><p> JOHN YANG:  Chris, are there places where the Republicans can work with the  Democrats in the next year before the elections?  </p><p> CHRIS BUSKIRK:  Yes, I will tell you what.  This is a place that I'm really  interested in.  </p><p> I think there are two big areas where Republicans and Democrats hopefully  will be able to find some common ground and come together.  Number one is  infrastructure.  This is something that has been talked about by people  like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi for a long time.  It's also something  that has been talked about by Donald Trump, where he actively on the  campaign trail was talking about a big infrastructure bill.  </p><p> I think that would be more than appropriate, more than welcome in 2018.  I  would hope there would be some consensus on that.  And the other part is --  and this really is big picture, but I think it's important, and that is  returning the power to legislate, to make laws back to Congress.  </p><p> I think Congress needs to take some of that power back from the executive  branch.  I think altogether too much lawmaking power resides in the  agencies and the departments of the executive branch.  And this, I think,  particularly now with Trump in the White House, this might be a time when  Democrats and Republicans in Congress can say, you know what, we need to go  back to doing the job the Constitution gives us, which is being the  legislature, being the one that makes the laws.  </p><p> JOHN YANG:  Chris Buskirk, Karine Jean-Pierre, thanks for being with us.  </p><p> CHRIS BUSKIRK:  Thanks.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  Stay with us.</p><p> Coming up on the \"NewsHour\": a treatment to eliminate a female medical  problem and, with it, a cultural taboo; the year in tech, when social media  companies came under scrutiny; and from the \"NewsHour\" Bookshelf, the real- life story of the infamous Miami drug war. </p><p> But, first, we continue our second look at a special series America  Addicted on the opioid crisis and its enormous toll.  </p><p> Tonight, the story of a doctor who suffered a devastating personal loss to  opioids exactly one year ago, but now he's doing everything he can to keep  other families from suffering the same fate.  </p><p> Miles O'Brien reports that, at the same time, he's also concerned about a  backlash where some patients can't get the pain treatment they need.  </p><p> This is part of our weekly Leading Edge science series.  </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  Spend the day with physician Jim Baker, and you will  understand America's opioid crisis in a uniquely professional and personal  way.  </p><p> He lives in Holden, Massachusetts, a Norman Rockwell town just north of  Worcester.  Idyllic as it seems, there is death all around.  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER, Maxwell F. Baker Foundation:  In that time it took us to  go around this block, of a minute, including my house right there, four  deaths and one person in recovery.  And so this is Holden.  </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  Less than a year ago, death by overdose came to his family.   He lost his son Max, or Macky, as his family called him.  He was 23.  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  Macky was a sensitive, caring, warm, brilliant young man.   He was so smart, it was scary.  </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  He always enjoyed music?  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  Yes.  He started playing seriously when he was about 10,  and he would play every day, multiple times a day.  </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  And because he was the drummer, the band played here.  Jim  Baker can remember the night things changed.  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  I was up in this room.  They did the first half of their  set, which was clear and strong music.  Then they took a break.  When they  came back, they were -- the timing was off.  The changes weren't right.  I  thought, what happened?  </p><p> I found out later that they had got a hold of pills.  And within a year, he  had moved on to heroin.  How that happened, I still don't know.  </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  And so began a downward spiral.  He was flunking out of  school, losing friends and his music deteriorated.  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  He had the deepest desire to stop.  He knew -- he said,  \"If I don't stop, it's going to kill me.\"  But he couldn't do it on his  own, and I couldn't find treatment.  </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  He was trying to find a fellow doctor willing and able to  give Macky treatment with Suboxone, a combination of two drugs.  One  answers an addict's craving for opioids.  The other blocks the high.  But  precious few doctors provide the treatment.  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  The sad truth is, they say, I don't want those patients  in my office or, in more private conversation, it takes too much time, I  don't want to deal with it.  </p><p> I have heard people say, our group talked about it.  We voted against it.   There is no reimbursement.  </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  Jim Baker spent many years as an emergency room doctor, and  now works for hospice.  He makes house calls to people who need opioids to  manage their pain.  </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  Today, he is checking in on Bob Hopwood (ph).  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  Do you feel like, when you use it, if you just had a  little bit more, it would help you?  </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  He works hard to insure his terminally ill patients avoid  unneeded suffering with pain.  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  Physicians are overtuned to this.  And What's happening  now is, physicians are responding by saying, I am writing for fewer  opioids.  I don't write for opioids anymore.  </p><p> And it is having a negative effect for people who have real pain and who  need relief.  Now they can't find it.  The pendulum has definitely swung  back too far, and now people who really have pain cannot find relief. </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  But he understands all too well the crisis that has caused  this overreaction.  </p><p> As his son's journey into the darkness of addiction worsened, Jim Baker  felt he had no choice.  He told Macky to leave the house, which prompted  this letter.</p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  I said: \"Macky, you can call me anytime, 24 hours a day  no matter where I am.  I will help however I can.  Just stay with it.  I  love you so much.  Dad.\"</p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  He did stay with it.  He finally found treatment, and he  got off the heroin.  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  He was able to maintain sobriety for two years or so, and  he was doing great.  He was in college.  He had fallen in love.  </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  He and Emma were planning on getting married, a storybook  ending.  It seemed like he had beaten the odds.  And then, Thanksgiving  last year, a horrible twist of fate.  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  It was late at night and coming down this road.  His  impact was right here, boom.  A young girl, we guess, just didn't see him  coming because of a bush or a house there.  He fractured and deformed his  right hand, his drumming hand, his writing hand.  And he was bruised up in  his chest and his face.  And he was beat up pretty good.  </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  As he went into surgery, Macky told the anesthesiologist  not to give him opioids.  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  But I found out later, she was injecting him with  fentanyl.  And when he came out of the operating room, the first thing he  said with glazed eyes is, \"I need drugs.\"</p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  Addicted once again.  </p><p> A month later, he got the call he had been dreading for years.  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  This is the road I was driving to when his brother called  me and said, \"Dad, Macky is unconscious.\"</p><p> And I was coming up here hoping and hoping, please, Macky, please.   Couldn't get the door open.  And I'm asking him, is he breathing?  Is he  responding?  And the answers were really scary.  </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  He was gone.  One of 33,000 Americans who die each year  because of an opioid overdose.  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  So, we're coming up upon a cemetery.  The field right  above that is where he learned to play tee-ball.  </p><p> Hey, Macky, dad is here.  Just want to tell you, I love you, pal.  We're  going to keep on fighting, </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  On this night, they gathered at a health club in Holden.   They pedaled hard to raise money for the Max Baker Foundation, and they  heard Jim Baker's talk, poignant and practical.  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  My goal is to have everyone here know more about opioids  than they did when they came through the door.  </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  He told a rapt audience what to look for, slurred speech,  pinpoint pupils and long-sleeve shirts.  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  The first thing that you do when you feel that problem is  there, please don't judge.  Recognize that that person inside of that  addiction is still your son or daughter or brother.  And they have  behaviors that they can't control.  </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  He told them to get Narcan, an over-the-counter drug that  can instantly counteract an overdose.  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  It's one of the few miracle drugs I have ever seen.  A  person is blue, not breathing, dusky, even cool, dying, and get Narcan in,  and, three, two, one, they sit up and go, what, what?  Where am I?  </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  And he told them to get a sledgehammer.  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  And if I hear a funny sound in the bathroom, or a thud,  and knock, knock, knock, and there is no answer in there, I'm going to pick  this up and I'm going to whack that door handle, and then I'm going to  whack that hinge.  I'm going to bust down that door and get in.  </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  This is Jim Baker's mission, his way of channeling profound  grief.  </p><p> DR. JAMES BAKER:  I feel like, what would it mean to me had someone who was  suffering done what it took, done what was necessary to help Macky?  </p><p> And I would be forever -- and I can't really talk about it, but the most  meaningful thing I could ever ask of someone.  But it's now my turn to do  it for somebody else, and I know that's what he'd want me to do.  </p><p> MILES O'BRIEN:  Max Baker is no longer with us, but his father is spending  his days hoping to make sure his son's life has enduring purpose.  </p><p> For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Miles O'Brien in Holden, Massachusetts.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  Tomorrow, a report on the impact opioid addiction is  having on the American workplace.  </p><p> Find all of our stories from the series online at PBS.org/NewsHour.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  Next: one effort to address a humiliating medical injury  that afflicts perhaps one million women in the developing world who lack  access to safe medical facilities.  </p><p> Fred de Sam Lazaro reports from Kenya.  It's part of his Agents for Change  series.  </p><p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  In a new hospital in Eldoret, Kenya, these women are  awaiting surgery to fix a condition that's widely misunderstood and  reviled, one that's made them outcasts, often in their own families.  </p><p> It's called obstetric fistula, an injury to the birth canal caused, in most  cases, by prolonged labor that leaves a woman incontinent.  Perhaps one  million women in the developing world suffer from fistulas, a condition  virtually wiped out in industrialized nations with better access to  prenatal care and medical facilities.  </p><p> At least once a week, these patients hear a message of hope from a woman  who knows all too well their suffering; 41-year-old Sarah Omega was just 19  when she was raped and became pregnant.  </p><p> SARAH OMEGA, Fistula Survivor:  I was so scared.  I didn't want to secure  an abortion because of my faith, yes, so I kept the pregnancy.  </p><p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  Omega eventually spent 38 hours in a difficult labor,  much of it at home.  In the process, the baby died, and she suffered a  large fistula.  For 12 years, Omega says she was subjected to isolation and  shame.  </p><p> SARAH OMEGA:  I attempted suicide twice.  Every night, I would go to bed.   I would say, God, please don't allow me to see tomorrow, because my  tomorrow, every day, I would wake up in the morning, see the sun, I would  cry because I knew it was another day of pain, of humiliation, of suffering  in isolation.  </p><p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  That anguish landed her in a psychiatric ward, and it  was there that a visiting doctor came to her bedside.  </p><p> SARAH OMEGA:  He assured me that my problem was going to be fixed.  And I  remember that day he told me: \"I'm seeing a lot of hope in you.  I want you  to get healed.\"</p><p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  That doctor was 49-year-old Hillary Mabeya, a  gynecologist and surgeon who has devoted his entire practice to women with  fistulas.  </p><p> This 88-bed hospital was built for his use, as part of a broad campaign by  the California-based Fistula Foundation.  </p><p> DR. HILLARY MABEYA, Gynocare Fistula Center:  These are patients who need  care, they need support, and they need a lot of counseling.  They suffer so  much from society because of their condition.  </p><p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  It's difficult to pinpoint how many women suffer from  fistula in this country, in part because most of them are kept isolated by  their communities and even their families.  </p><p> But in recent years, since the campaign began to raise awareness of  fistula, awareness that it is treatable, some 7,000 women have emerged from  hiding each year seeking surgery.  </p><p> Fistula awareness groups have taken to the streets to educate others about  the condition, and where to get help.  We watched as these women, many of  them survivors themselves, fanned out through the Western city of Mumias,  and encouraged women suffering from incontinence issues to get free  screening offered by the campaign.  </p><p> Organizer Habiba Mohamed said people still have many misconceptions about  fistula.  </p><p> HABIBA MOHAMED, Community Organizer:  Maybe she has been bewitched.  Maybe  she was promiscuous and had a relationship outside marriage when she was  pregnant.  </p><p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  Mohamed's group, WADADIA, recently arranged the  transportation and treatment for 35-year-old Rachel Juma Wasamba, who lives  in a remote village in Western Kenya.  </p><p> Wasamba was lucky.  Her husband stayed with her throughout her condition  and treatment.  Many husbands abandon their wives in such situations.   Amina Mushele says that's what happened to her.  </p><p> AMINA MUSHELE, Fistula Survivor (through translator):  My husband couldn't  take it anymore, so he left me to marry another woman.  </p><p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  She had surgery one year ago, and now makes and sells  goods in the town marketplace, using skills she got from a training program  sponsored by WADADIA.  The training, ranging from hairstyling, to  seamstress work, and computer skills, helps reintegrate women back into  their community.  </p><p> HABIBA MOHAMED:  The moment someone has been treated, and she has healed,  you can be able to see a significant change in her life, and not only in  her life, in her family, in her children.  So, it has a ripple effect to an  entire family and the entire community.  </p><p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  Back in Eldoret, Dr. Mabeya is kept very busy at one  of the few places where fistula surgery is performed and offered free of  charge.  </p><p> Working six days a week, he operates on 45 women a month.  Since that's  just a fraction of the new cases, he is also training other doctors in the  region, and he is working to prevent fistulas in the first place.  </p><p> DR. HILLARY MABEYA:  Fistula is almost 100 percent preventable.  In  developed countries, it's not even there.  </p><p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  He says fistula can be avoided if adequate prenatal  and emergency care is made available when complications arise during  pregnancy.  More than half of all Kenyan women still deliver their babies  at home.  </p><p> For her part, Sarah Omega says her healing became complete when she able to  give birth to a health baby daughter, Jade, who recently turned two.  </p><p> SARAH OMEGA:  She means just the whole world to me.  I remember at some  point, I would pray and say, God, if you give me a baby, that baby will  erase the pain I have gone through in this life.  </p><p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  And Omega continues to help other women erase the pain  of fistula.  </p><p> SARAH OMEGA:  I decided to change the pain I had gone through into  something beautiful, something that will help me reach out to other women,  something that will allow other women to live a normal life like me.  </p><p> FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  She travels frequently to talk about her experiences,  but, more regularly, her advocacy happens at the bedside of women at the  new fistula hospital.</p><p> For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Fred de Sam Lazaro in Eldoret, Kenya.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  Fred's reporting is a partnership with the Under-Told  Stories Project at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota.  </p><p> Technology has traditionally been seen by the public and many in the media  in a more hopeful light.  </p><p> But 2017 felt different, a year that frequently cast technology, and its  unintended consequences, in a much harsher light.  </p><p> In a moment, we will have a conversation that I recorded last week in New  York, but, first, a quick reminder about some of the major problems this  year.  </p><p>Russia used Facebook and social media to try and influence the 2016  elections.  The revelations reverberated throughout the nation's capital  this year.  </p><p> As congressional committees detailed, Russian operatives bought ads that  sought to capitalize on racial, religious and political divisions in the  U.S.  Just 120 fake accounts posted on Facebook 80,000 times and reached as  many as 126 million Americans.  </p><p>Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, initially doubted that the platform could  have influenced the election, but later pledged to make political  advertising more transparent.  </p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, Founder, Facebook:  Not only will you have to disclose  which page paid for an ad, but we will also make it so you can visit an  advertiser's page and see the ads that they're currently running to any  audience on Facebook.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  Members of both parties were angry at the company's slow  admission, but the focus grew beyond just one company to other tech giants,  since Russian agents used Twitter, Google and YouTube too.  </p><p> The Senate Intelligence Committee grilled top lawyers for the companies.  </p><p> SEN. MARK WARNER (D), Virginia:  Many of us on this committee have been  raising this issue since the beginning of this year.  And our claims were,  frankly, blown off by the leaderships of your companies, dismissed, so  there's no possibility nothing like this happening, nothing to see here.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  Hacking, a perennial problem, took on new urgency this  past year.  </p><p> The ransomware cyber-attack called WannaCry temporarily crippled computer  systems in hospitals, banks and companies around the world.  More than  230,000 computers in 150 countries were affected.  Just a week ago, the  Trump administration named the country it says was responsible.  </p><p> TOM BOSSERT, White House Homeland Security Adviser:  After careful  investigation, the United States is publicly attributing the massive  WannaCry cyber-attack to North Korea.  We do not make this allegation  lightly.  We do so with evidence, and we do so with partners.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  Hackers also tore into Equifax, one of the largest  credit bureaus, stealing the personal information of more than 145 million  people.  They got Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and  driver's licenses.  </p><p> The tech industry faced a new conversation on inequality by race and  gender.  </p><p> Susan Fowler, a former engineer at Uber, published a damning account of a  harassment-filled workplace culture.  Uber fired 20 employees and it  eventually helped lead to the CEO's resignation.</p><p> She told \"TIME\" she was amazed by the reaction to her essay.  </p><p> SUSAN FOWLER, Former Uber Engineer:  I expected it would be like a 24-hour,  like, viral thing, but it didn't slow down at all.  And I was reading  through all of these things.  And I thought like, oh, my gosh, like, I'm  not alone.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  Others, like Ellen Pao, who filed and lost a gender  discrimination case against a powerful venture capital firm, said change  was needed.  </p><p> ELLEN PAO, Tech Investor:  Well, I think if playing along means  participating in sexist and racist jokes, that expectation has to change.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  The year ended with a divisive decision by the FCC that  many fear will lead to the end of net neutrality, the idea of treating all  content on the Web equally without charging more or blocking your ability  to see other content.  </p><p> For a closer look at the potential turning point that 2017 is shaping up to  be for the most well-known tech giants, I'm joined by two people who follow  that world closely. Farhad Manjoo is a New York Times columnist who writes on how technology is  changing society and business.  And David Kirkpatrick is the founder of  Techonomy.  He's a technology journalist and author of \"The Facebook  Effect.\"  </p><p> Thank you both for joining us.  </p><p> So, Farhad, let me start with you.  </p><p> How did tech shift in our perception this year?  </p><p> FARHAD MANJOO, The New York Times:  Yes, I think we got, justifiably, a lot  less optimistic about tech, and a lot more worried about the implications  of a few big tech companies kind of taking over much of the world, much of  our communications, much of how we kind of learn and experience the world,  all of our personal information.  </p><p> And I think the tech companies responded to that.  They started to notice.   I mean, after the questions about the Russia hack, after questions about  sexual harassment, they started to respond to these criticisms.  </p><p> And I think the key change they made was a lot of these -- a lot of the big  tech companies started, at first grudgingly and then more willingly, I  think, they started to accept that they have some responsibility to the  rest of the world, that their technologies aren't necessarily kind of  neutral platforms, and that they have some responsibility to kind of police  what happens there.  </p><p> How that plays out, I think, will be the big question of 2018.  But this  year, I think that the big change is that, in the past, technology  companies sort of thought of themselves as kind of neutral.  And I think  that started to change.  They are less neutral now.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  But, David Kirkpatrick, what happened to make Silicon  Valley less the sort of darling of, well, Washington, D.C., as well as Wall  Street?  </p><p> DAVID KIRKPATRICK, Founder, Techonomy:  Well, if there is one single thing  that changed the situation, I would say it's Russian fake news affecting  the election, in the opinion of -- and the desire of Russia to alter our  electoral process, and using Facebook and Google, but Facebook in  particular, as a key means of doing that.  </p><p> And I think what that concern at a national level did was draw attention to  the extraordinary social, cultural and informational weight of these  companies, and then caused a lot of people to start asking bigger questions  about what it meant that these very small number of tech giants have had  such a monumental impact on our social dialogue and have, in effect, become  the central platform for social dialogue, and increasingly in many ways for  political behavior as well.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  Mark Zuckerberg famously said it is a crazy idea that  they would have had any impact on the U.S. elections.</p><p> And then, since then, he's made several statements that walked that back.  </p><p> DAVID KIRKPATRICK:  Right.  </p><p> He said that to me on my Techonomy stage in 2016 two days after the  election, in which, by the way, I also asked him if Facebook had special  responsibilities because of its scale.  And he essentially demurred on  that.  </p><p> So, again, while I agree with what Farhad said, it is really notable how  much he has changed since then.  </p><p> FARHAD MANJOO:  I think David is right.</p><p> Mark Zuckerberg has changed in a way that I have been surprised by.  When  he started Facebook, the main sort of idea behind Facebook was that he  wanted to kind of connect the world.  Connecting the world, he argued, was  enough.  </p><p> And that was kind of the general feeling among others in the tech industry,  that just sort of building the technology, the technology itself would kind  of help people, would democratize the world.</p><p> And now the thing that Mark Zuckerberg talks about is not just connecting  people, but creating meaningful connections.  This is a -- meaningful is a  word he has been using more often lately.  And what that means exactly is  not clear.  </p><p> But they plan to change the Facebook news feed to address some of these  concerns, both the fake news concerns, but also this idea that Facebook may  be kind of putting us into echo chambers, kind of splintering much of our  dialogue.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  Well, Farhad, how much of this has to do with who is  designing the underlying technology in the first place?  </p><p> FARHAD MANJOO:  This is a big problem for them to solve.  </p><p> The big tech companies are all based on the West Coast of the United  States, several here in California and then a couple in Seattle.  Their  sort of work forces kind of look the same.  They are not very diverse.   They are not gender-diverse.  They don't have a lot of minorities.  They  are not kind of class-diverse or geographically diverse.  </p><p> And they are increasingly gatekeepers for information for not just the  United States, but the entire planet.  And so you really have this question  where there are a small number of people who are essentially homogeneous  kind of making decisions for the rest of the world.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  David Kirkpatrick, what is the likelihood, then, of  these technologists attacking the problems that are underlying this, the  diversity, the lack of transparency, and the ultimate consequences of the  tools that they build?  </p><p> DAVID KIRKPATRICK:  Well, I think there is no question that there is a  major shift under way in the mind-set of the Silicon Valley work force and  the leaders of these companies that they have to do that.  </p><p> However, as Farhad has written, and as I firmly believe, it is an extremely  challenging project to understand the true weight of these massively  important systems in our society, and how to actually more effectively  manage them.  </p><p> I mean, it is a question of governance, in effect.  And the reality is when  the public square is, in effect, dominated by commercial enterprises, who  should regulate that is entirely undetermined.  Clearly, these people are  starting to recognize, if they don't take actions that appear to be in the  public's benefit, they will become regulated by a government, both in the  United States and abroad.</p><p> And that process is happening much more in Europe already.  They want to  desperately avoid that.  On the other hand, the ideas aren't really even  there on their part as to what really could be done to properly regulate  the flow of information, given their fundamental goal of selling  advertising to make money on these services, because advertising  effectively requires eyeballs and attention. And they still are more in the mind-set of drawing attention than they are  of doing the right thing, in my opinion.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  All right, David Kirkpatrick of Techonomy, and Farhad  Manjoo of The New York Times, thank you both.  </p><p> FARHAD MANJOO:  Thanks.  Good to be here.  </p><p> DAVID KIRKPATRICK:  Thanks.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  Finally, in the latest addition to the \"NewsHour\"  Bookshelf, Jeffrey Brown examines the Wild West that was Miami Beach, where  cocaine cowboys played and died.  </p><p> JEFFREY BROWN:  Al Pacino's gangster snarl in the film \"Scarface,\" the oh- so-cool undercover detectives in \"Miami Vice,\" the popular culture images  of Miami in the 1980s, when cocaine drug lords helped make it the murder  capital of America.  </p><p> The real-life story is told in the new book \"Hotel Scarface.\"  Author Roben  Farzad is a business journalist, host of \"Full Disclosure\" on NPR One, and  occasional contributor to this program.</p><p> And it's nice to talk to you, Roben.  </p><p> ROBEN FARZAD, Author, \"Hotel Scarface\":  So nice to...</p><p> JEFFREY BROWN:  We usually talk about economics, but here we are.  Why this  subject?  Why did you want to go look at this story?  </p><p> ROBEN FARZAD:  My heart has been with this for -- in the 22 to 23 years  since I left Miami to go to college.  </p><p> When cocaine came to town, it was so ridiculously profitable, it was so  seductive, it made people do such crazy things in the name of money and  power and bloodlust, that you had something approximating a failed state by  1981 in Miami.  </p><p> JEFFREY BROWN:  The epicenter is this hotel.  It's -- you nickname it  Scarface Hotel, right?  But it's the Mutiny was the real place.  </p><p> ROBEN FARZAD:  That's right.  </p><p> It was called the Hotel Mutiny at Sailboat Bay.  And the first three floors  had a club, a private discotheque, a restaurant, a lounge, a tiki bar.  And  it was just infamous.  All the celebs who would come to Miami, Fleetwood  Mac, The Cars -- Crosby and Nash recorded a song about the place.  Neil  Young would be there.  </p><p> It was kind of the closest thing to Miami's Studio 54 at the turn of the  decade, 1979-1980, well before South Beach had arrived on kind of the  global hot spot scene.  </p><p> JEFFREY BROWN:  So, the celebrities were there, but it's the drug lords and  the gangsters, that's where a lot of the action is.  </p><p> ROBEN FARZAD:  It's the ecosystem of all that money that was there, money  and sex and cocaine and aspiration.  </p><p> In the case of the Cuban exiles who came to this country penniless, who  really wrested control of the cocaine trade by the late '70s, and didn't  mind being seen with the most gorgeous models and \"Playboy\" casting calls  and powerful housewives and Richard Nixon's friends, everybody largely left  everybody alone until all of Miami blew up.</p><p> JEFFREY BROWN:  So, your book is filled with all these colorful characters,  colorful, but violent characters.  </p><p> ROBEN FARZAD:  Sure.</p><p> JEFFREY BROWN:  Pick one.  Tell -- just to give us an example of somebody  that kind of grabbed you.  </p><p> ROBEN FARZAD:  I, like many people in Miami, am haunted by the specter of  one Ricardo \"Monkey\" Morales.  Monkey was his nickname.  </p><p> This was a guy who worked for Fidel Castro, became disillusioned with the  violence and the revolutionary cause, was ostensibly flipped by the CIA,  brought to Miami in the anti-Castro cause, and was really raring for a  rematch.</p><p> And when we had the Bay of Pigs invasion, and that fell through, literally  all of exile Miami thought that it was fait accompli that Kennedy would  finish the job.  But then Kennedy didn't finish the job, and Kennedy dies,  and LBJ is looking at Vietnam ultimately.</p><p> And so you have all these orphaned people, all these bombers and  mercenaries and CIA-trained people, like Monkey Morales, who are kind of  rudderless for the '60s and '70s.  And, first, pot happens.</p><p> JEFFREY BROWN:  Yes.  </p><p> ROBEN FARZAD:  And it's child's play for them to move marijuana, because  the CIA trained them to know evasion on the coastline better than anybody  else.  </p><p> And then cocaine is multiples as profitable.  And even though Morales was  shot and killed at about Christmas of '82, his ghost lingers.  And I think  he is a metaphor for everything that went wrong between Cuba and the United  States.  </p><p> This was a person who was a romantic.  He read history books.  He quoted  \"Casablanca.\"  He cried whenever it came on.  But he also knew how to  strangle people.  He got away after shooting and killing several people.   He was an informant.  He hunted down Nazi fugitives, helped the Mossad. </p><p> I mean, imagine his LinkedIn profile.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> JEFFREY BROWN:  I was thinking, if I asked you about what surprises you  found along the way, I mean, maybe frame it in terms of those cultural  references I started with.  </p><p> Did they get it right when we look at \"Scarface\" or \"Miami Vice\"?  What did  they get right?  What did they exaggerate?  </p><p> ROBEN FARZAD:  What's shocking to me is, you can be meeting with ex-cons,  people who have spent, say, upwards of 25, 30 years in prison, and they  have now reintegrated back into Miami life.</p><p> And they're having an early bird dinner with you on Coral Way or somewhere  in Little Havana, and they're like, nine out of 10 times, you know, Tony  Montana is based on me.  The town rebelled against this entire concept of  \"Scarface\" coming there to film in '82 and '83.  They saw it as an affront  to the exile community, until it became this pop culture totem.  </p><p> And then everybody after the fact was like, it was based on me.  I had a  leopard.  No, it was based on me.  Look, his throne looked like mine.  </p><p> And I believe that he was a composite that Oliver Stone and De Palma saw at  this hotel.  </p><p> JEFFREY BROWN:  What ended it?  What brought this era to an end?  </p><p> ROBEN FARZAD:  It just became so violent by 1981.</p><p> It was fun and games in the sexy and swinging '70s, and people got along.   The Colombians came in with a shot across the bow in 1979, the Dadeland  Massacre.  And then once the Mariel boat crisis happened, and you had  120,000 refugees end up in South Florida, maybe 10,000 north of them  criminals, many violent criminals, it was every man for himself.</p><p> And that's when the Miami Police Department, the DEA, the FBI -- it became  a national security concern for Jimmy Carter and then Ronald Reagan in  morning in America.  I mean, after all, he deputized George Bush Sr. with  his South Florida drug task force.</p><p> So, when the feds got serious about it, I think all the fun and games and  the hyperbole of it was shut down.  But what's amazing to me is that it's  very much a story that still exists in Miami's psyche and the Pan-American  psyche, if you talk to people in Colombia and Panama and Venezuela.</p><p> JEFFREY BROWN:  Alright, the book is \"Hotel Scarface.\"</p><p> Roben Farzad, thanks very much.  </p><p> ROBEN FARZAD:  Thank you.  </p><p> HARI SREENIVASAN:  Author Roben Farzad shares more books explaining Miami  online.  It's on our Web site.</p><p> A clarification and follow-up to our tax story tonight, courtesy of the  national taxpayer advocate Nina Olson.</p><p> The IRS announced today taxpayers will only be able to deduct their  property taxes on the coming year on their 2017 returns if and only if  their 2018 taxes have been assessed by their local government.  If  taxpayers make payments on unassessed taxes, they will not be able to  deduct them.  </p><p> And that's the \"NewsHour\" for tonight.  </p><p> Tomorrow on the broadcast: the fight over Medicaid expansion in the state  of Maine, the voters against the governor.</p><p> For all of us at the \"PBS NewsHour,\" thank you.  We'll see you soon.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 NewsHour Productions, LLC.  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

JAMES BAKER, Maxwell F. Baker Foundation: The first thing that you do when you feel that problem is there, please don`t judge. Recognize that that person inside of that addiction is still your son or daughter or brother. And they have behaviors that they can`t control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HARI SREENIVASAN: And the year in technology. We review a turning point in our lives online and in social media.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FARHAD MANJOO, The New York Times: I think we got, justifiably, a lot less optimistic about tech, and a lot more worried about the implications of a few big tech companies kind of taking over much of the world.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and more on tonight`s \"PBS NewsHour.\"</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: A cold wave kept the nation`s Midwest and Northeast in the deep freeze today. Windchill warnings and advisories stretched from North Dakota to New Hampshire, as arctic winds dropped temperatures to 37 below zero in some places.</p><p>Officials warned of the risk of frostbite with less than 30 minutes of exposure, and they went on alert.</p><p>ED HASSAN, Boston EMS: Any time that we have an extreme in weather, be it cold or hot, it taxes the EMS system as a whole. Look for people who may need assistance maybe before they`re so bad off that they require an ambulance to go to the hospital. And they will get them services like a shelter, a detox, and things like that.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: As the cold set in, Erie, Pennsylvania, declared a state of emergency, with a record 65 inches of snow. More snow was falling today.</p><p>In Syria, critically ill patients are finally being evacuated from a rebel- held area near Damascus. Hundreds of sick people in eastern Ghouta have been unable to get treatment at area hospitals. But now government troops are letting aid groups evacuate nearly 30 critically ill patients. In return, the rebels want a like number of captive fighters released.</p><p>Also today, Russia declared the main battle with the Islamic State in Syria is now over. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Syrian army and its allies must turn their focus to hunting down the Nusra Front group, linked to al-Qaida.</p><p>Russian leader Vladimir Putin has officially registered to run for his fourth term as president. In Moscow today, Putin handed in his papers in person to the nation`s election commission. Early polls show he`s likely to be reelected in the March vote. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny is urging a boycott of the election after he was banned from running.</p><p>Today, he called for nationwide protests next month.</p><p>ALEXEI NAVALNY, Russian Opposition Leader (through translator): Let`s come out to the street for yourselves, for your rights, for your future, for the fact that we do not want to lose another six years. We will start a big campaign on one hand to persuade everyone to participate in the boycott and not to take part in the election, and on the other hand to count how many people really come to the polling stations, and not let Putin fabricate that number.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Putin is 65 years old and has already led Russia as prime minister and now president for a total of 18 years.</p><p>Former President Obama is urging leaders to be careful in their online statements. He spoke with Britain`s Prince Harry in an interview that aired today on the BBC. The former president didn`t directly mention President Trump, but he did voice concern about social media`s effect on politics.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, Former President of the United States: All of us in leadership have to find ways in which we can recreate a common space on the Internet.</p><p>One of the dangers of the Internet is, is that people can have entirely different realities. They can be just cocooned in information that reinforces their current biases.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Mr. Obama also said he considers the Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, one of his greatest achievements.</p><p>The Library of Congress says it will no longer archive every public tweet, including the president`s. Instead, starting in the new year, it will be more selective. The library cites the growing volume in tweets and the increase in characters from 140 to 280. The National Archives keeps all presidential tweets, and will continue to do so.</p><p>And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 28 points to close at 24774. The Nasdaq rose three points, and the S&amp;P 500 added two.</p><p>Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": should you pay your property taxes early? -- we look at the pros and cons under the new tax law; a nation divided, a review of the year in politics from the right and the left; America Addicted, a doctor`s personal loss to opioids; and much more.</p><p>The new tax laws are set to take effect on Monday.</p><p>Given that the president and Republicans in Congress just passed and signed the legislation days ago, some taxpayers are scrambling to try to squeeze in deductions, some for next year, before 2017 ends.</p><p>That`s especially true in a number of municipalities, where people are standing in line to prepay their property taxes for 2018.</p><p>Let`s look at what you need to know, and begin with this field report by Brenda Flanagan of New Jersey public television.</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>BRENDA FLANAGAN: While Republicans celebrated and called their tax bill historic, homeowners panicked and called their accountants in high- property-tax states like New York, California and New Jersey.</p><p>GAIL ROSEN, CPA: Phones and e-mails have been going off crazy, because a lot of people are hearing about the real estate tax deduction, hearing about all the changes, and wanting to know what to do.</p><p>BRENDA FLANAGAN: That`s because, in 2018, the Republican bill will cap property tax deductions at $10,000. But in Jersey, average property taxes exceed $10,000 in four counties. In fact, homeowners here pay the highest property taxes in the nation, more than $8,500, on average.</p><p>WAYNE DEFEO, New Jersey: Anyone in New Jersey, that`s got to be scary.</p><p>BRENDA FLANAGAN: So, many homeowners, like Wayne DeFeo, are meeting with CPAs, looking to prepay next year`s property taxes, to take advantage of the full deduction before it expires. It`s kind of a loophole.</p><p>WAYNE DEFEO: If I could prepay half of my property taxes for next year, to take advantage of it this tax year, based on what my accountant`s told me, is I would save almost $1,000. And that goes to my pocket.</p><p>GAIL ROSEN: It`s up to each and every taxpayer to make a decision how comfortable they feel paying real estate taxes in advance. But you should look at it. Everyone should look at it, because it`s a one-time opportunity by December 31. It`s a lot of money to leave on the table.</p><p>BRENDA FLANAGAN: How much? Say you`re single, with no kids, making $75,000. Your property taxes are $20,000. We figured that, for 2017, you will owe the IRS about $8,500. But prepaying the first two-quarters of your 2018 property taxes could knock that IRS bill down to about $6,000. You would save almost $2,500.</p><p>But accountants advise it won`t work for everyone.</p><p>DAN CONNOLLY, CPA: For people that make more than $200,000, they`re caught up in Alternate Minimum tax, which basically disallows income and real estate taxes to get you back to a minimum level.</p><p>BRENDA FLANAGAN: CPA Dan Connolly also warns some people may be tempted to borrow money to make those prepayments.</p><p>DAN CONNOLLY: Some people are going on credit lines to pay for them, and then they`re going to have to pay interest on the money that they borrow to prepay the tax. So the calculation is not that simple.</p><p>BRENDA FLANAGAN: Regardless, municipalities from Elizabeth to Alpine, and here in the shore town of Belmar report residents are showing up with checkbooks to prepay at least the first two quarters of next year`s property taxes.</p><p>MATT DOHERTY, Mayor of Belmar, New Jersey: We`re walking them through the process of prepayment. We have our staff ready to accept those prepayments, process them properly, make sure it`s all documented for anyone who comes in, so they`re able to take advantage of the deduction this year in 2017.</p><p>BRENDA FLANAGAN: Mayor Matt Doherty`s prepaying his taxes. But besides working the loophole, lawmakers in several states are also looking for other ways to soften the blow.</p><p>Here in Jersey, one bill would increase property tax deductions for homeowners. But it`d cost the state $170 million in revenues.</p><p>RAY LESNIAK (D), New Jersey State Senator: Well, the bill would allow full deductibility of homeowners` property taxes on their state income taxes. And that will cut in half for most people the hit they`re going to get by the Trump bill, which doesn`t allow deductibility for property taxes over $10,000.</p><p>BRENDA FLANAGAN: For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Brenda Flanagan, reporting from Elizabeth, New Jersey.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Some more questions and perspective about the changes to the tax code and end-of-the-year decision on property tax deductions.</p><p>Mark Steber is a CPA and chief tax officer for Jackson Hewitt Tax Service.</p><p>So, Mark, what are some of the factors that should go into figuring out whether you should make these payments now vs. later?</p><p>MARK STEBER, Jackson Hewitt Tax Service: Well, your piece was excellent and spot on with several of the observations from some of your professionals.</p><p>Basically, don`t think that one size fits all on this opportunity. It certainly works where it works, but where it doesn`t, it can have the benefit of biting you pretty badly on the back end.</p><p>So the two things that I`m telling folks on this property tax acceleration idea is, one, make sure you have the money. Borrowing money to do a tax planning idea that might change even after the 1st of the year, not my best advice.</p><p>And the second thing is watch out for that Alternative Minimum Tax. Your other featured speaker said that these taxes are not deductible when you go in and compute that, as are not mortgage interest and a whole host of other items that you do to calculate Alt Min that.</p><p>So if you make this accelerated deduction, throws you into Alternative Minimum Tax, and you don`t get a benefit, all might have been for naught.</p><p>So, have the cash. Watch out for Alt Min, but, most importantly, what we are telling our clients at Jackson Hewitt is consult with your tax adviser. Only they know your facts and circumstances and what to watch for and what your tax profile will look like for 2017 and for 2018, even given the new limitation on the property taxes.</p><p>There is a lot to look at, and you certainly don`t want to run afoul of a benefit that you might need next year, even if you are in a high property tax area.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the things we have heard is that this is going to affect states like California and New Jersey, but this isn`t a blue state/red state thing, is it?</p><p>MARK STEBER: No, it`s not, and that is really kind of a mischaracterization.</p><p>Those states that you name certainly do have high property taxes, but I`m from Florida and I have friends in all the different states in the country, and many of them have high property tax locations. So it`s really for anybody who has high property taxes. They should look at this.</p><p>But they should also look at their other factors as well. But this is not solely a New Jersey issue or a California issue or a New York issue. It`s a whoever has property taxes more than $10,000, the new limit, that is where this is kind of applicable, because that is where you are going to get capped out in 2018.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: What about the possibility that Congress could move forward to try to close this loophole retroactively, saying that everybody that went out of their way to stand in line and pay these now might not actually see the benefit?</p><p>MARK STEBER: Well, that is certainly a possibility, with the corrections bill that will come in after the fact to tweak up some of the areas that were not absolutely looked at in totality when they passed the law.</p><p>But I really wouldn`t worry too much about a retroactive change, unless there is a great deal of abuse. And I think once folks take a look at this and see what some of the risks are, what some of the costs are, I don`t see this really being an overwhelming opportunity for folks to take advantage of.</p><p>It is a lot of money up front for a tax benefit arguably in 2019, when do you your taxes. You really have to have a compelling set of facts and circumstances to do that. And some will do it, and it will make sense, but most people are taking a cautious look at the idea.</p><p>But where it makes sense, it makes sense. But it`s not for everybody.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Mark Steber of Jackson Hewitt, thanks so much.</p><p>MARK STEBER: Thank you.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Taxes were just one of the top political stories of 2017.</p><p>John Yang now takes a deeper look at President Trump`s first year and what`s in store for 2018 from two different perspectives.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Hari, we are joined Karine Jean-Pierre, who is a senior adviser to MoveOn.org a and contributing editor to the online women`s magazine \"Bustle.\" She also served in the Obama White House. And from Phoenix, Chris Buskirk is a radio host out there and editor of the conservative blog AmericanGreatness.org.</p><p>Chris, Karine, thanks for being with us.</p><p>Chris, I want to start with you.</p><p>You talk to folks out there on your radio show every day. As we end the year, what is the -- sort of the state of the Trump base, of Trump supporters out there now?</p><p>CHRIS BUSKIRK, AmericanGreatness.org: Well, a lot happier than I think folks were maybe even two, three weeks ago.</p><p>I think the fact that the tax bill passed was a welcome balm at the end of the year. And there are two elements of that. One is that people generally supported the tax bill. They think it was good policy. And that`s a big part of it.</p><p>The other part is just seeing a Republican Congress, for whom so many Trump voters had very, very high hopes at the beginning of this year, and seeing that Congress actually do something.</p><p>You know, I called it a do-nothing Congress for months and months and months, primarily because it was a do-nothing Congress. But they did something. And I think it was good policy from our perspective. And as we are wrapping up the year here, the Trump voters are looking and saying, you know what, the president did a lot of things he promised to, and now we are actually seeing Congress get on board too.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Chris, I want to continue with you.</p><p>As you pointed out, there was a lot of unhappiness about Congress. People were still supporting the president and they were blaming Congress for inaction. Has this solved all that? And, also, has the gap between the president`s supporters and, for a lack of a better term, the elected officials in Washington, the Speaker Ryans, the Leader McConnells, has that been healed over by this?</p><p>CHRIS BUSKIRK: You know, I don`t know if it healed over, but it`s a good start.</p><p>I guess I would put it that way. There has been a sort of changing of the guard going on, on the American right among conservatives over the past year or two or even three, I guess, if we go back to 2015. And is everything brushed under the carpet? No.</p><p>But you know what? That is OK. What is important here, from my perspective, I think from a lot of people`s perspective on the right, is that different factions within the Republican Party are figuring out, number one, that they need to work together, and, number two, how to do it.</p><p>And so, as we go into 2018, that is a reason for people on the right to have some optimism.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Karine, conversely, what is sort of the state of the loyal opposition at the end of the year?</p><p>KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, Democratic Strategist: Yes, conversely, indeed.</p><p>Look, I think that Republicans passed an unpopular bill, now that they have to go into 2018 trying to sell it. Not only that. They have a president that is historically unpopular. The Republican Congress is unpopular. So they are facing potentially a blue wave next year from the Democrats.</p><p>And I just don`t understand how they even think this is a good thing, when you see the polling after polling that says people hate the GOP tax plan, and also the intensity. There is an intensity on the Democratic side that we have not seen in a long time. They are unified, they are energized.</p><p>Democrats won a Senate seat in a ruby-red state of Alabama. That is unheard of. People would say we had no business even going into that state and trying to fight and win that race. And so I think that Republicans have a tough fight against them -- ahead of them in 2018. And I just don`t see how they even stop that.</p><p>Unifying right now doesn`t even make sense either, because they have an unpopular president. Congress is unpopular. And let`s not forget there is DACA that needs to be taken care of. There is CHIP that needs to be reauthorized, both bipartisan policies, programs that are popular.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Chris, what about that?</p><p>The Democrats -- there is a lot of talk about whether the Democrats have -- there is an enthusiasm gap with the Democrats, that they are more enthusiastic, more fired up going into 2018, going into the midterms. What about that?</p><p>CHRIS BUSKIRK: Well, there is something to it. There really is.</p><p>And I think this is going to be a hard-fought election year. There is no doubt about it. Look, there is something about being opposition that tends to galvanize the people who are in the opposition.</p><p>Republicans just had eight years of it and I think, by a lot of measures were more successful -- as the old mantra goes, the Republicans were the party of no. Republicans were pretty -- got pretty good at being the party of no during the Obama years, and because there is something that brings people together when you think that you are -- or actually are in the reality in the minority in Congress.</p><p>So, as we look at the elections coming up next year, yes, Republicans do need to figure how to, number one, stick together, and, number two, how to make the case.</p><p>I am happy to make the case that says, look, we have a booming stock market, we have got low unemployment, we have got a tax bill that allows people to keep more of what they earn. We have got more or less peace abroad, and make that case to the American people in 2018. But you know what? You have to make the case. And that is going to be the challenge for Republican candidates all over the country next year, because there is a lot of enthusiasm on the left. And so I say, let`s have at it.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Karine, that is the -- making a case for the Republicans in 2018.</p><p>For the Democrats, do they have to say -- I mean, what is the better politics for them, to stand and say no to the president, to be the opposition, literally the opposition, or do they look to work with him on the issues you talked about, DACA, the dreamers, the children`s health insurance, infrastructure?</p><p>KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Right.</p><p>So what I say to DACA and CHIP is that, look, it is a bipartisan support -- has bipartisan support, is very popular with the public. So it should be able to be fixed easily. It`s not very difficult.</p><p>And not only that. Republicans control all three branches, so they should be able to do that. And if they don`t, it`s not the Democrats` fault. It is the Republicans` fault. So, that is that point there.</p><p>But I do agree that Democrats need to not just be anti-Trump. They need to also offer something as well, which is, OK, let`s lift minimum wage. Let`s fight on that. Let`s make sure we expand Medicare, expand Medicaid, expand Social Security. Let`s be about something, not just anti-Trump.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Chris, are there places where the Republicans can work with the Democrats in the next year before the elections?</p><p>CHRIS BUSKIRK: Yes, I will tell you what. This is a place that I`m really interested in.</p><p>I think there are two big areas where Republicans and Democrats hopefully will be able to find some common ground and come together. Number one is infrastructure. This is something that has been talked about by people like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi for a long time. It`s also something that has been talked about by <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>where he actively on the campaign trail was talking about a big infrastructure bill.</p><p>I think that would be more than appropriate, more than welcome in 2018. I would hope there would be some consensus on that. And the other part is -- and this really is big picture, but I think it`s important, and that is returning the power to legislate, to make laws back to Congress.</p><p>I think Congress needs to take some of that power back from the executive branch. I think altogether too much lawmaking power resides in the agencies and the departments of the executive branch. And this, I think, particularly now with Trump in the White House, this might be a time when Democrats and Republicans in Congress can say, you know what, we need to go back to doing the job the Constitution gives us, which is being the legislature, being the one that makes the laws.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Chris Buskirk, Karine Jean-Pierre, thanks for being with us.</p><p>CHRIS BUSKIRK: Thanks.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.</p><p>Coming up on the \"NewsHour\": a treatment to eliminate a female medical problem and, with it, a cultural taboo; the year in tech, when social media companies came under scrutiny; and from the \"NewsHour\" Bookshelf, the real- life story of the infamous Miami drug war.</p><p>But, first, we continue our second look at a special series America Addicted on the opioid crisis and its enormous toll.</p><p>Tonight, the story of a doctor who suffered a devastating personal loss to opioids exactly one year ago, but now he`s doing everything he can to keep other families from suffering the same fate.</p><p>Miles O`Brien reports that, at the same time, he`s also concerned about a backlash where some patients can`t get the pain treatment they need.</p><p>This is part of our weekly Leading Edge science series.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: Spend the day with physician Jim Baker, and you will understand America`s opioid crisis in a uniquely professional and personal way.</p><p>He lives in Holden, Massachusetts, a Norman Rockwell town just north of Worcester. Idyllic as it seems, there is death all around.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER, Maxwell F. Baker Foundation: In that time it took us to go around this block, of a minute, including my house right there, four deaths and one person in recovery. And so this is Holden.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: Less than a year ago, death by overdose came to his family. He lost his son Max, or Macky, as his family called him. He was 23.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: Macky was a sensitive, caring, warm, brilliant young man. He was so smart, it was scary.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: He always enjoyed music?</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: Yes. He started playing seriously when he was about 10, and he would play every day, multiple times a day.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: And because he was the drummer, the band played here. Jim Baker can remember the night things changed.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: I was up in this room. They did the first half of their set, which was clear and strong music. Then they took a break. When they came back, they were -- the timing was off. The changes weren`t right. I thought, what happened?</p><p>I found out later that they had got a hold of pills. And within a year, he had moved on to heroin. How that happened, I still don`t know.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: And so began a downward spiral. He was flunking out of school, losing friends and his music deteriorated.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: He had the deepest desire to stop. He knew -- he said, \"If I don`t stop, it`s going to kill me.\" But he couldn`t do it on his own, and I couldn`t find treatment.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: He was trying to find a fellow doctor willing and able to give Macky treatment with Suboxone, a combination of two drugs. One answers an addict`s craving for opioids. The other blocks the high. But precious few doctors provide the treatment.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: The sad truth is, they say, I don`t want those patients in my office or, in more private conversation, it takes too much time, I don`t want to deal with it.</p><p>I have heard people say, our group talked about it. We voted against it. There is no reimbursement.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: Jim Baker spent many years as an emergency room doctor, and now works for hospice. He makes house calls to people who need opioids to manage their pain.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: Today, he is checking in on Bob Hopwood (ph).</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: Do you feel like, when you use it, if you just had a little bit more, it would help you?</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: He works hard to insure his terminally ill patients avoid unneeded suffering with pain.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: Physicians are overtuned to this. And What`s happening now is, physicians are responding by saying, I am writing for fewer opioids. I don`t write for opioids anymore.</p><p>And it is having a negative effect for people who have real pain and who need relief. Now they can`t find it. The pendulum has definitely swung back too far, and now people who really have pain cannot find relief.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: But he understands all too well the crisis that has caused this overreaction.</p><p>As his son`s journey into the darkness of addiction worsened, Jim Baker felt he had no choice. He told Macky to leave the house, which prompted this letter.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: I said: \"Macky, you can call me anytime, 24 hours a day no matter where I am. I will help however I can. Just stay with it. I love you so much. Dad.\"</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: He did stay with it. He finally found treatment, and he got off the heroin.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: He was able to maintain sobriety for two years or so, and he was doing great. He was in college. He had fallen in love.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: He and Emma were planning on getting married, a storybook ending. It seemed like he had beaten the odds. And then, Thanksgiving last year, a horrible twist of fate.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: It was late at night and coming down this road. His impact was right here, boom. A young girl, we guess, just didn`t see him coming because of a bush or a house there. He fractured and deformed his right hand, his drumming hand, his writing hand. And he was bruised up in his chest and his face. And he was beat up pretty good.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: As he went into surgery, Macky told the anesthesiologist not to give him opioids.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: But I found out later, she was injecting him with fentanyl. And when he came out of the operating room, the first thing he said with glazed eyes is, \"I need drugs.\"</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: Addicted once again.</p><p>A month later, he got the call he had been dreading for years.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: This is the road I was driving to when his brother called me and said, \"Dad, Macky is unconscious.\"</p><p>And I was coming up here hoping and hoping, please, Macky, please. Couldn`t get the door open. And I`m asking him, is he breathing? Is he responding? And the answers were really scary.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: He was gone. One of 33,000 Americans who die each year because of an opioid overdose.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: So, we`re coming up upon a cemetery. The field right above that is where he learned to play tee-ball.</p><p>Hey, Macky, dad is here. Just want to tell you, I love you, pal. We`re going to keep on fighting,</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: On this night, they gathered at a health club in Holden. They pedaled hard to raise money for the Max Baker Foundation, and they heard Jim Baker`s talk, poignant and practical.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: My goal is to have everyone here know more about opioids than they did when they came through the door.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: He told a rapt audience what to look for, slurred speech, pinpoint pupils and long-sleeve shirts.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: The first thing that you do when you feel that problem is there, please don`t judge. Recognize that that person inside of that addiction is still your son or daughter or brother. And they have behaviors that they can`t control.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: He told them to get Narcan, an over-the-counter drug that can instantly counteract an overdose.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: It`s one of the few miracle drugs I have ever seen. A person is blue, not breathing, dusky, even cool, dying, and get Narcan in, and, three, two, one, they sit up and go, what, what? Where am I?</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: And he told them to get a sledgehammer.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: And if I hear a funny sound in the bathroom, or a thud, and knock, knock, knock, and there is no answer in there, I`m going to pick this up and I`m going to whack that door handle, and then I`m going to whack that hinge. I`m going to bust down that door and get in.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: This is Jim Baker`s mission, his way of channeling profound grief.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER: I feel like, what would it mean to me had someone who was suffering done what it took, done what was necessary to help Macky?</p><p>And I would be forever -- and I can`t really talk about it, but the most meaningful thing I could ever ask of someone. But it`s now my turn to do it for somebody else, and I know that`s what he`d want me to do.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: Max Baker is no longer with us, but his father is spending his days hoping to make sure his son`s life has enduring purpose.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Miles O`Brien in Holden, Massachusetts.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Tomorrow, a report on the impact opioid addiction is having on the American workplace.</p><p>Find all of our stories from the series online at PBS.org/NewsHour.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Next: one effort to address a humiliating medical injury that afflicts perhaps one million women in the developing world who lack access to safe medical facilities.</p><p>Fred de Sam Lazaro reports from Kenya. It`s part of his Agents for Change series.</p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In a new hospital in Eldoret, Kenya, these women are awaiting surgery to fix a condition that`s widely misunderstood and reviled, one that`s made them outcasts, often in their own families.</p><p>It`s called obstetric fistula, an injury to the birth canal caused, in most cases, by prolonged labor that leaves a woman incontinent. Perhaps one million women in the developing world suffer from fistulas, a condition virtually wiped out in industrialized nations with better access to prenatal care and medical facilities.</p><p>At least once a week, these patients hear a message of hope from a woman who knows all too well their suffering; 41-year-old Sarah Omega was just 19 when she was raped and became pregnant.</p><p>SARAH OMEGA, Fistula Survivor: I was so scared. I didn`t want to secure an abortion because of my faith, yes, so I kept the pregnancy.</p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Omega eventually spent 38 hours in a difficult labor, much of it at home. In the process, the baby died, and she suffered a large fistula. For 12 years, Omega says she was subjected to isolation and shame.</p><p>SARAH OMEGA: I attempted suicide twice. Every night, I would go to bed. I would say, God, please don`t allow me to see tomorrow, because my tomorrow, every day, I would wake up in the morning, see the sun, I would cry because I knew it was another day of pain, of humiliation, of suffering in isolation.</p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That anguish landed her in a psychiatric ward, and it was there that a visiting doctor came to her bedside.</p><p>SARAH OMEGA: He assured me that my problem was going to be fixed. And I remember that day he told me: \"I`m seeing a lot of hope in you. I want you to get healed.\"</p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That doctor was 49-year-old Hillary Mabeya, a gynecologist and surgeon who has devoted his entire practice to women with fistulas.</p><p>This 88-bed hospital was built for his use, as part of a broad campaign by the California-based Fistula Foundation.</p><p>DR. HILLARY MABEYA, Gynocare Fistula Center: These are patients who need care, they need support, and they need a lot of counseling. They suffer so much from society because of their condition.</p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It`s difficult to pinpoint how many women suffer from fistula in this country, in part because most of them are kept isolated by their communities and even their families.</p><p>But in recent years, since the campaign began to raise awareness of fistula, awareness that it is treatable, some 7,000 women have emerged from hiding each year seeking surgery.</p><p>Fistula awareness groups have taken to the streets to educate others about the condition, and where to get help. We watched as these women, many of them survivors themselves, fanned out through the Western city of Mumias, and encouraged women suffering from incontinence issues to get free screening offered by the campaign.</p><p>Organizer Habiba Mohamed said people still have many misconceptions about fistula.</p><p>HABIBA MOHAMED, Community Organizer: Maybe she has been bewitched. Maybe she was promiscuous and had a relationship outside marriage when she was pregnant.</p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Mohamed`s group, WADADIA, recently arranged the transportation and treatment for 35-year-old Rachel Juma Wasamba, who lives in a remote village in Western Kenya.</p><p>Wasamba was lucky. Her husband stayed with her throughout her condition and treatment. Many husbands abandon their wives in such situations. Amina Mushele says that`s what happened to her.</p><p>AMINA MUSHELE, Fistula Survivor (through translator): My husband couldn`t take it anymore, so he left me to marry another woman.</p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She had surgery one year ago, and now makes and sells goods in the town marketplace, using skills she got from a training program sponsored by WADADIA. The training, ranging from hairstyling, to seamstress work, and computer skills, helps reintegrate women back into their community.</p><p>HABIBA MOHAMED: The moment someone has been treated, and she has healed, you can be able to see a significant change in her life, and not only in her life, in her family, in her children. So, it has a ripple effect to an entire family and the entire community.</p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Back in Eldoret, Dr. Mabeya is kept very busy at one of the few places where fistula surgery is performed and offered free of charge.</p><p>Working six days a week, he operates on 45 women a month. Since that`s just a fraction of the new cases, he is also training other doctors in the region, and he is working to prevent fistulas in the first place.</p><p>DR. HILLARY MABEYA: Fistula is almost 100 percent preventable. In developed countries, it`s not even there.</p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He says fistula can be avoided if adequate prenatal and emergency care is made available when complications arise during pregnancy. More than half of all Kenyan women still deliver their babies at home.</p><p>For her part, Sarah Omega says her healing became complete when she able to give birth to a health baby daughter, Jade, who recently turned two.</p><p>SARAH OMEGA: She means just the whole world to me. I remember at some point, I would pray and say, God, if you give me a baby, that baby will erase the pain I have gone through in this life.</p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And Omega continues to help other women erase the pain of fistula.</p><p>SARAH OMEGA: I decided to change the pain I had gone through into something beautiful, something that will help me reach out to other women, something that will allow other women to live a normal life like me.</p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She travels frequently to talk about her experiences, but, more regularly, her advocacy happens at the bedside of women at the new fistula hospital.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Fred de Sam Lazaro in Eldoret, Kenya.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Fred`s reporting is a partnership with the Under-Told Stories Project at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota.</p><p>Technology has traditionally been seen by the public and many in the media in a more hopeful light.</p><p>But 2017 felt different, a year that frequently cast technology, and its unintended consequences, in a much harsher light.</p><p>In a moment, we will have a conversation that I recorded last week in New York, but, first, a quick reminder about some of the major problems this year.</p><p>Russia used Facebook and social media to try and influence the 2016 elections. The revelations reverberated throughout the nation`s capital this year.</p><p>As congressional committees detailed, Russian operatives bought ads that sought to capitalize on racial, religious and political divisions in the U.S. Just 120 fake accounts posted on Facebook 80,000 times and reached as many as 126 million Americans.</p><p>Facebook`s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, initially doubted that the platform could have influenced the election, but later pledged to make political advertising more transparent.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, Founder, Facebook: Not only will you have to disclose which page paid for an ad, but we will also make it so you can visit an advertiser`s page and see the ads that they`re currently running to any audience on Facebook.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Members of both parties were angry at the company`s slow admission, but the focus grew beyond just one company to other tech giants, since Russian agents used Twitter, Google and YouTube too.</p><p>The Senate Intelligence Committee grilled top lawyers for the companies.</p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER (D), Virginia: Many of us on this committee have been raising this issue since the beginning of this year. And our claims were, frankly, blown off by the leaderships of your companies, dismissed, so there`s no possibility nothing like this happening, nothing to see here.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Hacking, a perennial problem, took on new urgency this past year.</p><p>The ransomware cyber-attack called WannaCry temporarily crippled computer systems in hospitals, banks and companies around the world. More than 230,000 computers in 150 countries were affected. Just a week ago, the Trump administration named the country it says was responsible.</p><p>TOM BOSSERT, White House Homeland Security Adviser: After careful investigation, the United States is publicly attributing the massive WannaCry cyber-attack to North Korea. We do not make this allegation lightly. We do so with evidence, and we do so with partners.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Hackers also tore into Equifax, one of the largest credit bureaus, stealing the personal information of more than 145 million people. They got Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and driver`s licenses.</p><p>The tech industry faced a new conversation on inequality by race and gender.</p><p>Susan Fowler, a former engineer at Uber, published a damning account of a harassment-filled workplace culture. Uber fired 20 employees and it eventually helped lead to the CEO`s resignation.</p><p>She told \"TIME\" she was amazed by the reaction to her essay.</p><p>SUSAN FOWLER, Former Uber Engineer: I expected it would be like a 24-hour, like, viral thing, but it didn`t slow down at all. And I was reading through all of these things. And I thought like, oh, my gosh, like, I`m not alone.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Others, like Ellen Pao, who filed and lost a gender discrimination case against a powerful venture capital firm, said change was needed.</p><p>ELLEN PAO, Tech Investor: Well, I think if playing along means participating in sexist and racist jokes, that expectation has to change.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: The year ended with a divisive decision by the FCC that many fear will lead to the end of net neutrality, the idea of treating all content on the Web equally without charging more or blocking your ability to see other content.</p><p>For a closer look at the potential turning point that 2017 is shaping up to be for the most well-known tech giants, I`m joined by two people who follow that world closely. Farhad Manjoo is a New York Times columnist who writes on how technology is changing society and business. And David Kirkpatrick is the founder of Techonomy. He`s a technology journalist and author of \"The Facebook Effect.\"</p><p>Thank you both for joining us.</p><p>So, Farhad, let me start with you.</p><p>How did tech shift in our perception this year?</p><p>FARHAD MANJOO, The New York Times: Yes, I think we got, justifiably, a lot less optimistic about tech, and a lot more worried about the implications of a few big tech companies kind of taking over much of the world, much of our communications, much of how we kind of learn and experience the world, all of our personal information.</p><p>And I think the tech companies responded to that. They started to notice. I mean, after the questions about the Russia hack, after questions about sexual harassment, they started to respond to these criticisms.</p><p>And I think the key change they made was a lot of these -- a lot of the big tech companies started, at first grudgingly and then more willingly, I think, they started to accept that they have some responsibility to the rest of the world, that their technologies aren`t necessarily kind of neutral platforms, and that they have some responsibility to kind of police what happens there.</p><p>How that plays out, I think, will be the big question of 2018. But this year, I think that the big change is that, in the past, technology companies sort of thought of themselves as kind of neutral. And I think that started to change. They are less neutral now.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: But, David Kirkpatrick, what happened to make Silicon Valley less the sort of darling of, well, Washington, D.C., as well as Wall Street?</p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK, Founder, Techonomy: Well, if there is one single thing that changed the situation, I would say it`s Russian fake news affecting the election, in the opinion of -- and the desire of Russia to alter our electoral process, and using Facebook and Google, but Facebook in particular, as a key means of doing that.</p><p>And I think what that concern at a national level did was draw attention to the extraordinary social, cultural and informational weight of these companies, and then caused a lot of people to start asking bigger questions about what it meant that these very small number of tech giants have had such a monumental impact on our social dialogue and have, in effect, become the central platform for social dialogue, and increasingly in many ways for political behavior as well.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Mark Zuckerberg famously said it is a crazy idea that they would have had any impact on the U.S. elections.</p><p>And then, since then, he`s made several statements that walked that back.</p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK: Right.</p><p>He said that to me on my Techonomy stage in 2016 two days after the election, in which, by the way, I also asked him if Facebook had special responsibilities because of its scale. And he essentially demurred on that.</p><p>So, again, while I agree with what Farhad said, it is really notable how much he has changed since then.</p><p>FARHAD MANJOO: I think David is right.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg has changed in a way that I have been surprised by. When he started Facebook, the main sort of idea behind Facebook was that he wanted to kind of connect the world. Connecting the world, he argued, was enough.</p><p>And that was kind of the general feeling among others in the tech industry, that just sort of building the technology, the technology itself would kind of help people, would democratize the world.</p><p>And now the thing that Mark Zuckerberg talks about is not just connecting people, but creating meaningful connections. This is a -- meaningful is a word he has been using more often lately. And what that means exactly is not clear.</p><p>But they plan to change the Facebook news feed to address some of these concerns, both the fake news concerns, but also this idea that Facebook may be kind of putting us into echo chambers, kind of splintering much of our dialogue.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Well, Farhad, how much of this has to do with who is designing the underlying technology in the first place?</p><p>FARHAD MANJOO: This is a big problem for them to solve.</p><p>The big tech companies are all based on the West Coast of the United States, several here in California and then a couple in Seattle. Their sort of work forces kind of look the same. They are not very diverse. They are not gender-diverse. They don`t have a lot of minorities. They are not kind of class-diverse or geographically diverse.</p><p>And they are increasingly gatekeepers for information for not just the United States, but the entire planet. And so you really have this question where there are a small number of people who are essentially homogeneous kind of making decisions for the rest of the world.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: David Kirkpatrick, what is the likelihood, then, of these technologists attacking the problems that are underlying this, the diversity, the lack of transparency, and the ultimate consequences of the tools that they build?</p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK: Well, I think there is no question that there is a major shift under way in the mind-set of the Silicon Valley work force and the leaders of these companies that they have to do that.</p><p>However, as Farhad has written, and as I firmly believe, it is an extremely challenging project to understand the true weight of these massively important systems in our society, and how to actually more effectively manage them.</p><p>I mean, it is a question of governance, in effect. And the reality is when the public square is, in effect, dominated by commercial enterprises, who should regulate that is entirely undetermined. Clearly, these people are starting to recognize, if they don`t take actions that appear to be in the public`s benefit, they will become regulated by a government, both in the United States and abroad.</p><p>And that process is happening much more in Europe already. They want to desperately avoid that. On the other hand, the ideas aren`t really even there on their part as to what really could be done to properly regulate the flow of information, given their fundamental goal of selling advertising to make money on these services, because advertising effectively requires eyeballs and attention. And they still are more in the mind-set of drawing attention than they are of doing the right thing, in my opinion.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, David Kirkpatrick of Techonomy, and Farhad Manjoo of The New York Times, thank you both.</p><p>FARHAD MANJOO: Thanks. Good to be here.</p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK: Thanks.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally, in the latest addition to the \"NewsHour\" Bookshelf, Jeffrey Brown examines the Wild West that was Miami Beach, where cocaine cowboys played and died.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Al Pacino`s gangster snarl in the film \"Scarface,\" the oh- so-cool undercover detectives in \"Miami Vice,\" the popular culture images of Miami in the 1980s, when cocaine drug lords helped make it the murder capital of America.</p><p>The real-life story is told in the new book \"Hotel Scarface.\" Author Roben Farzad is a business journalist, host of \"Full Disclosure\" on NPR One, and occasional contributor to this program.</p><p>And it`s nice to talk to you, Roben.</p><p>ROBEN FARZAD, Author, \"Hotel Scarface\": So nice to...</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: We usually talk about economics, but here we are. Why this subject? Why did you want to go look at this story?</p><p>ROBEN FARZAD: My heart has been with this for -- in the 22 to 23 years since I left Miami to go to college.</p><p>When cocaine came to town, it was so ridiculously profitable, it was so seductive, it made people do such crazy things in the name of money and power and bloodlust, that you had something approximating a failed state by 1981 in Miami.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: The epicenter is this hotel. It`s -- you nickname it Scarface Hotel, right? But it`s the Mutiny was the real place.</p><p>ROBEN FARZAD: That`s right.</p><p>It was called the Hotel Mutiny at Sailboat Bay. And the first three floors had a club, a private discotheque, a restaurant, a lounge, a tiki bar. And it was just infamous. All the celebs who would come to Miami, Fleetwood Mac, The Cars -- Crosby and Nash recorded a song about the place. Neil Young would be there.</p><p>It was kind of the closest thing to Miami`s Studio 54 at the turn of the decade, 1979-1980, well before South Beach had arrived on kind of the global hot spot scene.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: So, the celebrities were there, but it`s the drug lords and the gangsters, that`s where a lot of the action is.</p><p>ROBEN FARZAD: It`s the ecosystem of all that money that was there, money and sex and cocaine and aspiration.</p><p>In the case of the Cuban exiles who came to this country penniless, who really wrested control of the cocaine trade by the late `70s, and didn`t mind being seen with the most gorgeous models and \"Playboy\" casting calls and powerful housewives and Richard Nixon`s friends, everybody largely left everybody alone until all of Miami blew up.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: So, your book is filled with all these colorful characters, colorful, but violent characters.</p><p>ROBEN FARZAD: Sure.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Pick one. Tell -- just to give us an example of somebody that kind of grabbed you.</p><p>ROBEN FARZAD: I, like many people in Miami, am haunted by the specter of one Ricardo \"Monkey\" Morales. Monkey was his nickname.</p><p>This was a guy who worked for Fidel Castro, became disillusioned with the violence and the revolutionary cause, was ostensibly flipped by the CIA, brought to Miami in the anti-Castro cause, and was really raring for a rematch.</p><p>And when we had the Bay of Pigs invasion, and that fell through, literally all of exile Miami thought that it was fait accompli that Kennedy would finish the job. But then Kennedy didn`t finish the job, and Kennedy dies, and LBJ is looking at Vietnam ultimately.</p><p>And so you have all these orphaned people, all these bombers and mercenaries and CIA-trained people, like Monkey Morales, who are kind of rudderless for the `60s and `70s. And, first, pot happens.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.</p><p>ROBEN FARZAD: And it`s child`s play for them to move marijuana, because the CIA trained them to know evasion on the coastline better than anybody else.</p><p>And then cocaine is multiples as profitable. And even though Morales was shot and killed at about Christmas of `82, his ghost lingers. And I think he is a metaphor for everything that went wrong between Cuba and the United States.</p><p>This was a person who was a romantic. He read history books. He quoted \"Casablanca.\" He cried whenever it came on. But he also knew how to strangle people. He got away after shooting and killing several people. He was an informant. He hunted down Nazi fugitives, helped the Mossad.</p><p>I mean, imagine his LinkedIn profile.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: I was thinking, if I asked you about what surprises you found along the way, I mean, maybe frame it in terms of those cultural references I started with.</p><p>Did they get it right when we look at \"Scarface\" or \"Miami Vice\"? What did they get right? What did they exaggerate?</p><p>ROBEN FARZAD: What`s shocking to me is, you can be meeting with ex-cons, people who have spent, say, upwards of 25, 30 years in prison, and they have now reintegrated back into Miami life.</p><p>And they`re having an early bird dinner with you on Coral Way or somewhere in Little Havana, and they`re like, nine out of 10 times, you know, Tony Montana is based on me. The town rebelled against this entire concept of \"Scarface\" coming there to film in `82 and `83. They saw it as an affront to the exile community, until it became this pop culture totem.</p><p>And then everybody after the fact was like, it was based on me. I had a leopard. No, it was based on me. Look, his throne looked like mine.</p><p>And I believe that he was a composite that Oliver Stone and De Palma saw at this hotel.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: What ended it? What brought this era to an end?</p><p>ROBEN FARZAD: It just became so violent by 1981.</p><p>It was fun and games in the sexy and swinging `70s, and people got along. The Colombians came in with a shot across the bow in 1979, the Dadeland Massacre. And then once the Mariel boat crisis happened, and you had 120,000 refugees end up in South Florida, maybe 10,000 north of them criminals, many violent criminals, it was every man for himself.</p><p>And that`s when the Miami Police Department, the DEA, the FBI -- it became a national security concern for Jimmy Carter and then Ronald Reagan in morning in America. I mean, after all, he deputized George Bush Sr. with his South Florida drug task force.</p><p>So, when the feds got serious about it, I think all the fun and games and the hyperbole of it was shut down. But what`s amazing to me is that it`s very much a story that still exists in Miami`s psyche and the Pan-American psyche, if you talk to people in Colombia and Panama and Venezuela.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Alright, the book is \"Hotel Scarface.\"</p><p>Roben Farzad, thanks very much.</p><p>ROBEN FARZAD: Thank you.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Author Roben Farzad shares more books explaining Miami online.

JAMES BAKER, Maxwell F. Baker Foundation:  The first thing that you do  when you feel that problem is there, please don't judge.  Recognize that  that person inside of that addiction is still your son or daughter or  brother.  And they have behaviors that they can't control.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HARI SREENIVASAN:  And the year in technology.  We review a turning point  in our lives online and in social media.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FARHAD MANJOO, The New York Times:  I think we got, justifiably, a lot less  optimistic about tech, and a lot more worried about the implications of a  few big tech companies kind of taking over much of the world.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  All that and more on tonight's \"PBS NewsHour.\"  </p><p>(BREAK) </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  A cold wave kept the nation's Midwest and Northeast in  the deep freeze today.  Windchill warnings and advisories stretched from  North Dakota to New Hampshire, as arctic winds dropped temperatures to 37  below zero in some places.  </p><p>Officials warned of the risk of frostbite with less than 30 minutes of  exposure, and they went on alert.  </p><p>ED HASSAN, Boston EMS:  Any time that we have an extreme in weather, be it  cold or hot, it taxes the EMS system as a whole.  Look for people who may  need assistance maybe before they're so bad off that they require an  ambulance to go to the hospital.  And they will get them services like a  shelter, a detox, and things like that.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  As the cold set in, Erie, Pennsylvania, declared a state  of emergency, with a record 65 inches of snow.  More snow was falling  today.  </p><p>In Syria, critically ill patients are finally being evacuated from a rebel- held area near Damascus.  Hundreds of sick people in eastern Ghouta have  been unable to get treatment at area hospitals.  But now government troops  are letting aid groups evacuate nearly 30 critically ill patients.  In  return, the rebels want a like number of captive fighters released.  </p><p>Also today, Russia declared the main battle with the Islamic State in Syria  is now over.  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Syrian army and its  allies must turn their focus to hunting down the Nusra Front group, linked  to al-Qaida.  </p><p>Russian leader Vladimir Putin has officially registered to run for his  fourth term as president.  In Moscow today, Putin handed in his papers in  person to the nation's election commission.  Early polls show he's likely  to be reelected in the March vote.  Opposition leader Alexei Navalny is  urging a boycott of the election after he was banned from running.  </p><p>Today, he called for nationwide protests next month.  </p><p>ALEXEI NAVALNY, Russian Opposition Leader (through translator):  Let's come  out to the street for yourselves, for your rights, for your future, for the  fact that we do not want to lose another six years.  We will start a big  campaign on one hand to persuade everyone to participate in the boycott and  not to take part in the election, and on the other hand to count how many  people really come to the polling stations, and not let Putin fabricate  that number.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Putin is 65 years old and has already led Russia as  prime minister and now president for a total of 18 years.  </p><p>Former President Obama is urging leaders to be careful in their online  statements.  He spoke with Britain's Prince Harry in an interview that  aired today on the BBC.  The former president didn't directly mention  President Trump, but he did voice concern about social media's effect on  politics.  </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, Former President of the United States:  All of us in  leadership have to find ways in which we can recreate a common space on the  Internet.  </p><p>One of the dangers of the Internet is, is that people can have entirely  different realities.  They can be just cocooned in information that  reinforces their current biases.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Mr. Obama also said he considers the Affordable Care  Act, widely known as Obamacare, one of his greatest achievements.  </p><p>The Library of Congress says it will no longer archive every public tweet,  including the president's.  Instead, starting in the new year, it will be  more selective.  The library cites the growing volume in tweets and the  increase in characters from 140 to 280.  The National Archives keeps all  presidential tweets, and will continue to do so.  </p><p>And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 28 points to  close at 24774.  The Nasdaq rose three points, and the S&amp;P 500 added two.  </p><p>Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": should you pay your property taxes early?  -- we look at the pros and cons under the new tax law; a nation divided, a  review of the year in politics from the right and the left; America  Addicted, a doctor's personal loss to opioids; and much more.  </p><p>The new tax laws are set to take effect on Monday.  </p><p>Given that the president and Republicans in Congress just passed and signed  the legislation days ago, some taxpayers are scrambling to try to squeeze  in deductions, some for next year, before 2017 ends.  </p><p>That's especially true in a number of municipalities, where people are  standing in line to prepay their property taxes for 2018.  </p><p>Let's look at what you need to know, and begin with this field report by  Brenda Flanagan of New Jersey public television.  </p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>BRENDA FLANAGAN:  While Republicans celebrated and called their tax bill  historic, homeowners panicked and called their accountants in high- property-tax states like New York, California and New Jersey.  </p><p>GAIL ROSEN, CPA:  Phones and e-mails have been going off crazy, because a  lot of people are hearing about the real estate tax deduction, hearing  about all the changes, and wanting to know what to do.  </p><p>BRENDA FLANAGAN:  That's because, in 2018, the Republican bill will cap  property tax deductions at $10,000.  But in Jersey, average property taxes  exceed $10,000 in four counties.  In fact, homeowners here pay the highest  property taxes in the nation, more than $8,500, on average.  </p><p>WAYNE DEFEO, New Jersey:  Anyone in New Jersey, that's got to be scary.  </p><p>BRENDA FLANAGAN:  So, many homeowners, like Wayne DeFeo, are meeting with  CPAs, looking to prepay next year's property taxes, to take advantage of  the full deduction before it expires.  It's kind of a loophole.  </p><p>WAYNE DEFEO:  If I could prepay half of my property taxes for next year, to  take advantage of it this tax year, based on what my accountant's told me,  is I would save almost $1,000.  And that goes to my pocket.  </p><p>GAIL ROSEN:  It's up to each and every taxpayer to make a decision how  comfortable they feel paying real estate taxes in advance.  But you should  look at it.  Everyone should look at it, because it's a one-time  opportunity by December 31.  It's a lot of money to leave on the table.  </p><p>BRENDA FLANAGAN:  How much?  Say you're single, with no kids, making  $75,000.  Your property taxes are $20,000.  We figured that, for 2017, you  will owe the IRS about $8,500.  But prepaying the first two-quarters of  your 2018 property taxes could knock that IRS bill down to about $6,000.   You would save almost $2,500.  </p><p>But accountants advise it won't work for everyone.  </p><p>DAN CONNOLLY, CPA:  For people that make more than $200,000, they're caught  up in Alternate Minimum tax, which basically disallows income and real  estate taxes to get you back to a minimum level.  </p><p>BRENDA FLANAGAN:  CPA Dan Connolly also warns some people may be tempted to  borrow money to make those prepayments.  </p><p>DAN CONNOLLY:  Some people are going on credit lines to pay for them, and  then they're going to have to pay interest on the money that they borrow to  prepay the tax.  So the calculation is not that simple.  </p><p>BRENDA FLANAGAN:  Regardless, municipalities from Elizabeth to Alpine, and  here in the shore town of Belmar report residents are showing up with  checkbooks to prepay at least the first two quarters of next year's  property taxes.  </p><p>MATT DOHERTY, Mayor of Belmar, New Jersey:  We're walking them through the  process of prepayment.  We have our staff ready to accept those  prepayments, process them properly, make sure it's all documented for  anyone who comes in, so they're able to take advantage of the deduction  this year in 2017.  </p><p>BRENDA FLANAGAN:  Mayor Matt Doherty's prepaying his taxes.  But besides  working the loophole, lawmakers in several states are also looking for  other ways to soften the blow. </p><p>Here in Jersey, one bill would increase property tax deductions for  homeowners.  But it'd cost the state $170 million in revenues.  </p><p>RAY LESNIAK (D), New Jersey State Senator:  Well, the bill would allow full  deductibility of homeowners' property taxes on their state income taxes.   And that will cut in half for most people the hit they're going to get by  the Trump bill, which doesn't allow deductibility for property taxes over  $10,000.  </p><p>BRENDA FLANAGAN:  For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Brenda Flanagan, reporting  from Elizabeth, New Jersey.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Some more questions and perspective about the changes to  the tax code and end-of-the-year decision on property tax deductions.  </p><p>Mark Steber is a CPA and chief tax officer for Jackson Hewitt Tax Service.</p><p>So, Mark, what are some of the factors that should go into figuring out  whether you should make these payments now vs. later?  </p><p>MARK STEBER, Jackson Hewitt Tax Service:  Well, your piece was excellent  and spot on with several of the observations from some of your  professionals.  </p><p>Basically, don't think that one size fits all on this opportunity.  It  certainly works where it works, but where it doesn't, it can have the  benefit of biting you pretty badly on the back end.  </p><p>So the two things that I'm telling folks on this property tax acceleration  idea is, one, make sure you have the money.  Borrowing money to do a tax  planning idea that might change even after the 1st of the year, not my best  advice.  </p><p>And the second thing is watch out for that Alternative Minimum Tax.  Your  other featured speaker said that these taxes are not deductible when you go  in and compute that, as are not mortgage interest and a whole host of other  items that you do to calculate Alt Min that.</p><p>So if you make this accelerated deduction, throws you into Alternative  Minimum Tax, and you don't get a benefit, all might have been for naught.</p><p>So, have the cash.  Watch out for Alt Min, but, most importantly, what we  are telling our clients at Jackson Hewitt is consult with your tax adviser.   Only they know your facts and circumstances and what to watch for and what  your tax profile will look like for 2017 and for 2018, even given the new  limitation on the property taxes.  </p><p>There is a lot to look at, and you certainly don't want to run afoul of a  benefit that you might need next year, even if you are in a high property  tax area.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  One of the things we have heard is that this is going to  affect states like California and New Jersey, but this isn't a blue  state/red state thing, is it?  </p><p>MARK STEBER:  No, it's not, and that is really kind of a  mischaracterization.</p><p>Those states that you name certainly do have high property taxes, but I'm  from Florida and I have friends in all the different states in the country,  and many of them have high property tax locations.  So it's really for  anybody who has high property taxes.  They should look at this.</p><p>But they should also look at their other factors as well.  But this is not  solely a New Jersey issue or a California issue or a New York issue.  It's  a whoever has property taxes more than $10,000, the new limit, that is  where this is kind of applicable, because that is where you are going to  get capped out in 2018.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  What about the possibility that Congress could move  forward to try to close this loophole retroactively, saying that everybody  that went out of their way to stand in line and pay these now might not  actually see the benefit?</p><p>MARK STEBER:  Well, that is certainly a possibility, with the corrections  bill that will come in after the fact to tweak up some of the areas that  were not absolutely looked at in totality when they passed the law.  </p><p>But I really wouldn't worry too much about a retroactive change, unless  there is a great deal of abuse.  And I think once folks take a look at this  and see what some of the risks are, what some of the costs are, I don't see  this really being an overwhelming opportunity for folks to take advantage  of.</p><p>It is a lot of money up front for a tax benefit arguably in 2019, when do  you your taxes.  You really have to have a compelling set of facts and  circumstances to do that.  And some will do it, and it will make sense, but  most people are taking a cautious look at the idea.  </p><p>But where it makes sense, it makes sense.  But it's not for everybody.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  All right, Mark Steber of Jackson Hewitt, thanks so  much.  </p><p>MARK STEBER:  Thank you.    </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Taxes were just one of the top political stories of  2017.  </p><p>John Yang now takes a deeper look at President Trump's first year and  what's in store for 2018 from two different perspectives.  </p><p>JOHN YANG:  Hari, we are joined Karine Jean-Pierre, who is a senior adviser  to MoveOn.org a and contributing editor to the online women's magazine  \"Bustle.\"  She also served in the Obama White House.  And from Phoenix,  Chris Buskirk is a radio host out there and editor of the conservative blog  AmericanGreatness.org.  </p><p>Chris, Karine, thanks for being with us.</p><p>Chris, I want to start with you.  </p><p>You talk to folks out there on your radio show every day.  As we end the  year, what is the -- sort of the state of the Trump base, of Trump  supporters out there now?  </p><p>CHRIS BUSKIRK, AmericanGreatness.org:  Well, a lot happier than I think  folks were maybe even two, three weeks ago.  </p><p>I think the fact that the tax bill passed was a welcome balm at the end of  the year.  And there are two elements of that.  One is that people  generally supported the tax bill.  They think it was good policy.  And  that's a big part of it.</p><p>The other part is just seeing a Republican Congress, for whom so many Trump  voters had very, very high hopes at the beginning of this year, and seeing  that Congress actually do something.</p><p>You know, I called it a do-nothing Congress for months and months and  months, primarily because it was a do-nothing Congress.  But they did  something.  And I think it was good policy from our perspective.  And as we  are wrapping up the year here, the Trump voters are looking and saying, you  know what, the president did a lot of things he promised to, and now we are  actually seeing Congress get on board too.  </p><p>JOHN YANG:  Chris, I want to continue with you.</p><p>As you pointed out, there was a lot of unhappiness about Congress.  People  were still supporting the president and they were blaming Congress for  inaction.  Has this solved all that?  And, also, has the gap between the  president's supporters and, for a lack of a better term, the elected  officials in Washington, the Speaker Ryans, the Leader McConnells, has that  been healed over by this?  </p><p>CHRIS BUSKIRK:  You know, I don't know if it healed over, but it's a good  start.  </p><p>I guess I would put it that way.  There has been a sort of changing of the  guard going on, on the American right among conservatives over the past  year or two or even three, I guess, if we go back to 2015.  And is  everything brushed under the carpet?  No.  </p><p>But you know what?  That is OK.  What is important here, from my  perspective, I think from a lot of people's perspective on the right, is  that different factions within the Republican Party are figuring out,  number one, that they need to work together, and, number two, how to do it.  </p><p>And so, as we go into 2018, that is a reason for people on the right to  have some optimism.  </p><p>JOHN YANG:  Karine, conversely, what is sort of the state of the loyal  opposition at the end of the year?</p><p>KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, Democratic Strategist:  Yes, conversely, indeed.  </p><p>Look, I think that Republicans passed an unpopular bill, now that they have  to go into 2018 trying to sell it.  Not only that.  They have a president  that is historically unpopular.  The Republican Congress is unpopular.  So  they are facing potentially a blue wave next year from the Democrats.</p><p>And I just don't understand how they even think this is a good thing, when  you see the polling after polling that says people hate the GOP tax plan,  and also the intensity.  There is an intensity on the Democratic side that  we have not seen in a long time.  They are unified, they are energized.  </p><p>Democrats won a Senate seat in a ruby-red state of Alabama.  That is  unheard of.  People would say we had no business even going into that state  and trying to fight and win that race.  And so I think that Republicans  have a tough fight against them -- ahead of them in 2018.  And I just don't  see how they even stop that.</p><p>Unifying right now doesn't even make sense either, because they have an  unpopular president.  Congress is unpopular.  And let's not forget there is  DACA that needs to be taken care of.  There is CHIP that needs to be  reauthorized, both bipartisan policies, programs that are popular.  </p><p>JOHN YANG:  Chris, what about that?</p><p>The Democrats -- there is a lot of talk about whether the Democrats have --  there is an enthusiasm gap with the Democrats, that they are more  enthusiastic, more fired up going into 2018, going into the midterms.  What  about that?  </p><p>CHRIS BUSKIRK:  Well, there is something to it.  There really is.  </p><p>And I think this is going to be a hard-fought election year.  There is no  doubt about it.  Look, there is something about being opposition that tends  to galvanize the people who are in the opposition.  </p><p>Republicans just had eight years of it and I think, by a lot of measures  were more successful -- as the old mantra goes, the Republicans were the  party of no.  Republicans were pretty -- got pretty good at being the party  of no during the Obama years, and because there is something that brings  people together when you think that you are -- or actually are in the  reality in the minority in Congress.  </p><p>So, as we look at the elections coming up next year, yes, Republicans do  need to figure how to, number one, stick together, and, number two, how to  make the case.  </p><p>I am happy to make the case that says, look, we have a booming stock  market, we have got low unemployment, we have got a tax bill that allows  people to keep more of what they earn.  We have got more or less peace  abroad, and make that case to the American people in 2018.   But you know what?  You have to make the case.  And that is going to be the  challenge for Republican candidates all over the country next year, because  there is a lot of enthusiasm on the left.  And so I say, let's have at it.  </p><p>JOHN YANG:  Karine, that is the -- making a case for the Republicans in  2018.  </p><p>For the Democrats, do they have to say -- I mean, what is the better  politics for them, to stand and say no to the president, to be the  opposition, literally the opposition, or do they look to work with him on  the issues you talked about, DACA, the dreamers, the children's health  insurance, infrastructure?</p><p>KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:  Right.</p><p>So what I say to DACA and CHIP is that, look, it is a bipartisan support --  has bipartisan support, is very popular with the public.  So it should be  able to be fixed easily.  It's not very difficult.  </p><p>And not only that.  Republicans control all three branches, so they should  be able to do that.  And if they don't, it's not the Democrats' fault.  It  is the Republicans' fault.  So, that is that point there.  </p><p>But I do agree that Democrats need to not just be anti-Trump.  They need to  also offer something as well, which is, OK, let's lift minimum wage.  Let's  fight on that.  Let's make sure we expand Medicare, expand Medicaid, expand  Social Security.  Let's be about something, not just anti-Trump.  </p><p>JOHN YANG:  Chris, are there places where the Republicans can work with the  Democrats in the next year before the elections?  </p><p>CHRIS BUSKIRK:  Yes, I will tell you what.  This is a place that I'm really  interested in.  </p><p>I think there are two big areas where Republicans and Democrats hopefully  will be able to find some common ground and come together.  Number one is  infrastructure.  This is something that has been talked about by people  like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi for a long time.  It's also something  that has been talked about by Donald Trump, where he actively on the  campaign trail was talking about a big infrastructure bill.  </p><p>I think that would be more than appropriate, more than welcome in 2018.  I  would hope there would be some consensus on that.  And the other part is --  and this really is big picture, but I think it's important, and that is  returning the power to legislate, to make laws back to Congress.  </p><p>I think Congress needs to take some of that power back from the executive  branch.  I think altogether too much lawmaking power resides in the  agencies and the departments of the executive branch.  And this, I think,  particularly now with Trump in the White House, this might be a time when  Democrats and Republicans in Congress can say, you know what, we need to go  back to doing the job the Constitution gives us, which is being the  legislature, being the one that makes the laws.  </p><p>JOHN YANG:  Chris Buskirk, Karine Jean-Pierre, thanks for being with us.  </p><p>CHRIS BUSKIRK:  Thanks.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Stay with us.</p><p>Coming up on the \"NewsHour\": a treatment to eliminate a female medical  problem and, with it, a cultural taboo; the year in tech, when social media  companies came under scrutiny; and from the \"NewsHour\" Bookshelf, the real- life story of the infamous Miami drug war. </p><p>But, first, we continue our second look at a special series America  Addicted on the opioid crisis and its enormous toll.  </p><p>Tonight, the story of a doctor who suffered a devastating personal loss to  opioids exactly one year ago, but now he's doing everything he can to keep  other families from suffering the same fate.  </p><p>Miles O'Brien reports that, at the same time, he's also concerned about a  backlash where some patients can't get the pain treatment they need.  </p><p>This is part of our weekly Leading Edge science series.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  Spend the day with physician Jim Baker, and you will  understand America's opioid crisis in a uniquely professional and personal  way.  </p><p>He lives in Holden, Massachusetts, a Norman Rockwell town just north of  Worcester.  Idyllic as it seems, there is death all around.  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER, Maxwell F. Baker Foundation:  In that time it took us to  go around this block, of a minute, including my house right there, four  deaths and one person in recovery.  And so this is Holden.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  Less than a year ago, death by overdose came to his family.   He lost his son Max, or Macky, as his family called him.  He was 23.  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  Macky was a sensitive, caring, warm, brilliant young man.   He was so smart, it was scary.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  He always enjoyed music?  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  Yes.  He started playing seriously when he was about 10,  and he would play every day, multiple times a day.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  And because he was the drummer, the band played here.  Jim  Baker can remember the night things changed.  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  I was up in this room.  They did the first half of their  set, which was clear and strong music.  Then they took a break.  When they  came back, they were -- the timing was off.  The changes weren't right.  I  thought, what happened?  </p><p>I found out later that they had got a hold of pills.  And within a year, he  had moved on to heroin.  How that happened, I still don't know.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  And so began a downward spiral.  He was flunking out of  school, losing friends and his music deteriorated.  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  He had the deepest desire to stop.  He knew -- he said,  \"If I don't stop, it's going to kill me.\"  But he couldn't do it on his  own, and I couldn't find treatment.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  He was trying to find a fellow doctor willing and able to  give Macky treatment with Suboxone, a combination of two drugs.  One  answers an addict's craving for opioids.  The other blocks the high.  But  precious few doctors provide the treatment.  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  The sad truth is, they say, I don't want those patients  in my office or, in more private conversation, it takes too much time, I  don't want to deal with it.  </p><p>I have heard people say, our group talked about it.  We voted against it.   There is no reimbursement.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  Jim Baker spent many years as an emergency room doctor, and  now works for hospice.  He makes house calls to people who need opioids to  manage their pain.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  Today, he is checking in on Bob Hopwood (ph).  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  Do you feel like, when you use it, if you just had a  little bit more, it would help you?  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  He works hard to insure his terminally ill patients avoid  unneeded suffering with pain.  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  Physicians are overtuned to this.  And What's happening  now is, physicians are responding by saying, I am writing for fewer  opioids.  I don't write for opioids anymore.  </p><p>And it is having a negative effect for people who have real pain and who  need relief.  Now they can't find it.  The pendulum has definitely swung  back too far, and now people who really have pain cannot find relief. </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  But he understands all too well the crisis that has caused  this overreaction.  </p><p>As his son's journey into the darkness of addiction worsened, Jim Baker  felt he had no choice.  He told Macky to leave the house, which prompted  this letter.</p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  I said: \"Macky, you can call me anytime, 24 hours a day  no matter where I am.  I will help however I can.  Just stay with it.  I  love you so much.  Dad.\"</p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  He did stay with it.  He finally found treatment, and he  got off the heroin.  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  He was able to maintain sobriety for two years or so, and  he was doing great.  He was in college.  He had fallen in love.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  He and Emma were planning on getting married, a storybook  ending.  It seemed like he had beaten the odds.  And then, Thanksgiving  last year, a horrible twist of fate.  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  It was late at night and coming down this road.  His  impact was right here, boom.  A young girl, we guess, just didn't see him  coming because of a bush or a house there.  He fractured and deformed his  right hand, his drumming hand, his writing hand.  And he was bruised up in  his chest and his face.  And he was beat up pretty good.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  As he went into surgery, Macky told the anesthesiologist  not to give him opioids.  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  But I found out later, she was injecting him with  fentanyl.  And when he came out of the operating room, the first thing he  said with glazed eyes is, \"I need drugs.\"</p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  Addicted once again.  </p><p>A month later, he got the call he had been dreading for years.  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  This is the road I was driving to when his brother called  me and said, \"Dad, Macky is unconscious.\"</p><p>And I was coming up here hoping and hoping, please, Macky, please.   Couldn't get the door open.  And I'm asking him, is he breathing?  Is he  responding?  And the answers were really scary.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  He was gone.  One of 33,000 Americans who die each year  because of an opioid overdose.  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  So, we're coming up upon a cemetery.  The field right  above that is where he learned to play tee-ball.  </p><p>Hey, Macky, dad is here.  Just want to tell you, I love you, pal.  We're  going to keep on fighting, </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  On this night, they gathered at a health club in Holden.   They pedaled hard to raise money for the Max Baker Foundation, and they  heard Jim Baker's talk, poignant and practical.  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  My goal is to have everyone here know more about opioids  than they did when they came through the door.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  He told a rapt audience what to look for, slurred speech,  pinpoint pupils and long-sleeve shirts.  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  The first thing that you do when you feel that problem is  there, please don't judge.  Recognize that that person inside of that  addiction is still your son or daughter or brother.  And they have  behaviors that they can't control.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  He told them to get Narcan, an over-the-counter drug that  can instantly counteract an overdose.  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  It's one of the few miracle drugs I have ever seen.  A  person is blue, not breathing, dusky, even cool, dying, and get Narcan in,  and, three, two, one, they sit up and go, what, what?  Where am I?  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  And he told them to get a sledgehammer.  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  And if I hear a funny sound in the bathroom, or a thud,  and knock, knock, knock, and there is no answer in there, I'm going to pick  this up and I'm going to whack that door handle, and then I'm going to  whack that hinge.  I'm going to bust down that door and get in.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  This is Jim Baker's mission, his way of channeling profound  grief.  </p><p>DR. JAMES BAKER:  I feel like, what would it mean to me had someone who was  suffering done what it took, done what was necessary to help Macky?  </p><p>And I would be forever -- and I can't really talk about it, but the most  meaningful thing I could ever ask of someone.  But it's now my turn to do  it for somebody else, and I know that's what he'd want me to do.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  Max Baker is no longer with us, but his father is spending  his days hoping to make sure his son's life has enduring purpose.  </p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Miles O'Brien in Holden, Massachusetts.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Tomorrow, a report on the impact opioid addiction is  having on the American workplace.  </p><p>Find all of our stories from the series online at PBS.org/NewsHour.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Next: one effort to address a humiliating medical injury  that afflicts perhaps one million women in the developing world who lack  access to safe medical facilities.  </p><p>Fred de Sam Lazaro reports from Kenya.  It's part of his Agents for Change  series.  </p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  In a new hospital in Eldoret, Kenya, these women are  awaiting surgery to fix a condition that's widely misunderstood and  reviled, one that's made them outcasts, often in their own families.  </p><p>It's called obstetric fistula, an injury to the birth canal caused, in most  cases, by prolonged labor that leaves a woman incontinent.  Perhaps one  million women in the developing world suffer from fistulas, a condition  virtually wiped out in industrialized nations with better access to  prenatal care and medical facilities.  </p><p>At least once a week, these patients hear a message of hope from a woman  who knows all too well their suffering; 41-year-old Sarah Omega was just 19  when she was raped and became pregnant.  </p><p>SARAH OMEGA, Fistula Survivor:  I was so scared.  I didn't want to secure  an abortion because of my faith, yes, so I kept the pregnancy.  </p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  Omega eventually spent 38 hours in a difficult labor,  much of it at home.  In the process, the baby died, and she suffered a  large fistula.  For 12 years, Omega says she was subjected to isolation and  shame.  </p><p>SARAH OMEGA:  I attempted suicide twice.  Every night, I would go to bed.   I would say, God, please don't allow me to see tomorrow, because my  tomorrow, every day, I would wake up in the morning, see the sun, I would  cry because I knew it was another day of pain, of humiliation, of suffering  in isolation.  </p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  That anguish landed her in a psychiatric ward, and it  was there that a visiting doctor came to her bedside.  </p><p>SARAH OMEGA:  He assured me that my problem was going to be fixed.  And I  remember that day he told me: \"I'm seeing a lot of hope in you.  I want you  to get healed.\"</p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  That doctor was 49-year-old Hillary Mabeya, a  gynecologist and surgeon who has devoted his entire practice to women with  fistulas.  </p><p>This 88-bed hospital was built for his use, as part of a broad campaign by  the California-based Fistula Foundation.  </p><p>DR. HILLARY MABEYA, Gynocare Fistula Center:  These are patients who need  care, they need support, and they need a lot of counseling.  They suffer so  much from society because of their condition.  </p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  It's difficult to pinpoint how many women suffer from  fistula in this country, in part because most of them are kept isolated by  their communities and even their families.  </p><p>But in recent years, since the campaign began to raise awareness of  fistula, awareness that it is treatable, some 7,000 women have emerged from  hiding each year seeking surgery.  </p><p>Fistula awareness groups have taken to the streets to educate others about  the condition, and where to get help.  We watched as these women, many of  them survivors themselves, fanned out through the Western city of Mumias,  and encouraged women suffering from incontinence issues to get free  screening offered by the campaign.  </p><p>Organizer Habiba Mohamed said people still have many misconceptions about  fistula.  </p><p>HABIBA MOHAMED, Community Organizer:  Maybe she has been bewitched.  Maybe  she was promiscuous and had a relationship outside marriage when she was  pregnant.  </p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  Mohamed's group, WADADIA, recently arranged the  transportation and treatment for 35-year-old Rachel Juma Wasamba, who lives  in a remote village in Western Kenya.  </p><p>Wasamba was lucky.  Her husband stayed with her throughout her condition  and treatment.  Many husbands abandon their wives in such situations.   Amina Mushele says that's what happened to her.  </p><p>AMINA MUSHELE, Fistula Survivor (through translator):  My husband couldn't  take it anymore, so he left me to marry another woman.  </p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  She had surgery one year ago, and now makes and sells  goods in the town marketplace, using skills she got from a training program  sponsored by WADADIA.  The training, ranging from hairstyling, to  seamstress work, and computer skills, helps reintegrate women back into  their community.  </p><p>HABIBA MOHAMED:  The moment someone has been treated, and she has healed,  you can be able to see a significant change in her life, and not only in  her life, in her family, in her children.  So, it has a ripple effect to an  entire family and the entire community.  </p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  Back in Eldoret, Dr. Mabeya is kept very busy at one  of the few places where fistula surgery is performed and offered free of  charge.  </p><p>Working six days a week, he operates on 45 women a month.  Since that's  just a fraction of the new cases, he is also training other doctors in the  region, and he is working to prevent fistulas in the first place.  </p><p>DR. HILLARY MABEYA:  Fistula is almost 100 percent preventable.  In  developed countries, it's not even there.  </p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  He says fistula can be avoided if adequate prenatal  and emergency care is made available when complications arise during  pregnancy.  More than half of all Kenyan women still deliver their babies  at home.  </p><p>For her part, Sarah Omega says her healing became complete when she able to  give birth to a health baby daughter, Jade, who recently turned two.  </p><p>SARAH OMEGA:  She means just the whole world to me.  I remember at some  point, I would pray and say, God, if you give me a baby, that baby will  erase the pain I have gone through in this life.  </p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  And Omega continues to help other women erase the pain  of fistula.  </p><p>SARAH OMEGA:  I decided to change the pain I had gone through into  something beautiful, something that will help me reach out to other women,  something that will allow other women to live a normal life like me.  </p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO:  She travels frequently to talk about her experiences,  but, more regularly, her advocacy happens at the bedside of women at the  new fistula hospital.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Fred de Sam Lazaro in Eldoret, Kenya.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Fred's reporting is a partnership with the Under-Told  Stories Project at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota.  </p><p>Technology has traditionally been seen by the public and many in the media  in a more hopeful light.  </p><p>But 2017 felt different, a year that frequently cast technology, and its  unintended consequences, in a much harsher light.  </p><p>In a moment, we will have a conversation that I recorded last week in New  York, but, first, a quick reminder about some of the major problems this  year.  </p><p>Russia used Facebook and social media to try and influence the 2016  elections.  The revelations reverberated throughout the nation's capital  this year.  </p><p>As congressional committees detailed, Russian operatives bought ads that  sought to capitalize on racial, religious and political divisions in the  U.S.  Just 120 fake accounts posted on Facebook 80,000 times and reached as  many as 126 million Americans.  </p><p>Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, initially doubted that the platform could  have influenced the election, but later pledged to make political  advertising more transparent.  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, Founder, Facebook:  Not only will you have to disclose  which page paid for an ad, but we will also make it so you can visit an  advertiser's page and see the ads that they're currently running to any  audience on Facebook.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Members of both parties were angry at the company's slow  admission, but the focus grew beyond just one company to other tech giants,  since Russian agents used Twitter, Google and YouTube too.  </p><p>The Senate Intelligence Committee grilled top lawyers for the companies.  </p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER (D), Virginia:  Many of us on this committee have been  raising this issue since the beginning of this year.  And our claims were,  frankly, blown off by the leaderships of your companies, dismissed, so  there's no possibility nothing like this happening, nothing to see here.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Hacking, a perennial problem, took on new urgency this  past year.  </p><p>The ransomware cyber-attack called WannaCry temporarily crippled computer  systems in hospitals, banks and companies around the world.  More than  230,000 computers in 150 countries were affected.  Just a week ago, the  Trump administration named the country it says was responsible.  </p><p>TOM BOSSERT, White House Homeland Security Adviser:  After careful  investigation, the United States is publicly attributing the massive  WannaCry cyber-attack to North Korea.  We do not make this allegation  lightly.  We do so with evidence, and we do so with partners.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Hackers also tore into Equifax, one of the largest  credit bureaus, stealing the personal information of more than 145 million  people.  They got Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and  driver's licenses.  </p><p>The tech industry faced a new conversation on inequality by race and  gender.  </p><p>Susan Fowler, a former engineer at Uber, published a damning account of a  harassment-filled workplace culture.  Uber fired 20 employees and it  eventually helped lead to the CEO's resignation.</p><p>She told \"TIME\" she was amazed by the reaction to her essay.  </p><p>SUSAN FOWLER, Former Uber Engineer:  I expected it would be like a 24-hour,  like, viral thing, but it didn't slow down at all.  And I was reading  through all of these things.  And I thought like, oh, my gosh, like, I'm  not alone.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Others, like Ellen Pao, who filed and lost a gender  discrimination case against a powerful venture capital firm, said change  was needed.  </p><p>ELLEN PAO, Tech Investor:  Well, I think if playing along means  participating in sexist and racist jokes, that expectation has to change.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  The year ended with a divisive decision by the FCC that  many fear will lead to the end of net neutrality, the idea of treating all  content on the Web equally without charging more or blocking your ability  to see other content.  </p><p>For a closer look at the potential turning point that 2017 is shaping up to  be for the most well-known tech giants, I'm joined by two people who follow  that world closely. Farhad Manjoo is a New York Times columnist who writes on how technology is  changing society and business.  And David Kirkpatrick is the founder of  Techonomy.  He's a technology journalist and author of \"The Facebook  Effect.\"  </p><p>Thank you both for joining us.  </p><p>So, Farhad, let me start with you.  </p><p>How did tech shift in our perception this year?  </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO, The New York Times:  Yes, I think we got, justifiably, a lot  less optimistic about tech, and a lot more worried about the implications  of a few big tech companies kind of taking over much of the world, much of  our communications, much of how we kind of learn and experience the world,  all of our personal information.  </p><p>And I think the tech companies responded to that.  They started to notice.   I mean, after the questions about the Russia hack, after questions about  sexual harassment, they started to respond to these criticisms.  </p><p>And I think the key change they made was a lot of these -- a lot of the big  tech companies started, at first grudgingly and then more willingly, I  think, they started to accept that they have some responsibility to the  rest of the world, that their technologies aren't necessarily kind of  neutral platforms, and that they have some responsibility to kind of police  what happens there.  </p><p>How that plays out, I think, will be the big question of 2018.  But this  year, I think that the big change is that, in the past, technology  companies sort of thought of themselves as kind of neutral.  And I think  that started to change.  They are less neutral now.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  But, David Kirkpatrick, what happened to make Silicon  Valley less the sort of darling of, well, Washington, D.C., as well as Wall  Street?  </p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK, Founder, Techonomy:  Well, if there is one single thing  that changed the situation, I would say it's Russian fake news affecting  the election, in the opinion of -- and the desire of Russia to alter our  electoral process, and using Facebook and Google, but Facebook in  particular, as a key means of doing that.  </p><p>And I think what that concern at a national level did was draw attention to  the extraordinary social, cultural and informational weight of these  companies, and then caused a lot of people to start asking bigger questions  about what it meant that these very small number of tech giants have had  such a monumental impact on our social dialogue and have, in effect, become  the central platform for social dialogue, and increasingly in many ways for  political behavior as well.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Mark Zuckerberg famously said it is a crazy idea that  they would have had any impact on the U.S. elections.</p><p>And then, since then, he's made several statements that walked that back.  </p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK:  Right.  </p><p>He said that to me on my Techonomy stage in 2016 two days after the  election, in which, by the way, I also asked him if Facebook had special  responsibilities because of its scale.  And he essentially demurred on  that.  </p><p>So, again, while I agree with what Farhad said, it is really notable how  much he has changed since then.  </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:  I think David is right.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg has changed in a way that I have been surprised by.  When  he started Facebook, the main sort of idea behind Facebook was that he  wanted to kind of connect the world.  Connecting the world, he argued, was  enough.  </p><p>And that was kind of the general feeling among others in the tech industry,  that just sort of building the technology, the technology itself would kind  of help people, would democratize the world.</p><p>And now the thing that Mark Zuckerberg talks about is not just connecting  people, but creating meaningful connections.  This is a -- meaningful is a  word he has been using more often lately.  And what that means exactly is  not clear.  </p><p>But they plan to change the Facebook news feed to address some of these  concerns, both the fake news concerns, but also this idea that Facebook may  be kind of putting us into echo chambers, kind of splintering much of our  dialogue.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Well, Farhad, how much of this has to do with who is  designing the underlying technology in the first place?  </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:  This is a big problem for them to solve.  </p><p>The big tech companies are all based on the West Coast of the United  States, several here in California and then a couple in Seattle.  Their  sort of work forces kind of look the same.  They are not very diverse.   They are not gender-diverse.  They don't have a lot of minorities.  They  are not kind of class-diverse or geographically diverse.  </p><p>And they are increasingly gatekeepers for information for not just the  United States, but the entire planet.  And so you really have this question  where there are a small number of people who are essentially homogeneous  kind of making decisions for the rest of the world.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  David Kirkpatrick, what is the likelihood, then, of  these technologists attacking the problems that are underlying this, the  diversity, the lack of transparency, and the ultimate consequences of the  tools that they build?  </p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK:  Well, I think there is no question that there is a  major shift under way in the mind-set of the Silicon Valley work force and  the leaders of these companies that they have to do that.  </p><p>However, as Farhad has written, and as I firmly believe, it is an extremely  challenging project to understand the true weight of these massively  important systems in our society, and how to actually more effectively  manage them.  </p><p>I mean, it is a question of governance, in effect.  And the reality is when  the public square is, in effect, dominated by commercial enterprises, who  should regulate that is entirely undetermined.  Clearly, these people are  starting to recognize, if they don't take actions that appear to be in the  public's benefit, they will become regulated by a government, both in the  United States and abroad.</p><p>And that process is happening much more in Europe already.  They want to  desperately avoid that.  On the other hand, the ideas aren't really even  there on their part as to what really could be done to properly regulate  the flow of information, given their fundamental goal of selling  advertising to make money on these services, because advertising  effectively requires eyeballs and attention. And they still are more in the mind-set of drawing attention than they are  of doing the right thing, in my opinion.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  All right, David Kirkpatrick of Techonomy, and Farhad  Manjoo of The New York Times, thank you both.  </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:  Thanks.  Good to be here.  </p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK:  Thanks.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Finally, in the latest addition to the \"NewsHour\"  Bookshelf, Jeffrey Brown examines the Wild West that was Miami Beach, where  cocaine cowboys played and died.  </p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  Al Pacino's gangster snarl in the film \"Scarface,\" the oh- so-cool undercover detectives in \"Miami Vice,\" the popular culture images  of Miami in the 1980s, when cocaine drug lords helped make it the murder  capital of America.  </p><p>The real-life story is told in the new book \"Hotel Scarface.\"  Author Roben  Farzad is a business journalist, host of \"Full Disclosure\" on NPR One, and  occasional contributor to this program.</p><p>And it's nice to talk to you, Roben.  </p><p>ROBEN FARZAD, Author, \"Hotel Scarface\":  So nice to...</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  We usually talk about economics, but here we are.  Why this  subject?  Why did you want to go look at this story?  </p><p>ROBEN FARZAD:  My heart has been with this for -- in the 22 to 23 years  since I left Miami to go to college.  </p><p>When cocaine came to town, it was so ridiculously profitable, it was so  seductive, it made people do such crazy things in the name of money and  power and bloodlust, that you had something approximating a failed state by  1981 in Miami.  </p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  The epicenter is this hotel.  It's -- you nickname it  Scarface Hotel, right?  But it's the Mutiny was the real place.  </p><p>ROBEN FARZAD:  That's right.  </p><p>It was called the Hotel Mutiny at Sailboat Bay.  And the first three floors  had a club, a private discotheque, a restaurant, a lounge, a tiki bar.  And  it was just infamous.  All the celebs who would come to Miami, Fleetwood  Mac, The Cars -- Crosby and Nash recorded a song about the place.  Neil  Young would be there.  </p><p>It was kind of the closest thing to Miami's Studio 54 at the turn of the  decade, 1979-1980, well before South Beach had arrived on kind of the  global hot spot scene.  </p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  So, the celebrities were there, but it's the drug lords and  the gangsters, that's where a lot of the action is.  </p><p>ROBEN FARZAD:  It's the ecosystem of all that money that was there, money  and sex and cocaine and aspiration.  </p><p>In the case of the Cuban exiles who came to this country penniless, who  really wrested control of the cocaine trade by the late '70s, and didn't  mind being seen with the most gorgeous models and \"Playboy\" casting calls  and powerful housewives and Richard Nixon's friends, everybody largely left  everybody alone until all of Miami blew up.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  So, your book is filled with all these colorful characters,  colorful, but violent characters.  </p><p>ROBEN FARZAD:  Sure.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  Pick one.  Tell -- just to give us an example of somebody  that kind of grabbed you.  </p><p>ROBEN FARZAD:  I, like many people in Miami, am haunted by the specter of  one Ricardo \"Monkey\" Morales.  Monkey was his nickname.  </p><p>This was a guy who worked for Fidel Castro, became disillusioned with the  violence and the revolutionary cause, was ostensibly flipped by the CIA,  brought to Miami in the anti-Castro cause, and was really raring for a  rematch.</p><p>And when we had the Bay of Pigs invasion, and that fell through, literally  all of exile Miami thought that it was fait accompli that Kennedy would  finish the job.  But then Kennedy didn't finish the job, and Kennedy dies,  and LBJ is looking at Vietnam ultimately.</p><p>And so you have all these orphaned people, all these bombers and  mercenaries and CIA-trained people, like Monkey Morales, who are kind of  rudderless for the '60s and '70s.  And, first, pot happens.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  Yes.  </p><p>ROBEN FARZAD:  And it's child's play for them to move marijuana, because  the CIA trained them to know evasion on the coastline better than anybody  else.  </p><p>And then cocaine is multiples as profitable.  And even though Morales was  shot and killed at about Christmas of '82, his ghost lingers.  And I think  he is a metaphor for everything that went wrong between Cuba and the United  States.  </p><p>This was a person who was a romantic.  He read history books.  He quoted  \"Casablanca.\"  He cried whenever it came on.  But he also knew how to  strangle people.  He got away after shooting and killing several people.   He was an informant.  He hunted down Nazi fugitives, helped the Mossad. </p><p>I mean, imagine his LinkedIn profile.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  I was thinking, if I asked you about what surprises you  found along the way, I mean, maybe frame it in terms of those cultural  references I started with.  </p><p>Did they get it right when we look at \"Scarface\" or \"Miami Vice\"?  What did  they get right?  What did they exaggerate?  </p><p>ROBEN FARZAD:  What's shocking to me is, you can be meeting with ex-cons,  people who have spent, say, upwards of 25, 30 years in prison, and they  have now reintegrated back into Miami life.</p><p>And they're having an early bird dinner with you on Coral Way or somewhere  in Little Havana, and they're like, nine out of 10 times, you know, Tony  Montana is based on me.  The town rebelled against this entire concept of  \"Scarface\" coming there to film in '82 and '83.  They saw it as an affront  to the exile community, until it became this pop culture totem.  </p><p>And then everybody after the fact was like, it was based on me.  I had a  leopard.  No, it was based on me.  Look, his throne looked like mine.  </p><p>And I believe that he was a composite that Oliver Stone and De Palma saw at  this hotel.  </p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  What ended it?  What brought this era to an end?  </p><p>ROBEN FARZAD:  It just became so violent by 1981.</p><p>It was fun and games in the sexy and swinging '70s, and people got along.   The Colombians came in with a shot across the bow in 1979, the Dadeland  Massacre.  And then once the Mariel boat crisis happened, and you had  120,000 refugees end up in South Florida, maybe 10,000 north of them  criminals, many violent criminals, it was every man for himself.</p><p>And that's when the Miami Police Department, the DEA, the FBI -- it became  a national security concern for Jimmy Carter and then Ronald Reagan in  morning in America.  I mean, after all, he deputized George Bush Sr. with  his South Florida drug task force.</p><p>So, when the feds got serious about it, I think all the fun and games and  the hyperbole of it was shut down.  But what's amazing to me is that it's  very much a story that still exists in Miami's psyche and the Pan-American  psyche, if you talk to people in Colombia and Panama and Venezuela.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN:  Alright, the book is \"Hotel Scarface.\"</p><p>Roben Farzad, thanks very much.  </p><p>ROBEN FARZAD:  Thank you.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Author Roben Farzad shares more books explaining Miami  online.  It's on our Web site.</p><p>A clarification and follow-up to our tax story tonight, courtesy of the  national taxpayer advocate Nina Olson.</p><p>The IRS announced today taxpayers will only be able to deduct their  property taxes on the coming year on their 2017 returns if and only if  their 2018 taxes have been assessed by their local government.  If  taxpayers make payments on unassessed taxes, they will not be able to  deduct them.  </p><p>And that's the \"NewsHour\" for tonight.  </p><p>Tomorrow on the broadcast: the fight over Medicaid expansion in the state  of Maine, the voters against the governor.</p><p>For all of us at the \"PBS NewsHour,\" thank you.  We'll see you soon.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 NewsHour Productions, LLC.  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

They pulled back after a second day of violent assaults on the U.S.` largest and most expensive diplomatic complex.</p><p>The siege was sparked by U.S. airstrikes against militia sites over the weekend that killed more than two dozen fighters. We will have a detailed report after the news summary.</p><p>In Afghanistan, the Taliban staged a series of attacks on security forces, killing at least 26. The attackers struck in Kunduz, Balkh and Takhar provinces, all in Afghanistan`s north. Last weekend, Taliban officials say they agreed to a cease-fire, but gave no start date, and there`s been no letup in the violence.</p><p>A pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong that began last spring continues into the new year. Hundreds of thousands joined an annual march today that, by nightfall, descended into violence. Protesters vandalized banks and businesses with ties to mainland China and threw firebombs. Police fired tear gas and arrested about 400 people.</p><p>New Year`s Day brought only slight relief to parts of Australia ravaged by some of country`s worst ever wildfires. But after flames cut off several coastal towns, the death toll rose to 17.</p><p>John Ray of Independent Television News has our report.</p><p>JOHN RAY: In the small town of Mallacoota, residents returned to their homes to find nothing left to salvage.</p><p>JANN GILBERT, Mallacoota Resident: All of my possessions have been totally incinerated. There is just simply nothing left, nothing more, except ash.</p><p>JOHN RAY: There is now a brief lull in the winds that whipped up this firestorm that sent thousands of residents fleeing for their lives, and holiday makers trapped on the coast to shelter at sea.</p><p>Firefighters have been reinforced by the military to bring emergency supplies to ravaged communities and to help count the cost in a toll of death expected to rise.</p><p>GLADYS BEREJIKLIAN, Premier of New South Wales: Today is the day where it`s safe to do so, that our police and emergency services could actually go through the properties that have been lost, and in some circumstances make some very, very horrible findings.</p><p>JOHN RAY: Many of those who died had stayed behind in a doomed mission to protect homes and businesses. For now, in the towns, the fires only smolder. But in the hills, they still rage.</p><p>And the calmer weather that has allowed Australia to take stock of this catastrophe may be only a brief reprieve.</p><p>ROB ROGERS, Deputy Commissioner, New South Wales Fire Service: There is s every potential that conditions on Saturday will be as bad or worse than we saw yesterday.</p><p>JOHN RAY: Searing heat in a country left tinder-dry by years of drought. Fire has tested Australia to destruction.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: That report from John Ray of Independent Television News.</p><p>Severe flooding hit Indonesia`s capital, Jakarta, overnight, after monsoon rains dumped 14 inches during New Year`s celebrations. At least nine people were killed and thousands forced from their homes. Rescue workers evacuated women and children in inflatable boats, while others swam through floodwaters, past submerged vehicles and homes.</p><p>At the Vatican, in a New Year`s message, Pope Francis denounced violence against women. He likened it to profaning God, and called for a greater role for women in world decision-making. He also apologized for striking out at a woman in St. Peter`s Square last night.</p><p>Francis was shaking hands when the woman grabbed him and yanked him toward her. He slapped her hand and turned away, visibly angry.</p><p>Today, he said he had made a mistake.</p><p>POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic Church (through translator): Love makes us patient. So many times, we lose patience, even me. And I apologize for yesterday`s bad example.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: The woman involved in the incident has not been identified.</p><p>Back in this country, President Trump is again talking about cracking down on underage vaping. He said last night that sales of some flavored e- cigarettes might be halted. The Wall Street Journal reported the Food and Drug Administration will ban all flavors, except menthol and tobacco. The president promised a sweeping ban last September, but never followed through.</p><p>And former National Basketball Association commissioner David Stern has died. The league said he passed today, about three weeks after suffering a brain hemorrhage. Stern led the NBA for 30 years, and oversaw its huge growth for basketball in the U.S. and worldwide. In 2014, he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.</p><p>David Stern was 77 years old.</p><p>Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": backing down -- a crisis ends at the U.S. Embassy compound in Iraq; nuclear North -- what stark warnings from North Korea mean for the future of talks with the U.S. -- new year, new laws -- changing rules for what you can and can`t do in 2020 -- warnings from Antarctica -- penguins face the perils of climate change; and much more.</p><p>In Baghdad over the last day, there was a sense of crisis, American diplomats trapped in the embassy, U.S. troops on the embassy roof ready to fire into crowds.</p><p>Today, the siege outside the embassy is winding down, but the larger U.S.- Iran tensions remain high.</p><p>After the most significant standoff outside a U.S. Embassy in years, demonstrators in Baghdad today stood down and declared victory.</p><p>FADHIL AL-GEZZI, Militia Supporter (through translator): After we achieved what we intended here, we pulled out from this place triumphantly, and we soaked America`s news in dirt.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: For 24 hours, supporters of the Iran-backed militia Kataib Hezbollah staged a sit-in, and scaled the embassy walls, and broke the reception area`s windows. They demanded the U.S. close the embassy and withdraw its more than 5,000 troops from Iraq.</p><p>They were responding to Sunday`s U.S. airstrikes against members of the same militia. The U.S. blames the group for killing an American military contractor and attacking U.S. bases in Iraq 11 times in the last two months.</p><p>On CBS News yesterday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed the Iranian government.</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. Secretary of State: This is state-sponsored terror. This is Iranian-backed terrorism that took place that threatened American interests.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: During the sit-in, U.S. troops fired tear gas and stun grenades to push back demonstrators. Helicopters flew over the embassy and dropped flares. And the U.S. reinforced the embassy, deploying Marines from Kuwait and 750 additional soldiers from the U.S.</p><p>The U.S. was concerned Iraqi forces alone couldn`t handle the situation. At first, Iraqi forces allowed demonstrators to stream toward the embassy, inside the normally restricted Green Zone. Eventually, they tried to act as a buffer between demonstrators and American troops.</p><p>And, today, they continue to act as security. But the end to the crisis in Baghdad doesn`t reduce larger U.S.-Iran tensions. Yesterday, President Trump tweeted that Iran -- quote -- \"will pay a very big price. This is not a warning. It is a threat. Happy new year.\"</p><p>Today, Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei denied Iran played a role and mocked President Trump.</p><p>AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI, Supreme Leader of Iran (through translator): That gentleman has again tweeted. They tweet, speak or write articles, and he has said that, we see Iran responsible for this situation in Iraq, that Iran is controlling this, and we will respond to Iran.</p><p>First, you can`t do a damn thing. This has nothing to do with Iran. Second, be logical.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Outside the embassy, there are still a few hundred holdouts. And a few miles away, a separate demonstration. Thousands of anti-corruption protesters fill Baghdad`s Tahrir Square. They have been in the streets since October, demanding less sectarianism and more economic opportunity for all Iraqis.</p><p>Now two people with first-hand experience with the parties involved in the embassy standoff.</p><p>Sarkawt Shams is a member of the Iraqi Parliament representing the Kurdistan region. He joins me from the city of Sulaymaniyah. And Douglas Silliman, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq until early last year, he is now the president of the Arab Gulf States Institute, a Washington think tank.</p><p>Sarkawt Shams, the siege is over, but do you right now have criticism of both the Iraqi forces that allowed some of these protesters, these demonstrators, these members of the militia to get so close to the embassy, and do you have criticism of what started this, the U.S. airstrikes in Iraq over the weekend?</p><p>SARKAWT SHAMS, Iraqi Parliament Member: Right.</p><p>Both countries to blame, both parties to blame for the starting of this crisis. First, the U.S. unilateral action against elements of the PMU, or the Shia militias that the West them, some of them. And it was a mistake, it was a strategic mistake by the Iraqi security forces that are protecting the Green Zone, the international zone, where the U.S. Embassy and many other embassies and Iraqi -- sensitive Iraqi institutions like Parliament are located there.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Ambassador Silliman, you were in the embassy up until recently, up until last year.</p><p>So, Sarkawt Shams has two points. One, did the Iraqi forces do enough to keep these people away from the embassy? I assume you agree that they might have done more. But also that the U.S. didn`t enough -- didn`t do enough to actually tell the Iraqi government before these airstrikes this weekend?</p><p>DOUGLAS SILLIMAN, Former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq: First of all, in the short term, the Iraqi security forces that were guarding the Green Zone and the diplomat -- diplomatic establishment obviously didn`t do enough to keep the protesters from attacking the embassy.</p><p>And it was only after the attack was well under way, and there was damage to the embassy wall and reception area itself, that they called in the Iraqi Counterterrorism Service, which are the equivalent of U.S. Special Forces.</p><p>The trouble is, this issue is much broader and can be put in a couple of different contexts. So, the Iraqi government has not done enough to prevent the Popular Mobilization Forces, the -- what are generally called Shia militias, but that`s too broad a concept -- these irregular forces that are now part of the Iraqi government have not been controlled by the government adequately to prevent them from conducting attacks against Iraq institutions or diplomatic institutions.</p><p>So that`s the first issue. The second issue is the larger context. There is still the context of Iran consistently trying to poke the United States into action. You saw this in the Gulf of Oman months and months ago, the shooting down of the U.S. drone, and more recently, in October, the attacks on Saudi Arabian oil installations conducted by Iran, looking for that pressure point that is going to get the United States to react or, hopefully, in Iran`s eyes, overreact to the Iranian provocation.</p><p>And up until this attack that killed an American, there wasn`t a U.S. military response.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Sarkawt Shams, there has been a push by the same militia that we saw doing these attacks and this demonstration outside the embassy to evict the U.S. from Iraq.</p><p>Will Parliament now be more likely to take up the question of evicting the U.S. from Iraq?</p><p>SARKAWT SHAMS: I don`t think so. It`s going to happen in the Parliament.</p><p>First of all, it wasn`t the Parliament who invited the U.S. Army to Iraq. It was the prime minister, then Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi. It came at the invite and request of the Iraqi government, not the Parliament.</p><p>If the Iraqi government doesn`t need them, if the Iraqi military doesn`t need U.S. Army, which I think they need them now, they can just ask them to leave, and they will leave eventually, in a few days. We don`t need a bill in the Parliament to push the foreign forces.</p><p>Taking the issue, the crisis to the Parliament, that which means these leaders, they don`t want U.S. forces to leave. They just want to show up and just make it a case for their people -- to satisfy their people. That`s not a real step toward removing U.S. forces in Iraq.</p><p>That`s just a political show.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Mr. Shams, are you worried that the U.S. military response plays into Iran`s hand? Iran has been goading the U.S. to attack.</p><p>And are you worried that Iraq is becoming the main theater for a proxy war between the U.S. and Iran?</p><p>SARKAWT SHAMS: That`s already happening. And that`s the fear of all Iraqis, including the -- even the Kurdish government, Iraq to be transformed to a proxy war between the two nations.</p><p>Both nations are important to Iraq. Both, they have strategic relations with Iraq. And we cannot ignore and favor one over another one. What we want is both countries to have their conflict resolved elsewhere, not in Iraq.</p><p>Ambassador Silliman, he already know -- he have a lot of experience in this country -- that Iraqi institutions are weak in military institutions, economic institutions and (INAUDIBLE) we have a caretaker prime minister who cannot really execute his full constitutional power, due to he resigned, and we are awaiting a new prime minister.</p><p>So we are in a very fragile and a very dangerous region. And we require support from the United States. And we know that it`s really easy to start a war, but it is going to be almost impossible to win the peace.</p><p>DOUGLAS SILLIMAN: The reality is -- I would reframe the entire question, because it is not a war between the United States and Iran on Iraqi territory.</p><p>The goals of the United States in Iraq are internationally recognized. We have got a 17-country coalition to help Iraq defeat ISIS finally and to train and mentor toward the military. We have been working with the IMF, the World Bank, the United Nations, the European Union, NATO, and a number of other international organizations to build Iraqi institutions, so that Iraq can be an independent sovereign state and exercise its own sovereignty positively in the international community.</p><p>It is Iran that has been undermining the Iranian constitution -- the Iraqi constitution, putting its proxy forces or supporters into positions in the Iraqi government, and not obeying by the laws and the constitution of Iraq.</p><p>And so this is not the United States vs. Iran. This is the world vs. Iran. And the goals of Iran are to essentially swallow Iraq politically, economically, and give itself security strategic depth.</p><p>The world wants to see Iraq fully integrated into the international community in a positive way.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Sarkawt Shams, there has been a push by the same militia that we saw doing these attacks and this demonstration outside the embassy to evict the U.S. from Iraq.</p><p>Will Parliament now be more likely to take up the question of evicting the U.S. from Iraq?</p><p>SARKAWT SHAMS: I don`t think so.</p><p>It`s going to happen in the Parliament. First of all, it wasn`t the Parliament who invited the U.S. Army to Iraq. It was the prime minister, then Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi. It came at the invite and the request of the Iraqi government, not the Parliament.</p><p>If the Iraqi government doesn`t need them, if the Iraqi military doesn`t need U.S. Army, which I think they need them now, they can just ask them to leave, and they will leave eventually in few days.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Ambassador Silliman, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Sarkawt Shams, member of Iraqi Parliament, thank you very much to you both.</p><p>SARKAWT SHAMS: Thank you for having me.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: North Korea`s leader, Kim Jong-un, has announced he will no longer abide by a moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests, and he warned North Koreans of a -- quote -- \"long confrontation\" with the U.S.</p><p>Meanwhile, direct talks with the Trump administration are stalled.</p><p>For more on all of this, we turn to Naoko Aoki, an adjunct political scientist from the RAND Corporation and a former journalist who has been to North Korea 18 times.</p><p>Thank you very much. Welcome to the \"NewsHour.\"</p><p>NAOKO AOKI, RAND Corporation: Thank you.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: What are your main takeaways from Kim`s statement?</p><p>NAOKO AOKI: So, I think this is a major policy shift, from -- to an emphasis on weapons development, strategic weapons development, and also an emphasis on self-reliance, in terms of the economy.</p><p>And this is because North Korea sees a prolonged confrontation with the United States, and it thinks that it`s unlikely that sanctions will be lifted soon.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: So, let`s take each of those in turn.</p><p>The first one you talked about, strategic weapon. That`s the word that Kim used.</p><p>Let`s take a listen to a newscaster reading what Kim had to say about that.</p><p>WOMAN (through translator): He confirmed that the world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future.</p><p>He said that we will reliably put on constant alert the powerful nuclear deterrent capable of containing the nuclear threats from the U.S. and guaranteeing our long-term security, noting that the scope and depth of bolstering our deterrent will be properly coordinated, depending on the U.S. future attitude to the DPRK.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: So, there`s two points there. One, what is a new strategic weapon, but also that end phrase, depending on the U.S. attitude.</p><p>How important are those things?</p><p>NAOKO AOKI: Yes.</p><p>So, we don`t know exactly what this new weapon is going to be. But it is likely to be something qualitatively new, some component of it, at least, but we don`t know what that is going to be.</p><p>It could be something that would enhance the survivability of North Korea`s nuclear weapons. And it`s -- the conditional part is also important as well. If you read the report carefully, it`s -- a lot of the things are conditional on what the United States would do.</p><p>So there`s a little bit of flexibility in what the North Koreans may do.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Flexibility, an opening, so that these talks maybe aren`t dead?</p><p>NAOKO AOKI: Yes.</p><p>So, they didn`t completely shut the door to diplomacy. And I think that is important, although things do not look very optimistic right now.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: At the top, you laid out the two takeaways, the one strategic weapon, but, two, also the message of resilience, the message of a long confrontation with the United States.</p><p>And we have got some language from Kim himself that I can read.</p><p>And let`s -- let`s just read that right now.</p><p>He said: \"The present situation warning of long confrontation with the U.S. urgently requires us to make it a fait accompli that we have to live under the sanctions by the hostile forces in the future too, and strengthen the internal power from all aspects.\"</p><p>So, cutting through the chase of that, you have got two messages, one, the long confrontation, and we have to be resilient, as you said, right?</p><p>NAOKO AOKI: Yes, that`s correct.</p><p>And so Kim Jong-un is preparing the public for a prolonged confrontation with the United States, which may involve, which is likely to involve some form of sanctions for the foreseeable future, and so lowering expectations for the lifting of sanctions and preparing the public for economic hardships ahead.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: And what`s the -- what`s the implication of that? Has he said that before? And how will North Koreans receive that?</p><p>NAOKO AOKI: Well, it`s a policy shift because, in April 2018, he said that his policy of pursuing both economic -- economic development and nuclear arms development at the same time has been accomplished, and he`s going to shift more emphasis on the economy.</p><p>Well, this is sort of going back to that point where, well, the United States -- from the North Korean point of view, the United States is continuing with its anti-North Korea -- its hostile policy toward North Korea, and, therefore, we have to strengthen both.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Strengthen both, both the economy and the nuclear weapons or the nuclear system.</p><p>NAOKO AOKI: The nuclear -- yes.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: And hence the strategic, which leads to the takeaway.</p><p>I mean, so if he`s talking about a long confrontation, if he`s talking about new weapons, and the U.S. is not budging, as far as we know, are we going to go toward more confrontation and more back to where we were in 2017, fire and fury?</p><p>NAOKO AOKI: Well, that`s certainly a possibility.</p><p>And tensions are likely to rise, but we don`t quite know yet by how much. And that will depend on -- a lot on what both sides do.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: So, meaning the United States doesn`t necessarily have to go down the path of more confrontation, and nor will North Korea go down that path itself?</p><p>NAOKO AOKI: That`s the optimistic view, of course.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>NAOKO AOKI: And -- but we could certainly see a return of what we saw in 2017.</p><p>But it could -- given the political U.S. presidential elections, the political calendar and everything else, it could mean that it could be somewhere below that.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Meaning the United States and the Trump administration right now, as you see it, has no interest in ratcheting up tensions?</p><p>NAOKO AOKI: And, also, the -- North Korea would may not want to antagonize China, for example, by conducting ICBM tests, intercontinental ballistic missile tests, or nuclear tests.</p><p>So that is also a factor that could play in their calculation.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Naoko Aoki of RAND Corporation, thank you very much.</p><p>NAOKO AOKI: Thank you.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: On the final day of 2019, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker pardoned more than 11,000 people convicted for possessing low levels of cannabis.</p><p>He said hundreds of thousands of others could see their records expunged.</p><p>GOV. J.B. PRITZKER (D-IL): We are giving people a new lease on life. We will never be able to fully remedy the depth of the damage that`s been done. But, today, here in Illinois, we can govern with the courage to right the wrongs of the past.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: The governor`s announcement came as Illinois becomes today the 11 state to legalize marijuana.</p><p>As Lisa Desjardins explains, that`s just one example of scores of new laws going into effect across the country.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: Congress and the president have been dominating, almost monopolizing the headlines lately, but the states are arguably doing more that changes the law, including a sweep of new state laws going into effect today, from criminal justice reforms and higher minimum wages, to the cost of electric cars.</p><p>Reid Wilson is a correspondent at The Hill newspaper and keeps track of what`s happening in state politics. He joins me now from a familiar- looking set, our \"NewsHour West\" studio in Phoenix.</p><p>Thank you, Reid.</p><p>REID WILSON, The Hill: Hey, Lisa.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: Let`s start right away with criminal justice reform.</p><p>As Nick reported, Illinois has wiped out thousands of arrests and reversed convictions over marijuana, a small amount of marijuana possession, as part of the legalization of the drug for recreational use.</p><p>But this is also a part of a broader criminal justice reform across the country. Take us through what`s happening.</p><p>REID WILSON: Yes, we have seen Congress acting on criminal justice reform as one of their major initiatives this year, basically the only thing they could agree on, on a bipartisan basis.</p><p>But it really started in the states. And we have seen this push toward expunging records for minor drug crimes, especially in states where marijuana is now legal. And we have seen this effort in places like California, New Jersey and elsewhere, now, of course, in Illinois, as their recreational marijuana law takes effect.</p><p>In some other states -- New York has ended cash bail. It`s another one of the -- another trend that we`re starting to see in bluer states, a recognition that a lot of low-income residents who find themselves in jail can`t afford to bail themselves out and, in some cases, plead guilty to crimes they haven`t committed just in order to get themselves out of jail quickly.</p><p>And then, in states like New Jersey and Kentucky, we have seen a push towards re-enfranchising felons who were once in jail and now, once they`re out of jail, get the right to vote back. The theory behind it is basically, the more you are reintegrated into your community, the less likely you are to offend again and head back to jail.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: I also want to talk about something that will affect a lot of pocketbooks, minimum wages going up.</p><p>Now, currently, the federal minimum wage, as people know, $7,25 an hour. That`s about $15,000 for someone working full-time. But now we`re seeing today 21 states are seeing increases in their minimum wages. What`s motivating these states to have a higher minimum wage going forward?</p><p>REID WILSON: Well, so, the federal minimum wage has not changed since 2009. And, as you can imagine, inflation has not slowed down and has -- and basically makes that purchasing power of that $15,000 far less than it was a decade ago.</p><p>What we have seen in recent years is a push both through state legislatures and through ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage to $12, $13, $14, even $15 an hour.</p><p>And what a lot of these states are doing is, they`re taking an incremental process. So one state might pass a bill to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, but by, say, 2022. So, today, it will raise -- it will rise a dollar an hour. Next January 1, it`ll rise another dollar an hour to sort of give businesses the opportunity to factor in those costs and to lessen the burden, while also raising the minimum wage.</p><p>Another thing that we have seen across the country this year is teacher salaries on the rise. You might remember, about a year-and-a-half ago, there were some significant teacher strikes in places like Kentucky and Oklahoma demanding higher wages.</p><p>Governors all over the country, Republican and Democratic, didn`t want to see those same teacher strikes in their own backyard. So in places like Arizona, where I am now, they proactively went out and raised teacher pays.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: All right, let`s talk about tech.</p><p>Electric cars, some changes, and maybe texting and driving. I think Florida is making that a primary offense now.</p><p>REID WILSON: Yes, one of the things we`re seeing is governments across the country are trying to figure out how to handle these big tech giants that are disrupting so many -- so many industries across the country, whether that`s a bill like a California`s AB-5, which treats gig workers for Uber and Lyft and DoorDash as actual employees.</p><p>That passed last year. It will take effect in the new year, although it`s going to be challenged by those -- those big companies that I just mentioned.</p><p>In states that are raising costs of electric vehicles, that`s a recognition that, as more of us buy Priuses or Teslas or something like that, the revenue from gas taxes are going to go down. People putting less gas in their car means less money for roads and infrastructures in these states. So the states are trying to figure out how to regulate these new types of electric cars, so that they are -- the drivers of those cars are still paying into the funds that pay for our national infrastructure.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: OK, so what`s ahead? What our states likely to be talking about this year?</p><p>REID WILSON: Well, I think we`re going to see three broad trends in -- that have some form of bipartisan cooperation.</p><p>The first is about NCAA athletes and whether or not they can profit off of the use of their image and likeness. California passed a bill last year that would allow those athletes to get money from endorsement deals or, say, video game appearances. And we have already seen a number of bills introduced in a bipartisan basis in states like Minnesota and Florida and New York.</p><p>I think that`s going around the country in the next year. The second thing is sort of related in sports betting. Sports betting is a billion-dollar industry. And a lot of states are saying that, if they legalize sports betting, they will be able to take some of the revenue in the form of taxes from what has otherwise been an underground economy.</p><p>So we have seen legislation passed on a bipartisan basis in several states in 2019. That trend is going to continue in 2020.</p><p>And then the last thing I`d point to is state budgets. We have gone through a decade of economic expansion. States are taking in a lot more revenue then they budgeted for. That`s the good news. But state legislators are worried about the next economic downturn.</p><p>The recovery isn`t going to last forever. So a lot of states are socking millions, if not billions of dollars away in their rainy day funds. Rainy day reserves are more than double what they were already before the last recession.</p><p>So there`s a bit of bipartisan agreement, it`s time to save more money now, in advance of what`s going to be an economic downturn, whether it comes next year or a couple years down the road.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: Reid, thank you for watching these important state governments.</p><p>Reid Wilson of The Hill, happy new year.</p><p>REID WILSON: Thanks a lot, Lisa. You too.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: There is no place further south than Antarctica. It is virtually uninhabited, a continent covered almost entirely in ice.</p><p>William Brangham traveled there to meet a man who`s dedicated his life to studying three species of penguins and how they are adapting to a rapidly changing environment.</p><p>It`s an encore report in our weekly series Leading Edge of science.</p><p>RON NAVEEN, Oceanites: Hi, buddy.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For more than 35 years, Ron Naveen has been coming every year to Antarctica to do something he still can`t believe he gets paid for: research and count penguins.</p><p>RON NAVEEN: I can`t believe it. I have the best job on the planet.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Is that right?</p><p>RON NAVEEN: Well, I`m a penguin counter, for God`s sake. Can`t beat that, can you?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: No, I don`t think you can.</p><p>Naveen is a former lawyer for the Environmental Protection Agency, but he left government work back in the 1980s to start Oceanites, a nonprofit that tracks the health of three penguin species that breed on the Antarctic Peninsula.</p><p>It`s home to millions of these charming, occasionally awkward, flightless birds.</p><p>RON NAVEEN: They`re really funny. They`re like little human beings. And they don`t have knees, so they`re waddling around all the time. They look kind of silly and stupid and late for dinner, and all that stuff.</p><p>But they`re just cute as hell, and I love spending time watching their behaviors.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Antarctic Peninsula is the 800-mile-long stretch of land that branches off from the northwest corner of the continent. This region has been warming faster than almost anywhere else in the world.</p><p>And Naveen says that warming is having a dramatic impact on penguins.</p><p>RON NAVEEN: Because I have been coming here for so long, I have seen these changes. I have seen the penguin populations of certain colonies thin out pretty dramatically.</p><p>One colony that we studied at Deception Island has gone from an estimated 90,000 breeding pairs to 50 or fewer.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Wow.</p><p>RON NAVEEN: Fifty thousand or fewer.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ninety thousand down to 50?</p><p>RON NAVEEN: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That`s a huge drop-off.</p><p>RON NAVEEN: Right. But these penguins can teach us something about life on the planet.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We first met Naveen and his colleague, seabird biologist Grant Humphries, in the southern Argentinean city of Ushuaia. They were preparing for their annual trip south.</p><p>There, they met with Dr. Heather Lynch, an evolutionary biologist from Stony Brook University, who was just returning from a similar expedition. She and Naveen have long partnered in this penguin research.</p><p>DR. HEATHER LYNCH, Stony Brook University: Some species are going to be major climate change winners, and there are going to be others species that are no longer able to thrive on the Antarctic Peninsula.</p><p>And the changes that we have seen have been so rapid, that it`s really important that we`re down here every year to monitor them.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The research teams hitch rides on the various tourist ships willing to give them a lift to the bottom of the world.</p><p>And for more than two weeks, we followed Naveen and Humphries on this remarkable continent, as they trudged through snow, hiked up rocky peaks, and went into areas few humans are allowed to see.</p><p>The three different species they have been tracking here are Adelies, with the distinct white circle round their eyes, chinstraps, named for that thin marking across their faces, and gentoos, with the orange beaks.</p><p>GRANT HUMPHRIES, Seabird Biologist: Antarctic penguins are just unbelievable animals. They have been around for 60 million years.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Grant Humphries says these birds have long survived and thrived in some of the most inhospitable terrain on the planet.</p><p>GRANT HUMPHRIES: They look like rugby balls, you know?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GRANT HUMPHRIES: They just don`t look like they`re made for anything, and here we are on top of this hill here. They have come up from the water and hiked up through deep snow, up over the rocks and all that to get up here. And it`s not like they have hands. I mean, it is spectacular how hardy these animals are.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The sound that we hear them making, when they put their head up, and make that cry, what are they doing there?</p><p>RON NAVEEN: They`re displaying one to another, hee-haw, hee-haw, the donkey call of the penguin.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But are they communicating something with that?</p><p>RON NAVEEN: This is my nest. You`re my mate. This is my territory.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In the summer, when it`s a balmy 20 to 30 degrees out, the birds seek out some clear ground, where they build these piles of rocks for nests.</p><p>After their chicks hatch, the penguins head back to sea for the winter. Penguins are generally monogamous. Roughly 80 to 90 percent stick together for life. That doesn`t mean, though, that when they come back to nest each summer, it`s all marital bliss.</p><p>RON NAVEEN: The male will come back, claim his rocks, and start displaying. And, hopefully...</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That`s the come hither, ladies, sound?</p><p>RON NAVEEN: Come back to me, my lady from last year. And she hopefully will show up within 10 or 14 days. And, if she doesn`t, he`s going to take and get it on with whatever available female comes by.</p><p>I mean, he`s ready to go. And, of course, you see these fights, which are presumably between the two females when wife number one shows up late, finds somebody else in the house, and they have a battle royal.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Because she wants to be back with her mate from before?</p><p>RON NAVEEN: Well, she doesn`t understand who this other bird is that is sitting in the nest, and he`s got a lot of explaining to do.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Life here for the birds has never been easy. There are predators everywhere, from the sea, like this leopard seal, and from the sky, like these skuas flying overhead, constantly raiding penguin nests.</p><p>But now they`re facing a host of new threats. Krill, the tiny shrimp-like creatures which are the penguins` main food source, are declining. They`re being heavily fished to supply the booming fish-supplement industry, and everything down here eats krill, including the resurgent population of whales.</p><p>But climate change is also believed to be harming them. That`s forcing penguins to dive deeper and travel further in hopes of finding food. The warming on the peninsula is also causing another, seemingly contradictory effect, more snowfall, which makes it harder for the birds to breed.</p><p>That seems counterintuitive, that a warming environment brings more cold snow.</p><p>GRANT HUMPHRIES: Yes.</p><p>The interaction between that warmer air and the cold sea surface temperature means that you`re actually getting sort of more evaporation. You`re getting rain. You`re getting snow, things that wouldn`t normally happen on the peninsula over the course of a whole season.</p><p>And that heavy snowfall prevents these birds from being able to breed, because it packs down on top of them. The nests fail.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It`s all led to a rapid decline for the birds on the peninsula. Adelie populations have dropped by nearly 75 percent since 1990. Chinstraps have in some locations dropped by half.</p><p>GRANT HUMPHRIES: We`re quite concerned about Adelies and chinstraps. We`re seeing colonies that are getting close to blinking out, and it could very well be likely that, in our lifetime, we will see Adelie and chinstrap penguin completely disappear from the Antarctic Peninsula.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But, remarkably, the gentoos are actually thriving. Their numbers have grown six-fold over the same period.</p><p>Researchers believe it`s because they have adapted and are now eating more fish, instead of krill. And, as the breeding season gets harder, they`re re-laying their eggs a second time.</p><p>DR. HEATHER LYNCH: There`s a real lesson for us, that, as people, as communities, as cities, we`re all going to have to figure out what`s going to work in the future. And it may look very different than what`s worked in the past.</p><p>RON NAVEEN: Penguins are us, you might say. They breathe the same air. They have to have food, a good home, a good environment. If one of those falls out of synch, it`s troubling.</p><p>So, my question, you might say, in a very general, euphemistic way, are we going to be gentoos in the future, or are we going to have a sinking population, like some of the chinstrap and Adelie populations?</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Meaning, are we going to figure out either how to stop this warming or how to adapt to it?</p><p>RON NAVEEN: I don`t know if we`re going to be able to stop it. What I have been focusing a lot upon is whether we`re going to be able to adapt.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At 73, Ron Naveen is also learning to adapt. New technologies like drones and satellites are now used to count penguin colonies from above.</p><p>But he says old-fashioned manual counters like him will always be needed to verify what`s happening on the ground. And even after all these years, he admits that saying goodbye to this magical place is never easy.</p><p>RON NAVEEN: I get very wistful and teary-eyed, to be honest. It`s my last day in the Antarctic for this season. I do want to come back. I`m intending to come back. I have been doing this forever.</p><p>I want -- I`m not ready to hang up the penguin clicker. But I will have a few moments later this afternoon with my favorite guys, sitting down there communing with them. And I will go back to the ship and have a big fat smile on my face. I`m the luckiest guy on the planet.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m William Brangham in Antarctica.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Across the country, there are deserts of news. Local newspapers print fewer pages less frequently, and, in some cases, collapse entirely.</p><p>Recent studies paint a grim picture of the decline in local newspapers and the impact that is having on our politics.</p><p>Jeffrey Brown has our look.</p><p>A recent report by PEN America was titled \"Losing the News: The Decimation of Local News and the Search for Solutions.\"</p><p>And the evidence comes in newsroom jobs lost and papers shut down. According to the report, at least 200 counties in the U.S. have no newspaper at all.</p><p>The Internet, of course, helped change the economics of the news business, as advertising migrated online, and the Internet offers new ways for all of us to get news. But what`s happening and what`s been lost at the local level?</p><p>For that, I`m joined by Chuck Plunkett. He`s a former editorial page editor for The Denver Post. In 2018, he protested layoffs of the newsroom staff after the paper was taken over by a hedge fund. He`s now director of the News Corps at the University of Colorado Boulder, a media program for student journalists.</p><p>And Charles Sennott, a veteran journalist and now founder and CEO of The GroundTruth Project, a nonprofit media organization that founded Report for America, which helps train and place reporters in local newsrooms.</p><p>And welcome to both of you.</p><p>Charlie Sennott, help us define the problem and its causes. How do you describe -- in broad terms, how do you describe the current situation?</p><p>CHARLES SENNOTT, Founder, The GroundTruth Project: I think the crisis in journalism in America has become a real crisis for our democracy.</p><p>So, as you pointed out, there are newsrooms across the country that are seeing their staffs decimated. We are seeing communities where their news organizations have just closed up and gone away. There are 2,000 newspapers that have completely shut down, 2,000 communities without a newspaper anymore; 1,300 no longer have any local news coverage at all, no one watching the store, from small towns to medium-sized cities.</p><p>When we lose 30,000 reporting jobs, as we have in the last 10 years, what we lose is an ability for us to have a shared set of facts on a local level, and for us to have a civic debate on a local level. And I think we`re really seeing a fraying of communities as a result.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: So, Chuck Plunkett, you have -- you have seen this up close, put it in specific, even personal terms. What`s not getting covered? What are we missing?</p><p>CHUCK PLUNKETT, Former Editorial Page Editor, The Denver Post: I mean, here in Denver, it`s a perfect example. And it`s happened across the country.</p><p>When I started at The Post in 2003, there were nearly 300 journalists. And now there are 70. And that means there are fewer reporters covering the city hall, covering the statehouse, covering the important beats like cops and business.</p><p>Studies have shown that, when there are fewer reporters in communities, that corruption inevitably starts to grow, taxes start to go up, voter participation starts to drop.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: I mentioned, of course, the changing business model. And you both have watched that.</p><p>So, in the interim, in some of the solutions -- Charlie, you`re addressing one of them as part of this nonprofit movement. Tell us what you -- tell us about your project.</p><p>CHARLES SENNOTT: Sure.</p><p>So, what we`re trying to say is, we need to have a movement to confront this challenge to local reporting in America. So we started Report for America as a real service project to say, this is a call to service for a new generation of journalists to come forward and serve these local communities.</p><p>As Chuck pointed out, there`s greet needs to cover education, to cover health issues, to cover rural areas where no one is really having their story told.</p><p>So what we are trying to do is create a kind of a Teach for America or City Year for journalism and to deploy young journalists in the host newsroom. Those host newsrooms will now take in 250 Report for America corps members, as we call them.</p><p>And we`re really trying to put boots on the ground, so that we can say the best way to confront this crisis is going to be with real human beings doing real reporting and answering that need.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Chuck, if the economics don`t work so well anymore, the way they traditionally did for your industry, is it only projects like that, nonprofit, experimental, relatively small, even if trying to -- even if having an impact in?</p><p>CHUCK PLUNKETT: Every little bit helps, Jeff.</p><p>But I fear that we need something much bigger than that, that for years and years and years, before the rise of the Internet and things like Craigslist and Facebook, the rule of thumb was that traditional newspapers got 80 percent of their revenue from pricey print ads and classifieds and things like that.</p><p>And so now, when ads shift to online and people can go to Craigslist, that revenue just evaporates. So, The Denver Post, that had top level editors and top level reporters and investigative reporters and photojournalists, and the whole ballpark, suddenly, you find them in a situation where they need a lot more money to be able to pay the bills.</p><p>And trying to go this subscription model or the nonprofit model, the different courageous experiments that you`re seeing out there, isn`t really getting the job done.</p><p>I came around to the idea that a public funding option to help subsidize, to help backfill some of that 80 percent of the revenue that has been lost is going to be critically important to keeping our democracy alive and healthy.</p><p>And we need our watchdogs. We need the people who are journalistically trained to get out there. You need a source that you can go to that`s reliable, that speaks for the community, that`s been trusted and is considered one of the most plugged-in members of the community, like a Denver Post.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: We`re talking economics, of course, but we`re also in a time where journalism, journalists are -- these are contested areas. Facts and truth are contested.</p><p>And you`re both now working with young people. You`re working with what you hope is a new generation of journalists.</p><p>Charlie, what do you say to people coming into this?</p><p>CHARLES SENNOTT: What we say to young people is, look, you can go into a community, and you can be of service to that community, and you can change things.</p><p>Right now, too many communities have no one watching the store. There`s great journalism that can be done to go out into these communities and uncover really important stories that matter to the community.</p><p>So, Jeff, you and I came of an age when journalism had a big future to it, and you could get into these jobs. We want to restore the pipeline for a new generation of journalists to come forward. And we really want to urge them to apply.</p><p>You go to ReportforAmerica.org and apply for these positions.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Chuck, you`re working at a university now, so you`re with young people. What are they coming to you for, and what are you saying to them?</p><p>CHUCK PLUNKETT: Our students have a lot of passion. They look at the world that they live in, and they fear that it`s chaotic, and that it`s full of tricksters.</p><p>And a lot of -- as much as the Internet gives us wonderful information and tools to use, it also brings a lot of mischievous activity. And they look at the state of the country, and they see that there`s a lot of disconnect and a lot of anger.</p><p>And they have a real passion for wanting to do something about it and get involved and be able to develop the skills that it takes to go far beyond the kind of citizen journalism that`s needed.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Chuck Plunkett and Charles Sennott, thank you both very much, and happy new year.</p><p>CHUCK PLUNKETT: Happy new year to you.</p><p>CHARLES SENNOTT: Thank you. Happy new year.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Global water supply faces constant and worsening threats: rising temperatures, overconsumption, poor management.</p><p>It`s a challenge pushing scientists, politicians and designers to seek innovations that could lead to new sources of water.</p><p>John Yang has this encore report.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Situated on the edge of the Sahara in Southern Morocco, Mount Boutmezguida gets only about five inches of rain a year. But what it lacks in rain, it makes up for in fog, which blankets the area for about half the year.</p><p>So that`s where residents have now turned for their water, harvesting it from fog. Alongside scientists from the German Water Foundation, the Moroccan non-profit Dar Si Hmad has set up what`s said to be the largest fog collection project in the world, about 19,000 square feet of nets called cloud fishers.</p><p>As fog rolls through, the mesh traps freshwater, which drips into a receptacle. A network of pipes takes it to the villages below, where about 1,000 people every day use it for drinking and watering plants and animals.</p><p>Jamila Bargach is director of Dar Si Hmad.</p><p>JAMILA BARGACH, Director, Dar Si Hmad: The fact of having water has radically transformed the life of the women, who used to walk for hours to get water, one and two. There was always the fear of not having enough water. Right now, that fear is not there anymore.</p><p>JOHN YANG: But in other places, the fear remains.</p><p>Experts say there`s a global water crisis, with at least two-thirds of the population living in areas that lack water one month a year or more. This summer, Chennai, India, has had to rely on water deliveries from tanker trucks.</p><p>A poor monsoon season left all the city`s reservoirs dry.</p><p>BETSY OTTO, World Resources Institute: The relationship between water supply on the one hand and water demand on the other hand.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Betsy Otto directs the World Resources Institute`s Global Water Program.</p><p>BETSY OTTO: We`re seeing really significant shifts, much more erratic rainfall. Snowpack and glaciers that have been very important sources of slow-release water to much of the world are disappearing. So we`re seeing really significant changes from global climate change.</p><p>JOHN YANG: While collecting water from fog may sound revolutionary, it`s actually an ancient technique and one found in nature.</p><p>An African beetle species captures fog droplets with small bumps on its back. And archaeologists have found evidence it was used centuries ago in the Middle East and South America.</p><p>How can we get as much water as possible from fog today? With climate change and high consumption making water scarcity a growing problem around the world, researchers are tackling that question.</p><p>One technique is being tested here at this farm at Virginia Tech.</p><p>BROOK KENNEDY, Virginia Tech: We`re fog harvesting.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Industrial design professor Brook Kennedy is part of the team that developed the Fog Harp. It uses tightly placed vertical wires, as opposed to crisscrossing mesh.</p><p>BROOK KENNEDY: Either they tend to be too open, so a lot of fog passes through them, or they`re too tightly woven, and so the fog droplets get stuck. What we have done differently here is that we have removed the horizontal wires, and this prevents the water droplets from getting stuck. So they quickly, through gravity, drop away.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Tests have found this design to be at least three times more effective at capturing water than traditional nets.</p><p>For Kennedy, this was a case of biologically-inspired design, influenced, in part at least, by California redwoods. The towering trees draw most of their water from fog accumulating on their needles.</p><p>BROOK KENNEDY: The solution isn`t embedded with circuits and other high- tech accoutrements or features. It`s a fairly simple solution, but yet, by just tweaking meaningfully the design, really at a small scale, the results are rather dramatic.</p><p>What would their visual form be?</p><p>JOHN YANG: The team is now working on the next generation of fog harps, making them sturdier, more colorful, exploring the best wiring material. Within a few years, the plan is to test hundreds of harps in places battling water scarcity, like Peru or South Africa.</p><p>In Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT scientists are trying to take the innovations surrounding fog collection even further. They have discovered that zapping air rich in fog with a beam of electrically charged particles draws the droplets toward the mesh, dramatically increasing its ability to collect water.</p><p>MAN: Right now, the system is off. So you can see that this plume can pass through the mesh unaffected, and then it goes around. But when we turn the electric field on, the plume vanishes instantaneously and then water starts collecting on that mesh.</p><p>JOHN YANG: The idea is to use the system on power plant cooling towers.</p><p>Almost 40 percent of all freshwater taken from U.S. rivers, lakes and reservoirs is set aside for that critical purpose.</p><p>MIT mechanical engineering professor Kripa Varanasi leads the team.</p><p>KRIPA VARANASI, MIT: We have been able to fundamentally change the trajectory of these droplets. In fact, we saw these drops that are going away make a U-turn and come back. And so we went from a half to a couple of percent efficiency to almost 100 percent efficiency.</p><p>JOHN YANG: While both the projects are promising, the expert, the scientist, and the designer agree: Water innovation must be coupled with better water management.</p><p>BETSY OTTO: We`re going to have to find new ways of storing it or capturing it in places that used to have more water than they will now have.</p><p>Yes, it`s important to have those technologies, but that alone is not enough.</p><p>KRIPA VARANASI: Water is a very passionate topic for me, coming from India, where water is a major crisis.</p><p>It`s a big societal problem and not as simple you have a power plant, I can sell you this thing.</p><p>BROOK KENNEDY: It`s not going to be the only measure that needs to be taken. I mean, I think conservation, in combination with other techniques, working in unison, will help us tackle water scarcity.</p><p>JOHN YANG: That combination may mean the difference between losing or maintaining one of the most basic elements of life on Earth.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m John Yang.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: And that is the \"NewsHour\" for tonight. I`m Nick Schifrin.</p><p>Join us online and again here tomorrow evening. For all of us at the \"PBS NewsHour,\" happy new year. I hope you had a good day.</p><p>Thank you, and see you soon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSHR-2020010100cb112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSHR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWF-BMM1-DXH2-62BY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152462</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8869\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MacNeil/Lehrer Productions All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>PBS NewsHour (formerly The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 1, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002D8B</classCode><className>INDEPENDENT TELEVISION NEWS LTD</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Antarctica</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Iraq</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Iran</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Violence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>North Korea</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kim Jong-un</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nuclear Weapons</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

I`m Amna Nawaz. Judy Woodruff is away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the \"NewsHour\" tonight: the realities of resurgence. As COVID-19 cases continue to spike, officials are reimposing restrictions and asking residents to act responsibly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then: rollbacks. Some major policy changes from the Trump administration you might have missed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus: inequality exposed. The racial gap in COVID-19 death rates reveals a health system that`s long failed black Americans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">REV. HORACE SHEFFIELD, New Destiny Christian Fellowship: Because of the hue of our skin, you know, we`re being treated differently than other people. And COVID-19 just vividly portrays just how that exists.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: All that and more on tonight`s \"PBS NewsHour.\"</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: The list of pandemic victims keeps getting longer tonight, with 3.5 million cases nationwide. And the political fallout keeps growing for President Trump.</p><p>Meanwhile, the issue of face masks has become a front-line fight for a key state this November.</p><p>Lisa Desjardins begins our coverage.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: In Georgia, a political collision over life-and-death decisions.</p><p>As the virus surges, overnight, Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed an order banning any public mask requirements, that in direct conflict with several cities and towns which have ordered masks be worn.</p><p>Today, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she is keeping her mask order in place.</p><p>KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS (D), Mayor of Atlanta, Georgia: It`s a simple thing to do. It`s an easy thing to do. And we will just continue to push and ask people to do it, despite the disagreements that we may have.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: This one day after President Trump visited the state, praising Kemp and reopening to a local TV station.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States: You have reopened, and you`re just -- you`re getting close to 100 percent open, and you have really kept the virus, the level, down, which is an incredible tribute to a lot of good, talented people.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: In fact, the virus has grown in Georgia, with near record case totals yesterday.</p><p>Now indications the crisis overall is taking a deeper political toll on President Trump. Mr. Trump replaced his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, yesterday with a top adviser, Bill Stepien.</p><p>The shakeup comes as his campaign grapples with declining poll numbers. In the past week, separate polls put presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden ahead of Mr. Trump in four key battleground states, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Florida, and North Carolina, all states the president won in 2016.</p><p>This as, nationwide, Mr. Trump faces doubt on his top issue, jobs, where his approval rating is down to just 36 percent. But on the White House lawn today, economic adviser Larry Kudlow pointed to Wall Street and expressed cautious optimism.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, Director, National Economic Council: The pandemic is a temporary natural disaster. The market is now up almost 45 percent from the March lows.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: Democratic speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called for Republican senators to push for a larger national response from the White House.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): This is such a massive dereliction of duty. People are dying. And so what we are saying to the Senate, join us in asking a president to use executive action for good, instead of ill.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: Criticism now is openly boiling over from the president`s own party.</p><p>In a Washington Post op-ed, Republican Governor of Maryland Larry Hogan detailed what he called a jarring lack of response and even interference from President Trump that he said left governors hopeless and states in danger.</p><p>Hogan wrote: \"While other countries were racing ahead with well-coordinated regimes, the Trump administration bungled the effort.\"</p><p>White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany rejected the criticism.</p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, White House Press Secretary: This is revisionist history by Governor Hogan, and it stands in stark contrast to what he said on March 19, where he praised the great communication that the president has had with governors.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: All of this as the upcoming Republican National Convention is in murky waters, too. The Grand Old Party announced it is scaling back, limiting attendance to 2,500 for the first three days, and about 7,000 for the final day, when President Trump attends, that as COVID- 19 cases in host state Florida surge.</p><p>Today, another grim record there, with the most daily COVID-related deaths yet recorded. New data show that nearly one-third of all kids tested in the Sunshine State have been positive for the virus.</p><p>While there are hot spots, the problem is growing nationwide. In the past two weeks, cases of coronavirus have increased in some 41 states across the U.S.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Lisa Desjardins.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Georgia Governor Brian Kemp`s order has put the issue of masks front and center in that state.</p><p>With me now is Kelly Girtz. He is a Democrat and the mayor of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, which moved to require people to wear masks in public earlier this month.</p><p>Mayor Girtz, welcome to the \"NewsHour,\" and thanks for making the time.</p><p>I want to ask you about some late news we have just gotten about Governor Brian Kemp and the state attorney general suing the Atlanta mayor, Keisha Bottoms, and the City Council for their requirement for public mask wearing. What is your reaction to that?</p><p>KELLY GIRTZ (D), Mayor of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia: Amna, this has all been so deeply frustrating.</p><p>We simply want to create a platform for health and safety for the local population. I have been in constant contact with Mayor Bottoms and other mayors throughout the state.</p><p>And, in lieu of action on a statewide basis, as we have seen in other Republican-led states like Alabama and Arkansas, we need to act as local boots on the ground who are keeping people in our communities safe.</p><p>We are going to continue with our order in Athens-Clarke County, as Mayor Bottoms has also indicated she is going to do, and Mayor Davis in Augusta and Mayor Johnson in Savannah, because we understand that, as science has demonstrated over the last many months, it is simply safer to have a mask on for those around you.</p><p>The droplet dispersement, the aerosol dispersement is diminished by use of a mask. And so we`re going to follow this. And I have to say--</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Mayor Girtz, let me -- let me just ask you, if I can. I apologize, sir, I know your time is limited.</p><p>But even the head of Georgia`s Restaurant Association has said it`s confusing for people to have different rules in different counties. You need one set of guidelines. Let businesses decide if they should require masks.</p><p>What do you say to that?</p><p>KELLY GIRTZ: It`s been interesting, because large and very small retailers have said to me, we like a mask order, because that sets a citywide or a countywide standard, and so we know, from one block to another, one vendor to another, the public is going to have the same experience.</p><p>We`re also the flagship host for the University of Georgia here in the state. And just a couple of weeks ago, the university system indicated that every student, faculty member and staff member was going to have to wear a mask in interior spaces at the University of Georgia and in all other public universities in the state.</p><p>And so what we want to do is be able to provide the same solid foundation on campus and off campus here in Athens.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Mayor Girtz, let me ask you.</p><p>Both your hospitals in Athens were full yesterday. You had to divert patients to other facilities. Experts say you are not yet at your peak. Do you have what you need now to meet the moment and to handle the influx of patients?</p><p>KELLY GIRTZ: Unfortunately, we don`t have what we need.</p><p>The hospitals are very nimble, and they`re able to open up some overflow wards interior to their spaces. But it`s taken longer to get test kits here. And it`s taken much longer to get test results here.</p><p>People call me every day here in my office and say, I`m feeling sick, I have come into contact with somebody who`s COVID-positive, and it`s going to take me five days to even get an appointment to get a test.</p><p>And then I`m hearing that it`s taking somewhere between four days and eight days to get results after that test. That`s antithetical to the kind of things that need to happen. I mean, I sit here in front of you, and I wonder, can I get annexed into Germany or at least North Carolina?</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Mayor Girtz, I should mention, as you said, students are coming back to campus at the University of Georgia next month.</p><p>With all this confusion over which rule stands on the face masks, in a matter of seconds, are you worried about compliance and the virus spiking in a few weeks?</p><p>KELLY GIRTZ: Absolutely.</p><p>Here we are in July, and we haven`t even had the student population return. I wonder very much, where are we going to be in September in October and November, when more people are inside, and not in outdoor spaces?</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: That is Mayor Kelly Girtz of Athens-Clarke County in Georgia.</p><p>Thank you so much for your time. Please stay safe.</p><p>KELLY GIRTZ: Thank you, Amna.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: In the days other news: The U.S., Canada and Britain accused Russian hackers of trying to steal research on possible COVID-19 vaccines. The three nations said a group known as Cozy Bear, linked to Russian intelligence, is targeting academic and pharmaceutical groups. It`s unclear whether any information was actually stolen.</p><p>The FBI announced today it is investigating a sweeping security breach at Twitter. That comes after hackers accessed high-profile accounts on Wednesday, including Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Bill Gates and Kanye West, among others. They then tweeted from those accounts, promoting the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. We will get more details on this and the alleged Russian hacking of COVID research later in the program.</p><p>The European Union`s top court has voided an agreement that let big tech companies share data on E.U. citizens with the U.S. Privacy activists in Europe welcomed the decision.</p><p>Austrian activist Max Schrems said he hopes the two governments will guarantee that users` data is protected in the U.S. as strongly as it is in Europe.</p><p>MAX SCHREMS, Activist: Silicon Valley will simply realize that either U.S. laws are going to be changed to a certain extent, or they will literally have to move a lot of their operation to Europe and even split their systems into two parts.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: The case grew out of disclosures by Edward Snowden, a former contractor at the U.S. National Security Agency. In 2013, Snowden revealed that Facebook was giving U.S. security groups access to European users` data.</p><p>The Vatican is telling bishops they should report all claims of clergy sexual abuse to police, even if local law does not require it. That new guidance issued today aims to force church leaders to investigate such cases. It also urges them not to dismiss allegations made anonymously through social media.</p><p>For the second time this week, the United States has executed a federal death row inmate. Wesley Ira Purkey died by lethal injection today at a federal prison in Indiana. He`d been convicted in 2003 of kidnapping and murdering a teenage girl in Kansas City. This week`s federal executions are the nation`s first in 17 years.</p><p>The Trump administration fired off new warnings about China today, in a growing pressure campaign. Attorney General William Barr said Americans have become too reliant on Chinese goods and services. And in Grand Rapids, Michigan, he accused the ruling Chinese Communist Party of mounting a -- quote -- \"economic blitzkrieg\" to get ahead of the United States.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, U.S. Attorney General: Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of communist China`s -- Chinese drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Already this week, the U.S. stripped Hong Kong of preferential trading status. It also rejected Chinese claims in the South China Sea and imposed travel curbs on employees of the telecom giant Huawei. Beijing said today it will stand up to what it called gangster logic.</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court today refused to intervene in a fight over convicted felons` right to vote in Florida. A state law requires that they pay all court costs, fines and restitution before they can vote. A lower court had upheld that law, and the Supreme Court has now left that order in place.</p><p>The head of Medicaid and Medicare, Seema Verma, is under fire over alleged mismanagement of $6 million in communications contracts. An inspector general`s report says she let a Republican media consultant have too much authority over federal employees. Verma says the findings are based on -- quote -- \"unsubstantiated assumptions\" and incomplete analysis.</p><p>The pro football team in Washington, D.C., is facing allegations of long- running sexual harassment. The Washington Post reports tonight 15 former employees, female employees, say they suffered suggestive comments, verbal abuse and sexual overtures. They say it was routinely ignored or condoned.</p><p>The Post reports, three top employees with the franchise who have resigned in the past week are among those accused. The team says it has hired a law firm to investigate.</p><p>In economic news, another 1.3 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the last week. That`s unchanged from a week earlier.</p><p>On Wall Street, the jobless news helped to push stocks lower. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 135 points to close at 26731. The Nasdaq fell 76 points, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped 11.</p><p>Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": the Trump administration rolls back environmental reviews to speed up construction; a widespread hack of high- profile Twitter accounts exposes big tech`s weak points; the racial gap in COVID-19 death rates reveals a health care system failing black Americans; and much more.</p><p>Over the last few months, the global pandemic and worldwide protests for racial justice have dominated headlines.</p><p>But at the same time, the Trump administration has been pushing through its campaign promises to roll back environmental regulations, scale back immigration, and scrap financial protections.</p><p>President Trump held an event on the South Lawn today to tout his progress.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States: Before I came into office, American workers were smothered by a merciless avalanche of wasteful and expensive and intrusive federal regulation.</p><p>These oppressive, burdensome mandates were a stealth tax on our people, slashing take-home pay, suppressing innovation, surging the costs of goods, and shipping millions of American jobs overseas. We ended this regulatory assault on the American worker, and we launched the most dramatic regulatory relief campaign in American history, by far.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: We want to take a step back now and take a deeper look at some those big policy shifts over the last few weeks.</p><p>For that, I`m joined by our White House correspondent, Yamiche Alcindor.</p><p>Yamiche, it`s good to see you.</p><p>Let`s start with what we reported just yesterday on the president rolling back a longstanding environmental regulation. What exactly happened there?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Well, we`re really living through a chaotic and historic time, and the president has been laser-focused on trying to get conservative wins and really ticking off a conservative to-do list.</p><p>And in that, what we saw was the president reversing some 100 environmental rules. So, just yesterday, he focused on the National Environmental Policy Act. Now, this is a policy that dates back 50 years. President Richard Nixon signed this law.</p><p>And what it said was that federal agencies were required to look at how an infrastructure project would impact the environment and the climate before approving a project. President Trump said this was too much red tape. It led to a lot of delays, he said, for things like highways and pipelines and power plants. And, as a result, he`s doing away with that rule.</p><p>Opponents of the president`s actions say that this is really bad, because communities, including low-income communities, they won`t have a say on whether or not things like a highway rips through their neighborhoods, and maybe hurts the environment around them.</p><p>But the president is adamant that deregulation is a top priority for him. And even today, of course, he`s in the White House -- on the White House lawn talking about how deregulation was a key part of why he should be reelected and why he felt like he was doing all the things that conservatives elected him to do.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Yamiche, you just mentioned some 100 other environmental regulations? What else should people know about?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Well, the president has really been taking off so many things when it comes to environmental deregulation.</p><p>But I want to focus on two. The first has to do with commercial fishing. This is an Obama era rule that was created. It was about 5,000 miles about 130 miles off the coast of Cape Cod. President Obama said that there should be no commercial fishing in that area. Environmentalists said that was to protect animals like whales and others from being hurt.</p><p>But commercial fishermen really pushed back on that and said that this was about their livelihood. President Trump is now saying that that fishing can continue on, and that people should be allowed to fish in that area.</p><p>The second thing I want to point to is another Obama era rule. And this had to do with Alaskan bears and how animals in Alaska can be hunted. So, the Obama administration said that you should not be allowed to bait grizzly bears with things like bacon-soaked doughnuts, or you shouldn`t also be able to blind hibernating mother bears or their cubs and then shoot them, or even shoot swimming caribou.</p><p>But the Trump administration is saying all of those things should be allowed. So, they`re rolling back that policy. And hunters say that this is a good thing for them, because they see this as an infringement on their rights.</p><p>But environmentalists say that this is really cruel to the animals and that the Trump administration is allowing things that are inhumane to happen to these animals.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: So, there`s another central campaign pledge from President Trump, and that was to reform immigration and our immigration system.</p><p>What has he been doing, and what`s the administration been doing on that front?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Well, of course, the president has made immigration a central part of his administration. And it is a central part of his reelection campaign.</p><p>So, in this regard, the president has been looking at building the wall on the southern border. And the head of the Department of Homeland Security said that they are going to be bypassing some 26 or more environmental rules as they seek to build more and more of the wall.</p><p>And, as a result, things like the Clean Water Act and other things are not going to be things that they`re going to be looking at as they try to put new barrier up on the southern border.</p><p>Opponents of this say that this is going to really hurt communities, it`s going to hurt the environment to try to get this goal that President Trump has.</p><p>Another thing that the president and the Trump administration is doing is looking at asylum seekers. So there`s been a lot of talk from President Trump about illegal immigration, but this is targeting legal immigration.</p><p>And in this case, they`re using the coronavirus pandemic and saying that asylum seekers might be denied asylum in the United States if they`re seen as a public health risk. That could mean that they went through a country that has an outbreak of the coronavirus.</p><p>It is, of course, important to note that the United States is leading when it comes to coronavirus cases. And there are opponents of the president who say that this is really the president chipping away at legal immigration. He`s done so much when it comes to asylum seekers, including making them remain in Mexico, as we have noted on this show.</p><p>But this is focusing specifically on asylum seekers and their health.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: And, Yamiche, you have been tracking a number of other underreported policy changes in the last several weeks.</p><p>What else do people need to know about? What else has changed?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: One other big change that happened is that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, they`re doing away with this Obama era rule that said that these payday lenders -- these are, of course, short-term high-interest loans that people take out if they`re in need -- that they -- that these lenders will no longer have to look at whether or not the people they`re taking out these loans, whether or not they will be able to pay these loans back, so looking at their income and their ability to pay back.</p><p>Opponents of the president`s actions say that this is going to put a low- income people and people of color and single parents, a lot of the people who take out these loans, that it`s going to put them in a cycle of debt, because they`re not going to be able to pay back these loans.</p><p>And, as a result, they`re going to have to take out another loan to pay that loan back. But people who are supportive of the president`s rules and his changes, they say that this is going to allow more credit to be accessed to low-income people who need it.</p><p>It is a controversial rule. It`s something that Senator Elizabeth Warren pushed for to get, and now she`s blasting the Trump administration for doing away with it.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Yamiche, when you look at the body of all these decisions, all these changes, what can you tell us about why President Trump is making these moves?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: President Trump is focused on trying to give conservatives something that they feel good about.</p><p>So the president has been facing all sorts of backlash on his handling of the coronavirus. Just recently, the Republican governor, Larry Hogan, put out a pretty scathing op-ed, where he said that the president is not taking care of governors all across this country. But, in this case, these rules are meant to kind of throw a little red meat to the base.</p><p>Something else that`s important is that this is all happening as the president is changing up his own administration and changing up his own campaign. In this case, he got a new campaign manager. And that`s, in some ways, hinting at the fact that he`s worried about his standing in the race, as we see polls in battleground states showing that the president is behind Joe Biden.</p><p>Another thing to note is that the president is really trying to make sure that conservatives feel that he is being loyal to the things that he promised. This -- deregulation was a big thing that the president promised, including judicial nominees.</p><p>And he`s -- he has done some of these things that makes conservatives feel like, even if I don`t like the brashness and the tweets, the president is in some ways doing what conservatives want him to do.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: All with just months to go before the election.</p><p>That is our White House correspondent, Yamiche Alcindor.</p><p>Thanks, Yamiche.</p><p>We return now to the two cyber-intrusion stories, the hacking of Twitter and the allegation that Russians tried to access vaccine research.</p><p>So, what does all this mean for social media security and for the upcoming election?</p><p>Here`s William Brangham.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Amna, a stark warning came last night from the U.K., the U.S. and Canada: Not only were Russian operatives trying to steal information about the development of a coronavirus vaccine, but it was being done by the same Russian intelligence unit that hacked into the Democratic National Committee back during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>The British foreign secretary also said Russian agents attempted to interfere in last year`s British general election.</p><p>And Twitter suffered a serious intrusion last night. The accounts of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg, and other high-profile people were all taken over by hackers. The hackers tried to get people to pay money to them in the cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin.</p><p>We look at these broader issues that are brought up by these with two experts who are familiar with the methods used, the possible damage and the threat to our democracy.</p><p>Nina Jankowicz is the author of \"How to Lose the Information War\" and a fellow at The Wilson Center, which is a Washington-based think tank. And Dmitri Alperovitch, he traced the 2016 DNC hack to Russian intelligence while he was at a cybersecurity firm hired to investigate that breach. He`s now starting a nonprofit that focuses on cybersecurity and trade.</p><p>Welcome to you both. Thank you very much for being here.</p><p>Dmitri, to you first.</p><p>About this Twitter hack, can you just give us a sense, what is it that we know happened?</p><p>DMITRI ALPEROVITCH, Co-Founder and CEO, CrowdStrike: Well, we actually have some breaking news to reveal just in the last few minutes before we went on the air.</p><p>And that is that we may have possible attribution to who may have been behind this attack. This is the worst breach of social media platform on record. And it was quite devastating to Twitter itself, because what the attackers did is, they managed to get access to an internal tool within Twitter known as God Mode that allows internal Twitter employees to manage accounts of anyone on the platform.</p><p>And what it allowed the attackers to do is take over an account, being able to log in as that user, being able to obviously send out tweets, but also potentially look at direct messages that that person may be engaged in, reset the passwords, change their e-mail addresses and the like.</p><p>And what looks like have happened is that someone had gained access to that internal tool, potentially by social engineering Twitter employees, and getting access to that internal Twitter network, and then started reselling access to individual accounts on Twitter.</p><p>So, we may actually have a number of criminal organizations and individuals that have used that access, that have bought it for about $250 in the underground channels, to try to take over accounts of both celebrities and major political figures, in order to perpetrate this Bitcoin scam, but also potentially to do other nefarious things.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, Dmitri, that`s some obviously interesting developments we`re learning about just this evening.</p><p>Nina, to you.</p><p>This is not the first time that Twitter has been breached. We saw the CEO, Jack Dorsey, of Twitter got his account hacked. This does not look good for Twitter, which is obviously an enormously important social media platform.</p><p>NINA JANKOWICZ, The Wilson Center: No, it doesn`t look good for Twitter. But, frankly, Twitter is not the only social media platform or the only tech platform or the only company that is dealing with poor data stewardship right now.</p><p>Facebook has had a number of breaches. In one, 90 million accounts were affected, when people used the view as function to exploit a loophole and gain access to accounts.</p><p>The list is very long. And I think this points to a need for some really good regulation, regulation that has teeth, so that our social media platforms that have so much information about our likes, our dislikes, our habits of engagement and consumption, our personal information, are held accountable when this data goes missing or when they aren`t protecting it to the degree that they ought to.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dmitri, is that your sense? Is there something that we could do to -- obviously, these warnings have been shooting off like red flares for years now.</p><p>What are we not doing to encourage and force -- force the hands of these companies to try to tighten up their security?</p><p>DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Well, I do think, when it comes to Twitter, they have had plenty of warnings.</p><p>In fact, just last year, a number of individuals were indicted by the FBI that were working inside Twitter on behalf of the Saudi government, and were providing the Saudi government with private information using their access on various dissidents that the Saudi government was interested in.</p><p>So Twitter had plenty of warnings that, not just criminal groups, but nation states, were interested in the data that the company has on individuals all over the world. So, they really needed to get their security up and monitor very, very closely access to these internal powerful applications that allow you to get private information, but also to take over accounts.</p><p>Clearly, something went wrong here, and more needs to be done.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Nina, let`s turn to this other allegation of cyber- intrusion, which is the allegation that the Russian security forces have been trying to penetrate the computers of companies that are developing coronavirus vaccines.</p><p>What do we know about what happened and what they -- what might have gone down there?</p><p>NINA JANKOWICZ: Well, what we know so far is that the same Russian group that hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016 was trying to gain access to intellectual property and supply chain information related to the vaccine development for the coronavirus.</p><p>So far, we don`t think any public health was affected, likely just economic impact. But this is really a scary indication of where we are in terms of countering Russian information operations. We have had for years to get it together, and we have done very, very little to deter Russia and other bad actors, of which there are many, from these sorts of exploits.</p><p>Not only are they trying to deal with coronavirus vaccine information. They`re also still trying to influence our elections, which are approaching ever more quickly. The U.S. government has not done enough to deter these organizations.</p><p>And the Trump administration instead has curried favor with Putin and trusted Putin`s word over the word of its intelligence community. I think this is a dereliction of duty. And, certainly, I think we all need to be very worried for what`s to come in November.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dmitri, you`re obviously familiar with this particular Russian unit. You have had some dealings with them, so to speak, in the past.</p><p>What is your sense of what they`re trying to get at? Were they simply trying to look at the development of the vaccine? Were they trying to steal something? What do we know about that?</p><p>DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: So, this is actually one of the units that was responsible for the hack of the DNC. And it`s not the most well-known unit</p><p>The one that everyone thinks of and the one that was indicted by the Justice Department a few years ago was known as GRU, Russian military intelligence, that not just -- didn`t just hack the e-mails, but also leaked them out publicly and provided them to WikiLeaks.</p><p>This is a different unit that went into the DNC year prior, and, as far as we know, was not responsible for any leaking of information. It was probably engaged just in political espionage on campaigns.</p><p>And it`s believed to be tied to SVR, Russian civilian intelligence agency, that was sort of the precursor -- the successor to the KGB. And I`m a lot less concerned, to be honest with you, about this particular attempted hack, because the reality is, every country in the world right now, every intelligence agency is probably tasked with getting information vaccine developments.</p><p>And I would certainly hope that the U.S. intelligence community is doing the same thing against Russia, China and anyone else that is working on vaccines, because it is in the interest of every country to develop a vaccine and solve this crisis as quickly as possible.</p><p>We have thousands of people that are dying every day. So, of all the things to be concerned about -- and there`s certainly plenty, and the Russians are doing a lot of nefarious things that we should be confronting -- this is ranking very, very low on my list of concerns.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Dmitri Alperovitch and Nina Jankowicz, thank you both very much for being here.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Now the second of a two-part Race Matters report from Paul Solman on how past and present inequalities have sapped the wealth and health of black Americans.</p><p>Last night, Paul focused on economic matters. Tonight, he looks at health outcomes, all magnified in the time of COVID.</p><p>His report is part of our ongoing series Making Sense.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Within 48 hours, Desmond Tolbert lost both mother and father to COVID-19.</p><p>DESMOND TOLBERT, Georgia Resident: Both your parents at the same time, it`s hard.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Back in April, black rural Georgia, where the Tolberts live, had some of America`s highest pandemic death rates, foreshadowing today`s stunning statistic, that black Americans are at least twice as likely to die of COVID-19 than whites, almost four times more likely when you control for the fact that the black population is younger.</p><p>REV.

So it`s been pretty tough.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Shafina Che`s husband, Dajuan Wiggens (ph), was 47.</p><p>SHAFINA CHE WIGGENS: He died March the 31st.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Why, if he`s only 47?</p><p>SHAFINA CHE WIGGENS: Well, he did have high blood pressure.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: And thus the puzzle that prompted this story: Why are African-Americans dying at a much higher rate than whites?</p><p>TREVON LOGAN, The Ohio State University: Factor one would be essential worker employment.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Economics explains a lot, says Professor Trevon Logan.</p><p>TREVON LOGAN: A second factor would be density of living arrangements and higher rates of public transportation use.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: As Marcus Thorpe put it of his 90-minute New York bus commute:</p><p>MARCUS THORPE, New York City Resident: If you don`t have a car, you got to get on something. You know what I`m saying?</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: And there are a number of other problems that threaten the health of black Americans broadly, like the food desert, which is L`Tanya Holley`s D.C. neighborhood.</p><p>L`TANYA HOLLEY, Maya Angelou Public Charter and Public Learning Center: There`s not a grocery store in this area. The urban farm up the street was closed down. So what are the people supposed to do? They have to eat.</p><p>MAINZA SNAPP, Detroit Resident: Where I grew up on the East Side, it`s not uncommon to see Coney Island McDonald`s, whatever, the fast-food restaurant.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: That`s Mainza Snapp of Detroit.</p><p>MAINZA SNAPP: And then you see the liquor stores everywhere promoting cigarettes, alcohol, every single thing that you wouldn`t see in a white neighborhood.</p><p>DR. LISA COOPER, Johns Hopkins University: We do know that socioeconomic status has a huge impact on a whole host of health outcomes.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Public health physician Lisa Cooper is professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins.</p><p>DR. LISA COOPER: African-Americans are at greater risk for developing chronic diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: All contribute, says Dr. Cooper, to a health condition among blacks sometimes called weathering, which has been linked to cumulative stress.</p><p>DR. LISA COOPER: The body responds as if it`s, you know, trying to defend itself. And so there are elevated levels of stress hormones.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Which everyone knows are no good for you.</p><p>DR. LISA COOPER: Also leads to premature aging. And so it would explain a lot of the phenomena that we see among African-Americans.</p><p>RASHAWN RAY, University of Maryland: There is another study that looked at telomeres.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Telomeres are the protective caps at the end of chromosomes that get shorter with age, explains sociologist Rashawn Ray.</p><p>RASHAWN RAY: And what this research found is that black teenagers who are living in neighborhoods that are underserved, that have high levels of crime, their telomeres are the same length as elderly men, suggesting the ways in which weathering and chronic stress has impacted them.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: But let`s be clear. For black Americans, economic stressors are just part of the story.</p><p>DAVID WILLIAMS, Harvard University: America has recently awakened to a steady drumbeat of unarmed black men being shot by the police.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: A TED Talk by sociologist David Williams.</p><p>DAVID WILLIAMS: What is even a bigger story is that, every seven minutes, a black person dies prematurely in the United States.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Why?</p><p>DAVID WILLIAMS: Research has found that higher levels of discrimination are associated with the elevated risk of a broad range of diseases and even premature mortality.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: And that`s separate from the effects of economic disadvantage.</p><p>DR. LISA COOPER: Racism has an independent effect on health. You can have African-Americans who are upper middle-class who are experiencing much higher rates of disease than you would see among white Americans at the same level of socioeconomic status.</p><p>DR. WILLIAM GRIER, Co-Author, \"Black Rage\": We feel it is a very important cause.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: In 1968, psychiatrists William Grier and Price Cobbs co- authored a book called \"Black Rage.\"</p><p>DR. PRICE COBBS, Co-Author, \"Black Rage\": All black people are angry, not just a few militants whom one may see on television.

And, at some point, you just explode.</p><p>Let`s stop shooting our young men.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Myers, born deaf, hardly needs to lip read to understand a not untypical encounter with police in Minneapolis, where he`s been a professor for decades.</p><p>SAMUEL MYERS: Put your hands up on the dashboard. I mean, I learned very quickly that it is dangerous to reach into your pocket to get your wallet, that the police officer instinctively believes that you`re reaching for your weapon.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Outrageous, arguably. Enraging, for sure.</p><p>SAMUEL MYERS: And so what we have done is that we have kind of moved our anger internally, because we believe that we have a job to do with respect to proving that we are worthy, that we are capable, that we are productive citizens. But that`s what happens when that builds up.</p><p>TREVON LOGAN: I have been pulled over by the police more than 10 times in my own life.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Again, economist Trevon Logan.</p><p>TREVON LOGAN: I think it`s impossible for anyone who`s lived as an African-American in this country to say that they haven`t experienced racially specific stress. And that stress will have physiological consequences.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Which may explain why, by age 55, more than 75 percent of black Americans have hypertension, blood pressure higher than 130 over 80, compared with less than 50 percent of whites.</p><p>You have high blood pressure?</p><p>TREVON LOGAN: Yes, definitely.</p><p>REV. HORACE SHEFFIELD: That`s why this COVID-19 has been such a harassing menace in our community, because people already were unhealthy.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: And less access to health care makes matters worse, says Rashawn Ray.</p><p>RASHAWN RAY: Black men are less likely to utilize health care because of discrimination that`s embedded within the health care system.</p><p>There`s a recent study, really important for COVID-19, showing that blacks were six times more likely to be turned away from testing once they even went to the hospital.</p><p>MAN: This family`s story is so upsetting.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: In a Detroit case that made national news, 56-year old Gary Fowler died at home on April 7, having been denied a test at three hospitals.

HORACE SHEFFIELD: We understand that, because of the hue of our skin, you know, we`re being treated differently than other people.

It`s already happening in Italy, the third largest economy in Europe.</p><p>From the town of Grottammare on the Adriatic Coast, special correspondent Malcolm Brabant reports.</p><p>MALCOLM BRABANT: Four-year-old Angelo looks contented. At his tender age, he has no idea just how vulnerable he is. But Angelo`s Nigerian mother is worried about where his next meal will come from, which is why she`s lined up outside this food bank. She didn`t want to give her name.</p><p>WOMAN: With the COVID, it`s a little bit difficult to feed my son. So, I just came to pick some few things to feed my son.</p><p>MALCOLM BRABANT: It`s not just disadvantaged immigrants who are reliant on food banks. Italians who`d managed to cope before the pandemic are seeking help.</p><p>Before COVID struck, Samuela Paoloni was supporting both her sister and mother. Now all three are virtually destitute.</p><p>SAMUELA PAOLONI, Unemployed (through translator): I used to be a baby- sitter, but now I can`t find anything.</p><p>MALCOLM BRABANT: This food bank in a disused cinema is the tip of a global iceberg. It`s estimated that an extra one million Italians have fallen beneath the poverty line as a result of COVID-19.</p><p>And around the world, according to Oxfam, it`s estimated that 500 million people are now considered to be poor as a result of the pandemic.</p><p>The distribution center serving 100 food banks along the central Adriatic Coast is dependent on gifts. The pandemic has stimulated generosity, with supermarkets and restaurants donating food that would otherwise have gone to waste.</p><p>Their contributions have been essential because of the increased demand from the streets. The operation is run by Francesco Galieni.</p><p>FRANCESCO GALIENI, Food Bank Distributor (through translator): This is certainly a very sad situation, seeing people struggling, especially children. We have had alerts that children are really in need of food aid. In Italy, it`s estimated that a million children need food aid because they`re going hungry.</p><p>MALCOLM BRABANT: It`s collection day for the parish of the 16th century Pope Saint Pius V. The church in Grottammare is feeding 50 families, which means about 150 people in total. The collection is being supervised by parish priest Don Federico Pompei.</p><p>FEDERICO POMPEI, Church Pope Saint Pius V (through translator): With COVID-19, poverty has increased. The poverty that existed has become more profound. And those who were poor have become even poorer. Those who weren`t poor are on the verge of becoming the new poor.</p><p>MALCOLM BRABANT: Sixty-five-year-old shoemaker Giuseppe is one of the new poor. Divorce and losing his home before the pandemic were bad enough. But his troubles were just beginning. When COVID struck, his temporary contract with a shoe factory was canceled. He has no idea when he might work again.</p><p>GIUSEPPE, Unemployed Shoemaker (through translator): How do you expect me to feel? I can`t describe it. I can`t find the right word. I feel demoralized. I`m not use to this kind of thing, because I have always had a job.</p><p>MALCOLM BRABANT: Like other food bank clients, Giuseppe has been given an appointment, so social distancing can be applied. He collects staples, such as pasta and cooking oil. Giuseppe has fixed expenses, including $400 monthly rent, and has to keep his car running in case a job surfaces.</p><p>GIUSEPPE (through translator): It`s a help. It means I can save some money. But it`s the bare minimum. You get given some stuff, but it`s not everything you need.</p><p>MALCOLM BRABANT: But Giuseppe`s dependence on food aid could last longer than he expected because the Italian shoe industry is in trouble.</p><p>Giampietro Melchiorri`s shoe factory is treading water. Half of his 30 staff are furloughed. Last year, the company grossed $7 million from shoes like these that retailed for $250 to $400. Before the pandemic began, the company had hoped to expand.</p><p>Now Melchiorri fears disaster.</p><p>GIAMPIETRO MELCHIORRI, Shoe Factor Owner (through translator): Unfortunately, on the 21st of March, when the prime minister told us to shut down, personally, my dream was shattered. Our objectives were no longer attainable. It was as if the world totally collapsed on us.</p><p>MALCOLM BRABANT: Other shoe factories are also suffering a similar downturn in fortunes, so, unless he gets a lucky break, Giuseppe must conserve his handout for as long as possible.</p><p>GIUSEPPE (through translator): It certainly is a help. I can`t tell you if it`s going to last me for 10 or 20 days. It depends.</p><p>MALCOLM BRABANT: The elderly helpers at the food bank are shy about their volunteer work. They don`t want to give their full names.</p><p>ERICA, Volunteer (through translator): We are concerned. When you see people going hungry, you can`t be untroubled.</p><p>MALCOLM BRABANT: The Catholic Church is at the heart of Italian society. In this parish, charity is essential because of what Father Don Federico believes are the inadequacies of the state.</p><p>FEDERICO POMPEI (through translator): What needs to happen is that the promises of aid need to become reality. Unfortunately, bureaucracy is slowing things up a lot. People are struggling because their needs aren`t satisfied.</p><p>MALCOLM BRABANT: Over the past week, an average of 11 Italians have died every day from COVID, down from 900 a day in March.</p><p>If that trend continues, the economy stands a better chance of recovery, and so do the new poor.

And a couple of nights, I said my goodbyes to the world and woke up in the morning, not knowing that I would.</p><p>GENA ROSS, Coronavirus Survivor: In the hospital, I sang songs to myself. I tried to comfort myself. And I prayed a lot. And I made videos on Facebook to let people know, you know, this is what`s going on with me, but trying to encourage people too.</p><p>ALASTAIR BITSOI: Knowing my status, it gave me some relief in some ways. This is not good news I`m positive, but it`s also good news, in a sense that I can focus my body on where I need healing.</p><p>ZAIMAH HABEEB: I would take in a very, very, very deep breath and hold it for five seconds. And then I would breathe out very slowly. And I would do that over and over.</p><p>During those moments, I just would think about how I needed to get well for my kids and that I had so much to live for.</p><p>JOHN MENG: Even if you`re someone who`s relatively healthy, living an active lifestyle, with no underlying illnesses, and relatively young, your life can really be impacted by this virus.</p><p>ARLYN QUITEVIS: Some patients are kind of -- kind of on the fence sometimes when reaching out to their primary care doctor.</p><p>But if there`s something that`s off and you`re concerned, definitely seek medical advice. Don`t wait.</p><p>JAN JOHNSON: Just take it one day at a time. Don`t worry about the future. Just be grateful about the past.</p><p>AMANDA ELLIS: I always thought that, at the end of my life, I would have time to say goodbye, and maybe not. I`m going to, you know, spend my time to make sure that the people I love know that and why.</p><p>ZAIMAH HABEEB: I had no idea how much people cared for me. You just never know the difference that you make in someone`s lives. And I have heard people say that to me: Like, wow, we really need you to get better because you`re an inspiring person to me.</p><p>And I`m like, really? Thank you.</p><p>GENA ROSS: I made it. I got my double negatives. And I`m so excited.</p><p>I got to hug my daughter. I got to touch her face. I got to feel like mom again, instead of like some just big ball of germ.</p><p>JAN JOHNSON: I just feel lucky to be alive.</p><p>ALASTAIR BITSOI: One thing that has helped me through this process is having hope. I`m taught, through everything you face in your life, you always have sihasin, or hope.</p><p>DENISE DELPONTE DESARNO: So what if we`re in phase three or we have to stay in another week. We have our health. We have our family. It`s only going to get uphill. It can`t get any worse, because you have -- you have come out of this.</p><p>BEVERLYN QUITEVIS: Hope is on the way. I always believe that. Hope is on the way. This will not last long.</p><p>ZAIMAH HABEEB: The morning is going to come, if you can just make it through those tough moments. Hang on. Stay strong. You can do it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: And tonight`s Brief But Spectacular features pediatrician Lucy Marcil, who integrates free tax and financial services into her care for patients and their families as a way to help improve their overall health.</p><p>DR. LUCY MARCIL, Pediatrician: People trust their doctor. We ask them really intimate questions all the time. We ask them about sex, about mental health, about alcohol use.</p><p>But I bet, if you think about your own experiences, you have probably never had your doctor ask you how much money you make.</p><p>If you have less money, you have worse health outcomes in almost any disease you can think of. Poor children in the U.S. die at higher rates. They are one-and-a-half more likely to die. They`re twice as likely to be hospitalized.</p><p>So, it really is a health issue, and it`s negligence on our part not to be asking about it. I had a mom in clinic last week who is trying her best to raise two lovely kids, but she`s been homeless. She`s been in several abusive relationships. She`s encountered mental health problems.</p><p>And, as a result, it`s been hard for her to keep steady jobs. With her, for instance, I asked her, \"Have you filed your taxes?\"</p><p>She said: \"I`m not going to. I only made $3,000 last year.\"</p><p>And I was able to explain to her how, if she did file, the U.S. government would give her $1,200, which would be a third of her annual income. So that`s just a small example of the way in which we try to prescribe tax preparation as a health intervention in pediatric clinics.</p><p>We found that 60 percent of the families we serve have never heard of the Earned Income Tax Credit. It`s not just about getting the money back that`s been withheld from your paycheck. The government is going to give you extra money. And, often, it`s thousands of dollars.</p><p>For people who do know about it and are filing their taxes, they might not know that free tax preparation exists in the community. So it`s a huge relief to them often when I say, we can do this right here in the office for you.</p><p>And they say, you`re not going to charge me?</p><p>We have done, over the last three years, about 2,000 tax returns and returned over $4,000,000 to families. The very first family that we served was a great-grandmother who had custody of a 2-year-old. And after we got her back several thousand dollars, she said to me: \"I was able to buy luxuries. I bought a winter coat and fresh vegetables.\"</p><p>And we live in the United States of America. A winter coat and vegetables should not be luxuries when you`re trying to raise a child.</p><p>So, the patients that I have that have used StreetCred, I feel I have a deeper, more trusting relationship with. You know, I think they recognize that I`m someone they can tell anything to, that I`m interested in their problems, not just interested in telling them about how their kids should drink less juice, which they should. No one should be drinking juice.</p><p>Unless we show that we really care for people, they won`t trust us and let us help them.</p><p>My name is Dr. Lucy Marcil, and this is my Brief But Spectacular take on reimagining what a doctor`s visit looks like.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: And that`s the \"NewsHour\" for tonight. I`m Amna Nawaz.</p><p>For all of us at the \"PBS NewsHour,\" thank you, please stay safe, and we`ll see you soon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSHR-2020071601cb112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSHR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CF-KXS1-JB20-G4GX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152462</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8954\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MacNeil/Lehrer Productions All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>PBS NewsHour (formerly The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL &amp;

HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): The Republicans don`t even have a bill that the Senate Republican Conference uniformly supports. The president said it`s semi-irrelevant. What is there to negotiate? They have put forth a fiction of a response.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, another member of Congress has come down with the virus.</p><p>Texas Republican Louie Gohmert tested positive at the White House today and canceled plans to fly to Texas with the president. Gohmert passed close by Attorney General William Barr outside a House hearing yesterday. Barr was getting tested today, as a precaution.</p><p>With 23 million Americans out of work, the stakes are dire for many families if more help is not on the way. There remain deep divisions among lawmakers.</p><p>To shed light on where things stand, I spoke just moments ago with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.</p><p>Mr. Majority Leader, thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>The chief of staff at the White House, Mark Meadows, has just said in the last few minutes that they are nowhere close to a deal between the two sides on COVID relief.</p><p>Given the division among Republicans, members of your own party, does that mean these benefits, additional unemployment benefits, are going to lapse on Friday?</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Well, I certainly hope not. Neither side would like for that to happen.</p><p>And, you know, many things around here happen at the last minute. This is only Wednesday. So, hope springs eternal that we will reach some kind of agreement, either on a broad basis or a more narrow basis, to avoid having an adverse impact on unemployment.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of a more narrow basis, our Lisa Desjardins has reported that something like 20 members of your Republican Caucus have problems with the proposal, the larger Republican proposal, that you outlined the other day.</p><p>Given that, are you seriously looking at some sort of slimmed-down short- term deal here?</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Well, we`re looking at all options.</p><p>Of course, the -- Secretary Mnuchin and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows are doing the negotiating with the Democrats.</p><p>But you`re right, Judy. About 20 of my members think that we have already done enough. They are deeply concerned, and it`s understandable, about the size of our national debt now, which is as big as our economy for of the first time since World War II.</p><p>And so I do have a reasonable number of members who don`t think we ought to do another package.</p><p>That is not my view. And it`s not the majority of our conference view, nor is it the view of the president. We have divided government, so we have to sit down with the Democrats and work out something. And, hopefully, we will begin to do that before the end of the week.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what is going to make the difference?</p><p>Because, today, none other than the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell, is again saying, the economy needs the kind of boost that it got in the spring from the congressional COVID relief package. He`s urging Congress to do something like that again.</p><p>How do you turn your members around who say, we have already done enough?</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Well, I agree with the chairman of the Fed. We need to do more.</p><p>I`m sure he didn`t put a number on it. The issue is how much. The Democratic House wanted to add $3 trillion to the national debt, as much as we added back in March and April. We think that`s clearly far beyond what is necessary to get us through this next period, as we continue to wrestle with the coronavirus, which is simply not going away any time soon.</p><p>We all know that. And until we get a vaccine, we can`t begin to put this in the rearview mirror. So, the economy does need more help. We have divided government. We have to talk to each other and we have to try to get an outcome.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: You have made the argument steadily, Mr. Majority Leader, that the reason the benefits, these additional $600 a week in benefits, shouldn`t be conditioned is that it`s incentive for many people not to go back to work, just to stay home.</p><p>But we have looked at what economists are saying. They`re saying, there`s just no measurable evidence that people are staying home because of that. They say, if they are staying home, it`s because they don`t have a job to go back to, or they don`t have child care, or they have a serious worry about getting sick.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: I don`t know which economists you`re talking about, but a huge percentage of people in that category are choosing based upon the fact that they can make more staying at home, not an irrational decision when you look at the numbers, are reluctant to go back to work.</p><p>So, unemployment insurance is extremely important, particularly at a time of high unemployment, like we have now. And it ought to be operating like it has traditionally. But to pay people more to stay home than to go back to work, we think, is a mistake.</p><p>And I don`t know which economists you`re citing, but there are huge numbers of small business people all across the country, almost without exception, telling us, and I`m sure telling the Democrats as well, that this is a deterrent to getting back to work.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, there are a number of them.</p><p>But let me just be very specific. We put a call-out through social media, asking people to let us know about unemployment benefits. We had something like 2,000 people responding, including a woman named Latrice Wilson (ph). She`s from Kentucky, your home state.</p><p>She says that $600 additional a week allows her to pay for the medicine she needs for her autoimmune disease and to pay for her daughter to continue to go to college.</p><p>What do you say to someone like Mrs. Wilson?</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: What I`m saying to Mrs. Wilson is, you`re probably going to be eligible for the $1,200 additional cash payment that we would make under our proposal, the same as back in the CARES Act, direct cash straight into your pocket out of our package.</p><p>So, yes, those are people who do have significant concerns. And we address that with $1,200 direct cash payment.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you about a number of other things very quickly.</p><p>Government reports are right now, Mr. Leader, that as many as 26 million Americans, most of them with children, say they aren`t getting enough to eat these days.</p><p>We know that, for very young children, that can be incredibly harmful. Democrats -- the Democrats` plan right now increases food stamp, or SNAP, benefits by 15 percent. The Republican proposal would not extend those increased benefits. Why not?</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Well, I`m sure, when we sit down to talk to the Democrats, that will be an area we discuss.</p><p>But, of course, one thing that is extremely important to make sure children are well-fed is to get them back in school. And we actually put more money in our proposal than House Democrats for education.</p><p>That`s both K-12 and college. And to the extent that these local school districts are allowed -- make the decision to let their children come back to school, that will take care of a lot of the -- for many of these kids, the best meal they get of the day is the one they get at school.</p><p>So, getting them back in school, I think, is an important step in the right direction.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: There`s also a question about housing. Democrats would ban evictions, continue to ban evictions.</p><p>Are you prepared, as early as this -- next week, in coming weeks, to see people thrown out of their house or apartment because they can`t afford to make rent or mortgage payment?</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Yes. And I think that is the sort of thing we ought to be talking about with the Democrats to try to get to a solution.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Aid to state and local governments, Mr. Majority Leader.</p><p>Democrats are asking for a trillion dollars almost in aid to pay these front-line workers, people who are out there working because they have to, despite the coronavirus. The Republican bill, nothing in there for these state and local government workers. Why not?</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Judy, as you know, every state budget has two really big items, education and Medicaid.</p><p>Our proposal puts more money in for education than the Democratic proposal. Education aid is aid to state and local government. And so we think that is a excellent way to infuse cash.</p><p>In addition to that, the previous $150 billion that we sent down to states, much of which has not been dispensed yet, we would change the formula -- change the proposal to allow them to use it in any way they choose, even including revenue replacement.</p><p>So, in both of those ways, we think we provide additional assistance to states and localities.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Two other very quick things.</p><p>You have said you don`t like the idea that there is $1.8 billion in this plan for a new FBI building in Washington, coincidentally, across the street from the Trump Hotel. You said you want only COVID material in this bill.</p><p>Why not just say no to the White House on this? And, by the way, there`s money, 8 -- another $8 billion in this bill for military materiel, F-35 fighters, and so forth.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Yes.</p><p>Well, in the House bill, for example, there`s a tax cut for high-income people in blue states and all kinds of things related to marijuana and the legalization of assistance -- assistance to illegal immigrants.</p><p>I mean, my point was, Judy, I think all of the things that are not related to the COVID-19 fight ought to come out, whether it`s the FBI building or whether it`s a tax cut for wealthy people in blue states.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, can you just say no to the White House on the FBI?</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: I would say no to all of these unrelated COVID-19 items that both sides have made an effort to inject into the debate.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally, in the wake of more members of Congress testing positive for COVID-19, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is saying she is considering a requirement that everyone on the House side of the Capitol wear a mask.</p><p>Would you consider that kind of requirement in the Senate?</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Well, we have had good luck without a requirement. I believe just about every one of my members is wearing a mask.</p><p>And we have since the 1st of May, when we resumed. And I think we have been following the guidelines of the Capitol physician, properly socially distanced, wearing a mask, which I had on until I stepped up to the microphone to talk to you.</p><p>And we have had good compliance with that on the Senate side, without a mandate. And so we`re getting compliance the voluntary -- in the old- fashioned way. Everybody is doing it.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Would you consider a requirement, though, if necessary?</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: It appears not to be necessary, since everybody seems to be doing it.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we will leave it there.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: OK.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, thank you very much.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Thank you.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And just moments ago, after that interview, the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, announced that everyone, both members and staff, are now required to wear a mask in the entire House of Representatives complex.</p><p>In the day`s other news: Federal agents will begin withdrawing from downtown Portland, Oregon ,tomorrow, in a deal with state and local leaders. Federal agents and protesters have clashed nightly at the federal courthouse. But U.S. Homeland Security officials said state and local police will guard the site instead.</p><p>KEN CUCCINELLI, Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security: Our additional officers that have been brought to Portland will still be in downtown Portland. They will simply not be at the courthouse, and they will not be engaged if they are not needed.</p><p>And our hope is, of course, for all of us, that will not be needed.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Portland`s Democratic Mayor Ted Wheeler praised the end of what he called an illegal occupation.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. Justice Department formally announced that it will be sending teams of investigators to Cleveland, Detroit and Milwaukee. Their stated mission is to aid police fighting violent crime.</p><p>Members of Congress grilled CEOs of four tech giants today on whether they are too dominant. The heads of Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple appeared by video at a House hearing.</p><p>As they did, President Trump threatened executive orders to roll back legal protections for the companies.</p><p>We will have much more after the news summary.</p><p>In Turkey, social media is coming under tighter controls. The Parliament approved a law today ordering Facebook, Twitter and others to set up local offices and to police content. Supporters called it a curb on cyber-crime and online abuse of women. Critics and rights groups raised fears of censorship.</p><p>YAMAN AKDENIZ, Istanbul Bilgi University: These measures will have a chilling effect on the Turkish social media platform users. And people will be scared to use these platforms, because Turkish authorities will have access to the users` data.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: The law also requires companies to store user data in Turkey.</p><p>The U.S. military formally announced today that it will pull 12,000 American troops from Germany. The move will leave 24,000 troops still on German soil. President Trump has repeatedly denounced Germany for not spending more on defense and has pushed to withdraw U.S. forces. We will get details later in the program.</p><p>The Eastern Caribbean is facing heavy rain and strong winds tonight, as a budding tropical storm blows through. The weather system is expected to pass near Puerto Rico overnight, and to brush past the Dominican Republic tomorrow. Puerto Rican officials are warning of the potential for landslides, flooding and widespread power outages.</p><p>The Federal Reserve warned today that the resurgence of COVID-19 cases is sure to be a drag on the economy. Chairman Jerome Powell said that the Fed will use all the tools it has to help, but he warned that a recovery is linked directly to people`s behavior.</p><p>JEROME POWELL, Federal Reserve Chairman: The path of the economy is going to depend to a very high extent on the course of the virus and on the measures that we take to keep it in check. That is just a fundamental fact of our economy right now.</p><p>The two things are not in conflict. You know, social distancing measures and fast reopening actually go together. They`re not in competition with each other.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: The Central Bank announced no new policies, but did say that it plans to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate pegged to near zero.</p><p>Wall Street moved higher on the Fed`s pledge to continue shoring up the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 160 points, to close at 26539. The Nasdaq rose 140 points, and the S&amp;P 500 added 40.</p><p>And the annual Hajj pilgrimage is under way in Saudi Arabia, greatly scaled back by the coronavirus pandemic. Some 1,000 Muslim worshipers began arriving today at Mecca`s Grand Mosque, wearing face masks and praying at a distance. The Hajj usually draws up to 2.5 million people.</p><p>Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": leaders of tech giants face congressional scrutiny over their impact on society; questions arise over the president`s continued deferential behavior toward Vladimir Putin; the pharmaceutical industry struggles with an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria amid the pandemic; and much more.</p><p>The leaders of some of the most powerful tech and social media companies got a grilling today from Democrats and Republicans alike.</p><p>Together, their devices, platforms and innovations are a part of our everyday lives. The companies are valued at nearly $5 trillion. And they generate hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. They employ significant numbers of workers. And they include two of the world`s richest people.</p><p>But, as Amna Nawaz reports, concerns over their practices and their unrivaled power are growing on the part of many lawmakers.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Appearing virtually before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, the titans of tech, leaders from Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple, answered accusations that they`re too big and too powerful.</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): Many of the practices used by these companies have harmful economic effects. They discourage entrepreneurship, destroy jobs, hike costs, and degrade quality. Simply put, they have too much power.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Amazon faces questions over giving its own products an advantage on its massive online marketplace. Apple is accused of making it harder for app store rivals to compete. Facebook is criticized for acquiring potential rivals, like WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google has been alleged to use its search and advertising systems to squash its competition.</p><p>Today marked the first time Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has appeared before Congress. Bezos founded Amazon in 1994. Today, it`s worth more than $1.5 trillion and accounts for 38 percent of all online retail sales in the U.S.</p><p>He defended that growth today:</p><p>JEFF BEZOS, Chairman, President &amp; CEO, Amazon: We compete against large established players like Target, Costco, Kroger, and, of course, Walmart, a company more than twice Amazon`s size.</p><p>Twenty years ago, we made the decision to invite other sellers to sell in our store, to share the same valuable real estate we spent billions to build, market and maintain.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Tim Cook took over at Apple in 2011. Today, it`s the most valuable company in the world, at $1.6 trillion. In the hearing, Cook portrayed his massive company as an underdog.</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, Apple: Our goal is the best, not the most. In fact, we don`t have a dominant market share in any market or in any product category where we do business.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Mark Zuckerberg founded the social networking site Facebook in 2004. Today, more than three billion people use Facebook-owned platforms at least once a month, and it`s worth $665 billion.</p><p>Zuckerberg today called the growth of apps like Instagram an American success story.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, Chairman and CEO, Facebook: It was not a guarantee that Instagram was going to succeed. The acquisition has done wildly well, largely because, not of the founders` talent, but because we invested heavily in building up the infrastructure and promoting it and working on security and working on a lot of things around us.</p><p>And I think that this has been an American success story.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Sundar Pichai has led Alphabet and Google since 2015. Every day, 90 percent of online searches happen on Google. The company is valued at $1.5 billion.</p><p>He pushed back on questions about Google`s search engine blocking competitors.</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, Google: We have always focused on providing users the most relevant information. We rely on the trust for users to come back to Google everyday.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: For more than a year, the committee has investigated the companies through more than a million documents and hundreds of hours of interviews.</p><p>Washington State Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal cited one of those interviews in a question to Bezos.</p><p>REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): A former Amazon employee in third-party sales and recruitment told this committee -- quote -- \"There`s a rule, but there`s nobody enforcing or spot-checking. They just say, don`t help yourself to the data. It`s a candy shop. Everyone can have access to anything they want.\"</p><p>Do category managers have access to non-public data about third-party products and businesses?</p><p>JEFF BEZOS: Here`s what I can tell you. We do have certain safeguards in place. We train people on the policy. We expect people to follow that policy, the same way we would any other. It`s a voluntary policy. As far as I`m aware, no other retailer limits their use of data at all.</p><p>REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL: So, there`s no actual -- there`s no actual enforcement? There`s no actual enforcement of that policy?</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: And while the hearing`s stated purpose was antitrust--</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): I will just cut to the chase: Big tech`s out to get conservatives. That`s not a suspicion. That`s not a hunch. That`s a fact.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: -- some Republicans on the panel focused on what they call censorship of conservatives by big tech.</p><p>Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin:</p><p>REP. JAMES SENSENBRENNER (R-WI): Conservatives are consumers too. And the way the Net was put together, in the eyes of Congress, is that everybody should be able to speak their mind.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Zuckerberg pushed back:</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG: Frankly, I think that we have distinguished ourselves as one of the companies that defends free expression the most. We do have community standards around things that you can and cannot say.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: While, on the other side of the aisle, Congressman Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, asked what platforms are doing to combat hate speech and election meddling.</p><p>REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Is there nothing that can be done about the use of Facebook to engender social division in America?</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG: Since 2016, there have been a lot of steps that we have taken to protect the integrity of elections. We have hired, I think it`s more than 30,000 people to work on safety and security.</p><p>We have built up A.I. systems to be able to find harmful content, including being able to find more than 50 different networks of coordinated inauthentic behavior, basically nation states trying to interfere in elections.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Still, there was bipartisan concern the four tech giants are exerting too much influence.</p><p>REP. KEN BUCK (R-CO): I`m concerned that you have used Amazon`s dominant market position to unfairly harm competition.</p><p>REP. VAL DEMINGS (D-FL): Google buys up companies for the purpose of surveilling Americans. And because of Google`s dominance, users have no choice but to surrender.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: And without action from Congress, that influence is unlikely to wane.</p><p>Let`s dive now into a few of the issues raised at today`s hearing.</p><p>We turn now to Dipayan Ghosh. He leads the Digital Platforms and Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School. He also worked at Facebook, leading their efforts to address privacy and security issues, and later advised the Obama White House on technology policy.</p><p>And before we begin, we should note for the record that the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is a funder of the \"NewsHour.\"</p><p>Dipayan Ghosh, welcome to the \"NewsHour.\" Thanks for being here.</p><p>I think it`s fair to say there`s no question about the power and the reach of these four big companies, right? But when it comes to the concentration of power and to the detriment of competition, what new information did we learn today about their business practices and about their behavior?</p><p>DIPAYAN GHOSH, Harvard Kennedy School: I think the good thing here is that both Democrats and Republicans on the committee really got to the details of how these companies work, how their corporate strategies work.</p><p>And, for instance, both Democrats and Republicans really tried to pin down how Facebook and Google and Amazon and Apple went through certain decisions around corporate development, went through decisions around how they strategized with the app store and how they thought about mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>And all of that really serves to support the imperative of holding these companies accountable on competition issues. So, I think we learned quite a lot today.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: There is, of course, this political divide we just reported on, right, Democrats digging on those accusations of anti-competitive behavior, Republicans largely focused -- or some Republicans, at least, focused on what they`re calling censorship of conservatives on these platforms.</p><p>Even President Trump, I should mention, weighed in during the hearing. He was tweeting, saying: \"If Congress doesn`t bring fairness to big tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with executive orders.\"</p><p>Dipayan, as you were watching the hearing unfold and seeing that massive gap between the lines of questioning, what did you make of that?</p><p>DIPAYAN GHOSH: There`s no doubt about this. And you`re absolutely spot on. There is this divide.</p><p>And, traditionally, Republicans and Democrats have been coming at the issue of antitrust and market competition in the digital economy from different angles. Democrats have cared more about economic equity, algorithmic discrimination, racism and bias, these kinds of things, whereas Republicans have been thinking, including President Trump and his former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, have been thinking more about these content-related speech issues, and, in particular, anti-conservative bias, which are allegations that tech companies and many other experts have wholly rejected.</p><p>I would acknowledge that certain Republicans on the committee have been asking really pointed technical questions about the market power of these companies, particularly Representative Armstrong from North Dakota.</p><p>But, for the large -- largely, we have seen this division. And I hope that we can get to more bipartisan action.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: There were a couple of lines of questioning I`d love to get your take on.</p><p>There was one in particular directed at Facebook`s Mark Zuckerberg. That was coming from Washington State Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal.</p><p>The exchange here was based on e-mails that she says showed the committee Zuckerberg was essentially threatening to overrun Instagram with a similar photo product they were developing, even as Facebook was trying to buy Instagram. Take a listen to this exchange.</p><p>REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL: Do you copy your competitors?</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman, we have certainly adapted features that others have led in, as have others copied and adapted features that we have--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL: I`m not concerned about others. I`m just asking you, Mr. Zuckerberg.</p><p>Since March of 2012, after that e-mail conversation, how many competitors did Facebook end up copying?</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman, I can`t give you a number of companies.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Dipayan, we know Facebook went on to acquire Instagram for about a billion dollars in cash and stock.</p><p>But this allegation that Zuckerberg was threatening to basically overrun the company, right, saying, be acquired, or we will end you with our own product, is that fair? Is that what happened here?</p><p>DIPAYAN GHOSH: I think -- I think it`s fair to assume that that may be what happened.</p><p>Of course, I`m not privy to Mark Zuckerberg`s specific thoughts, nor was I the founder of Instagram, either of the two founders of Instagram.</p><p>But I think -- I think it`s fair to assume that the company did really put pressure on Instagram and tried to really get at understanding what its business model was, how it was trying to engage people, and certainly tried to try to copy some of its features, which I think, to be fair, Mark Zuckerberg essentially acknowledged</p><p>I think it`s -- I think it`s a problem. And the reason that we see it happening over and over again -- there were similar themes around questions asked of Amazon, and I think similar themes around Apple and Google as well.</p><p>The problem here is that these are companies that have monopolized huge swathes of the digital media ecosystem today. And if they`re -- if they`re copying small would-be rivals and (AUDIO GAP) own business, that really presents serious challenges to innovation in the very long run.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Well, there`s the issue of copying products. There`s also the issue of pushing your own products over your rivals, right?</p><p>There was another exchange I want to play for you with Amazon`s Jeff Bezos, this one coming from Congressman Jamie Raskin. And he was asking, basically, if Amazon uses its platform, its massive platform to push its own products over rival products. He was asking specifically about the Alexa voice service in this exchange. Take a listen.</p><p>REP. JAMIE RASKIN: Alexa-enabled smart speakers make up over 60 percent of the smart speaker market.</p><p>Mr. Bezos, when I ask Alexa to play my favorite song, Prime Music is the default music player. So, has Alexa ever been trained to favor Amazon products?</p><p>JEFF BEZOS: I don`t know if it`s been trained in that way. I`m sure there are cases where we do promote our own products, of course, a common practice in business. And so it wouldn`t surprise me if Alexa sometimes does promote our own products.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: So, Dipayan, here is the big question. Is this just good business, right, promoting your own product on your platform, or is it anti-competition behavior?</p><p>DIPAYAN GHOSH: I think I think what the Internet companies have really waded into is a situation where they didn`t quite recognize their market power.</p><p>And, yes, they did engage in harmful business practices. We see this in the case of Amazon, which has this monopoly. We have seen this in the case of Facebook. And Facebook was questioned about Onavo.</p><p>We have seen companies kind of spy on rivals, try to copy them, try to understand how their would-be rivals or smaller competitors might try to approach consumers, and then essentially just subsume them or suppress them.</p><p>And those are the kinds of things that are -- that are really damaging to competition, innovation, and consumer -- the price to consumers. And I think there`s no doubt that Amazon has really screwed with the markets and attempted to shut down smaller companies, at their expense and to Amazon`s benefit.</p><p>And that is precisely what this committee really needs to get to the bottom of with this full investigation.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Dipayan, very briefly, it feels like every time big tech comes under the scrutiny of Congress, we ask this question, which is, do the laws and the rules that we have in place, the way we define antitrust, for example, do those keep up with the problems that are presented to us by big tech today?</p><p>DIPAYAN GHOSH: I don`t think they have. I don`t think they have kept up.</p><p>Let`s be real here. We have antitrust and competition policy enforcement regimes in place in the United States, and they do reasonably well with certain marketplaces, with certain consumer markets. But the digital economy is something totally different, where we`re dealing with a new currency, in the form of people`s attention and people`s personal information.</p><p>And our regulatory regime has not stayed in line with that. It is way behind where the digital economy is today. And I think, though, with this hearing being the start to a broader conversation about how we need to develop a stringent regulatory regime for a digital -- for the digital economy, through privacy and through transparency and through interoperability and data portability and competition, and potentially even conditions on mergers and acquisitions, and potentially breakup, we are -- we`re going to see these companies having their feet held to the fire.</p><p>And the committee will see to it, I think, in the long run.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: That is Dipayan Ghosh of the Digital Platforms and Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School.</p><p>Thanks so much for your time.</p><p>DIPAYAN GHOSH: Thank you. Thank you for the conversation.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: In an interview released today, President Trump said that he had not challenged President Vladimir Putin over Russian efforts to pay the Taliban to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan.</p><p>The two leaders spoke just last week, for the seventh time in recent months.</p><p>As Nick Schifrin reports, this comes as the administration also cemented plans to withdraw and redeploy American forces in Europe.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: President Trump often questions and criticizes the u.s intelligence community and praises Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>And when he spoke to Putin on July 23, he did not raise the intelligence community`s investigations into Russian payments to the Taliban to attack U.S. troops, as he told Axios on HBO`s Jonathan Swan.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States: We did not discuss that, no.</p><p>JONATHAN SWAN, Axios: And you have never discussed it with him?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP: I have never discussed it with him, no. I would. I`d have no problem with it. But, you know--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JONATHAN SWAN: But you don`t believe the intelligence. It`s because you don`t believe the intelligence? That`s why?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP: Everything -- you know, it`s interesting. Nobody ever brings up China. They always bring Russia, Russia, Russia.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Former intelligence officials tell \"PBS NewsHour\" the Taliban received Russian military intelligence money to target U.S. service members.</p><p>Officials debated the intelligence, and commanders say the bounties did not likely result in deaths. But it was an increase in Russian support to the Taliban, as already detailed in 2018 by then top commander General John Nicholson.</p><p>GEN. JOHN NICHOLSON, Former Commander U.S. Forces, Afghanistan: I mean, we have had weapons brought to this headquarters and given to us by Afghan leaders and said, this was given by the Russians to the Taliban.</p><p>JONATHAN SWAN: John Nicholson, former head of forces in Afghanistan, said -- and this is when he was working for you -- that Russia is supplying weapons to the Taliban.</p><p>Isn`t that enough to challenge Putin over the killings of U.S. soldiers?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP: Well, we supplied weapons when they were fighting Russia too.</p><p>When we were -- when they were fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan--</p><p>JONATHAN SWAN: That`s a different era.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP: Well, it`s a different -- I`m just saying.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: In 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan to prop up an unpopular communist government. The United States supported and armed Afghan fighters known as mujahideen, who targeted Soviet troops.</p><p>In 2001, the United States was attacked and waged war in Afghanistan because that`s where 9/11`s planners plotted. President Trump`s moral equivalence is inaccurate, says Doug Lute.</p><p>LT. GEN. DOUGLAS LUTE (RET.), Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO: The equivalence here is inappropriate, because the situation is exactly reversed from what it was 30 or 40 years ago.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Lute is a retired lieutenant general appointed by President Bush to coordinate the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and by President Obama to be NATO ambassador.</p><p>He said both his former bosses would have demanded more information about the bounty program and responded, even if the intelligence was uncertain.</p><p>LT. GEN. DOUGLAS LUTE: It`s unimaginable to me that the president has -- that this has been public for weeks, and probably available to the president for many weeks before that, and yet he`s done nothing, to include not even raising it in multiple calls with President Putin.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Today, President Trump added he would be -- quote -- \"very angry\" if the bounties story were true. His administration has sanctioned Russian officials for election interference and chemical weapons attacks. But he has also reverted to moral equivalence on Russia before.</p><p>BILL O`REILLY, Former FOX News Anchor: Putin is a killer.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP: There`s a lot of killers. We have got a lot of killers. What, you think our country is so innocent?</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Another presidential instinct and priority, reducing U.S. troops overseas. Today, the administration announced it would withdraw nearly 12,000 troops from Germany and bring half home.</p><p>Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said thousands of service members would move toward Russia`s borders and enhance deterrence.</p><p>MARK ESPER, U.S. Defense Secretary: We`re following in many ways the boundary east, where our -- where our newest allies are, so, into the Black Sea region. We talked about additional forces into Poland. And I think there are opportunities to put forces into the Baltics.</p><p>That`s why it`s the strategic laydown that enhances deterrence, strengthens the allies.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: But, just minutes before, President Trump said the decision was punishment for Germany`s failing to fulfill its promise to spend 2 percent GDP on defense.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP: So, we`re reducing the force because they`re not paying their bill. It`s very simple. They`re delinquent.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Today, a senior ally to German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the reduction would weaken NATO. And the unit that will return to the U.S. is the most capable ground force in Europe.</p><p>LT. GEN. DOUGLAS LUTE: It is, in itself, the most flexible deterrent package that is in place today. So, to remove it from Germany and move it to the United States, it does not provide the same reassurance as having American soldiers live in Europe, be there 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: But reassuring Western European allies and overcoming bipartisan concerns about troop drawdowns and his relationship with Vladimir Putin have never been President Trump`s priorities.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Nick Schifrin.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: It turns out the coronavirus crisis has a menacing medical side effect that`s receiving little attention thus far: the secondary bacterial infections that it causes.</p><p>And that, in turn, raises acute economic issues that are causing a crisis in the antibiotics industry.</p><p>Our economics correspondent, Paul Solman, has the story.</p><p>It`s part of our regular series, Making Sense.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: How valuable was the company at its height?</p><p>LARRY EDWARDS, CEO, Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals: About $1.4 billion.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: And today?</p><p>LARRY EDWARDS: A little over $8 million.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Highly touted biotech startup Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals in Watertown, Massachusetts. We first visited three years ago, reporting on the scary rise of deadly drug-resistant bacteria and fungi, so-called superbugs, which infect, according to the CDC, some three million Americans a year and kill tens of thousands of us.</p><p>The good news, there were dozens of scientists in this lab alone working on several promising new antibiotics like Xerava, which, soon after our visit, won the gold medal for medications, FDA approval.</p><p>Now, it may seem strange to focus on antibiotics during a viral pandemic, since antibiotics don`t kills viruses.</p><p>WOMAN: You`re on the ventilator right now.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: But many COVID-19 patients develop potentially fatal secondary bacterial infections.</p><p>So, we returned to Tetraphase earlier this year, before masks and social distancing were mandated, to see how the antibiotics industry was progressing. The results were shocking.</p><p>This lab is completely nonfunctioning. I notice even the dust here.</p><p>LARRY EDWARDS: Yes, we had to let all of our research go.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: All of your research?</p><p>LARRY EDWARDS: All of our research is gone.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: All the scientists laid off.</p><p>Instead, CEO Larry Edwards had a skeleton staff trying to market and sell Xerava, and keep Tetraphase from going out of business, a fate that`s now befallen two of the 12 companies that, over the last decade, also won FDA approval for new antibiotics.</p><p>You were at one of those companies.</p><p>ERIN DUFFY, Former Chief Scientist, Melinta Therapeutics: I was in one of those companies, yes.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Erin Duffy was chief scientist at Melinta Therapeutics, translating the company`s Nobel Prize-winning research--</p><p>NARRATOR: Orbactiv prevents the cell from expanding and multiplying.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: -- into new superbug-slaying antibiotics.</p><p>ERIN DUFFY: That company has now filed Chapter 11.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Was the drug that it was selling promising?</p><p>ERIN DUFFY: We had four very promising antibiotics, all for serious infections in the hospital.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: It simply amazed me. While antiviral research is booming, the antibiotics market is broken, at the worst possible time, says infectious disease specialist Helen Boucher.</p><p>DR. HELEN BOUCHER, Tufts Medical Center: We know that, with the regular flu, influenza, our patients sometimes develop what we call secondary bacterial infections. And, in fact, when they get to us in the hospital, that`s often the dire consequence, and that`s how we lose patients.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: The same is now proving true of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>According to a recent paper, half of those who died from COVID-19 in China also had drug-resistant bacterial infections, and thus a further cause for concern, that, as more and more COVID patients become seriously ill, antibiotic resistance will inevitably accelerate.</p><p>DR. JOHN REX, Infectious Disease Specialist: Going on long enough, COVID- 19 and hospital pneumonia will drive resistance.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Dr. John Rex is a retired pharma executive.</p><p>DR. JOHN REX: We`re seeing people hospitalized on ventilators for extended periods of time. And that`s a setting where you`re going to use a lot of antibiotics.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: You mean, because antibiotics are being used for the patients of COVID for a secondary infection or to prevent it, that means resistance building up more quickly?</p><p>DR. JOHN REX: Absolutely.</p><p>Any given antibiotic, really, you could think of it as having a relatively finite lifetime. Resistance develops to everything.</p><p>DR. HELEN BOUCHER: So, this need to have a robust and renewable pipeline of antibiotics has really never been greater.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Doctors like Boucher see the need all the time in their patients, like Larry Parente, heart transplant last August, followed two months later by a bacterial infection.</p><p>LARRY PARENTE, Heart Transplant Patient: A case of klebsiella, which is one of the more highly drug-resistant organisms out there.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: So drug-resistant, it`s sometimes called a nightmare bacterium. He was treated for two weeks with intravenous ertapenem, one of the very few drugs, if not the only one, for his infection. A month later:</p><p>LARRY PARENTE: It had come back. So, what we thought was gone really was just sort of hiding. You know, if you`re limited to one or two drugs, and they don`t work, then what do you do? Where`s your options?</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Today, after six months of nearly continuous I.V. treatment, Parente now seems healthy, but he says:</p><p>LARRY PARENTE: This can happen to anybody. I personally know a gentleman that never got out of bed after surgery. He just literally got an infection and was gone within a week.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: A new knee, a C-section, even a cut now puts you at risk, not to mention ventilators.</p><p>CEO Larry Edwards cites a University of Washington study that puts the number of deaths due to drug-resistant microbes at up to 162,000 Americans a year, more than triple the CDC`s estimate, suggesting hospitals may be misreporting.</p><p>LARRY EDWARDS: They will say they died due to cancer and underlying factors, where a lot of times the underlying factor is the resistant pathogen or the bacteria that`s killing the patient.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: So, why would they be misreporting it?</p><p>LARRY EDWARDS: They end up getting hit negatively on if they`re showing that patients are dying due to a resistant bacterial infection, more than likely, the patient got that when they were in the hospital.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: So, between 50,000 and 162,000 deaths a year, as things stood, before the pandemic.</p><p>Look, an obvious takeaway from COVID-19 is that our market-driven economy didn`t invest in the necessary public goods for a virus, tests, masks, ventilators, treatments.</p><p>But we also haven`t invested to counter the bacterial and fungal infections that increasingly plague us. And it`s led to the predictable market outcome: The antibiotics pipeline is going bust.</p><p>TED SCHROEDER, CEO, Nabriva: This is a huge problem. And it`s not getting better. It just continues to get worse.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Ted Schroeder is CEO of Nabriva, whose market value, its capitalization, has also cratered, despite its recently approved antibiotic.</p><p>TED SCHROEDER: I don`t think anyone envisioned that the entire market cap of all the companies involved in this research would be half of what a single company was 2.5 years ago. That`s not just a decline. That`s a near collapse.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: At a moment of arguably the most dire need.</p><p>MAN: And I am very sorry for your loss.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: We will explore why in our next report.</p><p>This is Paul Solman in Boston.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight, our Now Read This book club conversation.</p><p>Our July pick is a book that remains as relevant and powerful as when it was first written.</p><p>Jeffrey Brown talks with author and poet Claudia Rankine about \"Citizen: An American Lyric,\" for our ongoing arts and culture series, Canvas.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: In 2014, American cities were convulsed in the aftermath of the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, two of the killings that helped catalyze the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p>That year, the book \"Citizen: An American Lyric\" was published, with prose poems, monologues, and imagery capturing the moment, but through a different lens: the inner lives and thoughts of individuals, the almost casual racism that permeates daily life for so many.</p><p>Author Claudia Rankine:</p><p>CLAUDIA RANKINE, Author, \"Citizen: An American Lyric\": Racism is institutional, we know, but institutions are made up of people. So, what are those thousand cuts that lead to the big institutional fails around racism?</p><p>I asked people who I knew, friends, other colleagues, to just tell me moments where they were going along in their day. And, suddenly, somebody said or did something that reduced them to their race.</p><p>And so I collected these stories, rewrote them, got to the heart of what I was trying to portray.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: One of them that stuck with me, it`s from a story called \"Stop and Frisk.\"</p><p>A man is narrating his own experience as he`s being pulled over by the police and keeps repeating this line to himself: \"You are not the guy, and, still, you fit the description, because there is only one guy, who is always the guy fitting the description.\"</p><p>CLAUDIA RANKINE: And that line actually came from the person I was interviewing.</p><p>He said -- \"And, of course, I wasn`t the guy, but I was the guy who fit the description again.\"</p><p>And so that became a refrain as I sort of crafted that poem.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: You know, several of our readers asked about the form of the book, because you have prose poems, monologues, you have photographs and images. What was the -- what was your thinking about how to structure the book?</p><p>CLAUDIA RANKINE: Well, I -- you know, I have always felt that visual artists have been able to portray these kinds of ways in which racism hits the body in ways that were so succinct. You just saw it, you understood it.</p><p>And so I embarked on this collaboration with these -- the works of these visual artists without even them knowing, because I was just requesting the use of an image in the book.</p><p>But I really wanted people to engage all of their senses in the book, from their sight, to their reading skills, to their body, so that it really -- these moments really sat inside them.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: The book came out in 2014. It was incredibly timely at that moment. How do you look at what`s going on now, in light of what you wrote then?</p><p>CLAUDIA RANKINE: Well, you know, Henry Louis Gates a long time ago wrote a book called \"The Signifying Monkey.\"</p><p>And he said that African American writers were always in conversation with the time and with each other.</p><p>And I feel like \"Citizen\" was just the next book that looked at the same dynamic that Toni Morrison was looking at or Frederick Douglass was looking at or James Baldwin, obviously.</p><p>And so if I had published \"Citizen\" in 2007 or 2012 or 2015 or yesterday, it would have the same mirroring, relay effect, because those events have been going on and continue to go on.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: A number of our readers, of course, wondered if you if you see signs of hope now.</p><p>CLAUDIA RANKINE: The protests are incredible.</p><p>We saw in Portland mothers of all races putting themselves in front of the military and protecting justice in this country, in a sense. And so that -- that is new. The intergenerational, cross-race gatherings that we have seen during the quarantine is unprecedented in this country.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: When all of this is going on, when people are in the streets demonstrating, and so much happening in the country, what does poetry or literature do? What can -- what does it offer?</p><p>CLAUDIA RANKINE: I think writers, as culture makers, are in that special place where they are able to say what is, and that`s it. They`re not asking for something to happen or needing to create a transaction.</p><p>They`re just saying what is. In a sense, their work becomes a kind of record, but not the record of values, the record of experience.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: All right, \"Citizen: An American Lyric.\"</p><p>Claudia Rankine, nice to talk to you. Thank you for being part of the book club.</p><p>CLAUDIA RANKINE: Oh, thank you. Thank you.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Great conversation.</p><p>And Claudia Rankine`s new book, \"Just Us: An American Conversation,\" will be published in September.</p><p>And for our August selection, something very different, \"Beijing Payback,\" a geopolitical thriller and crime novel. Author Daniel Nieh will join us here at the end of the month.</p><p>And we hope you will join us and other readers on our Web site and Facebook page for Now Read This. It`s our book club partnership with The New York Times.</p><p>And that`s the \"NewsHour\" for tonight. I`m Judy Woodruff.</p><p>Join us online and again here tomorrow evening. For all of us at the \"PBS NewsHour,\" thank you, please stay safe, and we`ll see you soon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSHR-2020072901cb112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSHR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-78H1-JB20-G3VF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152462</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8398\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MacNeil/Lehrer Productions All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>PBS NewsHour (formerly The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

LEANA WEN, Baltimore Health Commissioner: We are just treading water if all we`re doing is saving someone`s life right now. We also know that we have to get them the second part, which is access to long-term treatments.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and more on tonight`s \"PBS NewsHour.\"</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is looking to move ahead, in the wake of his address to Congress. He won praise today from Republicans, while Democrats warned that his more moderate sound belies his real intentions.</p><p>Wall Street`s reaction to the president`s business-friendly tone was euphoric. The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 300 points to close above 21000 for the first time. The Nasdaq rose 78 points, and the S&amp;P 500 added 32. We will take a closer look at what the president said and what comes next after the news summary.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: There`s word the president`s revised travel ban will no longer include citizens from Iraq. It had been one of seven nations included in the initial ban that`s still tied up in federal court.</p><p>The Associated Press also reports Syrian refugees will no longer be barred indefinitely under the revised order. And it drops any explicit exception for Christian and other religious minorities in Muslim nations. The White House now says the new order will come in the next few days.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Tornadoes ripped across part of the Midwest last night, killing three people and damaging more than 100 homes. The National Weather Service says it had reports of more than 20 twisters. Some of the worst damage came in Illinois and Missouri.</p><p>This morning, Illinois Governor <person><nameText>Bruce Rauner </nameText></person>surveyed extensive damage in the town of Ottawa.</p><p><person><nameText>GOV. BRUCE RAUNER </nameText></person>(R), Illinois: We got to count our blessings. This could have been way worse. The warnings systems worked well. People were notified. And it`s wonderful the way the residents in the community helped each other. They got to elderly residents, gave them a warning that tornadoes were coming. People got into their basements.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Forecasters say about 95 million people are in the path of the same storm system as it moves east.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile, a staggering statistic out of Chicago: The Windy City had no measurable snow during January and February for the first time in 146 years, while, in California, there`s been so much snow, that a five-year-long drought may finally be over. Crews already measured the state`s snowpack once, and did so again today, after one of California`s wettest winters on record.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: In Afghanistan, twin Taliban bombings, and a lengthy shoot-out, killed at least 16 people in the capital, Kabul. More than 100 others were wounded.</p><p>In the first attack, a suicide car bomber targeted a police station, touching off a gun battle that lasted hours. Later, an attacker on foot blew himself up outside the Afghan intelligence service.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: The United States today delivered a sharp rebuke to the U.N. Human Rights Council over Israel. Washington has long argued the 47-nation body unjustly focuses on Israel`s treatment of Palestinians.</p><p>In Geneva today, U.S. envoy Erin Barclay said the council has -- quote -- \"an obsession with Israel\" that undermines the group`s credibility.</p><p>ERIN BARCLAY, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Assistant: The United States will oppose any effort to delegitimize or isolate Israel, not just in the HRC, but wherever it occurs. When it comes to human rights, no country should be free from scrutiny, but neither should any democratic country be regularly subjected to unfair, unbalanced and unfounded bias.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: The critique comes amid reports the Trump administration is considering quitting the council altogether.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this country, the U.S. Senate easily confirmed Montana Congressman Ryan Zinke as secretary of the interior. The 55-year- old Republican and former Navy SEAL has pledged to revitalize the country`s national parks. He has also said he will resist efforts to sell or transfer federal lands.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: And Danish toymaker LEGO has announced plans for a new set honoring five women who were pioneers at NASA. The collection will feature computer scientist Margaret Hamilton, mathematician Katherine Johnson of \"Hidden Figures\" fame, astronauts Sally Ride and Mae Jemison, and astronomer Nancy Grace Roman. The set will be released later this year or early 2018.</p><p>Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>lays out his vision for the country -- now, what policies will take priority?; a closer look at the decision-making before the deadly raid in Yemen; Baltimore`s approach to battling the growing opioid epidemic; and much more.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: We take a longer look now at President Trump`s speech last night.</p><p>He promised action on a long list of priorities, including Obamacare, the border wall, public works and regulatory reform. And all of it, he did in a more disciplined, upbeat way than before.</p><p>Lisa Desjardins reports on the day after.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: The president called in Republican leaders for a White House lunch, hoping to build on momentum from last night`s address.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>President of the United States: It begins as of now, and we think we`re going to have tremendous success.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: Vice President Pence took that theme on a one-man media blitz, with 11 interviews on his public schedule.</p><p>MIKE PENCE, Vice President of the United States: What the American people saw last night is the president that I serve with every day: broad shoulders, big heart, reaching out, focusing on the future.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: Praise came from top Republicans in Congress as well.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority Leader: The president made clear last night he`s ready to work with Congress on policies that can actually move us forward. He will find many partners in Congress excited to get those things accomplished.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: High on that list, repealing and replacing Obamacare. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a former Republican primary rival, lauded Mr. Trump for his broad outline.</p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R), Texas: The principles he`s focused on are exactly the right principles: more choice, more competition, lower costs, lower premiums.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: But Democrats say there was no real substance, and they accuse the president of misleading the public with statements like this:</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: In fact, while it`s true Arizona`s premiums have gone up by that amount, the president ignored important context, that Arizona is an outlier, with increases four times the national average.</p><p>On immigration, some Republicans say they`re encouraged by Mr. Trump`s comments ahead of his speech that he`d consider a legal status for some undocumented immigrants.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South Carolina: He`s showing some willingness to embrace a more practical immigration proposal. I want to give him credit for that. Any time he moves into the land of practicality, I want to encourage him, because that`s what it`s going to take to get a bill passed.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: But in the actual speech, there was no mention of legalizing undocumented immigrants. Instead, the president spoke of crimes by immigrants and his plan to crack down on the undocumented.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: That claim, too, was challenged.</p><p>Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota spoke with the \"NewsHour\" last night.</p><p>REP. KEITH ELLISON (D), Minnesota: This speech seems to blame undocumented immigrants for a crime. It indicated that clamping down on immigration was actually going to increase wages and make our economy better. The fact is, there`s no facts that support that.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: Several of the presidents statements were declared inaccurate by fact-checkers today. Also getting attention, the generally positive tone of the speech.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: But Democratic leaders say it`s all a facade.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority Leader: You can`t just talk the talk, Mr. President. You have to walk the walk. And on issue after issue after issue, we haven`t seen anything, or negative things, for the working class.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: The president and Congress both soon will see pressure for action increase soon. House Republicans have said they want a draft health care bill by the end of this month. At that point, Trump will be just one month away from the end of his first 100 days.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Lisa Desjardins.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Last night`s presidential address relayed an ambitious agenda. But how much of it will take shape, and does <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>have enough support on Capitol Hill to find success?</p><p>Joining me to discuss all of that are Dan Balz of The Washington Post and NPR congressional reporter Susan Davis.</p><p>And we welcome both of you back to the program.</p><p>Dan, I`m going to start with you.</p><p>We just heard Lisa Desjardins talk about this was a different tone coming from the president. You wrote about that today in The Washington Post. It was a change from what we have been hearing.</p><p>DAN BALZ, Chief Political Reporter, The Washington Post: It was a dramatic change from what we have been hearing.</p><p>And I looked back to the inaugural address, which was described by so many people as dark or dystopian, the phrase American carnage being one that leaped out at people and has stayed with people, a very downbeat view of things in the state of the nation, the state of the world.</p><p>The substance of last night wasn`t significantly or materially different from what he`s talked about all through the campaign and in his inaugural address, but the tone was so much different. He talked about unity repeatedly. He talked about cooperating with Democrats. He talked about a spirit of American renewal.</p><p>And it was -- it was a speech that was certainly aimed at reassuring his congressional Republican allies that he will be presidential, if you will, going forward, that he will be serious about trying to get these things done, and that he will not be seeking to create diversion and digression and controversies.</p><p>Whether he`s able to stay with that, we don`t know. I mean, this was only one speech, and we know the history of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is that there are moments when he -- you know, he goes in directions that even his staff doesn`t want. But for that hour in the House chamber last night, he was the <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>that a lot of elected officials have wanted to see for a long time.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Sue Davis, it was a confident-sounding speech, as if he expects these things to happen. How much of what he`s done and what he said he`s going to do so far is actually taking effect?</p><p>SUSAN DAVIS, NPR: Well, let`s start with the two top priorities for Congress that we know, health care and taxes.</p><p>And his remarks in the speech last night, it`s like they could have been written by House Speaker Paul Ryan. And the speaker`s office has been saying, there`s no daylight between us. There`s no daylight between us.</p><p>But the president is fairly erratic. He has tweeted different things on positions at different times that have contradicted the speaker. And they saw the speech as incredibly reassuring, as Dan said, not only that they`re on the same page, but that the president is capable of using the moment to show leadership to sort of build the case for these conservative ideas.</p><p>Republicans say health care is on track. They expect to see a bill within weeks, not months. And they saw the president`s speech last night as an almost tacit endorsement of this plan that`s emerging from the House.</p><p>The fight that`s going to be really interesting is that there is a group of conservatives in the Senate, namely Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, and Mike Lee of Utah, who are -- could be an immovable force on this, who say it is not conservative enough.</p><p>And we`re going to see this really interesting test of conservatism and the conservatives that bedeviled past leaders in Congress and <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>and who is going to win out this fight. And I talked to Rand Paul today, and he said, what has emerged from the House, he will not vote for.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Dan Balz, to what extent is the White House prepared for that kind of pushback from people in their own party?</p><p>DAN BALZ: Well, I think they are prepared.</p><p>I think they know it`s there. They have been getting pushback for some time. There is not only opposition from conservatives on Capitol Hill. There is division among the Republican governors -- put aside the Democratic governors -- over what to do with Medicaid.</p><p>If you were a state that expanded Medicaid, you have got one view of that. And if you didn`t, you have got another view of that. There are divisions.</p><p>I think the administration today feels that, as a result of the speech, people who have been reticent to support him or openly hostile to what is taking shape in the House might be a little more amenable to working with the administration.</p><p>Secretary Price from HHS and the vice president, Mike Pence, are going to be the point people from the administration. I think one question is to what extent the administration will, in fact, put down a proposal and move toward Congress or wait for Congress to really do it and then come in at the end.</p><p>I think Congress would like the president to lead as effectively as he can, in part, I think, to try to create the consensus that doesn`t exist today.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And then, Sue Davis, there`s immigration, where -- I happened to be at a lunch with the president yesterday where he was talking about he liked want idea of an immigration bill, if he could get the two sides to compromise. He didn`t talk very much about comprehensive immigration reform last night.</p><p>He talked about the wall. And we know there`s that travel ban, renewed version of that. But what is the mood? What are the attitudes on the Hill about immigration?</p><p>SUSAN DAVIS: Well, here`s what we know is going to happen.</p><p>In a couple of weeks, he`s going to send a request to Congress asking for undetermined amounts of millions of dollars to start building that wall. But immigration -- comprehensive immigration reform hasn`t really been part of the conversation on the Hill.</p><p>It wasn`t part of the agenda outlined by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker Ryan at the beginning of the Congress. I talked to the speaker`s office today that said it`s still not necessarily at the top of the agenda. But if the president decides that he wants this to be a priority, he has tremendous power to make it a priority and upend what the congressional schedule is.</p><p>I think, on that issue, where I think Congress is trying to take the lead on things like health care and taxes, on immigration, I think they`d like to see the White House be a little bit more assertive and outline specifically what the president would like to do, specifically because that issue was such a core, center point of his campaign.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Just finally to the two of you -- and I hate to ask you to do this quickly -- but, Dan Balz, the president really mentioned tax reform only briefly last night, taxes at all.</p><p>What does it look -- what does the atmosphere look like? What are the realities in terms of getting tax reform done this year?</p><p>DAN BALZ: Well, it will be very challenging.</p><p>Just simply getting the health care bill through will be potentially a year-long effort, as we saw in the Obama administration. On taxes, they don`t have a plan at this point. And health care will have to go first. Taxes will have to follow. There are questions about what he really wants to do.</p><p>He provided no details of that last night. He provided some principles on health care at least. On tax reform and tax legislation, he offered nothing of substance beyond kind of a generalized notion of what he wants.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Did you pick up anything on that, Sue?</p><p>SUSAN DAVIS: I see the fates of health care and taxes linked.</p><p>If the repeal and replace effort falls apart, I think tax reform falls apart. If repeal and replace, if they`re able to get something to the president`s desk, I think that that increase the chances that they can actually move on taxes this year.</p><p>I don`t think they can be seen as separate tracks. I think they have to move together.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it is an ambitious agenda.</p><p>SUSAN DAVIS: Extremely.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: We`re talking health care. We`re talking -- and we didn`t even mention infrastructure, which is something the president has said he wants to get done too.</p><p>But we`re going to leave it there for now. We thank both of you for talking to us, Dan Balz of The Washington Post, Susan Davis of NPR. We thank you.</p><p>SUSAN DAVIS: Thank you.</p><p>DAN BALZ: Thank you.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: More than a month after a controversial special operations raid was launched on a moonless night in Yemen, questions persist about how that mission was authorized, what it accomplished, and how it`s been explained by the White House and by the president.</p><p>Margaret Warner begins our coverage.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>President of the United States: Ryan`s legacy is etched into eternity.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: Democrats and Republicans alike rose to their feet last night the widow of Navy SEAL Ryan Owens, who was killed during a January raid in Yemen.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: The Trump White House says the raid was planned by the Pentagon during the Obama administration, and <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>gave the go-ahead during his first week in office.</p><p>The Pentagon intended as an intelligence-gathering mission against al- Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the militant group`s most feared branches. But a gun battle erupted, and Owens was killed, reportedly along with as many as 30 civilians, including children.</p><p>Last night, the president said Defense Secretary Mattis told him the mission would lead to victories in the future.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: But others question that claim, and last month, Republican Senator John McCain suggested the raid was a failure.</p><p>Mr. Trump respond by charging such criticism only emboldened the enemy, and White House spokesman Sean Spicer joined in.</p><p>SEAN SPICER, White House Press Secretary: I think anybody who undermines the success of that raid owes an apology and does a disservice to the life of Chief Owens.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: The SEAL`s father, William Owens, refused to meet with the president when his son`s remains were flown home.</p><p>Instead, he told The Miami Herald that Mr. Trump shouldn`t -- quote -- \"hide behind his son`s death to prevent an investigation.\"</p><p>The president again deflected criticism in an interview aired yesterday on FOX News, saying he followed the military`s advice.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: This was a mission that was started before I got here. They explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected. And they lost Ryan.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: Today, South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham offered this advice:</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South Carolina: Don`t oversell results. The only sin I think a commander in chief can make is exaggerating successes and not understanding the challenges.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Margaret Warner.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And joining me now from the White House, Sebastian Gorka. He is deputy assistant to the president. He advises the administration on national security issues.</p><p>Mr. Gorka, thank you for being with us.</p><p>Picking up on what we heard from senator Graham, did the president fully understand the challenges involved when he signed off on this?</p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA, Deputy Assistant to <person><nameText>President Trump</nameText></person>: Of course he did. He`s the commander in chief. He takes his job very, very seriously.</p><p>If you look at the way he`s treated law enforcement, if you look at the way he`s treated the military, this is a man who fully understands the burden of leadership and the responsibility he has as the commander in chief.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, he suggested in that interview with FOX News yesterday that he did it mainly because the generals suggested that he do it, that they recommended it. Is that the case?</p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA: We don`t give our internal playbook away. That`s what the last administration did. That`s how people get in big, big trouble.</p><p>These are classified operations by our tier one operators. So, he acted and made a decision based upon the best advice of our military. That`s the way it has to work, Judy.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, my question is, Mr. Gorka, because we just -- again, looking at that FOX interview, referring to the generals, the president said, \"They lost Ryan.\"</p><p>Does that mean he doesn`t accept responsibility?</p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA: Of course it doesn`t. And I find it quite churlish when the media focuses on half a sentence here, half a sentence there.</p><p>Why would you even posit that of the president? It`s really unbecoming.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the president accepts, in effect, the buck stops with him?</p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA: Of course he does. He`s the president. This is a team effort, nevertheless.</p><p>Nobody goes into battle alone, but he is the commander in chief.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: We also heard the president say that the raid was highly successful, that it generated a large amount of intelligence that will be valuable, useful for the administration.</p><p>But we also know that there are a number of news organization reporting that senior officials saying that is not the case, that there is not valuable intelligence from that raid. What are we to believe?</p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA: Is that the same kind of sources that reported all kinds of fallacious things inside the White House?</p><p>The sad truth is, Judy, since I started working here six weeks ago, I find that more than 50 percent of the more sensational things I read are wholly fallacious and unfounded.</p><p>I can tell you because I`m inside the building when those decisions are being taken. So, it`s easy to make up unnamed sources, but the fact is life is a little different from what you would read in the mainstream media inside the White House.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you say to the American people who are asking, why is the U.S. in Yemen in the first place?</p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA: Oh, very easy, very, very easy.</p><p>As the president pointed out yesterday, we are facing a global threat. It is radical Islamic terrorism. Another great synonym is the global jihadi movement. And the idea that Yemen or another country that doesn`t have adequate governance is not potentially connected to the threat to the United States is, again, a very, very dangerous concept.</p><p>These aren`t just events occurring 8,000 or 10,000 miles away. Remember, Omar Mateen, as he slayed 49 Americans in the Pulse nightclub, stopped to dial 911, not to call an ambulance, Judy, but to swear allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in the Middle East.</p><p>That`s just how interconnected the threat is today and how real the war is from the streets of Aleppo right to Orlando.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I want to pick up on the phrase you just used, radical Islamic terrorism. We heard the president say that last night.</p><p>But it has also been reported, as you know, several news organizations, that the president`s new security adviser, General H.R. McMaster, has advised the president not to use that term, in effect because it suggests that all who believe in Islam as a faith, that there`s some strain there that`s connected to terrorism.</p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA: How does it -- A, the reports are, again, false. It`s fake news. Not true.</p><p>You need to talk to General McMaster, who I talked to yesterday before the speech. It`s not what he said. And, again, how does the phrase radical Islamic terrorism link all the believers of a faith to terrorism?</p><p>If I said radical Christian terrorism, does that mean I as a Catholic are a terrorist?</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, I`m just trying to understand. So you`re saying the president is not suggesting that there is something inherent in all of Islam that is at odds with Western values?</p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA: That would be asinine. Of course he didn`t.</p><p>We are dealing with a version of Islam, with criminals, mass murderers, people who run slave markets, that use a religion, use a seventh century, atavistic, blood-curdled version of it to justify their actions.</p><p>But I can tell you, the idea that you can separate jihadi terrorism from Islam is exactly what got us in the mess we are today, with 65 million refugees around the world and with ISIS controlling territory in multiple countries.</p><p>If you talk to Muslims, as I do -- I have trained hundreds of Muslim officers from our partner nations when I was in the Defense Department -- they will tell you, Judy, this is a war inside Islam for the heart of Islam. We are not at war with Islam. That is a very dangerous and very fallacious idea.</p><p>But we know that our Muslim allies are fighting a war for the heart of Islam. Ask the Jordanians. Ask the Egyptians. They understand the relevance of jihadist ideology in this war.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Sebastian Gorka, who is a deputy assistant to <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>we thank you very much.</p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA: My pleasure. Any time, Judy.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Now views on the raid in Yemen and the decision- making behind it.</p><p>We talk to two men with intimate knowledge of the process that authorized the use of military force during the Obama administration.</p><p>Colin Kahl was deputy assistant to the president and national security adviser to the vice president during the Obama administration. He is now an associate professor at Georgetown University. Andrew Exum was deputy assistant secretary of defense for Middle East policy during the Obama administration. He also served in the Army form 2000 to 2004 in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p><p>Colin, let me start with you.</p><p>We have heard the president say, this was a mission that was started before I got here.</p><p>You were in the rooms where these mission have been discussed for the Obama administration before he left. What did the previous administration leave for <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>to pick up?</p><p>COLIN KAHL, Former Deputy Assistant to President Obama: Yes.</p><p>Well, for years, the United States has been taking military action against this group, AQAP, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, al Qaeda`s affiliate in Yemen, predominantly through drone strikes, airstrikes.</p><p>What came to the White House shortly before Christmas was a proposal from the Pentagon to expand the authorities and resources to allow special operations forces to more actively engage in direct raids to go after compounds, like the one that we saw in January.</p><p>But a couple of things, I think, are important to note. First, they never briefed a particular raid. They didn`t say, we`re going to go after a particular target or a compound on this night or this day. Instead, they asked for a broad set of authorities to do this type of thing.</p><p>And, importantly, when the deputies convened, kind of a sub-cabinet level of government convened in early January, they recommended that this decision get deferred to the Trump administration, so they could run their own careful process. And President Obama agreed on that, that he would make no decision whether to do things like this, and instead that Trump should run his own process.</p><p>But, instead, Trump had a dinner party and decided it over dinner.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: So, you`re saying the category of raids was what was discussed, not this specific raid, because we saw reports that perhaps they were waiting for a moonless night, that was the opportune time, it couldn`t have happened in the Obama administration`s last few days.</p><p>COLIN KAHL: I will defer to Andrew, who worked in the Pentagon, on this one.</p><p>But my understanding is that there were a number of concepts of operations that were bouncing around the Pentagon for a long time, and this raid may have been one of them. It was never brought across the river to the White House.</p><p>And as it relates to the moonless night issue, a Pentagon spokesperson said that that issue didn`t become relevant until after January 20, when they then asked for the authority to do the raid to Trump.</p><p>And, importantly, that`s why I think it`s extraordinarily unfair to our men and women in the armed services for Trump to suggest, as he did on FOX yesterday, that somehow this is the military`s fault. He`s the commander in chief. The buck stops with him.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew Exum, fill in that blank there. From the Pentagon`s perspective, what was left for the Trump administration?</p><p>ANDREW EXUM, Former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense: Well, no, I think that that`s an accurate recounting of the way that things were presented to the Trump administration and to the Obama administration before the -- before the Trump inauguration.</p><p>I think that we in the Obama administration, those are of us who served in the Obama administration need to be very careful as we criticize the process that the Trump administration used to approve this.</p><p>First off, to approve this raid, it would have gone through several hurdles just through the Department of Defense before being presented to the president. When we in the Obama administration brought these options to the president, it followed a very deliberate interagency process.</p><p>It`s what worked for President Obama. Just because we have seen, quite frankly, a lot of a -- lot of mess in the Trump administration thus far in their first month, I think we have got to be careful about saying that we had all the answers during the Obama administration.</p><p>I think Colin would agree with that. This president`s going find a decision-making process that works for him. What happened in Yemen may cause him to rethink the way in which he approved this raid, because you can always delegate authority. You can never delegate the risk. Ultimately, you`re going to own that, as Dr. Gorka mentioned from the White House.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew, I want to -- you recently wrote that blaming the president is both inappropriate and counterproductive. You also described sometimes that the process can be paralysis by analysis.</p><p>ANDREW EXUM: Yes.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: That it can take a very long time.</p><p>ANDREW EXUM: No, that`s right.</p><p>Colin remembers that, at one point in the waning days of the Obama administration, I think we were debating at the Cabinet level the movement of three helicopters from Iraq to Syria.</p><p>Now, there are obvious, you know, political implications of anything you do on the ground. But at what point do you delegate authority down to your commander on the ground, I think, is the key question.</p><p>The reason why I think putting the -- putting real blame on the Trump administration here is dangerous is because you have the Benghazi effect. You remember, when the Republicans used Benghazi and what happened there as a cudgel to beat Hillary Clinton, and without -- you know their effort was successful, it must be added, to weaken her as a political candidate.</p><p>But it also had a chilling effect on the bureaucracy. It makes the bureaucracy risk-averse. And, quite frankly, that`s not something that we want from our diplomats. It`s not something we want from our special operators.</p><p>We want them to be aggressive. We want them to take risks. And when we elevate the blame, when something goes wrong, all the way to the presidential level, we just have got to be very careful about how we do that.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: And, Colin, why does it take so long? What kinds of input factor into a decision like this?</p><p>COLIN KAHL: Yes, look, I think that the Obama administration can be criticized for too much micromanagement of the Pentagon.</p><p>I think, you know, the question is, did they swing the pendulum too far in one direction? But I worry that <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>in the first big decision that came to his, in this case, dinner table as commander in chief, he swung the pendulum all the way back in the other direction.</p><p>Look, what President Obama insisted on is, every time that the military wanted to come forward to ask for authority to significantly escalate, especially to put ground forces into a conflict environment, where people can die, both our service members, but also civilians and others, that we needed to have a careful, deliberate process.</p><p>It doesn`t have to take weeks. It oftentimes takes a couple of days. But it works its way through, and you get the inputs from all the various agencies.</p><p>The question I have with Trump`s decision-making process here is not that you have to do it exactly the way we did it, but he didn`t run a process at all. He just had dinner with Secretary Mattis and General Dunford and a handful of close advisers and was briefed about the raid and made a decision.</p><p>And, as a consequence, he didn`t have the full benefit of his intelligence professionals, of his State Department. And that is a recipe for making mistakes and costing people their lives.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew Exum, what about the idea that, when there are these different agencies, these different people weighing in on it, that they`re going to think about diplomatic consequences, political consequences, things that perhaps a commander in the field might not think about because, for him or her, they see a much different objective?</p><p>ANDREW EXUM: Yes, it`s a valid point.</p><p>I think the way Colin described things, I think he`s right that the pendulum swung back. I wouldn`t say it went all the way back, because, again, the decision-making process in this raid would have gone through a very rigorous process in the Pentagon. It would have been blessed off by all the Pentagon senior leaders before it would have been presented to the president.</p><p>So it wasn`t completely without rigor. But I think what Colin is describing in terms of baking down the risk, that does happen in a deliberate process like that. The key question is opportunity cost.</p><p>So, in the Obama administration, we had a very deliberate process that in many cases served the president and was what the president desired. It drew down a lot of political risks, as well as the physical risk, to the operators on the ground.</p><p>The question is, was there an opportunity cost? The nature of these raids is, they go after time-sensitive targets. So do you lose opportunities the more that you hold things up in Washington? I think that`s the key question.</p><p>And where Colin and I may disagree, but where I think we do agree, is that there has to be a balance. It`s just a matter of where you strike that balance.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Andrew Exum, Colin Kahl, thank you both.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.</p><p>Coming up on the \"NewsHour\": the successes and struggles of two of the world`s fastest growing businesses; and a plan to once again send humans to the moon.</p><p>But first: the nation`s opioid crisis.</p><p>Overdose deaths are on the rise across the country, in 2015, surpassing gun homicides for the first time. One of the hardest-hit states is Maryland, where the governor today declared a state of emergency to fight the epidemic.</p><p>But, for more than a year, the city of Baltimore has been training everyday citizens in how to use a lifesaving antidote, an approach that`s catching on across the country.</p><p>\"NewsHour\" producer Pamela Kirkland visited Baltimore to find out more.</p><p>MAN: Excuse me, sir, are you interested in Narcan training?</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND: Each week, city health workers hit the streets of Baltimore, handing out an emergency medication that brings users back from the dead.</p><p>MAN: This is the medicine. It reverses overdoses.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND: Naloxone, brand name Narcan, comes as a nasal spray or injection, and works by blocking the brain`s opioid receptors.</p><p>In a city with 24,000 active heroin users, overdoses, and now increasingly this emergency antidote have become facts of life.</p><p>MAN: I lost a friend of mine that was -- at 25 years old.</p><p>MAN: I have just seen so many young people getting hooked on the opioids, or better yet, the fentanyl. And it`s definitely a killer,</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND: In Maryland, deaths from opioids, which include heroin, fentanyl and prescription painkillers, doubled between 2010 and 2015, to just under 1,100 people a year. Meanwhile, heroin fatalities alone more than tripled.</p><p>And in just the past three years, deaths in Baltimore from fentanyl, a synthetic opioid far stronger than heroin, are up 20-fold.</p><p>DR. LEANA WEN, Baltimore Health Commissioner: We have an epidemic of people, fellow residents in our city, who are dying from opioid overdose.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND: In late 2015, Dr. Leana Wen, Baltimore`s health commissioner, and a practicing emergency room physician, issued a standing order for naloxone to all 620,000 city residents.</p><p>DR. LEANA WEN: What that means is that, if somebody goes through a very basic training -- and we do trainings everywhere, including on street corners, in jails, in public housing, really anywhere that people are -- they will immediately get a prescription for naloxone, and even get the medication in hand.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND: Just one dose of naloxone can bring someone back. Residents can buy it at a pharmacy, only $1 for Medicaid recipients. And thanks to a 2015 good samaritan law, there`s no risk of prosecution if citizens intervene and the victim dies.</p><p>MAN: I have used it four times. I keep them in my bag. I always keep them in my bag, at least four or five of them in my bag.</p><p>JOHN HARRIS, Baltimore Health Department: This is our mobile unit.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND: John Harris works on one of the Health Department`s vans which traverse the city offering sexually transmitted infection screenings, clean needle kits and naloxone training.</p><p>JOHN HARRIS: Well, we tell people that, once you reverse an overdose, then not to use that.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND: He knows what addiction can do to a person, having spent 16 years addicted to heroin. But he sees something different today.</p><p>JOHN HARRIS: There was a lot of fentanyl at first that we were hearing about. But now the clients are starting to come with medications that they use on an elephant, tranquilizers being cut with heroin. There are benzodiazepines. We`re hearing about all different types of drugs. It`s really becoming more complicated and dangerous.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND: Since January 2015, the Baltimore Health Department says over 20,000 residents have completed naloxone training and at least 800 lives have been saved.</p><p>And many more states and municipalities across the country have moved to make naloxone more accessible to the public. But not everyone believes this is the right approach.</p><p>MIKE GIMBEL, Maryland Addiction Recovery Center: We are selling it to the public as if it`s the answer. I mean, it`s an amazing drug, no doubt about it, but it doesn`t change the behavior of the addict.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND: For 25 years, Mike Gimbel was Baltimore County`s director of substance abuse. Now he`s a consultant for Maryland Addiction Recovery Center, a private treatment facility outside the city. And like John Harris, Gimbel is in recovery.</p><p>MIKE GIMBEL: Heroin is the devil. It`s the devil. It makes you do things you would never do you in your life. It took a middle-class, good Jewish kid like me, and had me robing my own parents, carrying a gun.</p><p>That`s what heroin does. That`s how powerful heroin is.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND: He argues that the city and state are spending too much time and money on Narcan training and outreach, and not enough on long-term recovery.</p><p>And as a sign this approach isn`t working, he points to the city`s rising overdose fatalities, up 68 percent for the first three-quarters of 2016 over the same period the year before.</p><p>MIKE GIMBEL: Sometimes, by having Narcan so available, it actually reinforces the addict`s behavior. Why should I stop using heroin, when, if I overdose, Narcan`s going to save my life? Where`s the motivation to stop? It`s not there. It`s not there.</p><p>So, sometimes, yes -- and we don`t want to see people die, but, sometimes, watching someone die and watching what happens with overdose and death wakes up a lot of addicts.</p><p>TIMMY HALL, Former Baltimore Police Officer: It`s just a first- responder tool. That`s all it is.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND: Timmy Hall was with the Baltimore Police Department for 24 years, where he routinely saw opioid overdoses. He says officers often use Narcan to revive the same drug users over and over again.</p><p>TIMMY HALL: A lot of times, they get upset with you when you bring them back, because they feel like you wasted the money they spent. You know, that`s the feeling that they wanted. That wanted that feeling, and you took it away from them.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND: But Hall doesn`t see an alternative.</p><p>TIMMY HALL: As a police officer, your first job is to protect and serve, you know? And what officer would want to sit there and watch somebody die, if they got the tools to save somebody? So, Narcan, to me, is a great tool. It`s just a first-responder tool.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND: The Health Department attributes the continued rise in overdoses and fatalities to a rise in far more powerful drugs hitting the streets.</p><p>Dr. Wen says there`s no evidence that denying naloxone to overdose victims helps users end their addictions. Naloxone is just one tool in this fight.</p><p>DR. LEANA WEN: We are just treading water if all we`re doing is saving someone`s life right now. We also know that we have to get them the second part, which is access to long-term treatments, that it`s a combination of medications and some treatments, psychosocial treatments, like counseling. And then other services are important too, including housing.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND: Of course, those all cost money and political will.</p><p>GOV. LARRY HOGAN (R), Maryland: Heroin and opioid abuse has been taking lives and tearing apart families.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND: Just today, Maryland`s Republican governor, Larry Hogan, announced a state of emergency to deal with the crisis, pledging 50 million additional dollars over five years for enforcement, treatment and prevention.</p><p>JOHN HARRIS: It`s got to get better. It`s got to get better. And I believe it will get better. I don`t think perfection exists in anything, but I do believe Baltimore has done a lot of good work, will do some more good work, because we are saving lives.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND: Saving some lives amid a growing epidemic.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Pamela Kirkland in Baltimore.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Now: two high-flying companies whose value has soared and are the subject of intense scrutiny, Uber, and the parent company of Snapchat.</p><p>For Uber, it`s about the culture and leadership of the ride-hailing service, valued at nearly $70 billion. It`s back in the spotlight following release of a video of its CEO berating an Uber driver. More on that in a moment.</p><p>But, first, Snapchat is about to sell its stock to the public for the first time. The parent company announced it will offer its share at $17 a share, bringing its value to nearly $24 billion. The messaging app is used by nearly 160 million people each day, and is especially popular among teens and young adults.</p><p>But there are big questions about whether it`s worth this kind of value.</p><p>Mike Isaac is covering both these stories for The New York Times. He joins me now.</p><p>Let`s start with Snapchat. What is the value that Snapchat is trying to sell investors?</p><p>MIKE ISAAC, The New York Times: Yes.</p><p>So, Snapchat`s big story is, it`s going to be its next Facebook and not the next Twitter, essentially. One of Twitter`s big struggles, if you remember, when it went public a few years ago, is, it sort of failed to grow fast enough for investors on Wall Street.</p><p>And so, as far as Facebook is concerned, their growth was huge, but Snapchat just wants to say, like, look, this is the next big social network. You want to get in as quickly as possible on the ground floor of this IPO, and we`re going to have the success and strength and reach of Facebook, particularly with younger users.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: How does it plan to make money? At one point, it calls itself now a camera company. So, is it a social network? Is it a camera company? Do they make money selling advertisements?</p><p>MIKE ISAAC: Yes, so it`s primarily advertisements. They have little what they call Snapchat stories.</p><p>And publications like The New York Times will show different things inside of their -- usually video and photo-based. And then they sell ads against that.</p><p>And then they`re kind of experimenting with other things, whether it`s like e-commerce-related things inside the app. And then who knows? They have what are called Snapchat Spectacles, which are glasses on your face, and maybe they can make money from that. I`m not really sure.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: And so part of the reason that it looks like Wall Street is excited is because there hasn`t been a big tech IPO in a while.</p><p>MIKE ISAAC: Yes, that`s right.</p><p>I think a lot of investors feel like they missed out on Facebook a few years ago, especially when the IPO went really terribly for the company, and now Facebook is trading at over $100 a share. So I think everyone is really looking forward to a successful IPO from a tech company. And it has been a bit.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: And these two founders have also decided to take a lot of the -- I guess the voting control of the company. This seems to be the new thing. Mark Zuckerberg has a tremendous amount of control over his company. Is this the kind of template that now tech CEOs want?</p><p>MIKE ISAAC: I think so.</p><p>And I think investors kind of have a sense of trust that the founders tend to know best and what`s best for their company. Mark Zuckerberg really sort of became the pioneer or advocate for this approach, where, you know, he doesn`t really want to hear much of what investors have to say about how he should run his company.</p><p>And investors are comfortable with that because he tends to be running it really well, and it keeps growing, and it keeps making them tons of money. So that might work.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Sorry.</p><p>Let`s shift gears then to Uber. It`s been in the news recently after a former employee wrote on her personal blog that she had been sexually harassed at the company and that it was covered up.</p><p>Yesterday, Bloomberg released a video of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick in a heated exchange with an Uber driver over lowering fares for its black cars service. The argument took place in February.</p><p>MAN: You changed the whole business.</p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK, CEO, Uber: What? What?</p><p>MAN: You dropped the prices.</p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK: On black.</p><p>MAN: Yes, you did.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MAN: We started with $20. We started with $20. How much is the mile now, $2.75?</p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK: You know what?</p><p>MAN: What?</p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK: Some people don`t like to take responsibility for their...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK: They blame everything in their life on somebody else.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK: Good luck.</p><p>MAN: Good luck to you, too.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Kalanick later apologized.</p><p>He said in a statement: \"It`s clear this video is a reflection of me, and the criticism we have received is a stark reminder that I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up.\"</p><p>That`s part of the statement.</p><p>So, Mike, why is this apology to the driver and the company so important?</p><p>MIKE ISAAC: If you followed the company for the past seven years, one thing you can say about Travis Kalanick, he`s pretty unapologetic. He`s aggressive. He`s pushed into markets where operating Uber was actually illegal.</p><p>And it`s been a real no-holds-barred approach to operating a company. So, to see him say, I have to be humble, I have to change the type of leader that I am is a real big shift for them. And I`m really curious if he can actually do it at this point.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: And this is also a company that is not public yet, but when it goes, if it goes, the valuations are staggering -- $70 billion is currently where it`s at.</p><p>Does this call into question perhaps the temperament of this individual and whether he is the right person to run such a big global company?</p><p>MIKE ISAAC: Yes, I think that`s right.</p><p>Almost a $70 billion valuation, I think investors, as well as employees, are wondering, we had this CEO who got us through the really tough early phases. Can this person lead us through an IPO, where people really want a more even keel?</p><p>And I think everyone is still asking that question, but it`s not really clear at this point.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: This is in the wake of the revelations of a woman who left the company, and she had this -- part of this to say in her blog.</p><p>\"It became obvious that both H.R. and management had been lying about this being his first offense, and it certainly wasn`t his last. The situation was escalated as far up the chain as it could be escalated, and still nothing was done.\"</p><p>She`s not talking about Travis. She`s talking about one of her managers who she contends was harassing to her, and now there`s a large investigation. This is a big deal for the company.</p><p>MIKE ISAAC: Yes, this is -- you know, this is core to how the culture operates.</p><p>You know, it`s very -- to take it from Facebook, move fast and break things. But, at some point, you have to sort of clean things up on the inside and change, especially if you want to go public. And I think they`re really facing that question right now. It`s just a question of, can you do it and how long will it take?</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: For a little while, there was -- and there might still be continuing -- a delete Uber campaign. Did that have an impact on their business?</p><p>MIKE ISAAC: Yes, it did.</p><p>It was -- I would say it`s not a material financial impact, but I have spoken to a number of people who were watching that go down inside. And, you know, there were hundreds of thousands of people that deleted their Uber accounts entirely, and probably hundreds of thousands more that just deleted the app.</p><p>So, it worried Uber, and they definitely tried to curb it pretty quickly.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Mike Isaac of The New York Times, thanks so much.</p><p>MIKE ISAAC: Thanks for having me.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to our Leading edge segment for this week: a potential return to the moon.</p><p>Near the end of his address last night, the president made a reference to space travel, saying -- quote -- \"American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\"</p><p>It was only a line. But whenever a president speaks on the subject, the space community is closely trying to read the tea leaves. The sentence leaves a lot to interpretation, but all signs seem to indicate there is renewed focus inside the Trump administration, NASA and the private sector on travel to the moon, sooner than you might think.</p><p>Our science correspondent, Miles O`Brien, is here.</p><p>So, Miles, why the moon after all these years?</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: Aside from the \"because it`s there\" answer, it`s actually a good destination to go and learn about living and working on an encampment in space.</p><p>You know, we went to the moon 50 years ago now. We left some footprints and flags behind, but we didn`t really learn how to live there on a sustained basis. So, while NASA would still like to go to Mars, there`s a lot of things you can learn about by setting up an encampment on the moon.</p><p>And we have learned in the past 50 years there`s a lot of water ice on the moon. What is water? Hydrogen and oxygen. What is rocket fuel? Hydrogen and oxygen. So you can learn a lot about how to create rocket fuel on location and perhaps push deeper into space.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So this didn`t just spring up as an idea because they couldn`t think of anything else?</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: Well, there was one other factor. There was a mission planned at the end of `18 for the Space Launch System, which is the next heavy lift that NASA is working -- heavy lift rocket.</p><p>One piece of it wasn`t going to be ready, built by the Europeans, a service module. And so NASA was faced with the possibility of delaying that mission, an unmanned mission, even later, or maybe doing something like we did with Apollo 8, something bold.</p><p>In the case of Apollo 8, the lunar module wasn`t ready. And we decided to go around the moon. In this case, they`re thinking about putting astronauts on this flight maybe early `19, and send them around the moon Apollo 8-style.</p><p>So, a lot of things have lined up. And, all of a sudden, there is wide agreement in the space community, this might be the next step.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And you were telling me, Miles, there`s a private sector piece in all of this, Elon Musk announcing just the other day that two individuals, I guess, with some extra spending money...</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: To say the least.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: ... have told him they want to go around the moon and come back to Earth.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: Yes.</p><p>He got a lot of attention for that. He doesn`t have a rocket to do it yet. It`s just a design right now. It`s called the Falcon Heavy, which would have almost the thrust of the mighty Saturn 5 of Apollo days.</p><p>It will fly for the first time, he hopes, by the summer. So saying there are going to be paying passengers on there by `18 is optimistic, for sure. So, we will watch that with skepticism.</p><p>But to the extent that the private sector and the government space enterprise sort of push each other toward this destination, a lot of space people are pretty excited about it.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, remind us, Miles, why was the moon -- it was on the agenda at NASA for a while, but it came off. What was that all about?</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: Politics.</p><p>Of course, we lost the shuttle Columbia in `03. President Bush at the time canceled the shuttle program and said, let`s go back to the moon, a program called Constellation. That got some traction.</p><p>And then, of course, President Obama came in and said, we`re not going to the moon. We`re going to Mars.</p><p>And he wouldn`t let anybody talk about going to the moon. There were a lot of people who said, you know, we should try the moon first before we move onto Mars, but that got shelved during the Obama administration.</p><p>Politics now is different, obviously, with the Trump administration there. And I`m told the Trump administration would really like to have U.S. astronauts taking off from a U.S. spaceport some time in its first term. And so this idea of turning that unmanned Space Launch System flight into a crewed mission is gaining a lot of traction.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally, Miles, there is this question of money. It costs money to go into space.</p><p>This is a president who has talked about cutting back domestic discretionary spending. Where`s the money going to come from?</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: You know, it`s interesting.</p><p>You have to look at the entire space enterprise here. NASA`s budget is a little more than $19 billion, but if you look at the budget for the military side of space, it`s about $40 billion. So, what if they reconsider this idea of a space council, which they`re doing, headed by the vice president, and they start looking at ways to carve out and eliminate some of the redundancies between the military and the civilian side?</p><p>There may be some ways, even with NASA cuts, that they can borrow from each other, feed each other technology, as it were, military and civilian, which could be a bit of a force multiplier and could make it still possible.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Interesting, because the president has talked about spending a lot more money on defense.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: Exactly. So, that money might ultimately help NASA.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Miles O`Brien, taking us to the moon and back, thank you.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: To the moon, Alice.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.</p><p>MILES O`BRIEN: You`re welcome.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: On the \"NewsHour\" online right now: Aboriginal Australian art is the oldest continuous art tradition in the world, stretching back more than 40,000 years.

We also know  that we have to get them the second part, which is access to long-term  treatments.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  All that and more on tonight's \"PBS NewsHour.\"  </p><p>(BREAK) </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  President Trump is looking to move ahead, in the wake  of his address to Congress.  He won praise today from Republicans, while  Democrats warned that his more moderate sound belies his real intentions.  </p><p>Wall Street's reaction to the president's business-friendly tone was  euphoric.  The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 300 points to close  above 21000 for the first time.  The Nasdaq rose 78 points, and the S&amp;P 500  added 32.  We will take a closer look at what the president said and what  comes next after the news summary.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  There's word the president's revised travel ban  will no longer include citizens from Iraq.  It had been one of seven  nations included in the initial ban that's still tied up in federal court.  </p><p>The Associated Press also reports Syrian refugees will no longer be  barred indefinitely under the revised order.  And it drops any explicit  exception for Christian and other religious minorities in Muslim nations.   The White House now says the new order will come in the next few days.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Tornadoes ripped across part of the Midwest last  night, killing three people and damaging more than 100 homes.  The National  Weather Service says it had reports of more than 20 twisters.  Some of the  worst damage came in Illinois and Missouri.  </p><p>This morning, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner surveyed extensive damage  in the town of Ottawa.  </p><p>GOV. BRUCE RAUNER (R), Illinois:  We got to count our blessings.  This  could have been way worse.  The warnings systems worked well.  People were  notified.  And it's wonderful the way the residents in the community helped  each other.  They got to elderly residents, gave them a warning that  tornadoes were coming.  People got into their basements.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Forecasters say about 95 million people are in the  path of the same storm system as it moves east.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Meanwhile, a staggering statistic out of Chicago:   The Windy City had no measurable snow during January and February for the  first time in 146 years, while, in California, there's been so much snow,  that a five-year-long drought may finally be over.  Crews already measured  the state's snowpack once, and did so again today, after one of  California's wettest winters on record.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  In Afghanistan, twin Taliban bombings, and a lengthy  shoot-out, killed at least 16 people in the capital, Kabul.  More than 100  others were wounded.  </p><p>In the first attack, a suicide car bomber targeted a police station,  touching off a gun battle that lasted hours.  Later, an attacker on foot  blew himself up outside the Afghan intelligence service.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  The United States today delivered a sharp rebuke to  the U.N. Human Rights Council over Israel.  Washington has long argued the  47-nation body unjustly focuses on Israel's treatment of Palestinians.  </p><p>In Geneva today, U.S. envoy Erin Barclay said the council has -- quote  -- \"an obsession with Israel\" that undermines the group's credibility.  </p><p>ERIN BARCLAY, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Assistant:  The United  States will oppose any effort to delegitimize or isolate Israel, not just  in the HRC, but wherever it occurs.  When it comes to human rights, no  country should be free from scrutiny, but neither should any democratic  country be regularly subjected to unfair, unbalanced and unfounded bias.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  The critique comes amid reports the Trump  administration is considering quitting the council altogether.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Back in this country, the U.S. Senate easily confirmed  Montana Congressman Ryan Zinke as secretary of the interior.  The 55-year- old Republican and former Navy SEAL has pledged to revitalize the country's  national parks.  He has also said he will resist efforts to sell or  transfer federal lands.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  And Danish toymaker LEGO has announced plans for a  new set honoring five women who were pioneers at NASA.  The collection will  feature computer scientist Margaret Hamilton, mathematician Katherine  Johnson of \"Hidden Figures\" fame, astronauts Sally Ride and Mae Jemison,  and astronomer Nancy Grace Roman.  The set will be released later this year  or early 2018.  </p><p>Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": President Trump lays out his vision  for the country -- now, what policies will take priority?; a closer look at  the decision-making before the deadly raid in Yemen; Baltimore's approach  to battling the growing opioid epidemic; and much more.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  We take a longer look now at President Trump's speech  last night.  </p><p>He promised action on a long list of priorities, including Obamacare,  the border wall, public works and regulatory reform.  And all of it, he did  in a more disciplined, upbeat way than before.  </p><p>Lisa Desjardins reports on the day after.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  The president called in Republican leaders for a  White House lunch, hoping to build on momentum from last night's address.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:  It begins as of now,  and we think we're going to have tremendous success.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  Vice President Pence took that theme on a one-man  media blitz, with 11 interviews on his public schedule.  </p><p>MIKE PENCE, Vice President of the United States:  What the American  people saw last night is the president that I serve with every day: broad  shoulders, big heart, reaching out, focusing on the future.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  Praise came from top Republicans in Congress as  well.  </p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority Leader:  The president made  clear last night he's ready to work with Congress on policies that can  actually move us forward.  He will find many partners in Congress excited  to get those things accomplished.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  High on that list, repealing and replacing  Obamacare.  Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a former Republican primary rival,  lauded Mr. Trump for his broad outline.  </p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R), Texas:  The principles he's focused on are exactly  the right principles: more choice, more competition, lower costs, lower  premiums.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  But Democrats say there was no real substance, and  they accuse the president of misleading the public with statements like  this:  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double  and triple digits.  As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year  alone.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  In fact, while it's true Arizona's premiums have  gone up by that amount, the president ignored important context, that  Arizona is an outlier, with increases four times the national average.  </p><p>On immigration, some Republicans say they're encouraged by Mr. Trump's  comments ahead of his speech that he'd consider a legal status for some  undocumented immigrants.  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South Carolina:  He's showing some  willingness to embrace a more practical immigration proposal.  I want to  give him credit for that.  Any time he moves into the land of practicality,  I want to encourage him, because that's what it's going to take to get a  bill passed.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  But in the actual speech, there was no mention of  legalizing undocumented immigrants.  Instead, the president spoke of crimes  by immigrants and his plan to crack down on the undocumented.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will  raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars,  and make our communities safer for everyone.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  That claim, too, was challenged.  </p><p>Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota spoke with the  \"NewsHour\" last night.</p><p>REP. KEITH ELLISON (D), Minnesota:  This speech seems to blame  undocumented immigrants for a crime.  It indicated that clamping down on  immigration was actually going to increase wages and make our economy  better.  The fact is, there's no facts that support that.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  Several of the presidents statements were declared  inaccurate by fact-checkers today.  Also getting attention, the generally  positive tone of the speech.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite  for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  But Democratic leaders say it's all a facade.  </p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority Leader:  You can't just talk the  talk, Mr. President.  You have to walk the walk.  And on issue after issue  after issue, we haven't seen anything, or negative things, for the working  class.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  The president and Congress both soon will see  pressure for action increase soon.  House Republicans have said they want a  draft health care bill by the end of this month.  At that point, Trump will  be just one month away from the end of his first 100 days.  </p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Lisa Desjardins.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Last night's presidential address relayed an ambitious  agenda.  But how much of it will take shape, and does President Trump have  enough support on Capitol Hill to find success?  </p><p>Joining me to discuss all of that are Dan Balz of The Washington Post  and NPR congressional reporter Susan Davis.  </p><p>And we welcome both of you back to the program.  </p><p>Dan, I'm going to start with you.  </p><p>We just heard Lisa Desjardins talk about this was a different tone  coming from the president.  You wrote about that today in The Washington  Post.  It was a change from what we have been hearing.  </p><p>DAN BALZ, Chief Political Reporter, The Washington Post:  It was a  dramatic change from what we have been hearing.</p><p>And I looked back to the inaugural address, which was described by so  many people as dark or dystopian, the phrase American carnage being one  that leaped out at people and has stayed with people, a very downbeat view  of things in the state of the nation, the state of the world.  </p><p>The substance of last night wasn't significantly or materially  different from what he's talked about all through the campaign and in his  inaugural address, but the tone was so much different.  He talked about  unity repeatedly.  He talked about cooperating with Democrats.  He talked  about a spirit of American renewal.  </p><p>And it was -- it was a speech that was certainly aimed at reassuring  his congressional Republican allies that he will be presidential, if you  will, going forward, that he will be serious about trying to get these  things done, and that he will not be seeking to create diversion and  digression and controversies.  </p><p>Whether he's able to stay with that, we don't know.  I mean, this was  only one speech, and we know the history of Donald Trump is that there are  moments when he -- you know, he goes in directions that even his staff  doesn't want.  But for that hour in the House chamber last night, he was  the Donald Trump that a lot of elected officials have wanted to see for a  long time.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And, Sue Davis, it was a confident-sounding speech, as  if he expects these things to happen.  How much of what he's done and what  he said he's going to do so far is actually taking effect?  </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS, NPR:  Well, let's start with the two top priorities for  Congress that we know, health care and taxes.  </p><p>And his remarks in the speech last night, it's like they could have  been written by House Speaker Paul Ryan.  And the speaker's office has been  saying, there's no daylight between us.  There's no daylight between us.  </p><p>But the president is fairly erratic.  He has tweeted different things  on positions at different times that have contradicted the speaker.  And  they saw the speech as incredibly reassuring, as Dan said, not only that  they're on the same page, but that the president is capable of using the  moment to show leadership to sort of build the case for these conservative  ideas.  </p><p>Republicans say health care is on track.  They expect to see a bill  within weeks, not months.  And they saw the president's speech last night  as an almost tacit endorsement of this plan that's emerging from the House.  </p><p>The fight that's going to be really interesting is that there is a  group of conservatives in the Senate, namely Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted  Cruz of Texas, and Mike Lee of Utah, who are -- could be an immovable force  on this, who say it is not conservative enough.  </p><p>And we're going to see this really interesting test of conservatism  and the conservatives that bedeviled past leaders in Congress and Donald  Trump, and who is going to win out this fight.  And I talked to Rand Paul  today, and he said, what has emerged from the House, he will not vote for.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And, Dan Balz, to what extent is the White House  prepared for that kind of pushback from people in their own party?</p><p>DAN BALZ:  Well, I think they are prepared.  </p><p>I think they know it's there.  They have been getting pushback for  some time.  There is not only opposition from conservatives on Capitol  Hill.  There is division among the Republican governors -- put aside the  Democratic governors -- over what to do with Medicaid.  </p><p>If you were a state that expanded Medicaid, you have got one view of  that.  And if you didn't, you have got another view of that.  There are  divisions.  </p><p>I think the administration today feels that, as a result of the  speech, people who have been reticent to support him or openly hostile to  what is taking shape in the House might be a little more amenable to  working with the administration.  </p><p>Secretary Price from HHS and the vice president, Mike Pence, are going  to be the point people from the administration.  I think one question is to  what extent the administration will, in fact, put down a proposal and move  toward Congress or wait for Congress to really do it and then come in at  the end.</p><p>I think Congress would like the president to lead as effectively as he  can, in part, I think, to try to create the consensus that doesn't exist  today.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And then, Sue Davis, there's immigration, where -- I  happened to be at a lunch with the president yesterday where he was talking  about he liked want idea of an immigration bill, if he could get the two  sides to compromise.  He didn't talk very much about comprehensive  immigration reform last night.  </p><p>He talked about the wall.  And we know there's that travel ban,  renewed version of that.  But what is the mood?  What are the attitudes on  the Hill about immigration?  </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:  Well, here's what we know is going to happen.  </p><p>In a couple of weeks, he's going to send a request to Congress asking  for undetermined amounts of millions of dollars to start building that  wall.  But immigration -- comprehensive immigration reform hasn't really  been part of the conversation on the Hill.  </p><p>It wasn't part of the agenda outlined by Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell and Speaker Ryan at the beginning of the Congress.  I talked to  the speaker's office today that said it's still not necessarily at the top  of the agenda.  But if the president decides that he wants this to be a  priority, he has tremendous power to make it a priority and upend what the  congressional schedule is.  </p><p>I think, on that issue, where I think Congress is trying to take the  lead on things like health care and taxes, on immigration, I think they'd  like to see the White House be a little bit more assertive and outline  specifically what the president would like to do, specifically because that  issue was such a core, center point of his campaign.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Just finally to the two of you -- and I hate to ask  you to do this quickly -- but, Dan Balz, the president really mentioned tax  reform only briefly last night, taxes at all.  </p><p>What does it look -- what does the atmosphere look like?  What are the  realities in terms of getting tax reform done this year?  </p><p>DAN BALZ:  Well, it will be very challenging.  </p><p>Just simply getting the health care bill through will be potentially a  year-long effort, as we saw in the Obama administration.  On taxes, they  don't have a plan at this point.  And health care will have to go first.   Taxes will have to follow.  There are questions about what he really wants  to do.  </p><p>He provided no details of that last night.  He provided some  principles on health care at least.  On tax reform and tax legislation, he  offered nothing of substance beyond kind of a generalized notion of what he  wants.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Did you pick up anything on that, Sue?  </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:  I see the fates of health care and taxes linked.  </p><p>If the repeal and replace effort falls apart, I think tax reform falls  apart.  If repeal and replace, if they're able to get something to the  president's desk, I think that that increase the chances that they can  actually move on taxes this year.  </p><p>I don't think they can be seen as separate tracks.  I think they have  to move together.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Well, it is an ambitious agenda.  </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:  Extremely.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  We're talking health care.  We're talking -- and we  didn't even mention infrastructure, which is something the president has  said he wants to get done too.</p><p>But we're going to leave it there for now.  We thank both of you for  talking to us, Dan Balz of The Washington Post, Susan Davis of NPR.  We  thank you.  </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:  Thank you.  </p><p>DAN BALZ:  Thank you.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  More than a month after a controversial special  operations raid was launched on a moonless night in Yemen, questions  persist about how that mission was authorized, what it accomplished, and  how it's been explained by the White House and by the president.  </p><p>Margaret Warner begins our coverage.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:  Ryan's legacy is etched  into eternity.  </p><p>MARGARET WARNER:  Democrats and Republicans alike rose to their feet  last night the widow of Navy SEAL Ryan Owens, who was killed during a  January raid in Yemen.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero, battling  against terrorism and securing our nation.  </p><p>MARGARET WARNER:  The Trump White House says the raid was planned by  the Pentagon during the Obama administration, and President Trump gave the  go-ahead during his first week in office.  </p><p>The Pentagon intended as an intelligence-gathering mission against al- Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the militant group's most feared  branches.  But a gun battle erupted, and Owens was killed, reportedly along  with as many as 30 civilians, including children.  </p><p>Last night, the president said Defense Secretary Mattis told him the  mission would lead to victories in the future.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that  generated large amounts of vital intelligence.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER:  But others question that claim, and last month,  Republican Senator John McCain suggested the raid was a failure.  </p><p>Mr. Trump respond by charging such criticism only emboldened the  enemy, and White House spokesman Sean Spicer joined in.  </p><p>SEAN SPICER, White House Press Secretary:  I think anybody who  undermines the success of that raid owes an apology and does a disservice  to the life of Chief Owens.  </p><p>MARGARET WARNER:  The SEAL's father, William Owens, refused to meet  with the president when his son's remains were flown home.  </p><p>Instead, he told The Miami Herald that Mr. Trump shouldn't -- quote --  \"hide behind his son's death to prevent an investigation.\"</p><p>The president again deflected criticism in an interview aired  yesterday on FOX News, saying he followed the military's advice.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  This was a mission that was started before I got here.   They explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very  respected. And they lost Ryan.  </p><p>MARGARET WARNER:  Today, South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham  offered this advice:  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South Carolina:  Don't oversell results.  The  only sin I think a commander in chief can make is exaggerating successes  and not understanding the challenges.  </p><p>MARGARET WARNER:  For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Margaret Warner.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And joining me now from the White House, Sebastian  Gorka.  He is deputy assistant to the president.  He advises the  administration on national security issues.  </p><p>Mr. Gorka, thank you for being with us.  </p><p>Picking up on what we heard from senator Graham, did the president  fully understand the challenges involved when he signed off on this? </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA, Deputy Assistant to President Trump:  Of course he  did.  He's the commander in chief.  He takes his job very, very seriously.  </p><p>If you look at the way he's treated law enforcement, if you look at  the way he's treated the military, this is a man who fully understands the  burden of leadership and the responsibility he has as the commander in  chief.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Well, he suggested in that interview with FOX News  yesterday that he did it mainly because the generals suggested that he do  it, that they recommended it.  Is that the case?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA:  We don't give our internal playbook away.  That's  what the last administration did.  That's how people get in big, big  trouble.  </p><p>These are classified operations by our tier one operators.  So, he  acted and made a decision based upon the best advice of our military.   That's the way it has to work, Judy.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Well, my question is, Mr. Gorka, because we just --  again, looking at that FOX interview, referring to the generals, the  president said, \"They lost Ryan.\"</p><p>Does that mean he doesn't accept responsibility? </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA:  Of course it doesn't.  And I find it quite churlish  when the media focuses on half a sentence here, half a sentence there.  </p><p>Why would you even posit that of the president?  It's really  unbecoming.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  So, the president accepts, in effect, the buck stops  with him? </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA:  Of course he does.  He's the president.  This is a  team effort, nevertheless.  </p><p>Nobody goes into battle alone, but he is the commander in chief.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  We also heard the president say that the raid was  highly successful, that it generated a large amount of intelligence that  will be valuable, useful for the administration.  </p><p>But we also know that there are a number of news organization  reporting that senior officials saying that is not the case, that there is  not valuable intelligence from that raid.  What are we to believe?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA:  Is that the same kind of sources that reported all  kinds of fallacious things inside the White House?  </p><p>The sad truth is, Judy, since I started working here six weeks ago, I  find that more than 50 percent of the more sensational things I read are  wholly fallacious and unfounded.  </p><p>I can tell you because I'm inside the building when those decisions  are being taken.  So, it's easy to make up unnamed sources, but the fact is  life is a little different from what you would read in the mainstream media  inside the White House.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  What do you say to the American people who are asking,  why is the U.S. in Yemen in the first place?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA:  Oh, very easy, very, very easy.  </p><p>As the president pointed out yesterday, we are facing a global threat.   It is radical Islamic terrorism.  Another great synonym is the global  jihadi movement.  And the idea that Yemen or another country that doesn't  have adequate governance is not potentially connected to the threat to the  United States is, again, a very, very dangerous concept.  </p><p>These aren't just events occurring 8,000 or 10,000 miles away.   Remember, Omar Mateen, as he slayed 49 Americans in the Pulse nightclub,  stopped to dial 911, not to call an ambulance, Judy, but to swear  allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in the Middle East.  </p><p>That's just how interconnected the threat is today and how real the  war is from the streets of Aleppo right to Orlando.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Well, I want to pick up on the phrase you just used,  radical Islamic terrorism.  We heard the president say that last night.</p><p>But it has also been reported, as you know, several news  organizations, that the president's new security adviser, General H.R.  McMaster, has advised the president not to use that term, in effect because  it suggests that all who believe in Islam as a faith, that there's some  strain there that's connected to terrorism.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA:  How does it -- A, the reports are, again, false.   It's fake news.  Not true.  </p><p>You need to talk to General McMaster, who I talked to yesterday before  the speech.  It's not what he said.  And, again, how does the phrase  radical Islamic terrorism link all the believers of a faith to terrorism?  </p><p>If I said radical Christian terrorism, does that mean I as a Catholic  are a terrorist?  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  So, I'm just trying to understand.  So you're saying  the president is not suggesting that there is something inherent in all of  Islam that is at odds with Western values?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA:  That would be asinine.  Of course he didn't.  </p><p>We are dealing with a version of Islam, with criminals, mass  murderers, people who run slave markets, that use a religion, use a seventh  century, atavistic, blood-curdled version of it to justify their actions.  </p><p>But I can tell you, the idea that you can separate jihadi terrorism  from Islam is exactly what got us in the mess we are today, with 65 million  refugees around the world and with ISIS controlling territory in multiple  countries.  </p><p>If you talk to Muslims, as I do -- I have trained hundreds of Muslim  officers from our partner nations when I was in the Defense Department --  they will tell you, Judy, this is a war inside Islam for the heart of  Islam.  We are not at war with Islam.  That is a very dangerous and very  fallacious idea.  </p><p>But we know that our Muslim allies are fighting a war for the heart of  Islam.  Ask the Jordanians.  Ask the Egyptians.  They understand the  relevance of jihadist ideology in this war.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Sebastian Gorka, who is a deputy assistant to  President Trump, we thank you very much.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA:  My pleasure.  Any time, Judy.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Now views on the raid in Yemen and the decision- making behind it.  </p><p>We talk to two men with intimate knowledge of the process that  authorized the use of military force during the Obama administration.  </p><p>Colin Kahl was deputy assistant to the president and national security  adviser to the vice president during the Obama administration.  He is now  an associate professor at Georgetown University.  Andrew Exum was deputy  assistant secretary of defense for Middle East policy during the Obama  administration.  He also served in the Army form 2000 to 2004 in  Afghanistan and Iraq.  </p><p>Colin, let me start with you.  </p><p>We have heard the president say, this was a mission that was started  before I got here.  </p><p>You were in the rooms where these mission have been discussed for the  Obama administration before he left.  What did the previous administration  leave for President Trump to pick up?  </p><p>COLIN KAHL, Former Deputy Assistant to President Obama:  Yes.  </p><p>Well, for years, the United States has been taking military action  against this group, AQAP, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, al Qaeda's  affiliate in Yemen, predominantly through drone strikes, airstrikes.  </p><p>What came to the White House shortly before Christmas was a proposal  from the Pentagon to expand the authorities and resources to allow special  operations forces to more actively engage in direct raids to go after  compounds, like the one that we saw in January.  </p><p>But a couple of things, I think, are important to note.  First, they  never briefed a particular raid.  They didn't say, we're going to go after  a particular target or a compound on this night or this day.  Instead, they  asked for a broad set of authorities to do this type of thing.  </p><p>And, importantly, when the deputies convened, kind of a sub-cabinet  level of government convened in early January, they recommended that this  decision get deferred to the Trump administration, so they could run their  own careful process.  And President Obama agreed on that, that he would  make no decision whether to do things like this, and instead that Trump  should run his own process.  </p><p>But, instead, Trump had a dinner party and decided it over dinner.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  So, you're saying the category of raids was what  was discussed, not this specific raid, because we saw reports that perhaps  they were waiting for a moonless night, that was the opportune time, it  couldn't have happened in the Obama administration's last few days.  </p><p>COLIN KAHL:  I will defer to Andrew, who worked in the Pentagon, on  this one.</p><p>But my understanding is that there were a number of concepts of  operations that were bouncing around the Pentagon for a long time, and this  raid may have been one of them.  It was never brought across the river to  the White House.  </p><p>And as it relates to the moonless night issue, a Pentagon spokesperson  said that that issue didn't become relevant until after January 20, when  they then asked for the authority to do the raid to Trump.  </p><p>And, importantly, that's why I think it's extraordinarily unfair to  our men and women in the armed services for Trump to suggest, as he did on  FOX yesterday, that somehow this is the military's fault.  He's the  commander in chief.  The buck stops with him.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Andrew Exum, fill in that blank there.  From the  Pentagon's perspective, what was left for the Trump administration?</p><p>ANDREW EXUM, Former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense:  Well,  no, I think that that's an accurate recounting of the way that things were  presented to the Trump administration and to the Obama administration  before the -- before the Trump inauguration.  </p><p>I think that we in the Obama administration, those are of us who  served in the Obama administration need to be very careful as we criticize  the process that the Trump administration used to approve this.  </p><p>First off, to approve this raid, it would have gone through several  hurdles just through the Department of Defense before being presented to  the president.  When we in the Obama administration brought these options  to the president, it followed a very deliberate interagency process.  </p><p>It's what worked for President Obama.  Just because we have seen,  quite frankly, a lot of a -- lot of mess in the Trump administration thus  far in their first month, I think we have got to be careful about saying  that we had all the answers during the Obama administration.  </p><p>I think Colin would agree with that.  This president's going find a  decision-making process that works for him.  What happened in Yemen may  cause him to rethink the way in which he approved this raid, because you  can always delegate authority.  You can never delegate the risk.   Ultimately, you're going to own that, as Dr. Gorka mentioned from the White  House.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Andrew, I want to -- you recently wrote that  blaming the president is both inappropriate and counterproductive.  You  also described sometimes that the process can be paralysis by analysis.  </p><p>ANDREW EXUM:  Yes.    </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  That it can take a very long time.  </p><p>ANDREW EXUM:  No, that's right.  </p><p>Colin remembers that, at one point in the waning days of the Obama  administration, I think we were debating at the Cabinet level the movement  of three helicopters from Iraq to Syria.  </p><p>Now, there are obvious, you know, political implications of anything  you do on the ground.  But at what point do you delegate authority down to  your commander on the ground, I think, is the key question.</p><p>The reason why I think putting the -- putting real blame on the Trump  administration here is dangerous is because you have the Benghazi effect.   You remember, when the Republicans used Benghazi and what happened there as  a cudgel to beat Hillary Clinton, and without -- you know their effort was  successful, it must be added, to weaken her as a political candidate.  </p><p>But it also had a chilling effect on the bureaucracy.  It makes the  bureaucracy risk-averse.  And, quite frankly, that's not something that we  want from our diplomats.  It's not something we want from our special  operators.  </p><p>We want them to be aggressive.  We want them to take risks.  And when  we elevate the blame, when something goes wrong, all the way to the  presidential level, we just have got to be very careful about how we do  that.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  And, Colin, why does it take so long?  What kinds  of input factor into a decision like this?  </p><p>COLIN KAHL:  Yes, look, I think that the Obama administration can be  criticized for too much micromanagement of the Pentagon.  </p><p>I think, you know, the question is, did they swing the pendulum too  far in one direction?  But I worry that President Trump, in the first big  decision that came to his, in this case, dinner table as commander in  chief, he swung the pendulum all the way back in the other direction.  </p><p>Look, what President Obama insisted on is, every time that the  military wanted to come forward to ask for authority to significantly  escalate, especially to put ground forces into a conflict environment,  where people can die, both our service members, but also civilians and  others, that we needed to have a careful, deliberate process.  </p><p>It doesn't have to take weeks.  It oftentimes takes a couple of days.   But it works its way through, and you get the inputs from all the various  agencies.  </p><p>The question I have with Trump's decision-making process here is not  that you have to do it exactly the way we did it, but he didn't run a  process at all.  He just had dinner with Secretary Mattis and General  Dunford and a handful of close advisers and was briefed about the raid and  made a decision.  </p><p>And, as a consequence, he didn't have the full benefit of his  intelligence professionals, of his State Department.  And that is a recipe  for making mistakes and costing people their lives.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Andrew Exum, what about the idea that, when there  are these different agencies, these different people weighing in on it,  that they're going to think about diplomatic consequences, political  consequences, things that perhaps a commander in the field might not think  about because, for him or her, they see a much different objective?</p><p>ANDREW EXUM:  Yes, it's a valid point.</p><p>I think the way Colin described things, I think he's right that the  pendulum swung back.  I wouldn't say it went all the way back, because,  again, the decision-making process in this raid would have gone through a  very rigorous process in the Pentagon.  It would have been blessed off by  all the Pentagon senior leaders before it would have been presented to the  president.</p><p>So it wasn't completely without rigor.  But I think what Colin is  describing in terms of baking down the risk, that does happen in a  deliberate process like that.  The key question is opportunity cost.  </p><p>So, in the Obama administration, we had a very deliberate process that  in many cases served the president and was what the president desired.  It  drew down a lot of political risks, as well as the physical risk, to the  operators on the ground.  </p><p>The question is, was there an opportunity cost?  The nature of these  raids is, they go after time-sensitive targets.  So do you lose  opportunities the more that you hold things up in Washington?  I think  that's the key question.  </p><p>And where Colin and I may disagree, but where I think we do agree, is  that there has to be a balance.  It's just a matter of where you strike  that balance.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  All right, Andrew Exum, Colin Kahl, thank you both.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Stay with us.  </p><p>Coming up on the \"NewsHour\": the successes and struggles of two of the  world's fastest growing businesses; and a plan to once again send humans to  the moon.  </p><p>But first: the nation's opioid crisis.  </p><p>Overdose deaths are on the rise across the country, in 2015,  surpassing gun homicides for the first time.  One of the hardest-hit states  is Maryland, where the governor today declared a state of emergency to  fight the epidemic.  </p><p>But, for more than a year, the city of Baltimore has been training  everyday citizens in how to use a lifesaving antidote, an approach that's  catching on across the country.  </p><p>\"NewsHour\" producer Pamela Kirkland visited Baltimore to find out  more.  </p><p>MAN:  Excuse me, sir, are you interested in Narcan training?  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Each week, city health workers hit the streets of  Baltimore, handing out an emergency medication that brings users back from  the dead.  </p><p>MAN:  This is the medicine.  It reverses overdoses.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Naloxone, brand name Narcan, comes as a nasal spray  or injection, and works by blocking the brain's opioid receptors.  </p><p>In a city with 24,000 active heroin users, overdoses, and now  increasingly this emergency antidote have become facts of life.  </p><p>MAN:  I lost a friend of mine that was -- at 25 years old.  </p><p>MAN:  I have just seen so many young people getting hooked on the  opioids, or better yet, the fentanyl.  And it's definitely a killer, </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  In Maryland, deaths from opioids, which include  heroin, fentanyl and prescription painkillers, doubled between 2010 and  2015, to just under 1,100 people a year.  Meanwhile, heroin fatalities  alone more than tripled.  </p><p>And in just the past three years, deaths in Baltimore from fentanyl, a  synthetic opioid far stronger than heroin, are up 20-fold.  </p><p>DR. LEANA WEN, Baltimore Health Commissioner:  We have an epidemic of  people, fellow residents in our city, who are dying from opioid overdose.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  In late 2015, Dr. Leana Wen, Baltimore's health  commissioner, and a practicing emergency room physician, issued a standing  order for naloxone to all 620,000 city residents.  </p><p>DR. LEANA WEN:  What that means is that, if somebody goes through a  very basic training -- and we do trainings everywhere, including on street  corners, in jails, in public housing, really anywhere that people are --  they will immediately get a prescription for naloxone, and even get the  medication in hand.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Just one dose of naloxone can bring someone back.   Residents can buy it at a pharmacy, only $1 for Medicaid recipients.  And  thanks to a 2015 good samaritan law, there's no risk of prosecution if  citizens intervene and the victim dies.  </p><p>MAN:  I have used it four times.  I keep them in my bag.  I always  keep them in my bag, at least four or five of them in my bag.</p><p>JOHN HARRIS, Baltimore Health Department:  This is our mobile unit.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  John Harris works on one of the Health Department's  vans which traverse the city offering sexually transmitted infection  screenings, clean needle kits and naloxone training.  </p><p>JOHN HARRIS:  Well, we tell people that, once you reverse an overdose,  then not to use that.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  He knows what addiction can do to a person, having  spent 16 years addicted to heroin.  But he sees something different today.  </p><p>JOHN HARRIS:  There was a lot of fentanyl at first that we were  hearing about.  But now the clients are starting to come with medications  that they use on an elephant, tranquilizers being cut with heroin.  There  are benzodiazepines.  We're hearing about all different types of drugs.   It's really becoming more complicated and dangerous.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Since January 2015, the Baltimore Health Department  says over 20,000 residents have completed naloxone training and at least  800 lives have been saved.</p><p>And many more states and municipalities across the country have moved  to make naloxone more accessible to the public.  But not everyone believes  this is the right approach.  </p><p>MIKE GIMBEL, Maryland Addiction Recovery Center:  We are selling it to  the public as if it's the answer.  I mean, it's an amazing drug, no doubt  about it, but it doesn't change the behavior of the addict.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  For 25 years, Mike Gimbel was Baltimore County's  director of substance abuse.  Now he's a consultant for Maryland Addiction  Recovery Center, a private treatment facility outside the city.  And like  John Harris, Gimbel is in recovery.  </p><p>MIKE GIMBEL:  Heroin is the devil.  It's the devil.  It makes you do  things you would never do you in your life.  It took a middle-class, good  Jewish kid like me, and had me robing my own parents, carrying a gun. </p><p>That's what heroin does.  That's how powerful heroin is.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  He argues that the city and state are spending too  much time and money on Narcan training and outreach, and not enough on  long-term recovery.  </p><p>And as a sign this approach isn't working, he points to the city's  rising overdose fatalities, up 68 percent for the first three-quarters of  2016 over the same period the year before.  </p><p>MIKE GIMBEL:  Sometimes, by having Narcan so available, it actually  reinforces the addict's behavior.  Why should I stop using heroin, when, if  I overdose, Narcan's going to save my life?  Where's the motivation to  stop?  It's not there.  It's not there.  </p><p>So, sometimes, yes -- and we don't want to see people die, but,  sometimes, watching someone die and watching what happens with overdose and  death wakes up a lot of addicts.  </p><p>TIMMY HALL, Former Baltimore Police Officer:  It's just a first- responder tool.  That's all it is.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Timmy Hall was with the Baltimore Police Department  for 24 years, where he routinely saw opioid overdoses.  He says officers  often use Narcan to revive the same drug users over and over again.  </p><p>TIMMY HALL:  A lot of times, they get upset with you when you bring  them back, because they feel like you wasted the money they spent.  You  know, that's the feeling that they wanted.  That wanted that feeling, and  you took it away from them.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  But Hall doesn't see an alternative.  </p><p>TIMMY HALL:  As a police officer, your first job is to protect and  serve, you know?  And what officer would want to sit there and watch  somebody die, if they got the tools to save somebody?  So, Narcan, to me,  is a great tool.  It's just a first-responder tool.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  The Health Department attributes the continued rise  in overdoses and fatalities to a rise in far more powerful drugs hitting  the streets.  </p><p>Dr. Wen says there's no evidence that denying naloxone to overdose  victims helps users end their addictions.  Naloxone is just one tool in  this fight.  </p><p>DR. LEANA WEN:  We are just treading water if all we're doing is  saving someone's life right now.  We also know that we have to get them the  second part, which is access to long-term treatments, that it's a  combination of medications and some treatments, psychosocial treatments,  like counseling.  And then other services are important too, including  housing.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Of course, those all cost money and political will.  </p><p>GOV. LARRY HOGAN (R), Maryland:  Heroin and opioid abuse has been  taking lives and tearing apart families.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Just today, Maryland's Republican governor, Larry  Hogan, announced a state of emergency to deal with the crisis, pledging 50  million additional dollars over five years for enforcement, treatment and  prevention.</p><p>JOHN HARRIS:  It's got to get better.  It's got to get better.  And I  believe it will get better.  I don't think perfection exists in anything,  but I do believe Baltimore has done a lot of good work, will do some more  good work, because we are saving lives.    </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Saving some lives amid a growing epidemic.  </p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Pamela Kirkland in Baltimore.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Now: two high-flying companies whose value has  soared and are the subject of intense scrutiny, Uber, and the parent  company of Snapchat.  </p><p>For Uber, it's about the culture and leadership of the ride-hailing  service, valued at nearly $70 billion.  It's back in the spotlight  following release of a video of its CEO berating an Uber driver.  More on  that in a moment.  </p><p>But, first, Snapchat is about to sell its stock to the public for the  first time.  The parent company announced it will offer its share at $17 a  share, bringing its value to nearly $24 billion.  The messaging app is used  by nearly 160 million people each day, and is especially popular among  teens and young adults.  </p><p>But there are big questions about whether it's worth this kind of  value.  </p><p>Mike Isaac is covering both these stories for The New York Times.  He  joins me now.  </p><p>Let's start with Snapchat.  What is the value that Snapchat is trying  to sell investors?  </p><p>MIKE ISAAC, The New York Times:  Yes.  </p><p>So, Snapchat's big story is, it's going to be its next Facebook and  not the next Twitter, essentially.  One of Twitter's big struggles, if you  remember, when it went public a few years ago, is, it sort of failed to  grow fast enough for investors on Wall Street.</p><p>And so, as far as Facebook is concerned, their growth was huge, but  Snapchat just wants to say, like, look, this is the next big social  network.  You want to get in as quickly as possible on the ground floor of  this IPO, and we're going to have the success and strength and reach of  Facebook, particularly with younger users.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  How does it plan to make money?  At one point, it  calls itself now a camera company.  So, is it a social network?  Is it a  camera company?  Do they make money selling advertisements?  </p><p>MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, so it's primarily advertisements.  They have little  what they call Snapchat stories.</p><p>And publications like The New York Times will show different things  inside of their -- usually video and photo-based.  And then they sell ads  against that.  </p><p>And then they're kind of experimenting with other things, whether it's  like e-commerce-related things inside the app.  And then who knows?  They  have what are called Snapchat Spectacles, which are glasses on your face,  and maybe they can make money from that.  I'm not really sure.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  And so part of the reason that it looks like Wall  Street is excited is because there hasn't been a big tech IPO in a while.  </p><p>MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p>I think a lot of investors feel like they missed out on Facebook a few  years ago, especially when the IPO went really terribly for the company,  and now Facebook is trading at over $100 a share.  So I think everyone is  really looking forward to a successful IPO from a tech company.  And it has  been a bit.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  And these two founders have also decided to take a  lot of the -- I guess the voting control of the company.  This seems to be  the new thing.  Mark Zuckerberg has a tremendous amount of control over his  company.  Is this the kind of template that now tech CEOs want?  </p><p>MIKE ISAAC:  I think so.  </p><p>And I think investors kind of have a sense of trust that the founders  tend to know best and what's best for their company.  Mark Zuckerberg  really sort of became the pioneer or advocate for this approach, where, you  know, he doesn't really want to hear much of what investors have to say  about how he should run his company.  </p><p>And investors are comfortable with that because he tends to be running  it really well, and it keeps growing, and it keeps making them tons of  money.  So that might work.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Sorry.</p><p>Let's shift gears then to Uber.  It's been in the news recently after  a former employee wrote on her personal blog that she had been sexually  harassed at the company and that it was covered up.  </p><p>Yesterday, Bloomberg released a video of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick in a  heated exchange with an Uber driver over lowering fares for its black cars  service.  The argument took place in February.  </p><p>MAN:  You changed the whole business.  </p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK, CEO, Uber:  What?  What?  </p><p>MAN:  You dropped the prices.  </p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK:  On black.  </p><p>MAN:  Yes, you did.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MAN:  We started with $20.  We started with $20.  How much is the mile  now, $2.75?  </p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK:  You know what?  </p><p>MAN:  What?  </p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK:  Some people don't like to take responsibility for  their... </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK:  They blame everything in their life on somebody  else.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK:  Good luck.  </p><p>MAN:  Good luck to you, too.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Kalanick later apologized.  </p><p>He said in a statement: \"It's clear this video is a reflection of me,  and the criticism we have received is a stark reminder that I must  fundamentally change as a leader and grow up.\"</p><p>That's part of the statement.  </p><p>So, Mike, why is this apology to the driver and the company so  important?  </p><p>MIKE ISAAC:  If you followed the company for the past seven years, one  thing you can say about Travis Kalanick, he's pretty unapologetic.  He's  aggressive.  He's pushed into markets where operating Uber was actually  illegal.  </p><p>And it's been a real no-holds-barred approach to operating a company.   So, to see him say, I have to be humble, I have to change the type of  leader that I am is a real big shift for them.  And I'm really curious if  he can actually do it at this point.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  And this is also a company that is not public yet,  but when it goes, if it goes, the valuations are staggering -- $70 billion  is currently where it's at.  </p><p>Does this call into question perhaps the temperament of this  individual and whether he is the right person to run such a big global  company?</p><p>MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, I think that's right.  </p><p>Almost a $70 billion valuation, I think investors, as well as  employees, are wondering, we had this CEO who got us through the really  tough early phases.  Can this person lead us through an IPO, where people  really want a more even keel?  </p><p>And I think everyone is still asking that question, but it's not  really clear at this point.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  This is in the wake of the revelations of a woman  who left the company, and she had this -- part of this to say in her blog.  </p><p>\"It became obvious that both H.R. and management had been lying about  this being his first offense, and it certainly wasn't his last.  The  situation was escalated as far up the chain as it could be escalated, and  still nothing was done.\"</p><p>She's not talking about Travis.  She's talking about one of her  managers who she contends was harassing to her, and now there's a large  investigation.  This is a big deal for the company.  </p><p>MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, this is -- you know, this is core to how the culture  operates.  </p><p>You know, it's very -- to take it from Facebook, move fast and break  things.  But, at some point, you have to sort of clean things up on the  inside and change, especially if you want to go public.  And I think  they're really facing that question right now.  It's just a question of,  can you do it and how long will it take?  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  For a little while, there was -- and there might  still be continuing -- a delete Uber campaign.  Did that have an impact on  their business?  </p><p>MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, it did.  </p><p>It was -- I would say it's not a material financial impact, but I have  spoken to a number of people who were watching that go down inside.  And,  you know, there were hundreds of thousands of people that deleted their  Uber accounts entirely, and probably hundreds of thousands more that just  deleted the app.  </p><p>So, it worried Uber, and they definitely tried to curb it pretty  quickly.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  All right, Mike Isaac of The New York Times, thanks  so much.  </p><p>MIKE ISAAC:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And now to our Leading edge segment for this week: a  potential return to the moon.  </p><p>Near the end of his address last night, the president made a reference  to space travel, saying -- quote -- \"American footprints on distant worlds  are not too big a dream.\"</p><p>It was only a line.  But whenever a president speaks on the subject,  the space community is closely trying to read the tea leaves.  The sentence  leaves a lot to interpretation, but all signs seem to indicate there is  renewed focus inside the Trump administration, NASA and the private sector  on travel to the moon, sooner than you might think.  </p><p>Our science correspondent, Miles O'Brien, is here.  </p><p>So, Miles, why the moon after all these years?  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  Aside from the \"because it's there\" answer, it's  actually a good destination to go and learn about living and working on an  encampment in space.  </p><p>You know, we went to the moon 50 years ago now.  We left some  footprints and flags behind, but we didn't really learn how to live there  on a sustained basis.  So, while NASA would still like to go to Mars,  there's a lot of things you can learn about by setting up an encampment on  the moon.  </p><p>And we have learned in the past 50 years there's a lot of water ice on  the moon.  What is water?  Hydrogen and oxygen.  What is rocket fuel?   Hydrogen and oxygen.  So you can learn a lot about how to create rocket  fuel on location and perhaps push deeper into space.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  So this didn't just spring up as an idea because they  couldn't think of anything else?  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  Well, there was one other factor.  There was a mission  planned at the end of '18 for the Space Launch System, which is the next  heavy lift that NASA is working -- heavy lift rocket.  </p><p>One piece of it wasn't going to be ready, built by the Europeans, a  service module.  And so NASA was faced with the possibility of delaying  that mission, an unmanned mission, even later, or maybe doing something  like we did with Apollo 8, something bold.</p><p>In the case of Apollo 8, the lunar module wasn't ready.  And we  decided to go around the moon.  In this case, they're thinking about  putting astronauts on this flight maybe early '19, and send them around the  moon Apollo 8-style.  </p><p>So, a lot of things have lined up.  And, all of a sudden, there is  wide agreement in the space community, this might be the next step.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And you were telling me, Miles, there's a private  sector piece in all of this, Elon Musk announcing just the other day that  two individuals, I guess, with some extra spending money...</p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  To say the least.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  ... have told him they want to go around the moon and  come back to Earth.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  Yes.  </p><p>He got a lot of attention for that.  He doesn't have a rocket to do it  yet.  It's just a design right now.  It's called the Falcon Heavy, which  would have almost the thrust of the mighty Saturn 5 of Apollo days.  </p><p>It will fly for the first time, he hopes, by the summer.  So saying  there are going to be paying passengers on there by '18 is optimistic, for  sure.  So, we will watch that with skepticism.  </p><p>But to the extent that the private sector and the government space  enterprise sort of push each other toward this destination, a lot of space  people are pretty excited about it.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Now, remind us, Miles, why was the moon -- it was on  the agenda at NASA for a while, but it came off.  What was that all about?</p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  Politics.  </p><p>Of course, we lost the shuttle Columbia in '03.  President Bush at the  time canceled the shuttle program and said, let's go back to the moon, a  program called Constellation.  That got some traction.</p><p>And then, of course, President Obama came in and said, we're not going  to the moon.  We're going to Mars.  </p><p>And he wouldn't let anybody talk about going to the moon.  There were  a lot of people who said, you know, we should try the moon first before we  move onto Mars, but that got shelved during the Obama administration.  </p><p>Politics now is different, obviously, with the Trump administration  there.  And I'm told the Trump administration would really like to have  U.S. astronauts taking off from a U.S. spaceport some time in its first  term.  And so this idea of turning that unmanned Space Launch System flight  into a crewed mission is gaining a lot of traction.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And, finally, Miles, there is this question of money.   It costs money to go into space.  </p><p>This is a president who has talked about cutting back domestic  discretionary spending.  Where's the money going to come from?  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  You know, it's interesting.  </p><p>You have to look at the entire space enterprise here.  NASA's budget  is a little more than $19 billion, but if you look at the budget for the  military side of space, it's about $40 billion.  So, what if they  reconsider this idea of a space council, which they're doing, headed by the  vice president, and they start looking at ways to carve out and eliminate  some of the redundancies between the military and the civilian side?</p><p>There may be some ways, even with NASA cuts, that they can borrow from  each other, feed each other technology, as it were, military and civilian,  which could be a bit of a force multiplier and could make it still  possible.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Interesting, because the president has talked about  spending a lot more money on defense.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  Exactly.  So, that money might ultimately help NASA.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Miles O'Brien, taking us to the moon and back, thank  you.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  To the moon, Alice.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Thank you.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  You're welcome.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  On the \"NewsHour\" online right now:  Aboriginal  Australian art is the oldest continuous art tradition in the world,  stretching back more than 40,000 years.

LEANA WEN, Baltimore Health Commissioner:  We are just treading  water if all we're doing is saving someone's life right now.  We also know  that we have to get them the second part, which is access to long-term  treatments.</p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  All that and more on tonight's \"PBS NewsHour.\"  </p><p>  (BREAK) </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  President Trump is looking to move ahead, in the wake  of his address to Congress.  He won praise today from Republicans, while  Democrats warned that his more moderate sound belies his real intentions.  </p><p>  Wall Street's reaction to the president's business-friendly tone was  euphoric.  The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 300 points to close  above 21000 for the first time.  The Nasdaq rose 78 points, and the S&amp;P 500  added 32.  We will take a closer look at what the president said and what  comes next after the news summary.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  There's word the president's revised travel ban  will no longer include citizens from Iraq.  It had been one of seven  nations included in the initial ban that's still tied up in federal court.  </p><p>  The Associated Press also reports Syrian refugees will no longer be  barred indefinitely under the revised order.  And it drops any explicit  exception for Christian and other religious minorities in Muslim nations.   The White House now says the new order will come in the next few days.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Tornadoes ripped across part of the Midwest last  night, killing three people and damaging more than 100 homes.  The National  Weather Service says it had reports of more than 20 twisters.  Some of the  worst damage came in Illinois and Missouri.  </p><p>  This morning, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner surveyed extensive damage  in the town of Ottawa.  </p><p>  GOV. BRUCE RAUNER (R), Illinois:  We got to count our blessings.  This  could have been way worse.  The warnings systems worked well.  People were  notified.  And it's wonderful the way the residents in the community helped  each other.  They got to elderly residents, gave them a warning that  tornadoes were coming.  People got into their basements.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Forecasters say about 95 million people are in the  path of the same storm system as it moves east.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  Meanwhile, a staggering statistic out of Chicago:   The Windy City had no measurable snow during January and February for the  first time in 146 years, while, in California, there's been so much snow,  that a five-year-long drought may finally be over.  Crews already measured  the state's snowpack once, and did so again today, after one of  California's wettest winters on record.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  In Afghanistan, twin Taliban bombings, and a lengthy  shoot-out, killed at least 16 people in the capital, Kabul.  More than 100  others were wounded.  </p><p>  In the first attack, a suicide car bomber targeted a police station,  touching off a gun battle that lasted hours.  Later, an attacker on foot  blew himself up outside the Afghan intelligence service.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  The United States today delivered a sharp rebuke to  the U.N. Human Rights Council over Israel.  Washington has long argued the  47-nation body unjustly focuses on Israel's treatment of Palestinians.  </p><p>  In Geneva today, U.S. envoy Erin Barclay said the council has -- quote  -- \"an obsession with Israel\" that undermines the group's credibility.  </p><p>  ERIN BARCLAY, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Assistant:  The United  States will oppose any effort to delegitimize or isolate Israel, not just  in the HRC, but wherever it occurs.  When it comes to human rights, no  country should be free from scrutiny, but neither should any democratic  country be regularly subjected to unfair, unbalanced and unfounded bias.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  The critique comes amid reports the Trump  administration is considering quitting the council altogether.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Back in this country, the U.S. Senate easily confirmed  Montana Congressman Ryan Zinke as secretary of the interior.  The 55-year- old Republican and former Navy SEAL has pledged to revitalize the country's  national parks.  He has also said he will resist efforts to sell or  transfer federal lands.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  And Danish toymaker LEGO has announced plans for a  new set honoring five women who were pioneers at NASA.  The collection will  feature computer scientist Margaret Hamilton, mathematician Katherine  Johnson of \"Hidden Figures\" fame, astronauts Sally Ride and Mae Jemison,  and astronomer Nancy Grace Roman.  The set will be released later this year  or early 2018.  </p><p>  Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": President Trump lays out his vision  for the country -- now, what policies will take priority?; a closer look at  the decision-making before the deadly raid in Yemen; Baltimore's approach  to battling the growing opioid epidemic; and much more.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  We take a longer look now at President Trump's speech  last night.  </p><p>  He promised action on a long list of priorities, including Obamacare,  the border wall, public works and regulatory reform.  And all of it, he did  in a more disciplined, upbeat way than before.  </p><p>  Lisa Desjardins reports on the day after.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  The president called in Republican leaders for a  White House lunch, hoping to build on momentum from last night's address.  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:  It begins as of now,  and we think we're going to have tremendous success.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  Vice President Pence took that theme on a one-man  media blitz, with 11 interviews on his public schedule.  </p><p>  MIKE PENCE, Vice President of the United States:  What the American  people saw last night is the president that I serve with every day: broad  shoulders, big heart, reaching out, focusing on the future.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  Praise came from top Republicans in Congress as  well.  </p><p>  SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority Leader:  The president made  clear last night he's ready to work with Congress on policies that can  actually move us forward.  He will find many partners in Congress excited  to get those things accomplished.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  High on that list, repealing and replacing  Obamacare.  Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a former Republican primary rival,  lauded Mr. Trump for his broad outline.  </p><p>  SEN. TED CRUZ (R), Texas:  The principles he's focused on are exactly  the right principles: more choice, more competition, lower costs, lower  premiums.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  But Democrats say there was no real substance, and  they accuse the president of misleading the public with statements like  this:  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP:  Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double  and triple digits.  As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year  alone.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  In fact, while it's true Arizona's premiums have  gone up by that amount, the president ignored important context, that  Arizona is an outlier, with increases four times the national average.  </p><p>  On immigration, some Republicans say they're encouraged by Mr. Trump's  comments ahead of his speech that he'd consider a legal status for some  undocumented immigrants.  </p><p>  SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South Carolina:  He's showing some  willingness to embrace a more practical immigration proposal.  I want to  give him credit for that.  Any time he moves into the land of practicality,  I want to encourage him, because that's what it's going to take to get a  bill passed.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  But in the actual speech, there was no mention of  legalizing undocumented immigrants.  Instead, the president spoke of crimes  by immigrants and his plan to crack down on the undocumented.  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP:  By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will  raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars,  and make our communities safer for everyone.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  That claim, too, was challenged.  </p><p>  Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota spoke with the  \"NewsHour\" last night.</p><p>  REP. KEITH ELLISON (D), Minnesota:  This speech seems to blame  undocumented immigrants for a crime.  It indicated that clamping down on  immigration was actually going to increase wages and make our economy  better.  The fact is, there's no facts that support that.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  Several of the presidents statements were declared  inaccurate by fact-checkers today.  Also getting attention, the generally  positive tone of the speech.  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP:  Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite  for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.  </p><p>  (APPLAUSE)</p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  But Democratic leaders say it's all a facade.  </p><p>  SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority Leader:  You can't just talk the  talk, Mr. President.  You have to walk the walk.  And on issue after issue  after issue, we haven't seen anything, or negative things, for the working  class.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  The president and Congress both soon will see  pressure for action increase soon.  House Republicans have said they want a  draft health care bill by the end of this month.  At that point, Trump will  be just one month away from the end of his first 100 days.  </p><p>  For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Lisa Desjardins.</p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Last night's presidential address relayed an ambitious  agenda.  But how much of it will take shape, and does President Trump have  enough support on Capitol Hill to find success?  </p><p>  Joining me to discuss all of that are Dan Balz of The Washington Post  and NPR congressional reporter Susan Davis.  </p><p>  And we welcome both of you back to the program.  </p><p>  Dan, I'm going to start with you.  </p><p>  We just heard Lisa Desjardins talk about this was a different tone  coming from the president.  You wrote about that today in The Washington  Post.  It was a change from what we have been hearing.  </p><p>  DAN BALZ, Chief Political Reporter, The Washington Post:  It was a  dramatic change from what we have been hearing.</p><p>  And I looked back to the inaugural address, which was described by so  many people as dark or dystopian, the phrase American carnage being one  that leaped out at people and has stayed with people, a very downbeat view  of things in the state of the nation, the state of the world.  </p><p>  The substance of last night wasn't significantly or materially  different from what he's talked about all through the campaign and in his  inaugural address, but the tone was so much different.  He talked about  unity repeatedly.  He talked about cooperating with Democrats.  He talked  about a spirit of American renewal.  </p><p>  And it was -- it was a speech that was certainly aimed at reassuring  his congressional Republican allies that he will be presidential, if you  will, going forward, that he will be serious about trying to get these  things done, and that he will not be seeking to create diversion and  digression and controversies.  </p><p>  Whether he's able to stay with that, we don't know.  I mean, this was  only one speech, and we know the history of Donald Trump is that there are  moments when he -- you know, he goes in directions that even his staff  doesn't want.  But for that hour in the House chamber last night, he was  the Donald Trump that a lot of elected officials have wanted to see for a  long time.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  And, Sue Davis, it was a confident-sounding speech, as  if he expects these things to happen.  How much of what he's done and what  he said he's going to do so far is actually taking effect?  </p><p>  SUSAN DAVIS, NPR:  Well, let's start with the two top priorities for  Congress that we know, health care and taxes.  </p><p>  And his remarks in the speech last night, it's like they could have  been written by House Speaker Paul Ryan.  And the speaker's office has been  saying, there's no daylight between us.  There's no daylight between us.  </p><p>  But the president is fairly erratic.  He has tweeted different things  on positions at different times that have contradicted the speaker.  And  they saw the speech as incredibly reassuring, as Dan said, not only that  they're on the same page, but that the president is capable of using the  moment to show leadership to sort of build the case for these conservative  ideas.  </p><p>  Republicans say health care is on track.  They expect to see a bill  within weeks, not months.  And they saw the president's speech last night  as an almost tacit endorsement of this plan that's emerging from the House.  </p><p>  The fight that's going to be really interesting is that there is a  group of conservatives in the Senate, namely Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted  Cruz of Texas, and Mike Lee of Utah, who are -- could be an immovable force  on this, who say it is not conservative enough.  </p><p>  And we're going to see this really interesting test of conservatism  and the conservatives that bedeviled past leaders in Congress and Donald  Trump, and who is going to win out this fight.  And I talked to Rand Paul  today, and he said, what has emerged from the House, he will not vote for.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  And, Dan Balz, to what extent is the White House  prepared for that kind of pushback from people in their own party?</p><p>  DAN BALZ:  Well, I think they are prepared.  </p><p>  I think they know it's there.  They have been getting pushback for  some time.  There is not only opposition from conservatives on Capitol  Hill.  There is division among the Republican governors -- put aside the  Democratic governors -- over what to do with Medicaid.  </p><p>  If you were a state that expanded Medicaid, you have got one view of  that.  And if you didn't, you have got another view of that.  There are  divisions.  </p><p>  I think the administration today feels that, as a result of the  speech, people who have been reticent to support him or openly hostile to  what is taking shape in the House might be a little more amenable to  working with the administration.  </p><p>  Secretary Price from HHS and the vice president, Mike Pence, are going  to be the point people from the administration.  I think one question is to  what extent the administration will, in fact, put down a proposal and move  toward Congress or wait for Congress to really do it and then come in at  the end.</p><p>  I think Congress would like the president to lead as effectively as he  can, in part, I think, to try to create the consensus that doesn't exist  today.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  And then, Sue Davis, there's immigration, where -- I  happened to be at a lunch with the president yesterday where he was talking  about he liked want idea of an immigration bill, if he could get the two  sides to compromise.  He didn't talk very much about comprehensive  immigration reform last night.  </p><p>  He talked about the wall.  And we know there's that travel ban,  renewed version of that.  But what is the mood?  What are the attitudes on  the Hill about immigration?  </p><p>  SUSAN DAVIS:  Well, here's what we know is going to happen.  </p><p>  In a couple of weeks, he's going to send a request to Congress asking  for undetermined amounts of millions of dollars to start building that  wall.  But immigration -- comprehensive immigration reform hasn't really  been part of the conversation on the Hill.  </p><p>  It wasn't part of the agenda outlined by Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell and Speaker Ryan at the beginning of the Congress.  I talked to  the speaker's office today that said it's still not necessarily at the top  of the agenda.  But if the president decides that he wants this to be a  priority, he has tremendous power to make it a priority and upend what the  congressional schedule is.  </p><p>  I think, on that issue, where I think Congress is trying to take the  lead on things like health care and taxes, on immigration, I think they'd  like to see the White House be a little bit more assertive and outline  specifically what the president would like to do, specifically because that  issue was such a core, center point of his campaign.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Just finally to the two of you -- and I hate to ask  you to do this quickly -- but, Dan Balz, the president really mentioned tax  reform only briefly last night, taxes at all.  </p><p>  What does it look -- what does the atmosphere look like?  What are the  realities in terms of getting tax reform done this year?  </p><p>  DAN BALZ:  Well, it will be very challenging.  </p><p>  Just simply getting the health care bill through will be potentially a  year-long effort, as we saw in the Obama administration.  On taxes, they  don't have a plan at this point.  And health care will have to go first.   Taxes will have to follow.  There are questions about what he really wants  to do.  </p><p>  He provided no details of that last night.  He provided some  principles on health care at least.  On tax reform and tax legislation, he  offered nothing of substance beyond kind of a generalized notion of what he  wants.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Did you pick up anything on that, Sue?  </p><p>  SUSAN DAVIS:  I see the fates of health care and taxes linked.  </p><p>  If the repeal and replace effort falls apart, I think tax reform falls  apart.  If repeal and replace, if they're able to get something to the  president's desk, I think that that increase the chances that they can  actually move on taxes this year.  </p><p>  I don't think they can be seen as separate tracks.  I think they have  to move together.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Well, it is an ambitious agenda.  </p><p>  SUSAN DAVIS:  Extremely.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  We're talking health care.  We're talking -- and we  didn't even mention infrastructure, which is something the president has  said he wants to get done too.</p><p>  But we're going to leave it there for now.  We thank both of you for  talking to us, Dan Balz of The Washington Post, Susan Davis of NPR.  We  thank you.  </p><p>  SUSAN DAVIS:  Thank you.  </p><p>  DAN BALZ:  Thank you.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  More than a month after a controversial special  operations raid was launched on a moonless night in Yemen, questions  persist about how that mission was authorized, what it accomplished, and  how it's been explained by the White House and by the president.  </p><p>  Margaret Warner begins our coverage.  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:  Ryan's legacy is etched  into eternity.  </p><p>  MARGARET WARNER:  Democrats and Republicans alike rose to their feet  last night the widow of Navy SEAL Ryan Owens, who was killed during a  January raid in Yemen.  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP:  Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero, battling  against terrorism and securing our nation.  </p><p>  MARGARET WARNER:  The Trump White House says the raid was planned by  the Pentagon during the Obama administration, and President Trump gave the  go-ahead during his first week in office.  </p><p>  The Pentagon intended as an intelligence-gathering mission against al- Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the militant group's most feared  branches.  But a gun battle erupted, and Owens was killed, reportedly along  with as many as 30 civilians, including children.  </p><p>  Last night, the president said Defense Secretary Mattis told him the  mission would lead to victories in the future.  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP:  Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that  generated large amounts of vital intelligence.</p><p>  MARGARET WARNER:  But others question that claim, and last month,  Republican Senator John McCain suggested the raid was a failure.  </p><p>  Mr. Trump respond by charging such criticism only emboldened the  enemy, and White House spokesman Sean Spicer joined in.  </p><p>  SEAN SPICER, White House Press Secretary:  I think anybody who  undermines the success of that raid owes an apology and does a disservice  to the life of Chief Owens.  </p><p>  MARGARET WARNER:  The SEAL's father, William Owens, refused to meet  with the president when his son's remains were flown home.  </p><p>  Instead, he told The Miami Herald that Mr. Trump shouldn't -- quote --  \"hide behind his son's death to prevent an investigation.\"</p><p>  The president again deflected criticism in an interview aired  yesterday on FOX News, saying he followed the military's advice.  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP:  This was a mission that was started before I got here.   They explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very  respected. And they lost Ryan.  </p><p>  MARGARET WARNER:  Today, South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham  offered this advice:  </p><p>  SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South Carolina:  Don't oversell results.  The  only sin I think a commander in chief can make is exaggerating successes  and not understanding the challenges.  </p><p>  MARGARET WARNER:  For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Margaret Warner.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  And joining me now from the White House, Sebastian  Gorka.  He is deputy assistant to the president.  He advises the  administration on national security issues.  </p><p>  Mr. Gorka, thank you for being with us.  </p><p>  Picking up on what we heard from senator Graham, did the president  fully understand the challenges involved when he signed off on this? </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA, Deputy Assistant to President Trump:  Of course he  did.  He's the commander in chief.  He takes his job very, very seriously.  </p><p>  If you look at the way he's treated law enforcement, if you look at  the way he's treated the military, this is a man who fully understands the  burden of leadership and the responsibility he has as the commander in  chief.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Well, he suggested in that interview with FOX News  yesterday that he did it mainly because the generals suggested that he do  it, that they recommended it.  Is that the case?  </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA:  We don't give our internal playbook away.  That's  what the last administration did.  That's how people get in big, big  trouble.  </p><p>  These are classified operations by our tier one operators.  So, he  acted and made a decision based upon the best advice of our military.   That's the way it has to work, Judy.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Well, my question is, Mr. Gorka, because we just --  again, looking at that FOX interview, referring to the generals, the  president said, \"They lost Ryan.\"</p><p>  Does that mean he doesn't accept responsibility? </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA:  Of course it doesn't.  And I find it quite churlish  when the media focuses on half a sentence here, half a sentence there.  </p><p>  Why would you even posit that of the president?  It's really  unbecoming.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  So, the president accepts, in effect, the buck stops  with him? </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA:  Of course he does.  He's the president.  This is a  team effort, nevertheless.  </p><p>  Nobody goes into battle alone, but he is the commander in chief.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  We also heard the president say that the raid was  highly successful, that it generated a large amount of intelligence that  will be valuable, useful for the administration.  </p><p>  But we also know that there are a number of news organization  reporting that senior officials saying that is not the case, that there is  not valuable intelligence from that raid.  What are we to believe?  </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA:  Is that the same kind of sources that reported all  kinds of fallacious things inside the White House?  </p><p>  The sad truth is, Judy, since I started working here six weeks ago, I  find that more than 50 percent of the more sensational things I read are  wholly fallacious and unfounded.  </p><p>  I can tell you because I'm inside the building when those decisions  are being taken.  So, it's easy to make up unnamed sources, but the fact is  life is a little different from what you would read in the mainstream media  inside the White House.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  What do you say to the American people who are asking,  why is the U.S. in Yemen in the first place?  </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA:  Oh, very easy, very, very easy.  </p><p>  As the president pointed out yesterday, we are facing a global threat.   It is radical Islamic terrorism.  Another great synonym is the global  jihadi movement.  And the idea that Yemen or another country that doesn't  have adequate governance is not potentially connected to the threat to the  United States is, again, a very, very dangerous concept.  </p><p>  These aren't just events occurring 8,000 or 10,000 miles away.   Remember, Omar Mateen, as he slayed 49 Americans in the Pulse nightclub,  stopped to dial 911, not to call an ambulance, Judy, but to swear  allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in the Middle East.  </p><p>  That's just how interconnected the threat is today and how real the  war is from the streets of Aleppo right to Orlando.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Well, I want to pick up on the phrase you just used,  radical Islamic terrorism.  We heard the president say that last night.</p><p>  But it has also been reported, as you know, several news  organizations, that the president's new security adviser, General H.R.  McMaster, has advised the president not to use that term, in effect because  it suggests that all who believe in Islam as a faith, that there's some  strain there that's connected to terrorism.  </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA:  How does it -- A, the reports are, again, false.   It's fake news.  Not true.  </p><p>  You need to talk to General McMaster, who I talked to yesterday before  the speech.  It's not what he said.  And, again, how does the phrase  radical Islamic terrorism link all the believers of a faith to terrorism?  </p><p>  If I said radical Christian terrorism, does that mean I as a Catholic  are a terrorist?  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  So, I'm just trying to understand.  So you're saying  the president is not suggesting that there is something inherent in all of  Islam that is at odds with Western values?  </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA:  That would be asinine.  Of course he didn't.  </p><p>  We are dealing with a version of Islam, with criminals, mass  murderers, people who run slave markets, that use a religion, use a seventh  century, atavistic, blood-curdled version of it to justify their actions.  </p><p>  But I can tell you, the idea that you can separate jihadi terrorism  from Islam is exactly what got us in the mess we are today, with 65 million  refugees around the world and with ISIS controlling territory in multiple  countries.  </p><p>  If you talk to Muslims, as I do -- I have trained hundreds of Muslim  officers from our partner nations when I was in the Defense Department --  they will tell you, Judy, this is a war inside Islam for the heart of  Islam.  We are not at war with Islam.  That is a very dangerous and very  fallacious idea.  </p><p>  But we know that our Muslim allies are fighting a war for the heart of  Islam.  Ask the Jordanians.  Ask the Egyptians.  They understand the  relevance of jihadist ideology in this war.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Sebastian Gorka, who is a deputy assistant to  President Trump, we thank you very much.  </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA:  My pleasure.  Any time, Judy.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  Now views on the raid in Yemen and the decision- making behind it.  </p><p>  We talk to two men with intimate knowledge of the process that  authorized the use of military force during the Obama administration.  </p><p>  Colin Kahl was deputy assistant to the president and national security  adviser to the vice president during the Obama administration.  He is now  an associate professor at Georgetown University.  Andrew Exum was deputy  assistant secretary of defense for Middle East policy during the Obama  administration.  He also served in the Army form 2000 to 2004 in  Afghanistan and Iraq.  </p><p>  Colin, let me start with you.  </p><p>  We have heard the president say, this was a mission that was started  before I got here.  </p><p>  You were in the rooms where these mission have been discussed for the  Obama administration before he left.  What did the previous administration  leave for President Trump to pick up?  </p><p>  COLIN KAHL, Former Deputy Assistant to President Obama:  Yes.  </p><p>  Well, for years, the United States has been taking military action  against this group, AQAP, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, al Qaeda's  affiliate in Yemen, predominantly through drone strikes, airstrikes.  </p><p>  What came to the White House shortly before Christmas was a proposal  from the Pentagon to expand the authorities and resources to allow special  operations forces to more actively engage in direct raids to go after  compounds, like the one that we saw in January.  </p><p>  But a couple of things, I think, are important to note.  First, they  never briefed a particular raid.  They didn't say, we're going to go after  a particular target or a compound on this night or this day.  Instead, they  asked for a broad set of authorities to do this type of thing.  </p><p>  And, importantly, when the deputies convened, kind of a sub-cabinet  level of government convened in early January, they recommended that this  decision get deferred to the Trump administration, so they could run their  own careful process.  And President Obama agreed on that, that he would  make no decision whether to do things like this, and instead that Trump  should run his own process.  </p><p>  But, instead, Trump had a dinner party and decided it over dinner.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  So, you're saying the category of raids was what  was discussed, not this specific raid, because we saw reports that perhaps  they were waiting for a moonless night, that was the opportune time, it  couldn't have happened in the Obama administration's last few days.  </p><p>  COLIN KAHL:  I will defer to Andrew, who worked in the Pentagon, on  this one.</p><p>  But my understanding is that there were a number of concepts of  operations that were bouncing around the Pentagon for a long time, and this  raid may have been one of them.  It was never brought across the river to  the White House.  </p><p>  And as it relates to the moonless night issue, a Pentagon spokesperson  said that that issue didn't become relevant until after January 20, when  they then asked for the authority to do the raid to Trump.  </p><p>  And, importantly, that's why I think it's extraordinarily unfair to  our men and women in the armed services for Trump to suggest, as he did on  FOX yesterday, that somehow this is the military's fault.  He's the  commander in chief.  The buck stops with him.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  Andrew Exum, fill in that blank there.  From the  Pentagon's perspective, what was left for the Trump administration?</p><p>  ANDREW EXUM, Former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense:  Well,  no, I think that that's an accurate recounting of the way that things were  presented to the Trump administration and to the Obama administration  before the -- before the Trump inauguration.  </p><p>  I think that we in the Obama administration, those are of us who  served in the Obama administration need to be very careful as we criticize  the process that the Trump administration used to approve this.  </p><p>  First off, to approve this raid, it would have gone through several  hurdles just through the Department of Defense before being presented to  the president.  When we in the Obama administration brought these options  to the president, it followed a very deliberate interagency process.  </p><p>  It's what worked for President Obama.  Just because we have seen,  quite frankly, a lot of a -- lot of mess in the Trump administration thus  far in their first month, I think we have got to be careful about saying  that we had all the answers during the Obama administration.  </p><p>  I think Colin would agree with that.  This president's going find a  decision-making process that works for him.  What happened in Yemen may  cause him to rethink the way in which he approved this raid, because you  can always delegate authority.  You can never delegate the risk.   Ultimately, you're going to own that, as Dr. Gorka mentioned from the White  House.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  Andrew, I want to -- you recently wrote that  blaming the president is both inappropriate and counterproductive.  You  also described sometimes that the process can be paralysis by analysis.  </p><p>  ANDREW EXUM:  Yes.    </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  That it can take a very long time.  </p><p>  ANDREW EXUM:  No, that's right.  </p><p>  Colin remembers that, at one point in the waning days of the Obama  administration, I think we were debating at the Cabinet level the movement  of three helicopters from Iraq to Syria.  </p><p>  Now, there are obvious, you know, political implications of anything  you do on the ground.  But at what point do you delegate authority down to  your commander on the ground, I think, is the key question.</p><p>  The reason why I think putting the -- putting real blame on the Trump  administration here is dangerous is because you have the Benghazi effect.   You remember, when the Republicans used Benghazi and what happened there as  a cudgel to beat Hillary Clinton, and without -- you know their effort was  successful, it must be added, to weaken her as a political candidate.  </p><p>  But it also had a chilling effect on the bureaucracy.  It makes the  bureaucracy risk-averse.  And, quite frankly, that's not something that we  want from our diplomats.  It's not something we want from our special  operators.  </p><p>  We want them to be aggressive.  We want them to take risks.  And when  we elevate the blame, when something goes wrong, all the way to the  presidential level, we just have got to be very careful about how we do  that.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  And, Colin, why does it take so long?  What kinds  of input factor into a decision like this?  </p><p>  COLIN KAHL:  Yes, look, I think that the Obama administration can be  criticized for too much micromanagement of the Pentagon.  </p><p>  I think, you know, the question is, did they swing the pendulum too  far in one direction?  But I worry that President Trump, in the first big  decision that came to his, in this case, dinner table as commander in  chief, he swung the pendulum all the way back in the other direction.  </p><p>  Look, what President Obama insisted on is, every time that the  military wanted to come forward to ask for authority to significantly  escalate, especially to put ground forces into a conflict environment,  where people can die, both our service members, but also civilians and  others, that we needed to have a careful, deliberate process.  </p><p>  It doesn't have to take weeks.  It oftentimes takes a couple of days.   But it works its way through, and you get the inputs from all the various  agencies.  </p><p>  The question I have with Trump's decision-making process here is not  that you have to do it exactly the way we did it, but he didn't run a  process at all.  He just had dinner with Secretary Mattis and General  Dunford and a handful of close advisers and was briefed about the raid and  made a decision.  </p><p>  And, as a consequence, he didn't have the full benefit of his  intelligence professionals, of his State Department.  And that is a recipe  for making mistakes and costing people their lives.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  Andrew Exum, what about the idea that, when there  are these different agencies, these different people weighing in on it,  that they're going to think about diplomatic consequences, political  consequences, things that perhaps a commander in the field might not think  about because, for him or her, they see a much different objective?</p><p>  ANDREW EXUM:  Yes, it's a valid point.</p><p>  I think the way Colin described things, I think he's right that the  pendulum swung back.  I wouldn't say it went all the way back, because,  again, the decision-making process in this raid would have gone through a  very rigorous process in the Pentagon.  It would have been blessed off by  all the Pentagon senior leaders before it would have been presented to the  president.</p><p>  So it wasn't completely without rigor.  But I think what Colin is  describing in terms of baking down the risk, that does happen in a  deliberate process like that.  The key question is opportunity cost.  </p><p>  So, in the Obama administration, we had a very deliberate process that  in many cases served the president and was what the president desired.  It  drew down a lot of political risks, as well as the physical risk, to the  operators on the ground.  </p><p>  The question is, was there an opportunity cost?  The nature of these  raids is, they go after time-sensitive targets.  So do you lose  opportunities the more that you hold things up in Washington?  I think  that's the key question.  </p><p>  And where Colin and I may disagree, but where I think we do agree, is  that there has to be a balance.  It's just a matter of where you strike  that balance.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  All right, Andrew Exum, Colin Kahl, thank you both.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Stay with us.  </p><p>  Coming up on the \"NewsHour\": the successes and struggles of two of the  world's fastest growing businesses; and a plan to once again send humans to  the moon.  </p><p>  But first: the nation's opioid crisis.  </p><p>  Overdose deaths are on the rise across the country, in 2015,  surpassing gun homicides for the first time.  One of the hardest-hit states  is Maryland, where the governor today declared a state of emergency to  fight the epidemic.  </p><p>  But, for more than a year, the city of Baltimore has been training  everyday citizens in how to use a lifesaving antidote, an approach that's  catching on across the country.  </p><p>  \"NewsHour\" producer Pamela Kirkland visited Baltimore to find out  more.  </p><p>  MAN:  Excuse me, sir, are you interested in Narcan training?  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Each week, city health workers hit the streets of  Baltimore, handing out an emergency medication that brings users back from  the dead.  </p><p>  MAN:  This is the medicine.  It reverses overdoses.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Naloxone, brand name Narcan, comes as a nasal spray  or injection, and works by blocking the brain's opioid receptors.  </p><p>  In a city with 24,000 active heroin users, overdoses, and now  increasingly this emergency antidote have become facts of life.  </p><p>  MAN:  I lost a friend of mine that was -- at 25 years old.  </p><p>  MAN:  I have just seen so many young people getting hooked on the  opioids, or better yet, the fentanyl.  And it's definitely a killer, </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  In Maryland, deaths from opioids, which include  heroin, fentanyl and prescription painkillers, doubled between 2010 and  2015, to just under 1,100 people a year.  Meanwhile, heroin fatalities  alone more than tripled.  </p><p>  And in just the past three years, deaths in Baltimore from fentanyl, a  synthetic opioid far stronger than heroin, are up 20-fold.  </p><p>  DR. LEANA WEN, Baltimore Health Commissioner:  We have an epidemic of  people, fellow residents in our city, who are dying from opioid overdose.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  In late 2015, Dr. Leana Wen, Baltimore's health  commissioner, and a practicing emergency room physician, issued a standing  order for naloxone to all 620,000 city residents.  </p><p>  DR. LEANA WEN:  What that means is that, if somebody goes through a  very basic training -- and we do trainings everywhere, including on street  corners, in jails, in public housing, really anywhere that people are --  they will immediately get a prescription for naloxone, and even get the  medication in hand.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Just one dose of naloxone can bring someone back.   Residents can buy it at a pharmacy, only $1 for Medicaid recipients.  And  thanks to a 2015 good samaritan law, there's no risk of prosecution if  citizens intervene and the victim dies.  </p><p>  MAN:  I have used it four times.  I keep them in my bag.  I always  keep them in my bag, at least four or five of them in my bag.</p><p>  JOHN HARRIS, Baltimore Health Department:  This is our mobile unit.</p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  John Harris works on one of the Health Department's  vans which traverse the city offering sexually transmitted infection  screenings, clean needle kits and naloxone training.  </p><p>  JOHN HARRIS:  Well, we tell people that, once you reverse an overdose,  then not to use that.</p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  He knows what addiction can do to a person, having  spent 16 years addicted to heroin.  But he sees something different today.  </p><p>  JOHN HARRIS:  There was a lot of fentanyl at first that we were  hearing about.  But now the clients are starting to come with medications  that they use on an elephant, tranquilizers being cut with heroin.  There  are benzodiazepines.  We're hearing about all different types of drugs.   It's really becoming more complicated and dangerous.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Since January 2015, the Baltimore Health Department  says over 20,000 residents have completed naloxone training and at least  800 lives have been saved.</p><p>  And many more states and municipalities across the country have moved  to make naloxone more accessible to the public.  But not everyone believes  this is the right approach.  </p><p>  MIKE GIMBEL, Maryland Addiction Recovery Center:  We are selling it to  the public as if it's the answer.  I mean, it's an amazing drug, no doubt  about it, but it doesn't change the behavior of the addict.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  For 25 years, Mike Gimbel was Baltimore County's  director of substance abuse.  Now he's a consultant for Maryland Addiction  Recovery Center, a private treatment facility outside the city.  And like  John Harris, Gimbel is in recovery.  </p><p>  MIKE GIMBEL:  Heroin is the devil.  It's the devil.  It makes you do  things you would never do you in your life.  It took a middle-class, good  Jewish kid like me, and had me robing my own parents, carrying a gun. </p><p>  That's what heroin does.  That's how powerful heroin is.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  He argues that the city and state are spending too  much time and money on Narcan training and outreach, and not enough on  long-term recovery.  </p><p>  And as a sign this approach isn't working, he points to the city's  rising overdose fatalities, up 68 percent for the first three-quarters of  2016 over the same period the year before.  </p><p>  MIKE GIMBEL:  Sometimes, by having Narcan so available, it actually  reinforces the addict's behavior.  Why should I stop using heroin, when, if  I overdose, Narcan's going to save my life?  Where's the motivation to  stop?  It's not there.  It's not there.  </p><p>  So, sometimes, yes -- and we don't want to see people die, but,  sometimes, watching someone die and watching what happens with overdose and  death wakes up a lot of addicts.  </p><p>  TIMMY HALL, Former Baltimore Police Officer:  It's just a first- responder tool.  That's all it is.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Timmy Hall was with the Baltimore Police Department  for 24 years, where he routinely saw opioid overdoses.  He says officers  often use Narcan to revive the same drug users over and over again.  </p><p>  TIMMY HALL:  A lot of times, they get upset with you when you bring  them back, because they feel like you wasted the money they spent.  You  know, that's the feeling that they wanted.  That wanted that feeling, and  you took it away from them.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  But Hall doesn't see an alternative.  </p><p>  TIMMY HALL:  As a police officer, your first job is to protect and  serve, you know?  And what officer would want to sit there and watch  somebody die, if they got the tools to save somebody?  So, Narcan, to me,  is a great tool.  It's just a first-responder tool.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  The Health Department attributes the continued rise  in overdoses and fatalities to a rise in far more powerful drugs hitting  the streets.  </p><p>  Dr. Wen says there's no evidence that denying naloxone to overdose  victims helps users end their addictions.  Naloxone is just one tool in  this fight.  </p><p>  DR. LEANA WEN:  We are just treading water if all we're doing is  saving someone's life right now.  We also know that we have to get them the  second part, which is access to long-term treatments, that it's a  combination of medications and some treatments, psychosocial treatments,  like counseling.  And then other services are important too, including  housing.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Of course, those all cost money and political will.  </p><p>  GOV. LARRY HOGAN (R), Maryland:  Heroin and opioid abuse has been  taking lives and tearing apart families.</p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Just today, Maryland's Republican governor, Larry  Hogan, announced a state of emergency to deal with the crisis, pledging 50  million additional dollars over five years for enforcement, treatment and  prevention.</p><p>  JOHN HARRIS:  It's got to get better.  It's got to get better.  And I  believe it will get better.  I don't think perfection exists in anything,  but I do believe Baltimore has done a lot of good work, will do some more  good work, because we are saving lives.    </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Saving some lives amid a growing epidemic.  </p><p>  For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Pamela Kirkland in Baltimore.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  Now: two high-flying companies whose value has  soared and are the subject of intense scrutiny, Uber, and the parent  company of Snapchat.  </p><p>  For Uber, it's about the culture and leadership of the ride-hailing  service, valued at nearly $70 billion.  It's back in the spotlight  following release of a video of its CEO berating an Uber driver.  More on  that in a moment.  </p><p>  But, first, Snapchat is about to sell its stock to the public for the  first time.  The parent company announced it will offer its share at $17 a  share, bringing its value to nearly $24 billion.  The messaging app is used  by nearly 160 million people each day, and is especially popular among  teens and young adults.  </p><p>  But there are big questions about whether it's worth this kind of  value.  </p><p>  Mike Isaac is covering both these stories for The New York Times.  He  joins me now.  </p><p>  Let's start with Snapchat.  What is the value that Snapchat is trying  to sell investors?  </p><p>  MIKE ISAAC, The New York Times:  Yes.  </p><p>  So, Snapchat's big story is, it's going to be its next Facebook and  not the next Twitter, essentially.  One of Twitter's big struggles, if you  remember, when it went public a few years ago, is, it sort of failed to  grow fast enough for investors on Wall Street.</p><p>  And so, as far as Facebook is concerned, their growth was huge, but  Snapchat just wants to say, like, look, this is the next big social  network.  You want to get in as quickly as possible on the ground floor of  this IPO, and we're going to have the success and strength and reach of  Facebook, particularly with younger users.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  How does it plan to make money?  At one point, it  calls itself now a camera company.  So, is it a social network?  Is it a  camera company?  Do they make money selling advertisements?  </p><p>  MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, so it's primarily advertisements.  They have little  what they call Snapchat stories.</p><p>  And publications like The New York Times will show different things  inside of their -- usually video and photo-based.  And then they sell ads  against that.  </p><p>  And then they're kind of experimenting with other things, whether it's  like e-commerce-related things inside the app.  And then who knows?  They  have what are called Snapchat Spectacles, which are glasses on your face,  and maybe they can make money from that.  I'm not really sure.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  And so part of the reason that it looks like Wall  Street is excited is because there hasn't been a big tech IPO in a while.  </p><p>  MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p>  I think a lot of investors feel like they missed out on Facebook a few  years ago, especially when the IPO went really terribly for the company,  and now Facebook is trading at over $100 a share.  So I think everyone is  really looking forward to a successful IPO from a tech company.  And it has  been a bit.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  And these two founders have also decided to take a  lot of the -- I guess the voting control of the company.  This seems to be  the new thing.  Mark Zuckerberg has a tremendous amount of control over his  company.  Is this the kind of template that now tech CEOs want?  </p><p>  MIKE ISAAC:  I think so.  </p><p>  And I think investors kind of have a sense of trust that the founders  tend to know best and what's best for their company.  Mark Zuckerberg  really sort of became the pioneer or advocate for this approach, where, you  know, he doesn't really want to hear much of what investors have to say  about how he should run his company.  </p><p>  And investors are comfortable with that because he tends to be running  it really well, and it keeps growing, and it keeps making them tons of  money.  So that might work.  </p><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  Sorry.</p><p>  Let's shift gears then to Uber.  It's been in the news recently after  a former employee wrote on her personal blog that she had been sexually  harassed at the company and that it was covered up.  </p><p>  Yesterday, Bloomberg released a video of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick in a  heated exchange with an Uber driver over lowering fares for its black cars  service.  The argument took place in February.  </p><p>  MAN:  You changed the whole business.  </p><p>  TRAVIS KALANICK, CEO, Uber:  What?  What?  </p><p>  MAN:  You dropped the prices.  </p><p>  TRAVIS KALANICK:  On black.  </p><p>  MAN:  Yes, you did.  </p><p>  (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>  MAN:  We started with $20.  We started with $20.  How much is the mile  now, $2.75?  </p><p>  TRAVIS KALANICK:  You know what?  </p><p>  MAN:  What?  </p><p>  TRAVIS KALANICK:  Some people don't like to take responsibility for  their... </p><p>  (CROSSTALK) </p><p>  TRAVIS KALANICK:  They blame everything in their life on somebody  else.  </p><p>  (CROSSTALK) </p><p>  TRAVIS KALANICK:  Good luck.  </p><p>  MAN:  Good luck to you, too.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  Kalanick later apologized.  </p><p>  He said in a statement: \"It's clear this video is a reflection of me,  and the criticism we have received is a stark reminder that I must  fundamentally change as a leader and grow up.\"</p><p>  That's part of the statement.  </p><p>  So, Mike, why is this apology to the driver and the company so  important?  </p><p>  MIKE ISAAC:  If you followed the company for the past seven years, one  thing you can say about Travis Kalanick, he's pretty unapologetic.  He's  aggressive.  He's pushed into markets where operating Uber was actually  illegal.  </p><p>  And it's been a real no-holds-barred approach to operating a company.   So, to see him say, I have to be humble, I have to change the type of  leader that I am is a real big shift for them.  And I'm really curious if  he can actually do it at this point.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  And this is also a company that is not public yet,  but when it goes, if it goes, the valuations are staggering -- $70 billion  is currently where it's at.  </p><p>  Does this call into question perhaps the temperament of this  individual and whether he is the right person to run such a big global  company?</p><p>  MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, I think that's right.  </p><p>  Almost a $70 billion valuation, I think investors, as well as  employees, are wondering, we had this CEO who got us through the really  tough early phases.  Can this person lead us through an IPO, where people  really want a more even keel?  </p><p>  And I think everyone is still asking that question, but it's not  really clear at this point.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  This is in the wake of the revelations of a woman  who left the company, and she had this -- part of this to say in her blog.  </p><p>  \"It became obvious that both H.R. and management had been lying about  this being his first offense, and it certainly wasn't his last.  The  situation was escalated as far up the chain as it could be escalated, and  still nothing was done.\"</p><p>  She's not talking about Travis.  She's talking about one of her  managers who she contends was harassing to her, and now there's a large  investigation.  This is a big deal for the company.  </p><p>  MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, this is -- you know, this is core to how the culture  operates.  </p><p>  You know, it's very -- to take it from Facebook, move fast and break  things.  But, at some point, you have to sort of clean things up on the  inside and change, especially if you want to go public.  And I think  they're really facing that question right now.  It's just a question of,  can you do it and how long will it take?  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  For a little while, there was -- and there might  still be continuing -- a delete Uber campaign.  Did that have an impact on  their business?  </p><p>  MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, it did.  </p><p>  It was -- I would say it's not a material financial impact, but I have  spoken to a number of people who were watching that go down inside.  And,  you know, there were hundreds of thousands of people that deleted their  Uber accounts entirely, and probably hundreds of thousands more that just  deleted the app.  </p><p>  So, it worried Uber, and they definitely tried to curb it pretty  quickly.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  All right, Mike Isaac of The New York Times, thanks  so much.  </p><p>  MIKE ISAAC:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  And now to our Leading edge segment for this week: a  potential return to the moon.  </p><p>  Near the end of his address last night, the president made a reference  to space travel, saying -- quote -- \"American footprints on distant worlds  are not too big a dream.\"</p><p>  It was only a line.  But whenever a president speaks on the subject,  the space community is closely trying to read the tea leaves.  The sentence  leaves a lot to interpretation, but all signs seem to indicate there is  renewed focus inside the Trump administration, NASA and the private sector  on travel to the moon, sooner than you might think.  </p><p>  Our science correspondent, Miles O'Brien, is here.  </p><p>  So, Miles, why the moon after all these years?  </p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  Aside from the \"because it's there\" answer, it's  actually a good destination to go and learn about living and working on an  encampment in space.  </p><p>  You know, we went to the moon 50 years ago now.  We left some  footprints and flags behind, but we didn't really learn how to live there  on a sustained basis.  So, while NASA would still like to go to Mars,  there's a lot of things you can learn about by setting up an encampment on  the moon.  </p><p>  And we have learned in the past 50 years there's a lot of water ice on  the moon.  What is water?  Hydrogen and oxygen.  What is rocket fuel?   Hydrogen and oxygen.  So you can learn a lot about how to create rocket  fuel on location and perhaps push deeper into space.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  So this didn't just spring up as an idea because they  couldn't think of anything else?  </p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  Well, there was one other factor.  There was a mission  planned at the end of '18 for the Space Launch System, which is the next  heavy lift that NASA is working -- heavy lift rocket.  </p><p>  One piece of it wasn't going to be ready, built by the Europeans, a  service module.  And so NASA was faced with the possibility of delaying  that mission, an unmanned mission, even later, or maybe doing something  like we did with Apollo 8, something bold.</p><p>  In the case of Apollo 8, the lunar module wasn't ready.  And we  decided to go around the moon.  In this case, they're thinking about  putting astronauts on this flight maybe early '19, and send them around the  moon Apollo 8-style.  </p><p>  So, a lot of things have lined up.  And, all of a sudden, there is  wide agreement in the space community, this might be the next step.</p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  And you were telling me, Miles, there's a private  sector piece in all of this, Elon Musk announcing just the other day that  two individuals, I guess, with some extra spending money...</p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  To say the least.  </p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  ... have told him they want to go around the moon and  come back to Earth.  </p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  Yes.  </p><p>  He got a lot of attention for that.  He doesn't have a rocket to do it  yet.  It's just a design right now.  It's called the Falcon Heavy, which  would have almost the thrust of the mighty Saturn 5 of Apollo days.  </p><p>  It will fly for the first time, he hopes, by the summer.  So saying  there are going to be paying passengers on there by '18 is optimistic, for  sure.  So, we will watch that with skepticism.  </p><p>  But to the extent that the private sector and the government space  enterprise sort of push each other toward this destination, a lot of space  people are pretty excited about it.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Now, remind us, Miles, why was the moon -- it was on  the agenda at NASA for a while, but it came off.  What was that all about?</p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  Politics.  </p><p>  Of course, we lost the shuttle Columbia in '03.  President Bush at the  time canceled the shuttle program and said, let's go back to the moon, a  program called Constellation.  That got some traction.</p><p>  And then, of course, President Obama came in and said, we're not going  to the moon.  We're going to Mars.  </p><p>  And he wouldn't let anybody talk about going to the moon.  There were  a lot of people who said, you know, we should try the moon first before we  move onto Mars, but that got shelved during the Obama administration.  </p><p>  Politics now is different, obviously, with the Trump administration  there.  And I'm told the Trump administration would really like to have  U.S. astronauts taking off from a U.S. spaceport some time in its first  term.  And so this idea of turning that unmanned Space Launch System flight  into a crewed mission is gaining a lot of traction.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  And, finally, Miles, there is this question of money.   It costs money to go into space.  </p><p>  This is a president who has talked about cutting back domestic  discretionary spending.  Where's the money going to come from?  </p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  You know, it's interesting.  </p><p>  You have to look at the entire space enterprise here.  NASA's budget  is a little more than $19 billion, but if you look at the budget for the  military side of space, it's about $40 billion.  So, what if they  reconsider this idea of a space council, which they're doing, headed by the  vice president, and they start looking at ways to carve out and eliminate  some of the redundancies between the military and the civilian side?</p><p>  There may be some ways, even with NASA cuts, that they can borrow from  each other, feed each other technology, as it were, military and civilian,  which could be a bit of a force multiplier and could make it still  possible.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Interesting, because the president has talked about  spending a lot more money on defense.  </p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  Exactly.  So, that money might ultimately help NASA.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Miles O'Brien, taking us to the moon and back, thank  you.  </p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  To the moon, Alice.  </p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Thank you.  </p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  You're welcome.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  On the \"NewsHour\" online right now:  Aboriginal  Australian art is the oldest continuous art tradition in the world,  stretching back more than 40,000 years.  Now, due to a group of passionate  collectors and curators, Aboriginal Australian art shows are popping up  across the U.S. </p><p>  You can take a closer look and find more on our Web site,  PBS.org/NewsHour.  </p><p>  And we have lost another of the greats in public broadcasting.   Longtime \"Nightly Business Report\" co-anchor Paul Kangas passed away  yesterday at the age of 79 in Miami.  Paul retired from the program in  2009.  In an earlier era, The Detroit Free Press dubbed Paul the Walter  Cronkite of business broadcasting.  </p><p>  And we all remember his trademark sign-off, \"Wishing you the best of  good buys.\"  Paul was a true gentleman with a great sense of humor.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  And that's the \"NewsHour\" for tonight.  </p><p>  On Thursday, our Making Sense team looks at the unique corporate  culture behind the e-tailing giant Zappos.  </p><p>  I'm Hari Sreenivasan.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  And I'm Judy Woodruff.  </p><p>  Join us online and again right here tomorrow evening.  For all of us  at the \"PBS NewsHour,\" thank you, and we will see you soon.  </p><p> END </p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 MacNeil/Lehrer Productions.  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

LEANA WEN, Baltimore Health Commissioner:  We are just treading  water if all we're doing is saving someone's life right now.  We also know  that we have to get them the second part, which is access to long-term  treatments.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  All that and more on tonight's \"PBS NewsHour.\"  </p><p>(BREAK) </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  President Trump is looking to move ahead, in the wake  of his address to Congress.  He won praise today from Republicans, while  Democrats warned that his more moderate sound belies his real intentions.  </p><p>Wall Street's reaction to the president's business-friendly tone was  euphoric.  The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 300 points to close  above 21000 for the first time.  The Nasdaq rose 78 points, and the S&amp;P 500  added 32.  We will take a closer look at what the president said and what  comes next after the news summary.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  There's word the president's revised travel ban  will no longer include citizens from Iraq.  It had been one of seven  nations included in the initial ban that's still tied up in federal court.  </p><p>The Associated Press also reports Syrian refugees will no longer be  barred indefinitely under the revised order.  And it drops any explicit  exception for Christian and other religious minorities in Muslim nations.   The White House now says the new order will come in the next few days.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Tornadoes ripped across part of the Midwest last  night, killing three people and damaging more than 100 homes.  The National  Weather Service says it had reports of more than 20 twisters.  Some of the  worst damage came in Illinois and Missouri.  </p><p>This morning, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner surveyed extensive damage  in the town of Ottawa.  </p><p>GOV. BRUCE RAUNER (R), Illinois:  We got to count our blessings.  This  could have been way worse.  The warnings systems worked well.  People were  notified.  And it's wonderful the way the residents in the community helped  each other.  They got to elderly residents, gave them a warning that  tornadoes were coming.  People got into their basements.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Forecasters say about 95 million people are in the  path of the same storm system as it moves east.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Meanwhile, a staggering statistic out of Chicago:   The Windy City had no measurable snow during January and February for the  first time in 146 years, while, in California, there's been so much snow,  that a five-year-long drought may finally be over.  Crews already measured  the state's snowpack once, and did so again today, after one of  California's wettest winters on record.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  In Afghanistan, twin Taliban bombings, and a lengthy  shoot-out, killed at least 16 people in the capital, Kabul.  More than 100  others were wounded.  </p><p>In the first attack, a suicide car bomber targeted a police station,  touching off a gun battle that lasted hours.  Later, an attacker on foot  blew himself up outside the Afghan intelligence service.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  The United States today delivered a sharp rebuke to  the U.N. Human Rights Council over Israel.  Washington has long argued the  47-nation body unjustly focuses on Israel's treatment of Palestinians.  </p><p>In Geneva today, U.S. envoy Erin Barclay said the council has -- quote  -- \"an obsession with Israel\" that undermines the group's credibility.  </p><p>ERIN BARCLAY, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Assistant:  The United  States will oppose any effort to delegitimize or isolate Israel, not just  in the HRC, but wherever it occurs.  When it comes to human rights, no  country should be free from scrutiny, but neither should any democratic  country be regularly subjected to unfair, unbalanced and unfounded bias.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  The critique comes amid reports the Trump  administration is considering quitting the council altogether.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Back in this country, the U.S. Senate easily confirmed  Montana Congressman Ryan Zinke as secretary of the interior.  The 55-year- old Republican and former Navy SEAL has pledged to revitalize the country's  national parks.  He has also said he will resist efforts to sell or  transfer federal lands.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  And Danish toymaker LEGO has announced plans for a  new set honoring five women who were pioneers at NASA.  The collection will  feature computer scientist Margaret Hamilton, mathematician Katherine  Johnson of \"Hidden Figures\" fame, astronauts Sally Ride and Mae Jemison,  and astronomer Nancy Grace Roman.  The set will be released later this year  or early 2018.  </p><p>Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": President Trump lays out his vision  for the country -- now, what policies will take priority?; a closer look at  the decision-making before the deadly raid in Yemen; Baltimore's approach  to battling the growing opioid epidemic; and much more.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  We take a longer look now at President Trump's speech  last night.  </p><p>He promised action on a long list of priorities, including Obamacare,  the border wall, public works and regulatory reform.  And all of it, he did  in a more disciplined, upbeat way than before.  </p><p>Lisa Desjardins reports on the day after.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  The president called in Republican leaders for a  White House lunch, hoping to build on momentum from last night's address.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:  It begins as of now,  and we think we're going to have tremendous success.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  Vice President Pence took that theme on a one-man  media blitz, with 11 interviews on his public schedule.  </p><p>MIKE PENCE, Vice President of the United States:  What the American  people saw last night is the president that I serve with every day: broad  shoulders, big heart, reaching out, focusing on the future.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  Praise came from top Republicans in Congress as  well.  </p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority Leader:  The president made  clear last night he's ready to work with Congress on policies that can  actually move us forward.  He will find many partners in Congress excited  to get those things accomplished.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  High on that list, repealing and replacing  Obamacare.  Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a former Republican primary rival,  lauded Mr. Trump for his broad outline.  </p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R), Texas:  The principles he's focused on are exactly  the right principles: more choice, more competition, lower costs, lower  premiums.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  But Democrats say there was no real substance, and  they accuse the president of misleading the public with statements like  this:  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double  and triple digits.  As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year  alone.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  In fact, while it's true Arizona's premiums have  gone up by that amount, the president ignored important context, that  Arizona is an outlier, with increases four times the national average.  </p><p>On immigration, some Republicans say they're encouraged by Mr. Trump's  comments ahead of his speech that he'd consider a legal status for some  undocumented immigrants.  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South Carolina:  He's showing some  willingness to embrace a more practical immigration proposal.  I want to  give him credit for that.  Any time he moves into the land of practicality,  I want to encourage him, because that's what it's going to take to get a  bill passed.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  But in the actual speech, there was no mention of  legalizing undocumented immigrants.  Instead, the president spoke of crimes  by immigrants and his plan to crack down on the undocumented.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will  raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars,  and make our communities safer for everyone.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  That claim, too, was challenged.  </p><p>Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota spoke with the  \"NewsHour\" last night.</p><p>REP. KEITH ELLISON (D), Minnesota:  This speech seems to blame  undocumented immigrants for a crime.  It indicated that clamping down on  immigration was actually going to increase wages and make our economy  better.  The fact is, there's no facts that support that.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  Several of the presidents statements were declared  inaccurate by fact-checkers today.  Also getting attention, the generally  positive tone of the speech.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite  for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  But Democratic leaders say it's all a facade.  </p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority Leader:  You can't just talk the  talk, Mr. President.  You have to walk the walk.  And on issue after issue  after issue, we haven't seen anything, or negative things, for the working  class.  </p><p>LISA DESJARDINS:  The president and Congress both soon will see  pressure for action increase soon.  House Republicans have said they want a  draft health care bill by the end of this month.  At that point, Trump will  be just one month away from the end of his first 100 days.  </p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Lisa Desjardins.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Last night's presidential address relayed an ambitious  agenda.  But how much of it will take shape, and does President Trump have  enough support on Capitol Hill to find success?  </p><p>Joining me to discuss all of that are Dan Balz of The Washington Post  and NPR congressional reporter Susan Davis.  </p><p>And we welcome both of you back to the program.  </p><p>Dan, I'm going to start with you.  </p><p>We just heard Lisa Desjardins talk about this was a different tone  coming from the president.  You wrote about that today in The Washington  Post.  It was a change from what we have been hearing.  </p><p>DAN BALZ, Chief Political Reporter, The Washington Post:  It was a  dramatic change from what we have been hearing.</p><p>And I looked back to the inaugural address, which was described by so  many people as dark or dystopian, the phrase American carnage being one  that leaped out at people and has stayed with people, a very downbeat view  of things in the state of the nation, the state of the world.  </p><p>The substance of last night wasn't significantly or materially  different from what he's talked about all through the campaign and in his  inaugural address, but the tone was so much different.  He talked about  unity repeatedly.  He talked about cooperating with Democrats.  He talked  about a spirit of American renewal.  </p><p>And it was -- it was a speech that was certainly aimed at reassuring  his congressional Republican allies that he will be presidential, if you  will, going forward, that he will be serious about trying to get these  things done, and that he will not be seeking to create diversion and  digression and controversies.  </p><p>Whether he's able to stay with that, we don't know.  I mean, this was  only one speech, and we know the history of Donald Trump is that there are  moments when he -- you know, he goes in directions that even his staff  doesn't want.  But for that hour in the House chamber last night, he was  the Donald Trump that a lot of elected officials have wanted to see for a  long time.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And, Sue Davis, it was a confident-sounding speech, as  if he expects these things to happen.  How much of what he's done and what  he said he's going to do so far is actually taking effect?  </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS, NPR:  Well, let's start with the two top priorities for  Congress that we know, health care and taxes.  </p><p>And his remarks in the speech last night, it's like they could have  been written by House Speaker Paul Ryan.  And the speaker's office has been  saying, there's no daylight between us.  There's no daylight between us.  </p><p>But the president is fairly erratic.  He has tweeted different things  on positions at different times that have contradicted the speaker.  And  they saw the speech as incredibly reassuring, as Dan said, not only that  they're on the same page, but that the president is capable of using the  moment to show leadership to sort of build the case for these conservative  ideas.  </p><p>Republicans say health care is on track.  They expect to see a bill  within weeks, not months.  And they saw the president's speech last night  as an almost tacit endorsement of this plan that's emerging from the House.  </p><p>The fight that's going to be really interesting is that there is a  group of conservatives in the Senate, namely Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted  Cruz of Texas, and Mike Lee of Utah, who are -- could be an immovable force  on this, who say it is not conservative enough.  </p><p>And we're going to see this really interesting test of conservatism  and the conservatives that bedeviled past leaders in Congress and Donald  Trump, and who is going to win out this fight.  And I talked to Rand Paul  today, and he said, what has emerged from the House, he will not vote for.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And, Dan Balz, to what extent is the White House  prepared for that kind of pushback from people in their own party?</p><p>DAN BALZ:  Well, I think they are prepared.  </p><p>I think they know it's there.  They have been getting pushback for  some time.  There is not only opposition from conservatives on Capitol  Hill.  There is division among the Republican governors -- put aside the  Democratic governors -- over what to do with Medicaid.  </p><p>If you were a state that expanded Medicaid, you have got one view of  that.  And if you didn't, you have got another view of that.  There are  divisions.  </p><p>I think the administration today feels that, as a result of the  speech, people who have been reticent to support him or openly hostile to  what is taking shape in the House might be a little more amenable to  working with the administration.  </p><p>Secretary Price from HHS and the vice president, Mike Pence, are going  to be the point people from the administration.  I think one question is to  what extent the administration will, in fact, put down a proposal and move  toward Congress or wait for Congress to really do it and then come in at  the end.</p><p>I think Congress would like the president to lead as effectively as he  can, in part, I think, to try to create the consensus that doesn't exist  today.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And then, Sue Davis, there's immigration, where -- I  happened to be at a lunch with the president yesterday where he was talking  about he liked want idea of an immigration bill, if he could get the two  sides to compromise.  He didn't talk very much about comprehensive  immigration reform last night.  </p><p>He talked about the wall.  And we know there's that travel ban,  renewed version of that.  But what is the mood?  What are the attitudes on  the Hill about immigration?  </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:  Well, here's what we know is going to happen.  </p><p>In a couple of weeks, he's going to send a request to Congress asking  for undetermined amounts of millions of dollars to start building that  wall.  But immigration -- comprehensive immigration reform hasn't really  been part of the conversation on the Hill.  </p><p>It wasn't part of the agenda outlined by Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell and Speaker Ryan at the beginning of the Congress.  I talked to  the speaker's office today that said it's still not necessarily at the top  of the agenda.  But if the president decides that he wants this to be a  priority, he has tremendous power to make it a priority and upend what the  congressional schedule is.  </p><p>I think, on that issue, where I think Congress is trying to take the  lead on things like health care and taxes, on immigration, I think they'd  like to see the White House be a little bit more assertive and outline  specifically what the president would like to do, specifically because that  issue was such a core, center point of his campaign.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Just finally to the two of you -- and I hate to ask  you to do this quickly -- but, Dan Balz, the president really mentioned tax  reform only briefly last night, taxes at all.  </p><p>What does it look -- what does the atmosphere look like?  What are the  realities in terms of getting tax reform done this year?  </p><p>DAN BALZ:  Well, it will be very challenging.  </p><p>Just simply getting the health care bill through will be potentially a  year-long effort, as we saw in the Obama administration.  On taxes, they  don't have a plan at this point.  And health care will have to go first.   Taxes will have to follow.  There are questions about what he really wants  to do.  </p><p>He provided no details of that last night.  He provided some  principles on health care at least.  On tax reform and tax legislation, he  offered nothing of substance beyond kind of a generalized notion of what he  wants.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Did you pick up anything on that, Sue?  </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:  I see the fates of health care and taxes linked.  </p><p>If the repeal and replace effort falls apart, I think tax reform falls  apart.  If repeal and replace, if they're able to get something to the  president's desk, I think that that increase the chances that they can  actually move on taxes this year.  </p><p>I don't think they can be seen as separate tracks.  I think they have  to move together.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Well, it is an ambitious agenda.  </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:  Extremely.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  We're talking health care.  We're talking -- and we  didn't even mention infrastructure, which is something the president has  said he wants to get done too.</p><p>But we're going to leave it there for now.  We thank both of you for  talking to us, Dan Balz of The Washington Post, Susan Davis of NPR.  We  thank you.  </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:  Thank you.  </p><p>DAN BALZ:  Thank you.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  More than a month after a controversial special  operations raid was launched on a moonless night in Yemen, questions  persist about how that mission was authorized, what it accomplished, and  how it's been explained by the White House and by the president.  </p><p>Margaret Warner begins our coverage.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:  Ryan's legacy is etched  into eternity.  </p><p>MARGARET WARNER:  Democrats and Republicans alike rose to their feet  last night the widow of Navy SEAL Ryan Owens, who was killed during a  January raid in Yemen.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero, battling  against terrorism and securing our nation.  </p><p>MARGARET WARNER:  The Trump White House says the raid was planned by  the Pentagon during the Obama administration, and President Trump gave the  go-ahead during his first week in office.  </p><p>The Pentagon intended as an intelligence-gathering mission against al- Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the militant group's most feared  branches.  But a gun battle erupted, and Owens was killed, reportedly along  with as many as 30 civilians, including children.  </p><p>Last night, the president said Defense Secretary Mattis told him the  mission would lead to victories in the future.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that  generated large amounts of vital intelligence.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER:  But others question that claim, and last month,  Republican Senator John McCain suggested the raid was a failure.  </p><p>Mr. Trump respond by charging such criticism only emboldened the  enemy, and White House spokesman Sean Spicer joined in.  </p><p>SEAN SPICER, White House Press Secretary:  I think anybody who  undermines the success of that raid owes an apology and does a disservice  to the life of Chief Owens.  </p><p>MARGARET WARNER:  The SEAL's father, William Owens, refused to meet  with the president when his son's remains were flown home.  </p><p>Instead, he told The Miami Herald that Mr. Trump shouldn't -- quote --  \"hide behind his son's death to prevent an investigation.\"</p><p>The president again deflected criticism in an interview aired  yesterday on FOX News, saying he followed the military's advice.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  This was a mission that was started before I got here.   They explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very  respected. And they lost Ryan.  </p><p>MARGARET WARNER:  Today, South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham  offered this advice:  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South Carolina:  Don't oversell results.  The  only sin I think a commander in chief can make is exaggerating successes  and not understanding the challenges.  </p><p>MARGARET WARNER:  For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Margaret Warner.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And joining me now from the White House, Sebastian  Gorka.  He is deputy assistant to the president.  He advises the  administration on national security issues.  </p><p>Mr. Gorka, thank you for being with us.  </p><p>Picking up on what we heard from senator Graham, did the president  fully understand the challenges involved when he signed off on this? </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA, Deputy Assistant to President Trump:  Of course he  did.  He's the commander in chief.  He takes his job very, very seriously.  </p><p>If you look at the way he's treated law enforcement, if you look at  the way he's treated the military, this is a man who fully understands the  burden of leadership and the responsibility he has as the commander in  chief.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Well, he suggested in that interview with FOX News  yesterday that he did it mainly because the generals suggested that he do  it, that they recommended it.  Is that the case?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA:  We don't give our internal playbook away.  That's  what the last administration did.  That's how people get in big, big  trouble.  </p><p>These are classified operations by our tier one operators.  So, he  acted and made a decision based upon the best advice of our military.   That's the way it has to work, Judy.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Well, my question is, Mr. Gorka, because we just --  again, looking at that FOX interview, referring to the generals, the  president said, \"They lost Ryan.\"</p><p>Does that mean he doesn't accept responsibility? </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA:  Of course it doesn't.  And I find it quite churlish  when the media focuses on half a sentence here, half a sentence there.  </p><p>Why would you even posit that of the president?  It's really  unbecoming.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  So, the president accepts, in effect, the buck stops  with him? </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA:  Of course he does.  He's the president.  This is a  team effort, nevertheless.  </p><p>Nobody goes into battle alone, but he is the commander in chief.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  We also heard the president say that the raid was  highly successful, that it generated a large amount of intelligence that  will be valuable, useful for the administration.  </p><p>But we also know that there are a number of news organization  reporting that senior officials saying that is not the case, that there is  not valuable intelligence from that raid.  What are we to believe?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA:  Is that the same kind of sources that reported all  kinds of fallacious things inside the White House?  </p><p>The sad truth is, Judy, since I started working here six weeks ago, I  find that more than 50 percent of the more sensational things I read are  wholly fallacious and unfounded.  </p><p>I can tell you because I'm inside the building when those decisions  are being taken.  So, it's easy to make up unnamed sources, but the fact is  life is a little different from what you would read in the mainstream media  inside the White House.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  What do you say to the American people who are asking,  why is the U.S. in Yemen in the first place?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA:  Oh, very easy, very, very easy.  </p><p>As the president pointed out yesterday, we are facing a global threat.   It is radical Islamic terrorism.  Another great synonym is the global  jihadi movement.  And the idea that Yemen or another country that doesn't  have adequate governance is not potentially connected to the threat to the  United States is, again, a very, very dangerous concept.  </p><p>These aren't just events occurring 8,000 or 10,000 miles away.   Remember, Omar Mateen, as he slayed 49 Americans in the Pulse nightclub,  stopped to dial 911, not to call an ambulance, Judy, but to swear  allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in the Middle East.  </p><p>That's just how interconnected the threat is today and how real the  war is from the streets of Aleppo right to Orlando.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Well, I want to pick up on the phrase you just used,  radical Islamic terrorism.  We heard the president say that last night.</p><p>But it has also been reported, as you know, several news  organizations, that the president's new security adviser, General H.R.  McMaster, has advised the president not to use that term, in effect because  it suggests that all who believe in Islam as a faith, that there's some  strain there that's connected to terrorism.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA:  How does it -- A, the reports are, again, false.   It's fake news.  Not true.  </p><p>You need to talk to General McMaster, who I talked to yesterday before  the speech.  It's not what he said.  And, again, how does the phrase  radical Islamic terrorism link all the believers of a faith to terrorism?  </p><p>If I said radical Christian terrorism, does that mean I as a Catholic  are a terrorist?  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  So, I'm just trying to understand.  So you're saying  the president is not suggesting that there is something inherent in all of  Islam that is at odds with Western values?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA:  That would be asinine.  Of course he didn't.  </p><p>We are dealing with a version of Islam, with criminals, mass  murderers, people who run slave markets, that use a religion, use a seventh  century, atavistic, blood-curdled version of it to justify their actions.  </p><p>But I can tell you, the idea that you can separate jihadi terrorism  from Islam is exactly what got us in the mess we are today, with 65 million  refugees around the world and with ISIS controlling territory in multiple  countries.  </p><p>If you talk to Muslims, as I do -- I have trained hundreds of Muslim  officers from our partner nations when I was in the Defense Department --  they will tell you, Judy, this is a war inside Islam for the heart of  Islam.  We are not at war with Islam.  That is a very dangerous and very  fallacious idea.  </p><p>But we know that our Muslim allies are fighting a war for the heart of  Islam.  Ask the Jordanians.  Ask the Egyptians.  They understand the  relevance of jihadist ideology in this war.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Sebastian Gorka, who is a deputy assistant to  President Trump, we thank you very much.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA:  My pleasure.  Any time, Judy.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Now views on the raid in Yemen and the decision- making behind it.  </p><p>We talk to two men with intimate knowledge of the process that  authorized the use of military force during the Obama administration.  </p><p>Colin Kahl was deputy assistant to the president and national security  adviser to the vice president during the Obama administration.  He is now  an associate professor at Georgetown University.  Andrew Exum was deputy  assistant secretary of defense for Middle East policy during the Obama  administration.  He also served in the Army form 2000 to 2004 in  Afghanistan and Iraq.  </p><p>Colin, let me start with you.  </p><p>We have heard the president say, this was a mission that was started  before I got here.  </p><p>You were in the rooms where these mission have been discussed for the  Obama administration before he left.  What did the previous administration  leave for President Trump to pick up?  </p><p>COLIN KAHL, Former Deputy Assistant to President Obama:  Yes.  </p><p>Well, for years, the United States has been taking military action  against this group, AQAP, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, al Qaeda's  affiliate in Yemen, predominantly through drone strikes, airstrikes.  </p><p>What came to the White House shortly before Christmas was a proposal  from the Pentagon to expand the authorities and resources to allow special  operations forces to more actively engage in direct raids to go after  compounds, like the one that we saw in January.  </p><p>But a couple of things, I think, are important to note.  First, they  never briefed a particular raid.  They didn't say, we're going to go after  a particular target or a compound on this night or this day.  Instead, they  asked for a broad set of authorities to do this type of thing.  </p><p>And, importantly, when the deputies convened, kind of a sub-cabinet  level of government convened in early January, they recommended that this  decision get deferred to the Trump administration, so they could run their  own careful process.  And President Obama agreed on that, that he would  make no decision whether to do things like this, and instead that Trump  should run his own process.  </p><p>But, instead, Trump had a dinner party and decided it over dinner.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  So, you're saying the category of raids was what  was discussed, not this specific raid, because we saw reports that perhaps  they were waiting for a moonless night, that was the opportune time, it  couldn't have happened in the Obama administration's last few days.  </p><p>COLIN KAHL:  I will defer to Andrew, who worked in the Pentagon, on  this one.</p><p>But my understanding is that there were a number of concepts of  operations that were bouncing around the Pentagon for a long time, and this  raid may have been one of them.  It was never brought across the river to  the White House.  </p><p>And as it relates to the moonless night issue, a Pentagon spokesperson  said that that issue didn't become relevant until after January 20, when  they then asked for the authority to do the raid to Trump.  </p><p>And, importantly, that's why I think it's extraordinarily unfair to  our men and women in the armed services for Trump to suggest, as he did on  FOX yesterday, that somehow this is the military's fault.  He's the  commander in chief.  The buck stops with him.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Andrew Exum, fill in that blank there.  From the  Pentagon's perspective, what was left for the Trump administration?</p><p>ANDREW EXUM, Former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense:  Well,  no, I think that that's an accurate recounting of the way that things were  presented to the Trump administration and to the Obama administration  before the -- before the Trump inauguration.  </p><p>I think that we in the Obama administration, those are of us who  served in the Obama administration need to be very careful as we criticize  the process that the Trump administration used to approve this.  </p><p>First off, to approve this raid, it would have gone through several  hurdles just through the Department of Defense before being presented to  the president.  When we in the Obama administration brought these options  to the president, it followed a very deliberate interagency process.  </p><p>It's what worked for President Obama.  Just because we have seen,  quite frankly, a lot of a -- lot of mess in the Trump administration thus  far in their first month, I think we have got to be careful about saying  that we had all the answers during the Obama administration.  </p><p>I think Colin would agree with that.  This president's going find a  decision-making process that works for him.  What happened in Yemen may  cause him to rethink the way in which he approved this raid, because you  can always delegate authority.  You can never delegate the risk.   Ultimately, you're going to own that, as Dr. Gorka mentioned from the White  House.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Andrew, I want to -- you recently wrote that  blaming the president is both inappropriate and counterproductive.  You  also described sometimes that the process can be paralysis by analysis.  </p><p>ANDREW EXUM:  Yes.    </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  That it can take a very long time.  </p><p>ANDREW EXUM:  No, that's right.  </p><p>Colin remembers that, at one point in the waning days of the Obama  administration, I think we were debating at the Cabinet level the movement  of three helicopters from Iraq to Syria.  </p><p>Now, there are obvious, you know, political implications of anything  you do on the ground.  But at what point do you delegate authority down to  your commander on the ground, I think, is the key question.</p><p>The reason why I think putting the -- putting real blame on the Trump  administration here is dangerous is because you have the Benghazi effect.   You remember, when the Republicans used Benghazi and what happened there as  a cudgel to beat Hillary Clinton, and without -- you know their effort was  successful, it must be added, to weaken her as a political candidate.  </p><p>But it also had a chilling effect on the bureaucracy.  It makes the  bureaucracy risk-averse.  And, quite frankly, that's not something that we  want from our diplomats.  It's not something we want from our special  operators.  </p><p>We want them to be aggressive.  We want them to take risks.  And when  we elevate the blame, when something goes wrong, all the way to the  presidential level, we just have got to be very careful about how we do  that.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  And, Colin, why does it take so long?  What kinds  of input factor into a decision like this?  </p><p>COLIN KAHL:  Yes, look, I think that the Obama administration can be  criticized for too much micromanagement of the Pentagon.  </p><p>I think, you know, the question is, did they swing the pendulum too  far in one direction?  But I worry that President Trump, in the first big  decision that came to his, in this case, dinner table as commander in  chief, he swung the pendulum all the way back in the other direction.  </p><p>Look, what President Obama insisted on is, every time that the  military wanted to come forward to ask for authority to significantly  escalate, especially to put ground forces into a conflict environment,  where people can die, both our service members, but also civilians and  others, that we needed to have a careful, deliberate process.  </p><p>It doesn't have to take weeks.  It oftentimes takes a couple of days.   But it works its way through, and you get the inputs from all the various  agencies.  </p><p>The question I have with Trump's decision-making process here is not  that you have to do it exactly the way we did it, but he didn't run a  process at all.  He just had dinner with Secretary Mattis and General  Dunford and a handful of close advisers and was briefed about the raid and  made a decision.  </p><p>And, as a consequence, he didn't have the full benefit of his  intelligence professionals, of his State Department.  And that is a recipe  for making mistakes and costing people their lives.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Andrew Exum, what about the idea that, when there  are these different agencies, these different people weighing in on it,  that they're going to think about diplomatic consequences, political  consequences, things that perhaps a commander in the field might not think  about because, for him or her, they see a much different objective?</p><p>ANDREW EXUM:  Yes, it's a valid point.</p><p>I think the way Colin described things, I think he's right that the  pendulum swung back.  I wouldn't say it went all the way back, because,  again, the decision-making process in this raid would have gone through a  very rigorous process in the Pentagon.  It would have been blessed off by  all the Pentagon senior leaders before it would have been presented to the  president.</p><p>So it wasn't completely without rigor.  But I think what Colin is  describing in terms of baking down the risk, that does happen in a  deliberate process like that.  The key question is opportunity cost.  </p><p>So, in the Obama administration, we had a very deliberate process that  in many cases served the president and was what the president desired.  It  drew down a lot of political risks, as well as the physical risk, to the  operators on the ground.  </p><p>The question is, was there an opportunity cost?  The nature of these  raids is, they go after time-sensitive targets.  So do you lose  opportunities the more that you hold things up in Washington?  I think  that's the key question.  </p><p>And where Colin and I may disagree, but where I think we do agree, is  that there has to be a balance.  It's just a matter of where you strike  that balance.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  All right, Andrew Exum, Colin Kahl, thank you both.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Stay with us.  </p><p>Coming up on the \"NewsHour\": the successes and struggles of two of the  world's fastest growing businesses; and a plan to once again send humans to  the moon.  </p><p>But first: the nation's opioid crisis.  </p><p>Overdose deaths are on the rise across the country, in 2015,  surpassing gun homicides for the first time.  One of the hardest-hit states  is Maryland, where the governor today declared a state of emergency to  fight the epidemic.  </p><p>But, for more than a year, the city of Baltimore has been training  everyday citizens in how to use a lifesaving antidote, an approach that's  catching on across the country.  </p><p>\"NewsHour\" producer Pamela Kirkland visited Baltimore to find out  more.  </p><p>MAN:  Excuse me, sir, are you interested in Narcan training?  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Each week, city health workers hit the streets of  Baltimore, handing out an emergency medication that brings users back from  the dead.  </p><p>MAN:  This is the medicine.  It reverses overdoses.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Naloxone, brand name Narcan, comes as a nasal spray  or injection, and works by blocking the brain's opioid receptors.  </p><p>In a city with 24,000 active heroin users, overdoses, and now  increasingly this emergency antidote have become facts of life.  </p><p>MAN:  I lost a friend of mine that was -- at 25 years old.  </p><p>MAN:  I have just seen so many young people getting hooked on the  opioids, or better yet, the fentanyl.  And it's definitely a killer, </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  In Maryland, deaths from opioids, which include  heroin, fentanyl and prescription painkillers, doubled between 2010 and  2015, to just under 1,100 people a year.  Meanwhile, heroin fatalities  alone more than tripled.  </p><p>And in just the past three years, deaths in Baltimore from fentanyl, a  synthetic opioid far stronger than heroin, are up 20-fold.  </p><p>DR. LEANA WEN, Baltimore Health Commissioner:  We have an epidemic of  people, fellow residents in our city, who are dying from opioid overdose.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  In late 2015, Dr. Leana Wen, Baltimore's health  commissioner, and a practicing emergency room physician, issued a standing  order for naloxone to all 620,000 city residents.  </p><p>DR. LEANA WEN:  What that means is that, if somebody goes through a  very basic training -- and we do trainings everywhere, including on street  corners, in jails, in public housing, really anywhere that people are --  they will immediately get a prescription for naloxone, and even get the  medication in hand.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Just one dose of naloxone can bring someone back.   Residents can buy it at a pharmacy, only $1 for Medicaid recipients.  And  thanks to a 2015 good samaritan law, there's no risk of prosecution if  citizens intervene and the victim dies.  </p><p>MAN:  I have used it four times.  I keep them in my bag.  I always  keep them in my bag, at least four or five of them in my bag.</p><p>JOHN HARRIS, Baltimore Health Department:  This is our mobile unit.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  John Harris works on one of the Health Department's  vans which traverse the city offering sexually transmitted infection  screenings, clean needle kits and naloxone training.  </p><p>JOHN HARRIS:  Well, we tell people that, once you reverse an overdose,  then not to use that.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  He knows what addiction can do to a person, having  spent 16 years addicted to heroin.  But he sees something different today.  </p><p>JOHN HARRIS:  There was a lot of fentanyl at first that we were  hearing about.  But now the clients are starting to come with medications  that they use on an elephant, tranquilizers being cut with heroin.  There  are benzodiazepines.  We're hearing about all different types of drugs.   It's really becoming more complicated and dangerous.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Since January 2015, the Baltimore Health Department  says over 20,000 residents have completed naloxone training and at least  800 lives have been saved.</p><p>And many more states and municipalities across the country have moved  to make naloxone more accessible to the public.  But not everyone believes  this is the right approach.  </p><p>MIKE GIMBEL, Maryland Addiction Recovery Center:  We are selling it to  the public as if it's the answer.  I mean, it's an amazing drug, no doubt  about it, but it doesn't change the behavior of the addict.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  For 25 years, Mike Gimbel was Baltimore County's  director of substance abuse.  Now he's a consultant for Maryland Addiction  Recovery Center, a private treatment facility outside the city.  And like  John Harris, Gimbel is in recovery.  </p><p>MIKE GIMBEL:  Heroin is the devil.  It's the devil.  It makes you do  things you would never do you in your life.  It took a middle-class, good  Jewish kid like me, and had me robing my own parents, carrying a gun. </p><p>That's what heroin does.  That's how powerful heroin is.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  He argues that the city and state are spending too  much time and money on Narcan training and outreach, and not enough on  long-term recovery.  </p><p>And as a sign this approach isn't working, he points to the city's  rising overdose fatalities, up 68 percent for the first three-quarters of  2016 over the same period the year before.  </p><p>MIKE GIMBEL:  Sometimes, by having Narcan so available, it actually  reinforces the addict's behavior.  Why should I stop using heroin, when, if  I overdose, Narcan's going to save my life?  Where's the motivation to  stop?  It's not there.  It's not there.  </p><p>So, sometimes, yes -- and we don't want to see people die, but,  sometimes, watching someone die and watching what happens with overdose and  death wakes up a lot of addicts.  </p><p>TIMMY HALL, Former Baltimore Police Officer:  It's just a first- responder tool.  That's all it is.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Timmy Hall was with the Baltimore Police Department  for 24 years, where he routinely saw opioid overdoses.  He says officers  often use Narcan to revive the same drug users over and over again.  </p><p>TIMMY HALL:  A lot of times, they get upset with you when you bring  them back, because they feel like you wasted the money they spent.  You  know, that's the feeling that they wanted.  That wanted that feeling, and  you took it away from them.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  But Hall doesn't see an alternative.  </p><p>TIMMY HALL:  As a police officer, your first job is to protect and  serve, you know?  And what officer would want to sit there and watch  somebody die, if they got the tools to save somebody?  So, Narcan, to me,  is a great tool.  It's just a first-responder tool.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  The Health Department attributes the continued rise  in overdoses and fatalities to a rise in far more powerful drugs hitting  the streets.  </p><p>Dr. Wen says there's no evidence that denying naloxone to overdose  victims helps users end their addictions.  Naloxone is just one tool in  this fight.  </p><p>DR. LEANA WEN:  We are just treading water if all we're doing is  saving someone's life right now.  We also know that we have to get them the  second part, which is access to long-term treatments, that it's a  combination of medications and some treatments, psychosocial treatments,  like counseling.  And then other services are important too, including  housing.  </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Of course, those all cost money and political will.  </p><p>GOV. LARRY HOGAN (R), Maryland:  Heroin and opioid abuse has been  taking lives and tearing apart families.</p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Just today, Maryland's Republican governor, Larry  Hogan, announced a state of emergency to deal with the crisis, pledging 50  million additional dollars over five years for enforcement, treatment and  prevention.</p><p>JOHN HARRIS:  It's got to get better.  It's got to get better.  And I  believe it will get better.  I don't think perfection exists in anything,  but I do believe Baltimore has done a lot of good work, will do some more  good work, because we are saving lives.    </p><p>PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Saving some lives amid a growing epidemic.  </p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Pamela Kirkland in Baltimore.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Now: two high-flying companies whose value has  soared and are the subject of intense scrutiny, Uber, and the parent  company of Snapchat.  </p><p>For Uber, it's about the culture and leadership of the ride-hailing  service, valued at nearly $70 billion.  It's back in the spotlight  following release of a video of its CEO berating an Uber driver.  More on  that in a moment.  </p><p>But, first, Snapchat is about to sell its stock to the public for the  first time.  The parent company announced it will offer its share at $17 a  share, bringing its value to nearly $24 billion.  The messaging app is used  by nearly 160 million people each day, and is especially popular among  teens and young adults.  </p><p>But there are big questions about whether it's worth this kind of  value.  </p><p>Mike Isaac is covering both these stories for The New York Times.  He  joins me now.  </p><p>Let's start with Snapchat.  What is the value that Snapchat is trying  to sell investors?  </p><p>MIKE ISAAC, The New York Times:  Yes.  </p><p>So, Snapchat's big story is, it's going to be its next Facebook and  not the next Twitter, essentially.  One of Twitter's big struggles, if you  remember, when it went public a few years ago, is, it sort of failed to  grow fast enough for investors on Wall Street.</p><p>And so, as far as Facebook is concerned, their growth was huge, but  Snapchat just wants to say, like, look, this is the next big social  network.  You want to get in as quickly as possible on the ground floor of  this IPO, and we're going to have the success and strength and reach of  Facebook, particularly with younger users.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  How does it plan to make money?  At one point, it  calls itself now a camera company.  So, is it a social network?  Is it a  camera company?  Do they make money selling advertisements?  </p><p>MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, so it's primarily advertisements.  They have little  what they call Snapchat stories.</p><p>And publications like The New York Times will show different things  inside of their -- usually video and photo-based.  And then they sell ads  against that.  </p><p>And then they're kind of experimenting with other things, whether it's  like e-commerce-related things inside the app.  And then who knows?  They  have what are called Snapchat Spectacles, which are glasses on your face,  and maybe they can make money from that.  I'm not really sure.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  And so part of the reason that it looks like Wall  Street is excited is because there hasn't been a big tech IPO in a while.  </p><p>MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p>I think a lot of investors feel like they missed out on Facebook a few  years ago, especially when the IPO went really terribly for the company,  and now Facebook is trading at over $100 a share.  So I think everyone is  really looking forward to a successful IPO from a tech company.  And it has  been a bit.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  And these two founders have also decided to take a  lot of the -- I guess the voting control of the company.  This seems to be  the new thing.  Mark Zuckerberg has a tremendous amount of control over his  company.  Is this the kind of template that now tech CEOs want?  </p><p>MIKE ISAAC:  I think so.  </p><p>And I think investors kind of have a sense of trust that the founders  tend to know best and what's best for their company.  Mark Zuckerberg  really sort of became the pioneer or advocate for this approach, where, you  know, he doesn't really want to hear much of what investors have to say  about how he should run his company.  </p><p>And investors are comfortable with that because he tends to be running  it really well, and it keeps growing, and it keeps making them tons of  money.  So that might work.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Sorry.</p><p>Let's shift gears then to Uber.  It's been in the news recently after  a former employee wrote on her personal blog that she had been sexually  harassed at the company and that it was covered up.  </p><p>Yesterday, Bloomberg released a video of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick in a  heated exchange with an Uber driver over lowering fares for its black cars  service.  The argument took place in February.  </p><p>MAN:  You changed the whole business.  </p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK, CEO, Uber:  What?  What?  </p><p>MAN:  You dropped the prices.  </p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK:  On black.  </p><p>MAN:  Yes, you did.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MAN:  We started with $20.  We started with $20.  How much is the mile  now, $2.75?  </p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK:  You know what?  </p><p>MAN:  What?  </p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK:  Some people don't like to take responsibility for  their... </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK:  They blame everything in their life on somebody  else.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRAVIS KALANICK:  Good luck.  </p><p>MAN:  Good luck to you, too.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  Kalanick later apologized.  </p><p>He said in a statement: \"It's clear this video is a reflection of me,  and the criticism we have received is a stark reminder that I must  fundamentally change as a leader and grow up.\"</p><p>That's part of the statement.  </p><p>So, Mike, why is this apology to the driver and the company so  important?  </p><p>MIKE ISAAC:  If you followed the company for the past seven years, one  thing you can say about Travis Kalanick, he's pretty unapologetic.  He's  aggressive.  He's pushed into markets where operating Uber was actually  illegal.  </p><p>And it's been a real no-holds-barred approach to operating a company.   So, to see him say, I have to be humble, I have to change the type of  leader that I am is a real big shift for them.  And I'm really curious if  he can actually do it at this point.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  And this is also a company that is not public yet,  but when it goes, if it goes, the valuations are staggering -- $70 billion  is currently where it's at.  </p><p>Does this call into question perhaps the temperament of this  individual and whether he is the right person to run such a big global  company?</p><p>MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, I think that's right.  </p><p>Almost a $70 billion valuation, I think investors, as well as  employees, are wondering, we had this CEO who got us through the really  tough early phases.  Can this person lead us through an IPO, where people  really want a more even keel?  </p><p>And I think everyone is still asking that question, but it's not  really clear at this point.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  This is in the wake of the revelations of a woman  who left the company, and she had this -- part of this to say in her blog.  </p><p>\"It became obvious that both H.R. and management had been lying about  this being his first offense, and it certainly wasn't his last.  The  situation was escalated as far up the chain as it could be escalated, and  still nothing was done.\"</p><p>She's not talking about Travis.  She's talking about one of her  managers who she contends was harassing to her, and now there's a large  investigation.  This is a big deal for the company.  </p><p>MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, this is -- you know, this is core to how the culture  operates.  </p><p>You know, it's very -- to take it from Facebook, move fast and break  things.  But, at some point, you have to sort of clean things up on the  inside and change, especially if you want to go public.  And I think  they're really facing that question right now.  It's just a question of,  can you do it and how long will it take?  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  For a little while, there was -- and there might  still be continuing -- a delete Uber campaign.  Did that have an impact on  their business?  </p><p>MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, it did.  </p><p>It was -- I would say it's not a material financial impact, but I have  spoken to a number of people who were watching that go down inside.  And,  you know, there were hundreds of thousands of people that deleted their  Uber accounts entirely, and probably hundreds of thousands more that just  deleted the app.  </p><p>So, it worried Uber, and they definitely tried to curb it pretty  quickly.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  All right, Mike Isaac of The New York Times, thanks  so much.  </p><p>MIKE ISAAC:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And now to our Leading edge segment for this week: a  potential return to the moon.  </p><p>Near the end of his address last night, the president made a reference  to space travel, saying -- quote -- \"American footprints on distant worlds  are not too big a dream.\"</p><p>It was only a line.  But whenever a president speaks on the subject,  the space community is closely trying to read the tea leaves.  The sentence  leaves a lot to interpretation, but all signs seem to indicate there is  renewed focus inside the Trump administration, NASA and the private sector  on travel to the moon, sooner than you might think.  </p><p>Our science correspondent, Miles O'Brien, is here.  </p><p>So, Miles, why the moon after all these years?  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  Aside from the \"because it's there\" answer, it's  actually a good destination to go and learn about living and working on an  encampment in space.  </p><p>You know, we went to the moon 50 years ago now.  We left some  footprints and flags behind, but we didn't really learn how to live there  on a sustained basis.  So, while NASA would still like to go to Mars,  there's a lot of things you can learn about by setting up an encampment on  the moon.  </p><p>And we have learned in the past 50 years there's a lot of water ice on  the moon.  What is water?  Hydrogen and oxygen.  What is rocket fuel?   Hydrogen and oxygen.  So you can learn a lot about how to create rocket  fuel on location and perhaps push deeper into space.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  So this didn't just spring up as an idea because they  couldn't think of anything else?  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  Well, there was one other factor.  There was a mission  planned at the end of '18 for the Space Launch System, which is the next  heavy lift that NASA is working -- heavy lift rocket.  </p><p>One piece of it wasn't going to be ready, built by the Europeans, a  service module.  And so NASA was faced with the possibility of delaying  that mission, an unmanned mission, even later, or maybe doing something  like we did with Apollo 8, something bold.</p><p>In the case of Apollo 8, the lunar module wasn't ready.  And we  decided to go around the moon.  In this case, they're thinking about  putting astronauts on this flight maybe early '19, and send them around the  moon Apollo 8-style.  </p><p>So, a lot of things have lined up.  And, all of a sudden, there is  wide agreement in the space community, this might be the next step.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And you were telling me, Miles, there's a private  sector piece in all of this, Elon Musk announcing just the other day that  two individuals, I guess, with some extra spending money...</p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  To say the least.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  ... have told him they want to go around the moon and  come back to Earth.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  Yes.  </p><p>He got a lot of attention for that.  He doesn't have a rocket to do it  yet.  It's just a design right now.  It's called the Falcon Heavy, which  would have almost the thrust of the mighty Saturn 5 of Apollo days.  </p><p>It will fly for the first time, he hopes, by the summer.  So saying  there are going to be paying passengers on there by '18 is optimistic, for  sure.  So, we will watch that with skepticism.  </p><p>But to the extent that the private sector and the government space  enterprise sort of push each other toward this destination, a lot of space  people are pretty excited about it.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Now, remind us, Miles, why was the moon -- it was on  the agenda at NASA for a while, but it came off.  What was that all about?</p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  Politics.  </p><p>Of course, we lost the shuttle Columbia in '03.  President Bush at the  time canceled the shuttle program and said, let's go back to the moon, a  program called Constellation.  That got some traction.</p><p>And then, of course, President Obama came in and said, we're not going  to the moon.  We're going to Mars.  </p><p>And he wouldn't let anybody talk about going to the moon.  There were  a lot of people who said, you know, we should try the moon first before we  move onto Mars, but that got shelved during the Obama administration.  </p><p>Politics now is different, obviously, with the Trump administration  there.  And I'm told the Trump administration would really like to have  U.S. astronauts taking off from a U.S. spaceport some time in its first  term.  And so this idea of turning that unmanned Space Launch System flight  into a crewed mission is gaining a lot of traction.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And, finally, Miles, there is this question of money.   It costs money to go into space.  </p><p>This is a president who has talked about cutting back domestic  discretionary spending.  Where's the money going to come from?  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  You know, it's interesting.  </p><p>You have to look at the entire space enterprise here.  NASA's budget  is a little more than $19 billion, but if you look at the budget for the  military side of space, it's about $40 billion.  So, what if they  reconsider this idea of a space council, which they're doing, headed by the  vice president, and they start looking at ways to carve out and eliminate  some of the redundancies between the military and the civilian side?</p><p>There may be some ways, even with NASA cuts, that they can borrow from  each other, feed each other technology, as it were, military and civilian,  which could be a bit of a force multiplier and could make it still  possible.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Interesting, because the president has talked about  spending a lot more money on defense.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  Exactly.  So, that money might ultimately help NASA.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Miles O'Brien, taking us to the moon and back, thank  you.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  To the moon, Alice.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  Thank you.  </p><p>MILES O'BRIEN:  You're welcome.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  On the \"NewsHour\" online right now:  Aboriginal  Australian art is the oldest continuous art tradition in the world,  stretching back more than 40,000 years.  Now, due to a group of passionate  collectors and curators, Aboriginal Australian art shows are popping up  across the U.S. </p><p>You can take a closer look and find more on our Web site,  PBS.org/NewsHour.  </p><p>And we have lost another of the greats in public broadcasting.   Longtime \"Nightly Business Report\" co-anchor Paul Kangas passed away  yesterday at the age of 79 in Miami.  Paul retired from the program in  2009.  In an earlier era, The Detroit Free Press dubbed Paul the Walter  Cronkite of business broadcasting.  </p><p>And we all remember his trademark sign-off, \"Wishing you the best of  good buys.\"  Paul was a true gentleman with a great sense of humor.  </p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN:  And that's the \"NewsHour\" for tonight.  </p><p>On Thursday, our Making Sense team looks at the unique corporate  culture behind the e-tailing giant Zappos.  </p><p>I'm Hari Sreenivasan.  </p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF:  And I'm Judy Woodruff.  </p><p>Join us online and again right here tomorrow evening.

We also know  that we have to get them the second part, which is access to long-term  treatments.</p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  All that and more on tonight's \"PBS NewsHour.\"  </p><p>  (BREAK) </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  President Trump is looking to move ahead, in the wake  of his address to Congress.  He won praise today from Republicans, while  Democrats warned that his more moderate sound belies his real intentions.  </p><p>  Wall Street's reaction to the president's business-friendly tone was  euphoric.  The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 300 points to close  above 21000 for the first time.  The Nasdaq rose 78 points, and the S&amp;P 500  added 32.  We will take a closer look at what the president said and what  comes next after the news summary.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  There's word the president's revised travel ban  will no longer include citizens from Iraq.  It had been one of seven  nations included in the initial ban that's still tied up in federal court.  </p><p>  The Associated Press also reports Syrian refugees will no longer be  barred indefinitely under the revised order.  And it drops any explicit  exception for Christian and other religious minorities in Muslim nations.   The White House now says the new order will come in the next few days.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Tornadoes ripped across part of the Midwest last  night, killing three people and damaging more than 100 homes.  The National  Weather Service says it had reports of more than 20 twisters.  Some of the  worst damage came in Illinois and Missouri.  </p><p>  This morning, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner surveyed extensive damage  in the town of Ottawa.  </p><p>  GOV. BRUCE RAUNER (R), Illinois:  We got to count our blessings.  This  could have been way worse.  The warnings systems worked well.  People were  notified.  And it's wonderful the way the residents in the community helped  each other.  They got to elderly residents, gave them a warning that  tornadoes were coming.  People got into their basements.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Forecasters say about 95 million people are in the  path of the same storm system as it moves east.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  Meanwhile, a staggering statistic out of Chicago:   The Windy City had no measurable snow during January and February for the  first time in 146 years, while, in California, there's been so much snow,  that a five-year-long drought may finally be over.  Crews already measured  the state's snowpack once, and did so again today, after one of  California's wettest winters on record.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  In Afghanistan, twin Taliban bombings, and a lengthy  shoot-out, killed at least 16 people in the capital, Kabul.  More than 100  others were wounded.  </p><p>  In the first attack, a suicide car bomber targeted a police station,  touching off a gun battle that lasted hours.  Later, an attacker on foot  blew himself up outside the Afghan intelligence service.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  The United States today delivered a sharp rebuke to  the U.N. Human Rights Council over Israel.  Washington has long argued the  47-nation body unjustly focuses on Israel's treatment of Palestinians.  </p><p>  In Geneva today, U.S. envoy Erin Barclay said the council has -- quote  -- \"an obsession with Israel\" that undermines the group's credibility.  </p><p>  ERIN BARCLAY, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Assistant:  The United  States will oppose any effort to delegitimize or isolate Israel, not just  in the HRC, but wherever it occurs.  When it comes to human rights, no  country should be free from scrutiny, but neither should any democratic  country be regularly subjected to unfair, unbalanced and unfounded bias.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  The critique comes amid reports the Trump  administration is considering quitting the council altogether.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Back in this country, the U.S. Senate easily confirmed  Montana Congressman Ryan Zinke as secretary of the interior.  The 55-year- old Republican and former Navy SEAL has pledged to revitalize the country's  national parks.  He has also said he will resist efforts to sell or  transfer federal lands.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  And Danish toymaker LEGO has announced plans for a  new set honoring five women who were pioneers at NASA.  The collection will  feature computer scientist Margaret Hamilton, mathematician Katherine  Johnson of \"Hidden Figures\" fame, astronauts Sally Ride and Mae Jemison,  and astronomer Nancy Grace Roman.  The set will be released later this year  or early 2018.  </p><p>  Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": President Trump lays out his vision  for the country -- now, what policies will take priority?; a closer look at  the decision-making before the deadly raid in Yemen; Baltimore's approach  to battling the growing opioid epidemic; and much more.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  We take a longer look now at President Trump's speech  last night.  </p><p>  He promised action on a long list of priorities, including Obamacare,  the border wall, public works and regulatory reform.  And all of it, he did  in a more disciplined, upbeat way than before.  </p><p>  Lisa Desjardins reports on the day after.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  The president called in Republican leaders for a  White House lunch, hoping to build on momentum from last night's address.  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:  It begins as of now,  and we think we're going to have tremendous success.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  Vice President Pence took that theme on a one-man  media blitz, with 11 interviews on his public schedule.  </p><p>  MIKE PENCE, Vice President of the United States:  What the American  people saw last night is the president that I serve with every day: broad  shoulders, big heart, reaching out, focusing on the future.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  Praise came from top Republicans in Congress as  well.  </p><p>  SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority Leader:  The president made  clear last night he's ready to work with Congress on policies that can  actually move us forward.  He will find many partners in Congress excited  to get those things accomplished.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  High on that list, repealing and replacing  Obamacare.  Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a former Republican primary rival,  lauded Mr. Trump for his broad outline.  </p><p>  SEN. TED CRUZ (R), Texas:  The principles he's focused on are exactly  the right principles: more choice, more competition, lower costs, lower  premiums.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  But Democrats say there was no real substance, and  they accuse the president of misleading the public with statements like  this:  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP:  Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double  and triple digits.  As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year  alone.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  In fact, while it's true Arizona's premiums have  gone up by that amount, the president ignored important context, that  Arizona is an outlier, with increases four times the national average.  </p><p>  On immigration, some Republicans say they're encouraged by Mr. Trump's  comments ahead of his speech that he'd consider a legal status for some  undocumented immigrants.  </p><p>  SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South Carolina:  He's showing some  willingness to embrace a more practical immigration proposal.  I want to  give him credit for that.  Any time he moves into the land of practicality,  I want to encourage him, because that's what it's going to take to get a  bill passed.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  But in the actual speech, there was no mention of  legalizing undocumented immigrants.  Instead, the president spoke of crimes  by immigrants and his plan to crack down on the undocumented.  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP:  By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will  raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars,  and make our communities safer for everyone.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  That claim, too, was challenged.  </p><p>  Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota spoke with the  \"NewsHour\" last night.</p><p>  REP. KEITH ELLISON (D), Minnesota:  This speech seems to blame  undocumented immigrants for a crime.  It indicated that clamping down on  immigration was actually going to increase wages and make our economy  better.  The fact is, there's no facts that support that.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  Several of the presidents statements were declared  inaccurate by fact-checkers today.  Also getting attention, the generally  positive tone of the speech.  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP:  Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite  for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.  </p><p>  (APPLAUSE)</p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  But Democratic leaders say it's all a facade.  </p><p>  SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority Leader:  You can't just talk the  talk, Mr. President.  You have to walk the walk.  And on issue after issue  after issue, we haven't seen anything, or negative things, for the working  class.  </p><p>  LISA DESJARDINS:  The president and Congress both soon will see  pressure for action increase soon.  House Republicans have said they want a  draft health care bill by the end of this month.  At that point, Trump will  be just one month away from the end of his first 100 days.  </p><p>  For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Lisa Desjardins.</p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Last night's presidential address relayed an ambitious  agenda.  But how much of it will take shape, and does President Trump have  enough support on Capitol Hill to find success?  </p><p>  Joining me to discuss all of that are Dan Balz of The Washington Post  and NPR congressional reporter Susan Davis.  </p><p>  And we welcome both of you back to the program.  </p><p>  Dan, I'm going to start with you.  </p><p>  We just heard Lisa Desjardins talk about this was a different tone  coming from the president.  You wrote about that today in The Washington  Post.  It was a change from what we have been hearing.  </p><p>  DAN BALZ, Chief Political Reporter, The Washington Post:  It was a  dramatic change from what we have been hearing.</p><p>  And I looked back to the inaugural address, which was described by so  many people as dark or dystopian, the phrase American carnage being one  that leaped out at people and has stayed with people, a very downbeat view  of things in the state of the nation, the state of the world.  </p><p>  The substance of last night wasn't significantly or materially  different from what he's talked about all through the campaign and in his  inaugural address, but the tone was so much different.  He talked about  unity repeatedly.  He talked about cooperating with Democrats.  He talked  about a spirit of American renewal.  </p><p>  And it was -- it was a speech that was certainly aimed at reassuring  his congressional Republican allies that he will be presidential, if you  will, going forward, that he will be serious about trying to get these  things done, and that he will not be seeking to create diversion and  digression and controversies.  </p><p>  Whether he's able to stay with that, we don't know.  I mean, this was  only one speech, and we know the history of Donald Trump is that there are  moments when he -- you know, he goes in directions that even his staff  doesn't want.  But for that hour in the House chamber last night, he was  the Donald Trump that a lot of elected officials have wanted to see for a  long time.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  And, Sue Davis, it was a confident-sounding speech, as  if he expects these things to happen.  How much of what he's done and what  he said he's going to do so far is actually taking effect?  </p><p>  SUSAN DAVIS, NPR:  Well, let's start with the two top priorities for  Congress that we know, health care and taxes.  </p><p>  And his remarks in the speech last night, it's like they could have  been written by House Speaker Paul Ryan.  And the speaker's office has been  saying, there's no daylight between us.  There's no daylight between us.  </p><p>  But the president is fairly erratic.  He has tweeted different things  on positions at different times that have contradicted the speaker.  And  they saw the speech as incredibly reassuring, as Dan said, not only that  they're on the same page, but that the president is capable of using the  moment to show leadership to sort of build the case for these conservative  ideas.  </p><p>  Republicans say health care is on track.  They expect to see a bill  within weeks, not months.  And they saw the president's speech last night  as an almost tacit endorsement of this plan that's emerging from the House.  </p><p>  The fight that's going to be really interesting is that there is a  group of conservatives in the Senate, namely Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted  Cruz of Texas, and Mike Lee of Utah, who are -- could be an immovable force  on this, who say it is not conservative enough.  </p><p>  And we're going to see this really interesting test of conservatism  and the conservatives that bedeviled past leaders in Congress and Donald  Trump, and who is going to win out this fight.  And I talked to Rand Paul  today, and he said, what has emerged from the House, he will not vote for.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  And, Dan Balz, to what extent is the White House  prepared for that kind of pushback from people in their own party?</p><p>  DAN BALZ:  Well, I think they are prepared.  </p><p>  I think they know it's there.  They have been getting pushback for  some time.  There is not only opposition from conservatives on Capitol  Hill.  There is division among the Republican governors -- put aside the  Democratic governors -- over what to do with Medicaid.  </p><p>  If you were a state that expanded Medicaid, you have got one view of  that.  And if you didn't, you have got another view of that.  There are  divisions.  </p><p>  I think the administration today feels that, as a result of the  speech, people who have been reticent to support him or openly hostile to  what is taking shape in the House might be a little more amenable to  working with the administration.  </p><p>  Secretary Price from HHS and the vice president, Mike Pence, are going  to be the point people from the administration.  I think one question is to  what extent the administration will, in fact, put down a proposal and move  toward Congress or wait for Congress to really do it and then come in at  the end.</p><p>  I think Congress would like the president to lead as effectively as he  can, in part, I think, to try to create the consensus that doesn't exist  today.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  And then, Sue Davis, there's immigration, where -- I  happened to be at a lunch with the president yesterday where he was talking  about he liked want idea of an immigration bill, if he could get the two  sides to compromise.  He didn't talk very much about comprehensive  immigration reform last night.  </p><p>  He talked about the wall.  And we know there's that travel ban,  renewed version of that.  But what is the mood?  What are the attitudes on  the Hill about immigration?  </p><p>  SUSAN DAVIS:  Well, here's what we know is going to happen.  </p><p>  In a couple of weeks, he's going to send a request to Congress asking  for undetermined amounts of millions of dollars to start building that  wall.  But immigration -- comprehensive immigration reform hasn't really  been part of the conversation on the Hill.  </p><p>  It wasn't part of the agenda outlined by Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell and Speaker Ryan at the beginning of the Congress.  I talked to  the speaker's office today that said it's still not necessarily at the top  of the agenda.  But if the president decides that he wants this to be a  priority, he has tremendous power to make it a priority and upend what the  congressional schedule is.  </p><p>  I think, on that issue, where I think Congress is trying to take the  lead on things like health care and taxes, on immigration, I think they'd  like to see the White House be a little bit more assertive and outline  specifically what the president would like to do, specifically because that  issue was such a core, center point of his campaign.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Just finally to the two of you -- and I hate to ask  you to do this quickly -- but, Dan Balz, the president really mentioned tax  reform only briefly last night, taxes at all.  </p><p>  What does it look -- what does the atmosphere look like?  What are the  realities in terms of getting tax reform done this year?  </p><p>  DAN BALZ:  Well, it will be very challenging.  </p><p>  Just simply getting the health care bill through will be potentially a  year-long effort, as we saw in the Obama administration.  On taxes, they  don't have a plan at this point.  And health care will have to go first.   Taxes will have to follow.  There are questions about what he really wants  to do.  </p><p>  He provided no details of that last night.  He provided some  principles on health care at least.  On tax reform and tax legislation, he  offered nothing of substance beyond kind of a generalized notion of what he  wants.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Did you pick up anything on that, Sue?  </p><p>  SUSAN DAVIS:  I see the fates of health care and taxes linked.  </p><p>  If the repeal and replace effort falls apart, I think tax reform falls  apart.  If repeal and replace, if they're able to get something to the  president's desk, I think that that increase the chances that they can  actually move on taxes this year.  </p><p>  I don't think they can be seen as separate tracks.  I think they have  to move together.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Well, it is an ambitious agenda.  </p><p>  SUSAN DAVIS:  Extremely.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  We're talking health care.  We're talking -- and we  didn't even mention infrastructure, which is something the president has  said he wants to get done too.</p><p>  But we're going to leave it there for now.  We thank both of you for  talking to us, Dan Balz of The Washington Post, Susan Davis of NPR.  We  thank you.  </p><p>  SUSAN DAVIS:  Thank you.  </p><p>  DAN BALZ:  Thank you.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  More than a month after a controversial special  operations raid was launched on a moonless night in Yemen, questions  persist about how that mission was authorized, what it accomplished, and  how it's been explained by the White House and by the president.  </p><p>  Margaret Warner begins our coverage.  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:  Ryan's legacy is etched  into eternity.  </p><p>  MARGARET WARNER:  Democrats and Republicans alike rose to their feet  last night the widow of Navy SEAL Ryan Owens, who was killed during a  January raid in Yemen.  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP:  Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero, battling  against terrorism and securing our nation.  </p><p>  MARGARET WARNER:  The Trump White House says the raid was planned by  the Pentagon during the Obama administration, and President Trump gave the  go-ahead during his first week in office.  </p><p>  The Pentagon intended as an intelligence-gathering mission against al- Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the militant group's most feared  branches.  But a gun battle erupted, and Owens was killed, reportedly along  with as many as 30 civilians, including children.  </p><p>  Last night, the president said Defense Secretary Mattis told him the  mission would lead to victories in the future.  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP:  Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that  generated large amounts of vital intelligence.</p><p>  MARGARET WARNER:  But others question that claim, and last month,  Republican Senator John McCain suggested the raid was a failure.  </p><p>  Mr. Trump respond by charging such criticism only emboldened the  enemy, and White House spokesman Sean Spicer joined in.  </p><p>  SEAN SPICER, White House Press Secretary:  I think anybody who  undermines the success of that raid owes an apology and does a disservice  to the life of Chief Owens.  </p><p>  MARGARET WARNER:  The SEAL's father, William Owens, refused to meet  with the president when his son's remains were flown home.  </p><p>  Instead, he told The Miami Herald that Mr. Trump shouldn't -- quote --  \"hide behind his son's death to prevent an investigation.\"</p><p>  The president again deflected criticism in an interview aired  yesterday on FOX News, saying he followed the military's advice.  </p><p>  DONALD TRUMP:  This was a mission that was started before I got here.   They explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very  respected. And they lost Ryan.  </p><p>  MARGARET WARNER:  Today, South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham  offered this advice:  </p><p>  SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South Carolina:  Don't oversell results.  The  only sin I think a commander in chief can make is exaggerating successes  and not understanding the challenges.  </p><p>  MARGARET WARNER:  For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Margaret Warner.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  And joining me now from the White House, Sebastian  Gorka.  He is deputy assistant to the president.  He advises the  administration on national security issues.  </p><p>  Mr. Gorka, thank you for being with us.  </p><p>  Picking up on what we heard from senator Graham, did the president  fully understand the challenges involved when he signed off on this? </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA, Deputy Assistant to President Trump:  Of course he  did.  He's the commander in chief.  He takes his job very, very seriously.  </p><p>  If you look at the way he's treated law enforcement, if you look at  the way he's treated the military, this is a man who fully understands the  burden of leadership and the responsibility he has as the commander in  chief.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Well, he suggested in that interview with FOX News  yesterday that he did it mainly because the generals suggested that he do  it, that they recommended it.  Is that the case?  </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA:  We don't give our internal playbook away.  That's  what the last administration did.  That's how people get in big, big  trouble.  </p><p>  These are classified operations by our tier one operators.  So, he  acted and made a decision based upon the best advice of our military.   That's the way it has to work, Judy.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Well, my question is, Mr. Gorka, because we just --  again, looking at that FOX interview, referring to the generals, the  president said, \"They lost Ryan.\"</p><p>  Does that mean he doesn't accept responsibility? </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA:  Of course it doesn't.  And I find it quite churlish  when the media focuses on half a sentence here, half a sentence there.  </p><p>  Why would you even posit that of the president?  It's really  unbecoming.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  So, the president accepts, in effect, the buck stops  with him? </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA:  Of course he does.  He's the president.  This is a  team effort, nevertheless.  </p><p>  Nobody goes into battle alone, but he is the commander in chief.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  We also heard the president say that the raid was  highly successful, that it generated a large amount of intelligence that  will be valuable, useful for the administration.  </p><p>  But we also know that there are a number of news organization  reporting that senior officials saying that is not the case, that there is  not valuable intelligence from that raid.  What are we to believe?  </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA:  Is that the same kind of sources that reported all  kinds of fallacious things inside the White House?  </p><p>  The sad truth is, Judy, since I started working here six weeks ago, I  find that more than 50 percent of the more sensational things I read are  wholly fallacious and unfounded.  </p><p>  I can tell you because I'm inside the building when those decisions  are being taken.  So, it's easy to make up unnamed sources, but the fact is  life is a little different from what you would read in the mainstream media  inside the White House.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  What do you say to the American people who are asking,  why is the U.S. in Yemen in the first place?  </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA:  Oh, very easy, very, very easy.  </p><p>  As the president pointed out yesterday, we are facing a global threat.   It is radical Islamic terrorism.  Another great synonym is the global  jihadi movement.  And the idea that Yemen or another country that doesn't  have adequate governance is not potentially connected to the threat to the  United States is, again, a very, very dangerous concept.  </p><p>  These aren't just events occurring 8,000 or 10,000 miles away.   Remember, Omar Mateen, as he slayed 49 Americans in the Pulse nightclub,  stopped to dial 911, not to call an ambulance, Judy, but to swear  allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in the Middle East.  </p><p>  That's just how interconnected the threat is today and how real the  war is from the streets of Aleppo right to Orlando.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Well, I want to pick up on the phrase you just used,  radical Islamic terrorism.  We heard the president say that last night.</p><p>  But it has also been reported, as you know, several news  organizations, that the president's new security adviser, General H.R.  McMaster, has advised the president not to use that term, in effect because  it suggests that all who believe in Islam as a faith, that there's some  strain there that's connected to terrorism.  </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA:  How does it -- A, the reports are, again, false.   It's fake news.  Not true.  </p><p>  You need to talk to General McMaster, who I talked to yesterday before  the speech.  It's not what he said.  And, again, how does the phrase  radical Islamic terrorism link all the believers of a faith to terrorism?  </p><p>  If I said radical Christian terrorism, does that mean I as a Catholic  are a terrorist?  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  So, I'm just trying to understand.  So you're saying  the president is not suggesting that there is something inherent in all of  Islam that is at odds with Western values?  </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA:  That would be asinine.  Of course he didn't.  </p><p>  We are dealing with a version of Islam, with criminals, mass  murderers, people who run slave markets, that use a religion, use a seventh  century, atavistic, blood-curdled version of it to justify their actions.  </p><p>  But I can tell you, the idea that you can separate jihadi terrorism  from Islam is exactly what got us in the mess we are today, with 65 million  refugees around the world and with ISIS controlling territory in multiple  countries.  </p><p>  If you talk to Muslims, as I do -- I have trained hundreds of Muslim  officers from our partner nations when I was in the Defense Department --  they will tell you, Judy, this is a war inside Islam for the heart of  Islam.  We are not at war with Islam.  That is a very dangerous and very  fallacious idea.  </p><p>  But we know that our Muslim allies are fighting a war for the heart of  Islam.  Ask the Jordanians.  Ask the Egyptians.  They understand the  relevance of jihadist ideology in this war.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Sebastian Gorka, who is a deputy assistant to  President Trump, we thank you very much.  </p><p>  SEBASTIAN GORKA:  My pleasure.  Any time, Judy.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  Now views on the raid in Yemen and the decision- making behind it.  </p><p>  We talk to two men with intimate knowledge of the process that  authorized the use of military force during the Obama administration.  </p><p>  Colin Kahl was deputy assistant to the president and national security  adviser to the vice president during the Obama administration.  He is now  an associate professor at Georgetown University.  Andrew Exum was deputy  assistant secretary of defense for Middle East policy during the Obama  administration.  He also served in the Army form 2000 to 2004 in  Afghanistan and Iraq.  </p><p>  Colin, let me start with you.  </p><p>  We have heard the president say, this was a mission that was started  before I got here.  </p><p>  You were in the rooms where these mission have been discussed for the  Obama administration before he left.  What did the previous administration  leave for President Trump to pick up?  </p><p>  COLIN KAHL, Former Deputy Assistant to President Obama:  Yes.  </p><p>  Well, for years, the United States has been taking military action  against this group, AQAP, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, al Qaeda's  affiliate in Yemen, predominantly through drone strikes, airstrikes.  </p><p>  What came to the White House shortly before Christmas was a proposal  from the Pentagon to expand the authorities and resources to allow special  operations forces to more actively engage in direct raids to go after  compounds, like the one that we saw in January.  </p><p>  But a couple of things, I think, are important to note.  First, they  never briefed a particular raid.  They didn't say, we're going to go after  a particular target or a compound on this night or this day.  Instead, they  asked for a broad set of authorities to do this type of thing.  </p><p>  And, importantly, when the deputies convened, kind of a sub-cabinet  level of government convened in early January, they recommended that this  decision get deferred to the Trump administration, so they could run their  own careful process.  And President Obama agreed on that, that he would  make no decision whether to do things like this, and instead that Trump  should run his own process.  </p><p>  But, instead, Trump had a dinner party and decided it over dinner.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  So, you're saying the category of raids was what  was discussed, not this specific raid, because we saw reports that perhaps  they were waiting for a moonless night, that was the opportune time, it  couldn't have happened in the Obama administration's last few days.  </p><p>  COLIN KAHL:  I will defer to Andrew, who worked in the Pentagon, on  this one.</p><p>  But my understanding is that there were a number of concepts of  operations that were bouncing around the Pentagon for a long time, and this  raid may have been one of them.  It was never brought across the river to  the White House.  </p><p>  And as it relates to the moonless night issue, a Pentagon spokesperson  said that that issue didn't become relevant until after January 20, when  they then asked for the authority to do the raid to Trump.  </p><p>  And, importantly, that's why I think it's extraordinarily unfair to  our men and women in the armed services for Trump to suggest, as he did on  FOX yesterday, that somehow this is the military's fault.  He's the  commander in chief.  The buck stops with him.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  Andrew Exum, fill in that blank there.  From the  Pentagon's perspective, what was left for the Trump administration?</p><p>  ANDREW EXUM, Former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense:  Well,  no, I think that that's an accurate recounting of the way that things were  presented to the Trump administration and to the Obama administration  before the -- before the Trump inauguration.  </p><p>  I think that we in the Obama administration, those are of us who  served in the Obama administration need to be very careful as we criticize  the process that the Trump administration used to approve this.  </p><p>  First off, to approve this raid, it would have gone through several  hurdles just through the Department of Defense before being presented to  the president.  When we in the Obama administration brought these options  to the president, it followed a very deliberate interagency process.  </p><p>  It's what worked for President Obama.  Just because we have seen,  quite frankly, a lot of a -- lot of mess in the Trump administration thus  far in their first month, I think we have got to be careful about saying  that we had all the answers during the Obama administration.  </p><p>  I think Colin would agree with that.  This president's going find a  decision-making process that works for him.  What happened in Yemen may  cause him to rethink the way in which he approved this raid, because you  can always delegate authority.  You can never delegate the risk.   Ultimately, you're going to own that, as Dr. Gorka mentioned from the White  House.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  Andrew, I want to -- you recently wrote that  blaming the president is both inappropriate and counterproductive.  You  also described sometimes that the process can be paralysis by analysis.  </p><p>  ANDREW EXUM:  Yes.    </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  That it can take a very long time.  </p><p>  ANDREW EXUM:  No, that's right.  </p><p>  Colin remembers that, at one point in the waning days of the Obama  administration, I think we were debating at the Cabinet level the movement  of three helicopters from Iraq to Syria.  </p><p>  Now, there are obvious, you know, political implications of anything  you do on the ground.  But at what point do you delegate authority down to  your commander on the ground, I think, is the key question.</p><p>  The reason why I think putting the -- putting real blame on the Trump  administration here is dangerous is because you have the Benghazi effect.   You remember, when the Republicans used Benghazi and what happened there as  a cudgel to beat Hillary Clinton, and without -- you know their effort was  successful, it must be added, to weaken her as a political candidate.  </p><p>  But it also had a chilling effect on the bureaucracy.  It makes the  bureaucracy risk-averse.  And, quite frankly, that's not something that we  want from our diplomats.  It's not something we want from our special  operators.  </p><p>  We want them to be aggressive.  We want them to take risks.  And when  we elevate the blame, when something goes wrong, all the way to the  presidential level, we just have got to be very careful about how we do  that.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  And, Colin, why does it take so long?  What kinds  of input factor into a decision like this?  </p><p>  COLIN KAHL:  Yes, look, I think that the Obama administration can be  criticized for too much micromanagement of the Pentagon.  </p><p>  I think, you know, the question is, did they swing the pendulum too  far in one direction?  But I worry that President Trump, in the first big  decision that came to his, in this case, dinner table as commander in  chief, he swung the pendulum all the way back in the other direction.  </p><p>  Look, what President Obama insisted on is, every time that the  military wanted to come forward to ask for authority to significantly  escalate, especially to put ground forces into a conflict environment,  where people can die, both our service members, but also civilians and  others, that we needed to have a careful, deliberate process.  </p><p>  It doesn't have to take weeks.  It oftentimes takes a couple of days.   But it works its way through, and you get the inputs from all the various  agencies.  </p><p>  The question I have with Trump's decision-making process here is not  that you have to do it exactly the way we did it, but he didn't run a  process at all.  He just had dinner with Secretary Mattis and General  Dunford and a handful of close advisers and was briefed about the raid and  made a decision.  </p><p>  And, as a consequence, he didn't have the full benefit of his  intelligence professionals, of his State Department.  And that is a recipe  for making mistakes and costing people their lives.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  Andrew Exum, what about the idea that, when there  are these different agencies, these different people weighing in on it,  that they're going to think about diplomatic consequences, political  consequences, things that perhaps a commander in the field might not think  about because, for him or her, they see a much different objective?</p><p>  ANDREW EXUM:  Yes, it's a valid point.</p><p>  I think the way Colin described things, I think he's right that the  pendulum swung back.  I wouldn't say it went all the way back, because,  again, the decision-making process in this raid would have gone through a  very rigorous process in the Pentagon.  It would have been blessed off by  all the Pentagon senior leaders before it would have been presented to the  president.</p><p>  So it wasn't completely without rigor.  But I think what Colin is  describing in terms of baking down the risk, that does happen in a  deliberate process like that.  The key question is opportunity cost.  </p><p>  So, in the Obama administration, we had a very deliberate process that  in many cases served the president and was what the president desired.  It  drew down a lot of political risks, as well as the physical risk, to the  operators on the ground.  </p><p>  The question is, was there an opportunity cost?  The nature of these  raids is, they go after time-sensitive targets.  So do you lose  opportunities the more that you hold things up in Washington?  I think  that's the key question.  </p><p>  And where Colin and I may disagree, but where I think we do agree, is  that there has to be a balance.  It's just a matter of where you strike  that balance.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  All right, Andrew Exum, Colin Kahl, thank you both.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Stay with us.  </p><p>  Coming up on the \"NewsHour\": the successes and struggles of two of the  world's fastest growing businesses; and a plan to once again send humans to  the moon.  </p><p>  But first: the nation's opioid crisis.  </p><p>  Overdose deaths are on the rise across the country, in 2015,  surpassing gun homicides for the first time.  One of the hardest-hit states  is Maryland, where the governor today declared a state of emergency to  fight the epidemic.  </p><p>  But, for more than a year, the city of Baltimore has been training  everyday citizens in how to use a lifesaving antidote, an approach that's  catching on across the country.  </p><p>  \"NewsHour\" producer Pamela Kirkland visited Baltimore to find out  more.  </p><p>  MAN:  Excuse me, sir, are you interested in Narcan training?  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Each week, city health workers hit the streets of  Baltimore, handing out an emergency medication that brings users back from  the dead.  </p><p>  MAN:  This is the medicine.  It reverses overdoses.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Naloxone, brand name Narcan, comes as a nasal spray  or injection, and works by blocking the brain's opioid receptors.  </p><p>  In a city with 24,000 active heroin users, overdoses, and now  increasingly this emergency antidote have become facts of life.  </p><p>  MAN:  I lost a friend of mine that was -- at 25 years old.  </p><p>  MAN:  I have just seen so many young people getting hooked on the  opioids, or better yet, the fentanyl.  And it's definitely a killer, </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  In Maryland, deaths from opioids, which include  heroin, fentanyl and prescription painkillers, doubled between 2010 and  2015, to just under 1,100 people a year.  Meanwhile, heroin fatalities  alone more than tripled.  </p><p>  And in just the past three years, deaths in Baltimore from fentanyl, a  synthetic opioid far stronger than heroin, are up 20-fold.  </p><p>  DR. LEANA WEN, Baltimore Health Commissioner:  We have an epidemic of  people, fellow residents in our city, who are dying from opioid overdose.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  In late 2015, Dr. Leana Wen, Baltimore's health  commissioner, and a practicing emergency room physician, issued a standing  order for naloxone to all 620,000 city residents.  </p><p>  DR. LEANA WEN:  What that means is that, if somebody goes through a  very basic training -- and we do trainings everywhere, including on street  corners, in jails, in public housing, really anywhere that people are --  they will immediately get a prescription for naloxone, and even get the  medication in hand.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Just one dose of naloxone can bring someone back.   Residents can buy it at a pharmacy, only $1 for Medicaid recipients.  And  thanks to a 2015 good samaritan law, there's no risk of prosecution if  citizens intervene and the victim dies.  </p><p>  MAN:  I have used it four times.  I keep them in my bag.  I always  keep them in my bag, at least four or five of them in my bag.</p><p>  JOHN HARRIS, Baltimore Health Department:  This is our mobile unit.</p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  John Harris works on one of the Health Department's  vans which traverse the city offering sexually transmitted infection  screenings, clean needle kits and naloxone training.  </p><p>  JOHN HARRIS:  Well, we tell people that, once you reverse an overdose,  then not to use that.</p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  He knows what addiction can do to a person, having  spent 16 years addicted to heroin.  But he sees something different today.  </p><p>  JOHN HARRIS:  There was a lot of fentanyl at first that we were  hearing about.  But now the clients are starting to come with medications  that they use on an elephant, tranquilizers being cut with heroin.  There  are benzodiazepines.  We're hearing about all different types of drugs.   It's really becoming more complicated and dangerous.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Since January 2015, the Baltimore Health Department  says over 20,000 residents have completed naloxone training and at least  800 lives have been saved.</p><p>  And many more states and municipalities across the country have moved  to make naloxone more accessible to the public.  But not everyone believes  this is the right approach.  </p><p>  MIKE GIMBEL, Maryland Addiction Recovery Center:  We are selling it to  the public as if it's the answer.  I mean, it's an amazing drug, no doubt  about it, but it doesn't change the behavior of the addict.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  For 25 years, Mike Gimbel was Baltimore County's  director of substance abuse.  Now he's a consultant for Maryland Addiction  Recovery Center, a private treatment facility outside the city.  And like  John Harris, Gimbel is in recovery.  </p><p>  MIKE GIMBEL:  Heroin is the devil.  It's the devil.  It makes you do  things you would never do you in your life.  It took a middle-class, good  Jewish kid like me, and had me robing my own parents, carrying a gun. </p><p>  That's what heroin does.  That's how powerful heroin is.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  He argues that the city and state are spending too  much time and money on Narcan training and outreach, and not enough on  long-term recovery.  </p><p>  And as a sign this approach isn't working, he points to the city's  rising overdose fatalities, up 68 percent for the first three-quarters of  2016 over the same period the year before.  </p><p>  MIKE GIMBEL:  Sometimes, by having Narcan so available, it actually  reinforces the addict's behavior.  Why should I stop using heroin, when, if  I overdose, Narcan's going to save my life?  Where's the motivation to  stop?  It's not there.  It's not there.  </p><p>  So, sometimes, yes -- and we don't want to see people die, but,  sometimes, watching someone die and watching what happens with overdose and  death wakes up a lot of addicts.  </p><p>  TIMMY HALL, Former Baltimore Police Officer:  It's just a first- responder tool.  That's all it is.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Timmy Hall was with the Baltimore Police Department  for 24 years, where he routinely saw opioid overdoses.  He says officers  often use Narcan to revive the same drug users over and over again.  </p><p>  TIMMY HALL:  A lot of times, they get upset with you when you bring  them back, because they feel like you wasted the money they spent.  You  know, that's the feeling that they wanted.  That wanted that feeling, and  you took it away from them.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  But Hall doesn't see an alternative.  </p><p>  TIMMY HALL:  As a police officer, your first job is to protect and  serve, you know?  And what officer would want to sit there and watch  somebody die, if they got the tools to save somebody?  So, Narcan, to me,  is a great tool.  It's just a first-responder tool.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  The Health Department attributes the continued rise  in overdoses and fatalities to a rise in far more powerful drugs hitting  the streets.  </p><p>  Dr. Wen says there's no evidence that denying naloxone to overdose  victims helps users end their addictions.  Naloxone is just one tool in  this fight.  </p><p>  DR. LEANA WEN:  We are just treading water if all we're doing is  saving someone's life right now.  We also know that we have to get them the  second part, which is access to long-term treatments, that it's a  combination of medications and some treatments, psychosocial treatments,  like counseling.  And then other services are important too, including  housing.  </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Of course, those all cost money and political will.  </p><p>  GOV. LARRY HOGAN (R), Maryland:  Heroin and opioid abuse has been  taking lives and tearing apart families.</p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Just today, Maryland's Republican governor, Larry  Hogan, announced a state of emergency to deal with the crisis, pledging 50  million additional dollars over five years for enforcement, treatment and  prevention.</p><p>  JOHN HARRIS:  It's got to get better.  It's got to get better.  And I  believe it will get better.  I don't think perfection exists in anything,  but I do believe Baltimore has done a lot of good work, will do some more  good work, because we are saving lives.    </p><p>  PAMELA KIRKLAND:  Saving some lives amid a growing epidemic.  </p><p>  For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Pamela Kirkland in Baltimore.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  Now: two high-flying companies whose value has  soared and are the subject of intense scrutiny, Uber, and the parent  company of Snapchat.  </p><p>  For Uber, it's about the culture and leadership of the ride-hailing  service, valued at nearly $70 billion.  It's back in the spotlight  following release of a video of its CEO berating an Uber driver.  More on  that in a moment.  </p><p>  But, first, Snapchat is about to sell its stock to the public for the  first time.  The parent company announced it will offer its share at $17 a  share, bringing its value to nearly $24 billion.  The messaging app is used  by nearly 160 million people each day, and is especially popular among  teens and young adults.  </p><p>  But there are big questions about whether it's worth this kind of  value.  </p><p>  Mike Isaac is covering both these stories for The New York Times.  He  joins me now.  </p><p>  Let's start with Snapchat.  What is the value that Snapchat is trying  to sell investors?  </p><p>  MIKE ISAAC, The New York Times:  Yes.  </p><p>  So, Snapchat's big story is, it's going to be its next Facebook and  not the next Twitter, essentially.  One of Twitter's big struggles, if you  remember, when it went public a few years ago, is, it sort of failed to  grow fast enough for investors on Wall Street.</p><p>  And so, as far as Facebook is concerned, their growth was huge, but  Snapchat just wants to say, like, look, this is the next big social  network.  You want to get in as quickly as possible on the ground floor of  this IPO, and we're going to have the success and strength and reach of  Facebook, particularly with younger users.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  How does it plan to make money?  At one point, it  calls itself now a camera company.  So, is it a social network?  Is it a  camera company?  Do they make money selling advertisements?  </p><p>  MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, so it's primarily advertisements.  They have little  what they call Snapchat stories.</p><p>  And publications like The New York Times will show different things  inside of their -- usually video and photo-based.  And then they sell ads  against that.  </p><p>  And then they're kind of experimenting with other things, whether it's  like e-commerce-related things inside the app.  And then who knows?  They  have what are called Snapchat Spectacles, which are glasses on your face,  and maybe they can make money from that.  I'm not really sure.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  And so part of the reason that it looks like Wall  Street is excited is because there hasn't been a big tech IPO in a while.  </p><p>  MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p>  I think a lot of investors feel like they missed out on Facebook a few  years ago, especially when the IPO went really terribly for the company,  and now Facebook is trading at over $100 a share.  So I think everyone is  really looking forward to a successful IPO from a tech company.  And it has  been a bit.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  And these two founders have also decided to take a  lot of the -- I guess the voting control of the company.  This seems to be  the new thing.  Mark Zuckerberg has a tremendous amount of control over his  company.  Is this the kind of template that now tech CEOs want?  </p><p>  MIKE ISAAC:  I think so.  </p><p>  And I think investors kind of have a sense of trust that the founders  tend to know best and what's best for their company.  Mark Zuckerberg  really sort of became the pioneer or advocate for this approach, where, you  know, he doesn't really want to hear much of what investors have to say  about how he should run his company.  </p><p>  And investors are comfortable with that because he tends to be running  it really well, and it keeps growing, and it keeps making them tons of  money.  So that might work.  </p><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  Sorry.</p><p>  Let's shift gears then to Uber.  It's been in the news recently after  a former employee wrote on her personal blog that she had been sexually  harassed at the company and that it was covered up.  </p><p>  Yesterday, Bloomberg released a video of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick in a  heated exchange with an Uber driver over lowering fares for its black cars  service.  The argument took place in February.  </p><p>  MAN:  You changed the whole business.  </p><p>  TRAVIS KALANICK, CEO, Uber:  What?  What?  </p><p>  MAN:  You dropped the prices.  </p><p>  TRAVIS KALANICK:  On black.  </p><p>  MAN:  Yes, you did.  </p><p>  (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>  MAN:  We started with $20.  We started with $20.  How much is the mile  now, $2.75?  </p><p>  TRAVIS KALANICK:  You know what?  </p><p>  MAN:  What?  </p><p>  TRAVIS KALANICK:  Some people don't like to take responsibility for  their... </p><p>  (CROSSTALK) </p><p>  TRAVIS KALANICK:  They blame everything in their life on somebody  else.  </p><p>  (CROSSTALK) </p><p>  TRAVIS KALANICK:  Good luck.  </p><p>  MAN:  Good luck to you, too.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  Kalanick later apologized.  </p><p>  He said in a statement: \"It's clear this video is a reflection of me,  and the criticism we have received is a stark reminder that I must  fundamentally change as a leader and grow up.\"</p><p>  That's part of the statement.  </p><p>  So, Mike, why is this apology to the driver and the company so  important?  </p><p>  MIKE ISAAC:  If you followed the company for the past seven years, one  thing you can say about Travis Kalanick, he's pretty unapologetic.  He's  aggressive.  He's pushed into markets where operating Uber was actually  illegal.  </p><p>  And it's been a real no-holds-barred approach to operating a company.   So, to see him say, I have to be humble, I have to change the type of  leader that I am is a real big shift for them.  And I'm really curious if  he can actually do it at this point.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  And this is also a company that is not public yet,  but when it goes, if it goes, the valuations are staggering -- $70 billion  is currently where it's at.  </p><p>  Does this call into question perhaps the temperament of this  individual and whether he is the right person to run such a big global  company?</p><p>  MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, I think that's right.  </p><p>  Almost a $70 billion valuation, I think investors, as well as  employees, are wondering, we had this CEO who got us through the really  tough early phases.  Can this person lead us through an IPO, where people  really want a more even keel?  </p><p>  And I think everyone is still asking that question, but it's not  really clear at this point.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  This is in the wake of the revelations of a woman  who left the company, and she had this -- part of this to say in her blog.  </p><p>  \"It became obvious that both H.R. and management had been lying about  this being his first offense, and it certainly wasn't his last.  The  situation was escalated as far up the chain as it could be escalated, and  still nothing was done.\"</p><p>  She's not talking about Travis.  She's talking about one of her  managers who she contends was harassing to her, and now there's a large  investigation.  This is a big deal for the company.  </p><p>  MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, this is -- you know, this is core to how the culture  operates.  </p><p>  You know, it's very -- to take it from Facebook, move fast and break  things.  But, at some point, you have to sort of clean things up on the  inside and change, especially if you want to go public.  And I think  they're really facing that question right now.  It's just a question of,  can you do it and how long will it take?  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  For a little while, there was -- and there might  still be continuing -- a delete Uber campaign.  Did that have an impact on  their business?  </p><p>  MIKE ISAAC:  Yes, it did.  </p><p>  It was -- I would say it's not a material financial impact, but I have  spoken to a number of people who were watching that go down inside.  And,  you know, there were hundreds of thousands of people that deleted their  Uber accounts entirely, and probably hundreds of thousands more that just  deleted the app.  </p><p>  So, it worried Uber, and they definitely tried to curb it pretty  quickly.  </p><p>  HARI SREENIVASAN:  All right, Mike Isaac of The New York Times, thanks  so much.  </p><p>  MIKE ISAAC:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  And now to our Leading edge segment for this week: a  potential return to the moon.  </p><p>  Near the end of his address last night, the president made a reference  to space travel, saying -- quote -- \"American footprints on distant worlds  are not too big a dream.\"</p><p>  It was only a line.  But whenever a president speaks on the subject,  the space community is closely trying to read the tea leaves.  The sentence  leaves a lot to interpretation, but all signs seem to indicate there is  renewed focus inside the Trump administration, NASA and the private sector  on travel to the moon, sooner than you might think.  </p><p>  Our science correspondent, Miles O'Brien, is here.  </p><p>  So, Miles, why the moon after all these years?  </p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  Aside from the \"because it's there\" answer, it's  actually a good destination to go and learn about living and working on an  encampment in space.  </p><p>  You know, we went to the moon 50 years ago now.  We left some  footprints and flags behind, but we didn't really learn how to live there  on a sustained basis.  So, while NASA would still like to go to Mars,  there's a lot of things you can learn about by setting up an encampment on  the moon.  </p><p>  And we have learned in the past 50 years there's a lot of water ice on  the moon.  What is water?  Hydrogen and oxygen.  What is rocket fuel?   Hydrogen and oxygen.  So you can learn a lot about how to create rocket  fuel on location and perhaps push deeper into space.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  So this didn't just spring up as an idea because they  couldn't think of anything else?  </p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  Well, there was one other factor.  There was a mission  planned at the end of '18 for the Space Launch System, which is the next  heavy lift that NASA is working -- heavy lift rocket.  </p><p>  One piece of it wasn't going to be ready, built by the Europeans, a  service module.  And so NASA was faced with the possibility of delaying  that mission, an unmanned mission, even later, or maybe doing something  like we did with Apollo 8, something bold.</p><p>  In the case of Apollo 8, the lunar module wasn't ready.  And we  decided to go around the moon.  In this case, they're thinking about  putting astronauts on this flight maybe early '19, and send them around the  moon Apollo 8-style.  </p><p>  So, a lot of things have lined up.  And, all of a sudden, there is  wide agreement in the space community, this might be the next step.</p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  And you were telling me, Miles, there's a private  sector piece in all of this, Elon Musk announcing just the other day that  two individuals, I guess, with some extra spending money...</p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  To say the least.  </p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  ... have told him they want to go around the moon and  come back to Earth.  </p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  Yes.  </p><p>  He got a lot of attention for that.  He doesn't have a rocket to do it  yet.  It's just a design right now.  It's called the Falcon Heavy, which  would have almost the thrust of the mighty Saturn 5 of Apollo days.  </p><p>  It will fly for the first time, he hopes, by the summer.  So saying  there are going to be paying passengers on there by '18 is optimistic, for  sure.  So, we will watch that with skepticism.  </p><p>  But to the extent that the private sector and the government space  enterprise sort of push each other toward this destination, a lot of space  people are pretty excited about it.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Now, remind us, Miles, why was the moon -- it was on  the agenda at NASA for a while, but it came off.  What was that all about?</p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  Politics.  </p><p>  Of course, we lost the shuttle Columbia in '03.  President Bush at the  time canceled the shuttle program and said, let's go back to the moon, a  program called Constellation.  That got some traction.</p><p>  And then, of course, President Obama came in and said, we're not going  to the moon.  We're going to Mars.  </p><p>  And he wouldn't let anybody talk about going to the moon.  There were  a lot of people who said, you know, we should try the moon first before we  move onto Mars, but that got shelved during the Obama administration.  </p><p>  Politics now is different, obviously, with the Trump administration  there.  And I'm told the Trump administration would really like to have  U.S. astronauts taking off from a U.S. spaceport some time in its first  term.  And so this idea of turning that unmanned Space Launch System flight  into a crewed mission is gaining a lot of traction.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  And, finally, Miles, there is this question of money.   It costs money to go into space.  </p><p>  This is a president who has talked about cutting back domestic  discretionary spending.  Where's the money going to come from?  </p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  You know, it's interesting.  </p><p>  You have to look at the entire space enterprise here.  NASA's budget  is a little more than $19 billion, but if you look at the budget for the  military side of space, it's about $40 billion.  So, what if they  reconsider this idea of a space council, which they're doing, headed by the  vice president, and they start looking at ways to carve out and eliminate  some of the redundancies between the military and the civilian side?</p><p>  There may be some ways, even with NASA cuts, that they can borrow from  each other, feed each other technology, as it were, military and civilian,  which could be a bit of a force multiplier and could make it still  possible.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Interesting, because the president has talked about  spending a lot more money on defense.  </p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  Exactly.  So, that money might ultimately help NASA.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Miles O'Brien, taking us to the moon and back, thank  you.  </p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  To the moon, Alice.  </p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  Thank you.  </p><p>  MILES O'BRIEN:  You're welcome.  </p><p>  JUDY WOODRUFF:  On the \"NewsHour\" online right now:  Aboriginal  Australian art is the oldest continuous art tradition in the world,  stretching back more than 40,000 years.

I`m Amna Nawaz. Judy Woodruff is away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the \"NewsHour\" tonight: facing facts. The dilemma for Facebook and other social media on how to handle doctored video.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then, our Politics Monday duo is here, as 2020 presidential candidates hold campaign events, town halls, and attend Memorial Day celebrations..</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And honoring those who served, with one military unit that has suffered more losses from post-traumatic stress disorder than from combat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DR. SKIP RIZZO, Clinical Psychologist: We`re seeing people that end up killing themselves because they never got the treatment, or the treatment was ineffective in addressing their needs.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: All that and more on tonight`s \"PBS NewsHour.\"</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: President Trump today dismissed concerns about North Korea`s recent missile tests, publicly disagreeing with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.</p><p>In Tokyo, the president held a joint press conference without Abe and said he`s not bothered by the actions of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States: I view it as a man, perhaps he wants to get attention, and perhaps not. Who knows? It doesn`t matter.</p><p>All I know is that there have been no nuclear tests. There have been no ballistic missiles going out. There have been no long-range missiles going out. And I think that, someday, we will have a deal.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: In contrast, Prime Minister Abe did express concern about North Korea firing short-range missiles earlier this month.</p><p>SHINZO ABE, Japanese Prime Minister (through translator): North Korea`s May 9 short-range ballistic missile launch violates the U.N. resolutions, and it is extremely regrettable, as I have repeatedly said. But I would like to express my respect in the new approach taken between President Trump and Chairman Kim.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: President Trump has had two summits with North Korea`s Kim, but talks about denuclearization have stalled. the north said last week that nuclear negotiations will not resume until the U.S. eases sanctions.</p><p>The European Parliament election results are in, and the center-right and center-left parties that ruled for years have lost some ground. Over four days of voting, turnout spiked to the highest since 1994. Anti- immigration nationalist parties made gains, as did liberal and green parties. Overall, though, parties that generally support the European union will maintain a majority.</p><p>Back in this country, the nation marked Memorial Day, honoring those who died in U.S. military service. Vice President Pence laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery. He then paid tribute to those they left behind.</p><p>MIKE PENCE, Vice President of the United States: To the families of the fallen here and looking on, who`ve sacrificed more than we can comprehend, know that the hearts of every American are with you today, and they will stay with you every day.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Meanwhile, service members in New York unfurled a 100- foot flag aboard the USS Intrepid, now a floating museum. And cities and towns across the country held their own Memorial Day observances.</p><p>U.S. health officials report 60 new measles cases were confirmed last week, making 940 cases already this year. It is the worst outbreak since 1994. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 26 states have reported cases so far.</p><p>And two losses we`d like to note from the sports world.</p><p>Hall of Fame quarterback Bart Starr died Sunday at 85. He led the great Green Bay Packers teams that won five NFL titles in the 1960s, including the first two Super Bowls. His most famous when came in the infamous Ice Bowl of 1967 with chills at 50 below. Starr scored in the final minute to beat Dallas and send Green Bay to its second Super Bowl.</p><p>Also, former Boston Red Sox first baseman Bill Buckner passed away today after struggling with dementia. The All-Star hitter is remembered for a single unlucky moment in game since of the 1986 World Series against the New York Mets.</p><p>With the game tied and two out in the 10th inning, a ground ball somehow rolled between Buckner`s legs. The Mets scored the game-winning run, and went on to win the series. Boston`s title drought finally ended in 2004. Bill Buckner was 69 years old.</p><p>Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": how Facebook is handling doctored video meant to mislead its audience; 2020 presidential candidates hit the trail over the holiday weekend; searching for treatment with a military unit that has lost more members to post-traumatic stress disorder than in combat; and much more.</p><p>A doctored video circulating on the Internet continues to stir up controversy. It falsely depicts House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slurring her words at a public event.</p><p>As you will see, someone has edited the original video to slow down her movements and speech.</p><p>Here now is that doctored version, followed immediately by the original, unaltered footage.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): And then he had a press conference in the Rose Garden with all this sort of visuals that obviously were planned.</p><p>And then he had a press conference in the Rose Garden with all this sort of visuals that obviously were planned.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: So, while one social media giant, YouTube, removed the doctored video from its platform last week, both Facebook and Twitter left it up. Facebook instead said it reduced its distribution and added an alert advising viewers that its authenticity had been called into question.</p><p>Facebook`s actions drew strong criticism from media watchers, but on Friday, the company`s head of global policy management, Monika Bickert, defended the company`s decision.</p><p>MONIKA BICKERT, Facebook: We think it`s important for people to make their own informed choice about what to believe. Our job is to make sure that we are getting them accurate information. And that`s why we work with more than 50 fact-checking organizations around the world.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: As of late today, the doctored video remains available on Facebook.</p><p>So, what should viewers expect from Facebook and other social media sites when it comes to authenticating material on their platforms? And is it possible to screen all content from more than two billion active Facebook users?</p><p>For one perspective, I`m joined by Franklin Foer. He is a writer for \"The Atlantic\" and author of \"World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech.\"</p><p>Welcome back to the \"NewsHour.\"</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER, Author, \"World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech\": Thank you.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: So, Facebook defended its decision to leave the video up. Should they have removed it, in your view?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: This cuts to the very core problem that Facebook faces, which is that it has gained tremendous reach and tremendous power over the public square. It, in fact, does constitute the public square for these billions of people who are on it, and yet, having that much power, it also entails responsibility.</p><p>Facebook claims that it`s just a place where people can post their opinions. But, of course, it`s also a place where people get news and information. And the place has become a bit of a mess.</p><p>And so it means that they have some responsibility to try to clean that up. Yet, when they assume that responsibility, it means that they`re going to get targeted for lots of criticism. So they`re in a very, very sticky position.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: So how far should that responsibility go? They alerted people, something has happened to this video. They share related articles next to it, right, to point out that this video has been edited.</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Yes.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Is that far enough?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: So the video reflects this problem that we`re going to increasingly face, which is that we can`t trust our own eyes.</p><p>So it`s not that easy for the average citizen to make sense of what`s true and what`s false, what gets circulated, what goes viral on Facebook. And so they need to defer to people with expert opinion. Facebook is shirking that role. They`re claiming that they don`t want to exert expert opinion. They don`t want to say what is true or false.</p><p>But I think the republic begins to suffer if people are getting extremely bad information and the authorities, the elites, the gatekeepers, are basically throwing up their hands and saying, not my problem.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: So how far can we expect a company like Facebook to reasonably go? Because it`s kind of a slippery slope, right? Should they be fact-checking every piece of journalism before they`re allowed to post?</p><p>Should they say, hey, this person actually has some kind of filter on the selfie that she posted? Like, how far does that go?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: So I`m extremely sympathetic to Facebook, in that even though I wrote this book being very critical of them, this is not an easy problem for them to solve, because there are heads of state who are sharing misinformation.</p><p>So does Facebook go and say that presidents of countries shouldn`t be -- should be kicked off of the platform or that their words shouldn`t be shared through Facebook?</p><p>I think that we have two responses to Facebook. One is that we could regulate them, or we could say that maybe the response to Facebook is not to take their power and to invest it with even greater power. So over the long run -- in the short term, I think that they have a responsibility to take action.</p><p>Over the long run, I think we`re all going to sit uncomfortably with them exerting that power.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Is it different, do you think, when it`s dealing with an elected official, when there`s an election at stake, when there`s some sort of bigger issue that they`re weighing? Is that different for them?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Yes, I actually do think -- I think it is different, because we want them to come down on the side of reality and of truth, but we don`t want them tipping -- using their power in order to influence political outcomes, because I think that that`s -- that`s too much responsibility to have in one corporation.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: At the same time, shouldn`t the onus be on the user to approach with a little bit more skepticism everything they see if it isn`t coming from a verified kind of source? Shouldn`t we expect more from people who are viewing the content?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Right.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Is that really Facebook`s responsibility?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: I think it is. I mean, of course we want citizens to be able to distinguish between what`s real and what`s not. We want them to be very active in seeking out information, not to get trapped in filter bubbles, not to rely on one source of information.</p><p>But we all know that the flow of information comes at us so fast, so intensely, that even trained journalists have a hard time separating sometimes what`s real and what`s not real.</p><p>And in the case of this video, you can just see how it`s just a tweet. It`s not that -- it`s not an extreme doctoring of the video. And so how is the normal person -- average person going to be able to make that distinction on their own?</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Well, that`s the other point I want to ask you about. It didn`t take much to alter this video. There`s no deep editing. There`s no CGI here. It was just a slowing down of the speech.</p><p>This can`t be the last time we will see a video like this.</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Yes, exactly.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Yes, is Facebook`s response here sustainable?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: No, because this is the spear tip.</p><p>The last election, we saw how outside actors came in and tried to manipulate the American electorate, spreading misinformation, and Facebook was their primary platform for spreading misinformation. So what happens when those actors, when the Russians or some other -- or some bad political actors here try to use manipulated video that doesn`t just change a snippet in a clip, but that invents things whole cloth?</p><p>Because the technology increasingly allows people to fabricate video where they would take the words of a politician and insert new words into their mouth, and it would be convincing for the whole world.</p><p>And so I don`t see how, once that fire hose is unleashed, we have any choice but to have some authority step in and make those distinctions about what`s real and what`s not.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Franklin Foer of \"The Atlantic,\" thanks for being here.</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Thank you.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: For the record, \"PBS NewsHour\" produces some content in a business relationship with Facebook.</p><p>Just one month until the first Democratic presidential debate, and the crowded field of contenders spent the three-day weekend crisscrossing the country talking to voters.</p><p>Lisa Desjardins has our report.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: A somber Memorial Day for the Democrats who hope to become commander in chief.</p><p>SEN.

She co-hosts the \"NPR Politics\" podcast.</p><p>Welcome to you both.</p><p>So, there`s a couple of ways that you can make the debate stage right now if you`re a Democratic candidate, right? Let`s take a look at who has made it so far, 19 candidates so far.</p><p>You will see in the middle there, that`s the group that`s qualified both meeting the donor and the poll threshold, the group on the left just meeting the poll threshold.</p><p>Amy, when you look at this group, what`s standing out to you about who`s made it and who hasn`t?</p><p>AMY WALTER, The Cook Political Report: Well, pretty much everybody is in that mix, which is what the DNC did want to do.</p><p>Remember, part of the reason for this new threshold, which is very low, needing just 1 percent in the polls or a number of donors, 65,000 individual donors, part of the reason they wanted to do this was as a reaction to the criticism the DNC got in 2016, when there was criticism that they didn`t hold enough debates, that they were on weekend nights, that they didn`t start until late in the process, and by the time that they really started getting going, Hillary Clinton had already built up a pretty big lead.</p><p>This year, they said, nope, we`re going to be more small-D democratic about it.</p><p>What I think what we`re all looking to see, though, is whether or not this is actually going to thin the field by the time the first set of debates is in June. Then there`s another one in July. By the end of the summer, will that 25 or however many candidates we will have by the end -- by now, be thinned out significantly because of these debate performances?</p><p>If you think back to 2012 and 2016, it was the candidates who had really bad performances. Many of them were considered in the top tier. 2012, it was Rick Perry, the governor of Texas with the famous remembering...</p><p>TAMARA KEITH, National Public Radio: Oops.</p><p>AMY WALTER: Oops -- the three things.</p><p>And then you had Tim Pawlenty also in 2012 considered a top candidate in the race, drops out soon after those, and Scott Walker in 2016. So, theoretically, that`s what you may see when all is said and done, but it`s very big and messy.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: It`s very big, Tam.</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: Yes.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: And you have been watching some of these candidates in action. Are you seeing them kind of road-test what we are going to see in those debates?</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: Some of them are definitely doing and saying things,, talking about President Trump in a way that seems to be trying to signal to voters in these early states, hey, look at me, I would be good on a debate stage.</p><p>And, in fact, in talking to voters, a lot of them are thinking about who would be the best one to debate President Trump? Who do I want to see on stage with President Trump? And then they are really -- a lot of the voters I`m talking to -- looking forward to these debates to see how these candidates are in that format.</p><p>And that, I think, will probably play into their thoughts about electability.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: That`s something they`re considering.</p><p>Amy, I want to point to something you wrote last week on that question. There is this gap between electability and potentially enthusiasm among Democratic voters of who would bring them out.</p><p>You wrote about this last week. You said: \"New polling by Pew Research suggests that former Vice President Joe Biden, the candidate many see as the most electable, also fits the description of the type of nominee that many voters in the Democratic base say they are least enthusiastic about supporting in November of 2020.\"</p><p>Why is that?</p><p>AMY WALTER: What is that? Right.</p><p>There`s something of a catch-22 for Democrats right now. Tam pointed to it, that Democratic voters, when you talk to them, over and over say, I want to pick the candidate who is going to look up best against Donald Trump, who`s the most electable candidate, even if they`re not the most exciting candidate or groundbreaking candidate.</p><p>But, on the other hand, the worry about the least risky choice is that it actually is pretty risky for Democrats in November because younger voters, voters of color, a lot of whom stayed home in 2016, were not enthusiastic about Hillary Clinton, may stay home again in 2020.</p><p>What Pew found, the group of voters that is the least enthusiastic about a white male candidate, younger women. They are also, perhaps not surprisingly, the most excited about having a female candidate.</p><p>But a white male candidate is the candidate that not only garners the least enthusiasm from Democratic voters, but also the highest percent of less-than-enthusiastic responses.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: So, Tam, you were just in Iowa, right, talking to voters. You saw a couple of candidates in action, Senator Gillibrand, Senator Klobuchar.</p><p>What are people there telling you and what are the candidates saying in terms of messaging about this electability vs. enthusiasm gap?</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: Yes, so the voters that I talked to -- I was at a Gillibrand event and several of them, they were all shopping. At this point, no one was there saying, I am committed to vote for the candidate they were seeing or any of the four other candidates they had already seen.</p><p>They`re sort of overwhelmed by the size of the field and overwhelmed by the options. A couple of female voters I talked to said, well if Biden`s the pick, then I will vote for Biden, but they didn`t seem excited about it.</p><p>And, really, they are -- when you ask them about electability, though, or -- they say, I`m out for the most electable candidate. Then you ask them what that means. They don`t really know.</p><p>AMY WALTER: They will know it when they see it.</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: They will know it when they see it.</p><p>And one point about electability, a lot of voters talk about, well, we need somebody who can really get those voters in the Upper Midwest, get those states that Hillary Clinton lost.</p><p>And I feel like a lot of voters I`m talking to, the image they have in their mind is sort of a white working-class guy. But white working-class guys are probably not why Hillary Clinton lost in those key states. The turnout was depressed among African-American and other voters in the cities, in Detroit and Milwaukee and Philadelphia.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Let`s talk about who they are going to be running against.</p><p>We have heard, obviously, a few of them kind of punching up at the president as well. And we should look at how -- The New York Times actually did an analysis of who the president has been insulting and attacking in tweets and in statements and so on.</p><p>Right now, leading that pack in terms of that analysis is Joe Biden. What does that say to you?</p><p>AMY WALTER: Well, he knows how to read the polls is what it says.</p><p>He sees Joe Biden is out front and he says, well, then I have got to come and take him down, right? And so, the most recent, of course, sort of was tweeting from Japan. I think he tweeted from Japan this quote from Kim Jong-un and the government in North Korea saying that they see Joe Biden as being a low-I.Q. kind of person.</p><p>And the president said, I agree with that, which there was a time when we had this rule about politics not crossing the ocean, right, that all politics stays -- goes away when you go overseas.</p><p>I think we broached that a long time ago. But now we`re to a place too where the president`s desire to always be punching, always be on the offense, even when it comes to agreeing with a murderous dictator`s very dim view of a former vice president, is something we have never seen before.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: It is unprecedented, it is worth noting.</p><p>It is also worth noting the president has also punched at Bill de Blasio in tweets, right?</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: He is taking all kind of shots. He mentioned Beto O`Rourke recently again.</p><p>This is -- he is thinking -- President Trump is thinking a lot about 2020, and he is filtering almost everything through that political prism.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: And so should we see more of this now? I know Amy mentioned...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: Of course we`re going to see more of this.</p><p>This is part of the show. And you know what? Those insults worked for him last time. People kept talking about the insults, which meant they were talking about him. They were not talking about policy, necessarily. They weren`t talking about what the candidates stood for, what Hillary Clinton stood for in that case, or the 16 people on stage with him before that on the Republican side.</p><p>And so President Trump knows what he thought worked last time. He`s going to do it again.</p><p>AMY WALTER: That`s right, though, this time, he is the sitting president of the United States. So that is a very different perch from which to do the name-calling.</p><p>And it`s part of the reason, I think, that he is struggling with his approval rating in the low to mid-40s, because people see that he is not acting presidential.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Still several months to go before the first votes are even cast.</p><p>AMY WALTER: Yes.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Amy Walter, Tamara Keith, good to see you both.</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: Good to see you.</p><p>AMY WALTER: Thank you.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Stay with us.</p><p>Coming up on the \"NewsHour\": Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton on the military guard unit older than the Constitution; in Wyoming, a look at the benefits and challenges of a one-room school; and a new way to experience art at Dartmouth`s Hood Museum.</p><p>Long after they come home, many troops continue to face battles with post-traumatic stress disorder. Some of them find that traditional therapy programs are not enough, and instead seek different programs and medicine than before.</p><p>Special correspondent Mike Cerre reports on the new ways former soldiers are now fighting to overcome their trauma.</p><p>MIKE CERRE: After three tours of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, veterans of Fox Company, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, known as FOX 2/5, thought their wars were over.</p><p>But their fight has followed them home. More members of their unit have since died from suicide than from combat, as they continue to battle PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorders, from their service.</p><p>Former Corporal William Yellowhair was the unit`s third and most recent suicide.</p><p>CPL. WILLIAM YELLOWHAIR, U.S. Marine Corps: I like to know what we`re going into, what we`re getting into, what kind of operations we`re going to be doing.</p><p>MIKE CERRE: Despite more than a decade of in- and out-patient treatment at the VA hospital in Prescott, Arizona, William Yellowhair`s body was found in his garage next to his service duffel bag and pictures of his Iraq service.</p><p>As an embedded reporter with FOX 2/5 on two of their tours of duty in Iraq, and following up with them over the years, many of them have shared their difficulties with varying degrees of PTSD and the different treatments they have tried, with mixed results.</p><p>KAINE MARZOLA, Former U.S. Marine: I felt extremely isolated because I couldn`t relate to anybody.</p><p>MIKE CERRE: Kaine Marzola, highlighted here fighting from a rooftop in Ramadi, Iraq, was first diagnosed with PTSD while still in the Marines. After his discharge, he was treated at his local VA hospital near Las Vegas.</p><p>KAINE MARZOLA: When they started to giving me all the medications, I lost all of that. I lost what made me special, what made me different, what made me stand out amongst my peers. I just was a zombie. I didn`t care. Didn`t have a fight, no more fight left in me.</p><p>MIKE CERRE: Frustrated by the traditional PTSD drug and therapy protocols, he created one of his own based on an intense physical training to regain what he calls his fighting spirit.</p><p>CPL. MICHAEL ELLIOT (RET.), U.S. Marine Corps: Seeing things out here, being part of a war, part of history, it has impacted us all in different aspects, I think. Definitely, it`s changed my life forever. I won`t go back to the States the same.</p><p>MIKE CERRE: After coming home, former corporal Michael Elliot was initially reluctant to get treated for his PTSD.</p><p>CPL. MICHAEL ELLIOT: I hit rock bottom. I got a DUI for drinking. Quit my job that I had here, a little short-term job. I was just like, this is not me. Something is wrong. I need help.</p><p>MIKE CERRE: He confessed to driving to the VA Hospital in Helena, Montana, for nearly a year, and sitting in the parking lot, before mustering the courage to share his problems with professionals.</p><p>CPL. MICHAEL ELLIOT: It`s a safe place. It`s a place where people are actually here to help you. And a lot of time, out in the community, your family and things like that, you feel like you don`t want to complain with your story or your issues to people.</p><p>MIKE CERRE: According to the VA, nearly 10 percent to 20 percent of recent combat veterans, and 15 percent of Vietnam era veterans, are experiencing some degree of PTSD. Together, they account for nearly 20 percent of the VA`s patients.</p><p>Most experts agree that psychotherapy programs is the most effective long-term treatment. The problem, it`s not easy or readily accessible to veterans when they need it in their daily lives.</p><p>DR. THOMAS NEYLAN, San Francisco VA Hospital: Well, some of it has to do with the nature of PTSD, and that is that people with PTSD try to avoid memories and things that remind them of their experiences.</p><p>MIKE CERRE: Dr. Thomas Neylan, head of San Francisco VA Hospital`s PTSD clinic, understands FOX 2/5 and other veterans` complaints with existing PTSD treatments. Namely, cognitive therapy can take months of emotional sessions discussing their trauma, which can be too difficult and time-consuming to complete.</p><p>The prescribed antidepressant medications mostly treat PTSD symptoms, rather than the underlying problems.</p><p>DR. THOMAS NEYLAN: These medications have side effects. Sexual side effects is really common, sedation, insomnia, and there`s a host of them. And yes, the medicines are better than they used to be, but no one`s happy with the current status.</p><p>MIKE CERRE: What are some of things you`re looking at to maybe make the cognitive therapy easier or more accessible?</p><p>DR. THOMAS NEYLAN: There`s been a lot of effort to sort of optimize cognitive therapies, to speed them up, to telescope them into a shorter period of time.</p><p>MIKE CERRE: The VA is also using teleconferencing to make the therapy more accessible and convenient, and developing mobile apps to help vets deal with their PTSD crises wherever they might emerge.</p><p>WOMAN: Welcome the body. Shift back to that feeling of calm tranquility.</p><p>DR. KAREN SEAL, San Francisco VA Hospital: We can recommend some complementary integrative therapies that are known to reduce stress and have some preliminary evidence for PTSD, such as yoga or mindfulness meditation or acupuncture.</p><p>MIKE CERRE: Dr. Karen Seal, the director of the San Francisco VA`s integrated care clinic, believes many of these complimentary treatments the VA is now offering can reduce the dependence on prescribed drugs.</p><p>Many veterans are relying on recreational drugs for their symptoms, which the VA can`t prescribe, like marijuana, and MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, which is further along in the clinical trials and more promising for treating the underlying causes of PTSD, according to the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies, conducting the research.</p><p>MAN: This is the time for the supplemental dose, if you want to take it.</p><p>MAN: Sure, why not?</p><p>REBECCA MATTHEWS, Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies: Cannabis only works in symptom reduction, is the hypothesis. And with MDMA, we believe, is that it can actually cure PTSD, with the way it works in the brain and the way that the neuroplasticity and the relearning and reconsolidation of the memories.</p><p>MIKE CERRE: MDMA taken alone is not believed to be a silver bullet cure. Therapy is still required and experts warn against taking MDMA and other psychedelics for PTSD without professional assistance.</p><p>SAL \"DOC\" CHAVEZ, Former U.S. Navy Soldier: About a week ago, I had a sniper came real close. You never know out here. An IED, we used to -- I guess the first couple months, we saw them every day.</p><p>MIKE CERRE: Sal Chavez, a former Navy corpsman with FOX 2/5, has tried several therapy programs, both at the VA and in private practice. He believes his 15-year struggle with PTSD is responsible for his excessive drinking, fighting, divorce, and frequent thoughts of suicide.</p><p>DR. SKIP RIZZO, Clinical Psychologist: We`re seeing people that end up killing themselves because they never got the treatment, or the treatment was ineffective in addressing their needs.</p><p>MIKE CERRE: Dr. Skip Rizzo, a research psychologist at USC`s Institute for Creative Technologies, has been developing virtual reality programs for engaging this generation of PTSD veterans in exposure therapy.</p><p>DR. SKIP RIZZO: The goal isn`t that just by going back to the scene of the crime, you`re magically going to get fixed. The goal is, is to activate those emotions and reprocess them, and to do it repeatedly and in that safe context.</p><p>MIKE CERRE: With the help of Dr. Todd Adamson, a former VA therapist, Sal Chavez agreed to reexperience a particularly traumatic event we both were involved in during a roadside ambush on FOX 2/5`s final approach to Baghdad, when they suffered their first fatalities, on April 4, 2003.</p><p>SAL \"DOC\" CHAVEZ: Everything was on fire. It was loud. Rounds were going off, Matech being shot off. You could feel the percussions of all the explosions.</p><p>MAN: How do you feel in your body right now that you`re watching this?</p><p>SAL \"DOC\" CHAVEZ: A little tense. I know that this is a virtual world, but I`m like -- my habits are doing what I`m supposed to be doing.</p><p>MAN: Yes.</p><p>MIKE CERRE: V.R. can never be an exact representation, but it`s stimulating enough for the vet and the therapist to work together more efficiently and to make the traumatic experiences easier to deal with.</p><p>SAL \"DOC\" CHAVEZ: So I had to find it within me to start making the hard choices of facing myself, finding help, doing whatever I had to do to get healthy again.</p><p>MIKE CERRE: Kaine Marzola is working with other vets on overcoming their PTSD problems. And Michael Elliot is getting his master`s degree in social work to do the same, as the Marines of FOX 2/5 continue their battles with PTSD.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Mike Cerre reporting from San Francisco.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Also in honor of this Memorial Day, Judy Woodruff introduces us to one of the country`s oldest and most elite army units.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Arlington National Cemetery is widely known as the final resting place for men and women who served in our nation`s military. But less is known about the Old Guard.</p><p>That is the Army`s oldest active-duty regiment, primarily tasked with performing funerals there for our country`s fallen heroes.</p><p>Senator Tom Cotton, a veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, wrote about the Old Guard and his experience serving with that elite unit in his new book, \"Sacred Duty: A Soldier`s Tour at Arlington National Cemetery.\"</p><p>And Senator Cotton joins me now.</p><p>Welcome to the \"NewsHour.\"</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): Thank you, Judy.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot of people know you as the senator, as we said, from Arkansas. You`re known to be a committed conservative.</p><p>But this is a book about the work you did as a member of the military. You served for 16 months. Tell us about the Old Guard and tell us why you wanted to write about them.</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON: \"Sacred Duty\" is the story of the Old Guard.</p><p>I play a very small part in that story. I was there for 16 months in 2007-2008. But the Old Guard is literally the Old Guard of the Army. It was stood up in 1784. And for 160 years, it fought our nation`s major conflicts. But for the last 71 years, it`s been the Army`s official ceremonial unit at Arlington National Cemetery.</p><p>I knew when I served there that it was a special place. It was a genuine honor for me to perform those missions in Arlington.</p><p>But once I got into Congress, I really appreciated just what a special place Arlington has in the hearts of our fellow citizens. Arkansans come to visit me all the time in Washington. And they usually see the sights, and I ask them their favorite stop was.</p><p>And they almost always say Arlington National Cemetery. And I think so many Americans have that feeling as well. And no one`s ever told the story of the Old Guard.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Tell us about the work that they do. How is it different from what other service members do?</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON: Most Army regiments are training for their mission, which is performed overseas, defending our country, or they are already overseas performing that mission.</p><p>But the Old Guard is performing its core mission, military honor funerals and ceremonies, every single day in Arlington National Cemetery and in the capital region. And it`s a very demanding operational tempo. Soldiers take two to three months before they`re even trained and certified to perform that mission, because everything the Old Guard does lives up to a single, simple standard, perfection, because there are no do-overs in Arlington National Cemetery.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Meaning you do a funeral...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON: So, we performed, when I was there and still today, up to 20 or 30 funerals a day. That means an individual soldier or his team could do six or seven funerals in a day.</p><p>But every funeral is unique, because, for the family, that`s a once- in-a-lifetime moment. And it`s a lifetime in the making. And we took that into the cemetery, focusing on how the family saw those funerals. And we wanted to make sure that everything we did was absolutely perfect, so they would not have anything that marred their memory of laying their loved one to rest, and so that they could go through the grieving process while we paid the honors.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you make it perfect? Talk about some of the things that each member of the Old Guard has to do and how to get right over and over again.</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON: Yes.</p><p>So, just take the uniforms. I mean, every Old Guard company has large industrial presses in its barracks, just like you might see at a dry cleaning store. And it takes hours and hours and hours to get those perfect razor-sharp creases into the sleeves of your jacket or into the creases of your pants.</p><p>It can take, like I say, two to three months to learn the individual skills of how to march wearing steel-plated shoes, or the collective skills of how a casket team folds a flag into a perfect triangle on a minute-and- 55-second schedule exactly, or how a seven-man firing party makes seven rifles sound like one during that three-volley salute.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And you open describing how precise it is, on the Thursday before Memorial Day, when you`re placing the flag, the small American flag at each grave.</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON: So, last Thursday was Flags In, in Arlington National Cemetery, a tradition that goes back now into its eighth decade.</p><p>Old Guard soldiers take off their ceremonial blue uniforms as the last funerals of the day wind down, put on their combat fatigues, and march into the cemetery carrying between them 245,000 American flags, and they put a flag in front of every grave.</p><p>And the standard is very precise, vertical and perpendicular to the headstone. And the way you size it out is, you use your foot. So you put your toe to the headstone, you plant the flag at the heel. That means only one soldier can do each row, because you can`t have my size 14 feet matched to another soldier`s size 8 feet, because everything, again, is designed to achieve that standard of perfection.</p><p>So over these last four days, as thousands of Americans have visited Arlington National Cemetery, they see those flags perfectly aligned. And they know that, in the last four days, every single person who`s laid the rest in Arlington has had one of today`s soldiers come by and remind them that they are not forgotten.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Why does it matter so much? Why is it so important to get it exactly right?</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON: Yes, it`s not just about honoring the fallen and their families. It`s also about sending the message to today`s Americans that we don`t forget our warriors, and that we will treat all of today`s soldiers in the exact same fashion.</p><p>One story I tell in the book comes from Sergeant Major of the Army Dan Dailey. He was escorting a foreign military leader through Arlington. And he was telling him a little bit about the Old Guard and what they do in Arlington.</p><p>And he said that foreign military leader, without turning away from the window, looking at all those headstones, said: \"Now I know why your soldiers fight so hard. You treat your dead better than we treat our living.\"</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And how are they chosen? How do the Army services choose these individuals?</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON: Well, the Old Guard performs a very sensitive and very prominent mission.</p><p>It`s the face of the Army to the family and the cemetery. It`s the face of the Army to the world. So they recruit only the top-notch soldiers. It`s a volunteer regiment. Many of the officers and noncommissioned officers have to apply, because they have very strict height and weight standards, physical fitness standards.</p><p>It gets some of the smartest soldiers in the Army, according to the Army`s general intelligence test, no legal blemishes in your background, or no character issues as well, because they know that the Old Guard soldier is going to have to operate in a very decentralized fashion, without much oversight from senior leaders, often performing very sensitive missions.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And you write about how they can`t show any emotion. They`re standing virtually all day long.</p><p>But, inside, that has to be hard. I mean, funeral after funeral?</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON: Yes.</p><p>So we`re trying to maintain ceremonial composure, whether it`s at a ceremony for, say, a retiring general officer, or at a funeral in Arlington National Cemetery. And that`s because our job is not to grieve. Our job is to honor.</p><p>That doesn`t mean we don`t grieve the loss of our fallen comrades, but it`s -- our primary job is to honor him or her and honor their families. Some of those families are grieving in a very clear and manifest way. I mean, some of them lost their loved one just a couple of weeks earlier in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p>And when you`re standing near that grave, and you see a mother and a father who have lost a child, and a widow or widower, and young children who may not understand what is going on, that`s an image you can`t forget. But it`s also something that you have to put aside in the moment, so you can focus on your role, which is honoring that fallen hero.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: How does it strike you that you are one of the few current members of Congress who`ve served in the military, and I believe the only one who`s performed this duty?</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON: Well, we`re at something of a historic low point in the Congress, in part because our nation moved to an all-volunteer force about 40 years ago.</p><p>I do think that, as my generation of veterans ages and gets into our 40s and 50s in the coming years, we will see more in Congress, because the same kind of respect and reverence you see for our fallen heroes in Arlington, I think, you also see for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines all around the country who are serving.</p><p>And I think that`s a good thing. That doesn`t mean we all have the same political views. Far from it. But I do think it`s a good thing that we will be seeing more veterans in Congress in the years ahead.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Tom Cotton.</p><p>The book is \"Sacred Duty: A Soldier`s Tour at Arlington National Cemetery.\"</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON: Thank you.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Many small schools across the country have closed in recent years due to state funding issues and population shifts.</p><p>But in rural Wyoming, one school with just six students has so far survived.</p><p>From our Student Reporting Labs at Cody High School, senior Mason Baum reports.</p><p>MASON BAUM: This is Valley Elementary School in the Absaroka Mountains of Northern Wyoming. This is an area so remote, students have to do weekly bear drills.</p><p>MICHELLE DEAN, Teacher: Bear, bear!</p><p>MASON BAUM: Literally, these are drills to protect them from bears coming up to the school.</p><p>Michelle Dean is the school`s primary teacher.</p><p>MICHELLE DEAN: There`s abundant wildlife amongst us because we`re so close to Yellowstone National Park.</p><p>HALLIE ROBINSON, Student: Like, at nighttime, we will have lions come down the front, and bears.</p><p>MORIAH DEAN, Student: I`m scared of bears, mountain lions, and sometimes bugs.</p><p>MASON BAUM: Valley Elementary is a K-5 school. It currently serves only six students, making it one of the country`s smallest public schools.</p><p>MICHELLE DEAN: This is an essential school. The school is part of the community. It`s a historic landmark. This is where the community comes together, and it`s part of our culture.</p><p>MASON BAUM: All of the kids at Valley Elementary live on nearby ranches.</p><p>BRANDON ROBINSON, Manager, Majo Ranch: But when we come home from school, the kids will help us with whatever chores we have here at the ranch or maybe a project that I`m working on.</p><p>MASON BAUM: Brandon Robinson manages the Majo Ranch. His children, Blake and Hallie, attend Valley Elementary.</p><p>BRANDON ROBINSON: We`re too far from town to send them to town. We moved up here seven years ago because of the Valley School, and we`d have a really neat setting for our kids to go to school through the fifth grade.</p><p>MASON BAUM: When Valley Elementary first opened 100 years ago, there were roughly 200,000 one-room-schoolhouses like it across the country. Now there are only about 200 remaining.</p><p>Jillian Balow is the Wyoming superintendent of public instruction. She explains how the state funds small schools like valley.</p><p>JILLIAN BALOW, Wyoming Superintendent of Public Instruction: Wyoming spends between $15,000 to $18,000 per student per year in K-12 education. Among the top in the nation and maybe unique to Wyoming is our funding model that recaptures money from our wealthy districts and redistributes those to school districts that we call entitlement districts.</p><p>MASON BAUM: The news organization called Education Week recently graded all 50 states in two key categories of school finance, overall spending and equity. Wyoming received the best grade in the nation.</p><p>JILLIAN BALOW: Well, we see states across the nation looking to us to replicate their own state funding model.</p><p>No matter the zip code, no matter the size of the community, no matter where the student is from, or traveling to the school each day, and no matter what your socioeconomic status is, in Wyoming, we certainly, certainly believe and are committed to making sure that every student has access to a quality education.</p><p>MICHELLE DEAN: The advantages of teaching a one-room classroom is seeing the multi-age model working. It`s very amazing. It`s actually quite magical.</p><p>I have more flexibility here to meet the needs of my students and to give them a real-life learning experience outside the classroom, and just to bridge that community and the school together.</p><p>MASON BAUM: What do you want to be when you grow up?</p><p>GRACE KLEINMAN, Student: I want to be a veterinarian.</p><p>BLAKE ROBINSON, Student: When I grow up, I`m going to live in a cabin on the mountains and I want to work for a ranch.</p><p>MASON BAUM: After graduating from elementary school, students will have to travel an hour or more for middle school and high school. The transition can be jarring.</p><p>Thomas Lawler went to Valley. He is now a sophomore at Cody High School.</p><p>THOMAS LAWLER, Student: I didn`t have anyone coming from my school going into middle school, so I was just kind of alone.</p><p>I made friends pretty quick, but getting thrown in with nothing is kind of scary. It was really overwhelming to having only me as a fifth grader and like five other kids to having over, like, 100 kids in my grade alone, and then walking through the halls and going to different classes and having different teachers. It was definitely a big change.</p><p>MASON BAUM: How did Valley prepare you, or not prepare you, for the future?</p><p>THOMAS LAWLER: Valley, it was a big part of my life, and it kind of made me who I am, in a way, because it kind of forced me to be a better person because I couldn`t stray off, and I had individual attention.</p><p>MASON BAUM: Valley students prepare for middle school by taking field trips with other schools.</p><p>MICHELLE DEAN: Well, we tour the middle school, and the middle school teachers are great. They reach out to me, and we talk about the strengths and needs of each of our fifth grade students that are getting ready to go.</p><p>HALLIE ROBINSON: I don`t want to go to middle school.</p><p>MASON BAUM: Are you scared of it?</p><p>HALLIE ROBINSON: No, I just like elementary a lot.</p><p>MASON BAUM: A lot of small schools around the country face the threat of closure, but the Valley community is hopeful that Wyoming`s commitment to its rural schools will last at least another generation, so they can focus on the more immediate threat: grizzly bears and mountain lions.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour\"`s Student Reporting Labs, I`m Mason Baum in Cody, Wyoming.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Well, spring classes at Dartmouth College are about to end. And, this term, students have had the opportunity to explore a revitalized museum right on campus.</p><p>From PBS station WGBH in Boston, Jared Bowen has our story.</p><p>It`s part of series on arts and culture called Canvas.</p><p>JARED BOWEN: Just off the green of Dartmouth College in New Hampshire is the campus` Hood Museum of Art. Newly renovated and expanded, it beckons once again. But this is not the same old.</p><p>JOHN STOMBERG, Director, Hood Museum of Art: Be prepared for surprise.</p><p>JARED BOWEN: During the Hood`s three years of construction, John Stomberg had a chance most museum directors never get. While the Hood was closed and empty, he and his team entirely reimagined the way we experience art.</p><p>JOHN STOMBERG: We have many of the old favorites, but they`re scattered in a different way. Our overall goal was to change the way the story of art is told.</p><p>JARED BOWEN: This is where you enter the museum, in a gallery dominated by a sprawling work of art you have probably never seen by a contemporary artist you have probably haven`t heard of.</p><p>JOHN STOMBERG: A lot of us know, who are the major artists today? But there are thousands more artists who make great artwork. So, let`s open that up a little bit and bring more people into the conversation.</p><p>So, for example, the painting that I`m standing in front of is by the major Nigerian modernist, Obiora Udechukwu. And yet that`s not a household name. The painting is amazing.</p><p>JARED BOWEN: Stomberg says he`s inverted the museum experience, changing where and how you will find particular art and artists.</p><p>He`s already done what the Museum of Modern Art in New York recently announced it`s about to do. You will still find Renaissance art here and the blockbuster artists like Picasso, but they`re on the fringes of the museum, no longer center stage.</p><p>JOHN STOMBERG: In the core of the museum, you`re going to find international or global contemporary art. All through the center of the museum, we`re looking at the art of today, the art of now. We like to think of the Hood as a responsive museum, responsive to the world.</p><p>JARED BOWEN: Is there a risk in doing what you have done? It`s very unconventional.</p><p>JOHN STOMBERG: The risk is actually to tradition. So, are we risking tradition? Absolutely. But is that a role for an arts presenting agency? Absolutely.</p><p>JULIETTE BIANCO, Deputy Director, Hood Museum of Art: This is our gallery of indigenous Australian art, and it`s from a major gift to the museum from about 10 years ago.</p><p>JARED BOWEN: Juliette Bianco is the Hood`s deputy director and a Dartmouth graduate who spent her formative years here, and says there`s freedom in being a college museum, where experimentation is welcome with a fresh flow of ideas from students who constantly cycle through and curate shows.</p><p>JOHN STOMBERG: They came up with an amazing idea, consent. It`s clearly a big issue on campus. It`s clearly a big issue across the country. And it is, of course, a founding issue in photography.</p><p>JULIETTE BIANCO: Incorporating student voices not only into the interpretation of our objects, but also into the decisions about which objects to add, how to interpret them, how to display them, if we should display them or not.</p><p>JARED BOWEN: In this inaugural exhibition, students consider the issue of consent in myriad forms, like the agency a young soldier has, or doesn`t have, in hazing rituals, or whether the work of secretive photographer Vivian Maier should be produced. She kept it hidden away.</p><p>JOHN STOMBERG: We can have these conversations. If we can`t have these conversations in a museum, where are we going to have these conversations?</p><p>JARED BOWEN: Here, they will be ongoing. With more than 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest university collections in the country. Stomberg wants as much of that work as possible on view, which means rotating some galleries as quickly as every three months.</p><p>JOHN STOMBERG: One of the things that everybody is going to experience is how works of art change by the company they keep.</p><p>JARED BOWEN: The museum doesn`t charge for admission, and that impacts Hood`s design.</p><p>JOHN STOMBERG: Spend 10 minutes, spend two hours, it`s up to you, whatever is comfortable. One of the things that I love about a museum that`s free is that you can come in and look at one work of art. You can come in and spend an afternoon with friends. It`s totally variable. And so there`s no one way to see the museum.</p><p>JARED BOWEN: Except that, at the Hood, there`s always with a view to the outside world.</p><p>I`m Jared Bowen of WGBH reporting for the \"PBS NewsHour\" in Hanover, New Hampshire.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: And that`s the \"NewsHour\" for tonight.</p><p>On Tuesday, we will look at an effort to expand the diversity of teachers in public schools.</p><p>Until then, I`m Amna Nawaz.</p><p>Join us online and again here tomorrow evening. For all of us at the \"PBS NewsHour,\" thank you. We`ll see you soon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSHR-2019052701cb112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSHR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W6R-JT51-JB20-G13B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152462</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8892\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MacNeil/Lehrer Productions All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>PBS NewsHour (formerly The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 27, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I`m Judy Woodruff.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the \"NewsHour\" tonight: As the U.S. reaches 100,000 deaths from COVID- 19, we talk to Dr. Anthony Fauci and the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, about the ongoing response on both the health front and the economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then: a call for change. Despite the pandemic, large protests erupt in Minnesota following the police-involved death of George Floyd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus: the question of child care. With essential workers required on the job, how to nurture the next generation.</p><p>LYNETTE FRAGA, Executive Director, Child Care Aware of America: Child care around the United States prior to the pandemic was already challenged and really fractured. Now that we`re in the context of the pandemic, it is really breaking.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more on tonight`s \"PBS NewsHour.\"</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: The coronavirus pandemic has reached a fearsome new number tonight: 100,000 lives lost in the United States.</p><p>It is more than all the American dead in the Korean conflict and the Vietnam War combined.</p><p>Lisa Desjardins begins our coverage of this day`s events.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: The U.S. death toll has now reached staggering highs, but, every day, more communities are moving to reopen for business.</p><p>In Orange, California, Stacy Hewett is getting ready to reopen her salon and spa, with a new check-in for customers.</p><p>STACY HEWETT, Owner, Synergy Salon and Spa: Their temperature will be taken. They will be handed a handout on our protocols that will be implemented in the salon. Their hands will be sanitized, and they will be escorted back to their seat.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: In neighboring Nevada, casinos will be back up and running June 4, after a 10-week shutdown. Florida`s tourism industry is hopeful about July, after Disney announced plans to reopen some of its Orlando theme parks July 11, with requirements for face masks, temperature checks and social distance.</p><p>And in Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser announced she will lift the district`s stay-at-home order Friday.</p><p>MURIEL BOWSER (D), Mayor of Washington, D.C.: So, as we begin reopening, it cannot be said enough that every single one of us has a role to play in protecting ourselves and each other.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: But it wasn`t business as usual on Capitol Hill today.</p><p>The House of Representatives allowed proxy voting for the first time in its 231-year history. Lawmakers could ask another member to cast their vote for them.</p><p>MAN: I inform the House that he will vote yay.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: House Republicans have filed a lawsuit arguing the procedure is unconstitutional.</p><p>House Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney:</p><p>REP. LIZ CHENEY (D-WY): So, instead of going down the path of saying, how can we do this together, the Democrats have adopted a completely partisan scheme, and they have done it in a way that absolutely infringes on the rights of the minority and infringes on the Constitution.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: While the U.S. looks to reopen, COVID-19 cases are spiking around the world, including in previous hot spots.</p><p>South Korea reported its highest number of new cases in weeks. Many of the infections were linked to an outbreak at an e-commerce warehouse.</p><p>KIM KANG LIP, South Korean Vice Minister of Health and Welfare (through translator): We are very nervous about community infections, and we are keeping a close eye on the situation. We are doing our best to prevent the further spread of infection through fast contact tracing and testing.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: India logged a new record number of daily infections as well, as its overall caseload topped 150,000. And with coronavirus cases surging across Latin America, hospitals in Brazil, Mexico, and Chile are struggling to keep up with the huge influx in patients.</p><p>Meanwhile, hospitals in France will no longer use the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. The country banned it after a study found it wasn`t effective and posed serious health risks, this as the European Union unveiled an $825 billion fund help its 25 member states rebuild their struggling economies.</p><p>URSULA VON DER LEYEN, President, European Commission (through translator): Tomorrow, the cost of inaction in this crisis will be much more expensive. This is about laying the foundations for our future together and, at the same time, to react appropriately to a clearly defined, extraordinary crisis situation, through no fault of our own.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: They`re not alone. Japan, the world`s third largest economy, injected one trillion more dollars into its economy to help bounce back from its recession. The move effectively doubles the country`s stimulus spending.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Lisa Desjardins.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: As we said, the U.S. has just passed a grim milestone in the number of deaths.</p><p>I had a chance to talk about this, where we stand in the battle against COVID, and how to reopen safely with Dr. Anthony Fauci. He is one of the leading public health voices in the country and a key member of the president`s pandemic task force.</p><p>Dr. Tony Fauci, thank you for joining us. We welcome you.</p><p>As the United States today nears 100,000 deaths, that terrible toll, what are your thoughts about that?</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases: Well, obviously, we have been put through a very terrible ordeal, in many respects, that`s historic, Judy.</p><p>But I look forward about the kinds of things that we can do, you know, to contain this, both from a public health standpoint and marshaling all of the resources of science that we have.</p><p>So, we`re in a situation. We have been through a lot. Things will, I believe, improve, as we start to see the diminution in cases in many areas, although, disturbingly, there are still some areas in which cases are going up.</p><p>I think, if we continue to pull together as a nation, doing the kinds of things to mitigate the spread, as well as, at the same time, as we try to gradually and prudently try to reopen the country to a little bit more normality -- we have taken a terrible hit; 100,000 people is just really historic in the public health impact it`s had on us.</p><p>But, you know, it`s a challenge. And this country, as I say often, has been through some really challenging, terrible times, you know, World Wars, depressions, 9/11. This falls in that category. You know, we have got to pull together as a nation to get over this.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned opening up, and parts of the country are opening up fast. I mean, the state of Georgia opened, what, over three weeks ago, other states opening up all over the country.</p><p>Is it necessarily the case that we are going to see outbreaks where there have been moves to open up quickly?</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, first of all, there`s a wide range of how individual states, cities and counties have opened up.</p><p>For those who have opened up in a way that has been strictly according to the guidelines of the gateway, the phase one, the phase two, even at that approach, there are going to be cases that you`re going to see blips.</p><p>That`s inevitable, and people should not be surprised at that. The real critical issue, Judy, is how you respond to that, how you can have the resources in place to be able to identify, isolate, contact trace, so a blip doesn`t become a surge.</p><p>For those who have actually gone and leaped over a couple of the benchmarks that they needed to pass I mean, obviously, I have said and I continue to say that we need to be prudent and careful and not to, in the sense, go prematurely into an area where we should wait a little bit more.</p><p>But for those that have already done it -- and we have seen it on television -- my advice is, there are certain fundamental, basic things that, no matter what stage you`re at, you need to do it. And that`s things like wearing masks, staying physically distant--</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: -- avoiding crowds, washing hands. Those are things you should do no matter what.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And my question is, in those places that have opened up, is it going to be enough to wash hands, wear the mask, keep socially distanced?</p><p>Because we also are hearing if there is not testing available -- you mentioned contact tracing, but testing. The administration this week said it`s up to the states. As you know, Dr. Fauci, a number of experts say that`s not enough; we need more of a national strategy.</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Yes.</p><p>Well, Judy, what`s happening right now -- and we were just at a meeting down at the White House yesterday, one of our meetings, where we went over with several of the governors the kinds of things that are in place. The testing is getting better and better and better.</p><p>I mean, I have always been publicly skeptical about that. But, right now, what I`m seeing is that the kinds of testing availability is getting better and better. And, as the weeks go by, I believe strongly that we`re going to be able to address that.</p><p>But you make a very good point. When I see some of those pictures of how people are congregating, at a time when there are still infections around, that`s not prudent, and that people need to really take a step back and look at that.</p><p>I mean, everybody wants to see us get back to some sort of normality. Everybody wants to open up the country, including an economic rebound. But we need to be really careful that we don`t do it in a way that is, in some respects, stepping over the prudent steps.</p><p>So, that`s the thing I keep advising, and I keep urging people to be really prudent about that.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you`re saying it can be done, even though we`re not going to have a vaccine until the end of this year, at the earliest?</p><p>I mean, even you have said it`s possible. But you`re saying, in the meantime, it is going to be safe for states to open up, as long as they do it carefully?</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: I do think so.</p><p>And I think what will happen -- and I keep saying that -- we do not necessarily have to have a major rebound or, as people say, a second wave, in the fall and in the winter. It will happen if we don`t address it in an appropriate way, because we are going to see blips of cases coming up as we try to tiptoe towards normality.</p><p>My feeling is that, if we put all our efforts into that, we can prevent these blips from becoming a resurgence or a second wave.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And just to clarify on testing, administration is saying 300,000 tests a day is enough. And you`re saying, that`s going to -- that`s going to work?</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: No, no, I`m not, Judy.</p><p>What I`m saying is that the tests that are going to be available are going to go well beyond that. I mean, even though one says it`s going to be enough, if you look at the reality, the way the testing that is going on right now, and the partnering with the industry, is that, as we get into the next several weeks to months, we`re going to have many more tests than that limit that you`re talking about.</p><p>We`re going to go over that.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Vaccine, I want to come back to that very quickly. You have said you think it`s possible by the end of 2020.</p><p>Do you think that`s the most likely scenario?</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: You know, I`m cautiously optimistic about that, Judy, because we have been right now, as I told you, we got -- we jumped into the development of vaccine within days from the time that the sequence was put on the public database.</p><p>We`re well into a phase one with one candidate. But there`s more than one candidates. I mean, I was just on the phone literally 15 minutes ago with the pharmaceutical companies that are involved, that group of four or five that are going to be going into trials at various stages. Some right now are already in. Others will be going in, in the next couple of months.</p><p>We hope to start -- and I think we`re going to do it, Judy -- to start a phase three trial at least with a couple of candidates by early July. If we do that, and we get enough efficacy signals over the summer and into the fall, it is not only conceivable, but I`m cautiously optimistic that we would have a vaccine towards the end of this year and the beginning of next year.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, your best estimate right now, Dr. Fauci, about what life looks like this fall is what, in terms of school, in terms of back to work?</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Right.</p><p>Well, again, it`s very difficult to estimate when you have a moving target like an outbreak. But what I would hope happens is that, as we get into the summer, we will continue to see that leveling off and coming down, because, if you look at the curves for the United States, even though there are some states that are still going up and not plateauing, for the most part, as a nation, we`re starting to come down.</p><p>If that decline continues, and we get to the point in the summer where we`re really very, very low, which is a good baseline to be at, what I see in the fall and the winter is that, as people start to get congregating indoors, and when winter comes, respiratory diseases tend to flourish.</p><p>We are going to have the complication of influenza coming back. I believe that, if we have in place the ability to do that kind of identification, isolation and contact tracing as we see these blips, it is not inevitable that we will have a second wave.</p><p>So, my cautious hope and optimism is that, as we get into the fall, we will be able to control the inevitable return of infection. Anybody that thinks it`s not going to come back in the fall is not being realistic.</p><p>It`s how you handle it that determines whether or not you have a second wave.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Tony Fauci, we always appreciate your joining us. Thank you very much.</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Good to be with you, Judy. Thank you for having me.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Here in Washington, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agree another economic relief package is needed to help struggling Americans deal with the economic fallout caused by the pandemic.</p><p>But Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress are divided over who should receive that help and how much the government should spend.</p><p>Joining us now, the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>Madam Speaker, thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>The American people right now are looking at, if you will, a battle between you and the Democrats, arguing, we need more help for the unemployed, we need more help for those front-line workers employed by state and local governments.</p><p>On the other hand, Republicans saying, we have already spent too much money, a lot of money.</p><p>Where is this headed?</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Well, it`s headed for us to have another package to again honor our heroes, our state and local health care workers, transit workers, first responders, police, fire, emergency services, food servers, teachers, teachers, teachers, you name it, all of our heroes who are on the front line.</p><p>They`re risking their lives to save lives. And now they`re risking their jobs because of the cost of the coronavirus to state governments.</p><p>We`re here for testing, testing, testing, as Dr. Fauci just said, identifying, tracing, treating. We call that testing. And we have a great plan, a strategy to test, with a timetable, with benchmarks, with milestones, with effectiveness, to reach many more people, so that we can identify the size of this challenge, so that we can save lives.</p><p>And then, third, to put money in the pockets of the American people. All of these have had bipartisan support. All of the bills that we have passed had been bipartisan, but they didn`t all start off that way.</p><p>And this -- again, we have made our proposal, as they have made their proposals in the past, and then we negotiate. So, I have -- I`m quite certain that we will have a bill, and it will be a big bill, because to do anything less will cost even more in the future, in terms of lives, livelihood and the life of our democracy.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, with regard to unemployment benefits, for example, the Republicans are saying language that`s in there now, that they say it creates a disincentive for workers.</p><p>Right now, it`s assistance of $600 a week for workers up to four months. Republicans are saying, that`s a reason for people not to want to go back to work.</p><p>Do you see a compromise on this?</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI: Well, again, we will go to -- I`m not going to negotiate -- as much as I love this show, and as much as I`m happy to be with you, that I`m not going to be negotiating here.</p><p>However, I will say this. The $600, really, at a very, very difficult time in the lives of America`s families, losing their jobs, concerned about their health, losing lives and their families, $600 is a small price to pay.</p><p>As we go forward, we will see. Hopefully, the economy will improve, but it won`t improve unless we test, test, test, so that we can open up the economy.</p><p>So, all of this is connected. You just can`t take one piece.</p><p>But they had no trouble giving tax cuts in their bill, CARES 1, CARES Act, they gave a $120 billion tax break to high rollers, hedge funds, real estate high rollers, that was retroactive, had very little to do with the coronavirus. But when it comes to poorer people, they have a reluctance to help out.</p><p>But the best thing we can do, in terms of it being a stimulus to the economy, is to put money in the pockets of the American people with direct payments, with unemployment insurance, with food stamps.</p><p>They are opposed to food stamps, when people are hungry in our country. We have some differences of opinion, and that`s what we will negotiate.</p><p>But I would hope that the great movement in our country on food insecurity, to feed the hungry, will catch fire in the Senate, too, as it has in the country.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: I do want to ask you about something in that CARES Act that you mentioned.</p><p>We learned in a study that was done by the Kaiser Family Foundation that some $72 billion in that legislation that went to hospitals, most of it -- or, I should say, twice as much went to hospitals that are well-endowed, sitting on a lot of cash, money that they have raised, as opposed to the hospitals that serve more of the public.</p><p>So, my question is, is this the kind of thing that Congress can look at? Were you made aware of this? And is there some way to fix it?</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI: Well, we were made aware of it when they dispensed the money.</p><p>And that means, in the next bill that we are doing now, we have prescribed more carefully how it should go out, because they came up with a formula that was very strange, that would go the Medicare-favored hospitals, as opposed to Medicaid.</p><p>It was a strange formula. And now we have to be, again, more prescriptive in how we put out the money, because, in the first CARES Act, they did that. In the second act, which was the interim bill on more PPP, that we put the money in for testing and for hospitals, $175 billion for hospitals, $25 billion for testing, $100 billion for health care, we were more prescriptive as to where this money should go.</p><p>And then, of course, now, in the HEROES Act, we have even learned more about how careful we have to be, and not just leave it up to them to make those decisions, because it really, frankly, had no logic, and really wasn`t meeting the needs of the American people, which is what we`re supposed to be doing.</p><p>But we will work together to come together on that.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So--</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI: We didn`t like what the administration did, but we will, in Congress, correct that.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Several more things to ask you about, Madam Speaker.</p><p>One is, you mentioned testing, coronavirus testing. We know the administration put out a proposal. They`re leaving it up to the states.</p><p>This is what the administration is doing. In the meantime, is there something Congress can do to help the states come up with the testing materials they need?</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI: Well, that`s what our second pillar of our bill is, honor our -- honor our heroes, state and local, helping with state and local to help them with the cost of the coronavirus already in terms of outlays, but also in terms of revenue lost by the states, counties, communities, cities, municipalities.</p><p>The second pillar is testing, testing, testing. What the administration put out this weekend was an insult to the intelligence of the American people and a disservice to the challenge that we`re facing with the coronavirus.</p><p>I don`t know what -- it doesn`t even rise to the level of a notion, much less an idea or a plan.</p><p>But, in our bill, we have a plan with a strategy, as I mentioned, a strategy, a timetable, benchmarks, milestones, and, again, the cultural compatibility that we have among the people who will do the tracing that Dr. Fauci said was so necessary, if we do it right with the second wave.</p><p>If we had done it right with the first wave, we would not be observing 100 (sic) people dying in our country from the coronavirus this very day. It took about 100 days to get here. Hopefully, we can slow that pace as we go forward, testing, tracing, treatment, isolation, if necessary, but identifying it culturally, in terms of the disparity, so many in nursing homes.</p><p>It breaks your heart to think of the high percentage of people who have died in nursing homes, but in terms of the communities of color, far higher percentage of incidents of the coronavirus than in the rest of the population. We have to identify that. We have to fight that. We have to stave those lives.</p><p>But we can`t save the lives if we don`t identify them with testing.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Two other things I want to ask you about, Madam Speaker.</p><p>One is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI: Yes.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: This is something the House is due to vote on.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI: Yes.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump has again said, just in the last few minutes, I`m told, that he will veto it if the House passes it.</p><p>Why should -- why does this matter to the American people?</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI: One of our -- when we take the oath of office, we raise our right hand and we vow, take an oath to protect and defend the American people, the Constitution of the United States.</p><p>And, in doing so, we recognize that our strength is measured many ways, the health, the education, well-being of our children and our families, our military might, so essential, but also the intelligence that protects the force protection, for those who would go risk their lives in the initiation of hostility, to predict what would happen, to protect once they`re there.</p><p>And, so, in -- when I started in intelligence, like 25 years, that`s what it was, force protection. Now it`s so much technology. It`s a whole new world.</p><p>And the FISA is about how we -- how we -- we have to pass a FISA bill in order to protect and defend the American people. We have to have a bill. There are those who say, oh, I don`t like this bill, I don`t like that bill.</p><p>You have to have a bill. Now, the bill we`re taking up today is a bill that 48 of the 53 Republicans in the Senate voted for. It passed 80 -- with 80 votes in the Senate just recently, and now they have sent it over to the House.</p><p>There are some who say, I don`t like this, I don`t like that. And if they don`t want to vote for a bill, then we will just send back our House bill, which isn`t as good as the Senate bill. The Senate bill was very courageous, broke new ground, very, very progressive in terms of protecting the balance between security, privacy, security and civil rights.</p><p>That`s the constant balance that we have to have, and this bill does it very well. So, I would hope people would vote for it. If they don`t, we will send back our original House bill.</p><p>The Senate bill is better. I wish we could do that. Eighty senators, 48 Republicans, voted for it in the Senate. On our House bill, we had two- thirds of the House members who are Republicans vote for our House bill, two-thirds of the Democrats voting for it.</p><p>So, it was bipartisan and veto-proof. But, as I say, the Senate bill is better.</p><p>So, I would hope that we can pass the Senate bill in the House today, send it to the president. If not, we will just send back our House bill, which would be OK, but it`s better if we could pass the Senate bill.</p><p>But these Republicans in the House, in voting against the Senate bill, imagine, they voted against their own vote. They`re countering their own vote, in support of having a check on the FISA system, just because the president told them to.</p><p>How do you protect and defend, except if he says not to?</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Final yes-or-no question, should the Democrats go ahead with an in-person convention this August in Milwaukee?</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI: You know there`s no yes or no.</p><p>At the moment, I would say not yet, because we want to -- people`s health is the most important part of all of it. But let`s just see. God willing, we have a therapy, and, God willing, a vaccine, whatever.</p><p>But from this vantage point, I think all options are on the table. I don`t know. I`m not central to that decision-making. But I think that, until we know that we can do it safely, we shouldn`t go down that path.</p><p>But we will see. And I -- we`re in good hands with Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. We`re proud of our nominee, Joe, Joe Biden. I`m sure they will -- their teams, working together, will do what is right for our country to nominate the next president of the United States, Joe Biden.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, thank you very much.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI: Happy to be with you, Judy, always. Thank you.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day`s other news: The mayor of Minneapolis called for criminal charges against a white policeman, after a black man died in custody.</p><p>George Floyd pleaded he could not breathe when the officer pressed a knee to his neck. Four officers have been fired, but there were new protests overnight. We will get much more after the news summary.</p><p>In Hong Kong, thousands of people protested today against curtailing civil liberties. Police fired pepper pellets and arrested 360 demonstrators, who condemned efforts to outlaw disrespect for China`s national anthem.</p><p>Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared Hong Kong may no longer qualify for special trade benefits.</p><p>We will return to this story as well later in the program.</p><p>President Trump is bashing social media after Twitter slapped fact-check warnings on two of his posts. He had alleged, without proof, that mail-in voting is rife with fraud.</p><p>Today, he accused big tech companies of anti-conservative bias, and warned -- quote -- \"We will strongly regulate or close them down.\"</p><p>Any such action would likely require congressional approval.</p><p>Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has stepped up criticism of the president for refusing to wear a mask in public. The former vice president called Mr. Trump a fool last night.</p><p>Today, he renewed the attack during an event with Pennsylvania`s Governor Tom Wolf.</p><p>JOSEPH BIDEN (D), Presidential Candidate: Wearing one of these masks when you`re outside is not a partisan issue.</p><p>The Secret Service outside my house, they all have a mask on. We don`t talk. We don`t talk unless I walk out with a mask. It is a matter of protecting other people, not just yourself, other people. That`s what this is about.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: On Monday, Biden wore a face mask during a Memorial Day event, and the president retweeted a post that appeared to mock him for it.</p><p>NASA today had to scrub the first launch of astronauts from U.S. soil in nearly a decade. Storms kept two astronauts and their SpaceX rocket stalled at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. They will try again on Saturday to reach the International Space Station. Americans have been hitching rides on Russian spaceships since the last space shuttle flight in 2011.</p><p>Meanwhile, Boeing announced today that it is cutting more than 12,000 jobs from a work force of 160,000. Sales of the company`s jetliners have plummeted during the pandemic. Boeing also said that it has resumed low- level production of the 737 MAX jet, after two fatal crashes grounded the planes last year.</p><p>A tropical storm made landfall near Charleston, South Carolina, today with almost no warning. Bertha came ashore just after forming, and caused minor flooding. It is the second named storm before hurricane season officially starts on June 1.</p><p>On Wall Street, stocks surged again, on hopes for economic revival. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 553 points to close at 25548. The Nasdaq rose 72 points, and the S&amp;P 500 added 44.</p><p>And playwright and pioneering AIDS activist Larry Kramer has died in New York, of pneumonia. He fought for bold action against HIV and for gay rights in the 1980s and `90s.</p><p>Jeffrey Brown looks at his life.</p><p>ACTOR: Have you told the man there`s an epidemic going on?</p><p>ACTOR: Oh, says who?</p><p>ACTOR: The government.</p><p>ACTOR: Which government? What, our government? An epidemic?</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: In \"The Normal Heart,\" his 1985 play and later an HBO film, Larry Kramer wrote of love, agony and anger in the early years of AIDS.</p><p>It was the subject of much of his work as writer and activist. He was a founder of the Gay Men`s Health Crisis, and later the group ACT UP, whose public confrontations demanded attention and urgent action to address the growing AIDS crisis.</p><p>LARRY KRAMER, AIDS Activist: Plague! Forty million infected people is a plague! We are in the worst shape we have ever, ever been in.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: He was passionate, often loud, but he was heard, including when he took on then-prominent AIDS researcher Dr. Anthony Fauci. Kramer labeled Fauci an incompetent idiot.</p><p>The two would later come to mutual respect and even friendship. Today, Fauci, one of the leaders of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, spoke to Judy about Kramer.</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases: I`m very sad that we have lost him. He was just an extraordinary man.</p><p>He changed totally -- by his extraordinary iconoclastic and theatrical ways of doing things, he changed the relationship between the afflicted community with a given disease and the scientific and regulatory community that has such a great impact on them.</p><p>He said, you can`t be separate. You have got to keep us in the tent. We have got to be in there with you.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Kramer dealt with illness for much of his adult life. He was infected with HIV and, separately, liver disease. A novelist, a nonfiction writer as well, at his death, he was working on a new play centered on the current pandemic.</p><p>Larry Kramer was 84 years old.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": protests erupt in Minnesota following the police-involved death of an unarmed black man; Hong Kong reacts to the Chinese government`s attempt to exert greater control; and the challenges of child care in the time of COVID.</p><p>It was a painful night in Minneapolis and a day of difficult questions about the death of George Floyd, his treatment by the police, and the department`s relationship with citizens of color.</p><p>All of this captured tragically on video, when Floyd told the police, \"I can`t breathe.\"</p><p>Amna Nawaz explores those questions.</p><p>But, first, Yamiche Alcindor has this report.</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: In Minneapolis, outrage over the death of George Floyd.</p><p>PROTESTERS: Prosecute the police!</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Yesterday, hundreds gathered to protest his death in police custody on Monday. By nighttime, police used tear gas on crowds, as they were demanding justice in the case.</p><p>Some of the unrest took place at this intersection, where only a day earlier the struggle between Floyd and the officers unfolded.</p><p>A video captured by a bystander shows Floyd being pinned to the ground, as a white police officer kneels on his neck.</p><p>GEORGE FLOYD, Died in Police Custody: I can`t breathe. Please. A knee in my neck.</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Gasping for air, he pleaded, \"I can`t breathe,\" until he appears to lose consciousness.</p><p>The initial police report of the incident did not detail what the cell phone video, which has now gone viral, laid bare. Instead, police said they were responding to a call of forgery and that Floyd physically resisted arrest.</p><p>But a surveillance video obtained by The Washington Post shows the moments leading up to the arrest. In it, Floyd seems to comply. State officials and the FBI are investigating the case. All the four officers at the scene were quickly fired late Tuesday.</p><p>Today, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said he would be requesting that the county attorney file charges against the officer who knelt on Floyd.</p><p>JACOB FREY (D), Mayor of Minneapolis, Minnesota: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail? If you had done it or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now.</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Floyd`s family has called for the four officers to be charged with murder.</p><p>SHAREEDUH TATE, Cousin of George Floyd: Essentially, they executed him in front of us, and we watched his life leaving his body.</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Floyd`s brother Rodney said the late 46-year-old, who was a bouncer at a local restaurant, was deeply loved.</p><p>RODNEY FLOYD, Brother of George Floyd: A great people person. Everyone loves him, if you got a chance to know him. He gives out plenty of good energy, good vibes. He`s happy. He`s smiling all the time.</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: And Floyd`s cousin, Shareeduh Tate, said the officers had failed to see the humanity in him.</p><p>SHAREEDUH TATE: He held no value to them whatsoever. They didn`t care one way or another if he lived or died. And it was clear, because, as he was sitting there begging, begging repeatedly for somebody to hear him say, \"I cannot breathe,\" they just chose to turn and look the other way.</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: The family`s lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said the video is damning.</p><p>BENJAMIN CRUMP, Attorney For Family of George Floyd: So, I think any jury looking at this evidence, this overwhelming evidence, has to say, at some point, when they ignore his pleas, that intent informs.</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: With echoes of the 2014 Eric Garner case in New York, Floyd`s death has drawn condemnation across the country.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Yamiche Alcindor.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Let`s get a view now from a leading voice in the community.</p><p>City Councilwoman Andrea Jenkins is the vice president of the council. She represents the area that includes that corner where the encounter between Floyd and the police occurred. She joins us now.</p><p>Councilwoman Jenkins, welcome to the \"NewsHour.\" And thank you for being with us.</p><p>I want to begin with what you just heard from Mayor Frey. He was unequivocal early today. He said, that officer needs to be charged. Do you agree with him?</p><p>ANDREA JENKINS, Vice President, Minneapolis City Council: Oh, Amna, yes, I absolutely agree with Mayor Frey and his call for charges to be filed against the officer involved.</p><p>And I am calling for all of the officers involved to be investigated. You know, as the mayor said, if you or I had stood by in the commission of a crime, then we would be charged as accomplices.</p><p>And so it was clear to me what we witnessed in that video was a crime. And it was not only a crime against George Floyd, although he suffered the most deep injustice, but, in my mind, it felt like it was a symbol for a knee on the neck of black America.</p><p>The president has loosened the restrictions on the EPA, which we know is creating an issue in black and brown communities all around this country, inhibiting our ability to breathe. The pandemic is impacting black and brown communities disproportionately in regards to access to health care and testing, in regards to employment, in regards to who is dying from this pandemic.</p><p>Sixty percent of all the deaths have been black and brown people. And so it seems like that was a symbol for having -- America having its knee on the necks of black and brown people in this country.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Councilwoman, let me ask you what you`re hearing from your constituents.</p><p>You were at the protest last night. We should mention there are protests again tonight in Minneapolis. If there are no charges in the days or weeks ahead, what do you think the reaction will be?</p><p>ANDREA JENKINS: Well, certainly, there were protests last night.</p><p>And there have been protests all day today, and I have been to two of them already. I believe that we will not get to a place of beginning to think about healing until we have charges against those officers.</p><p>That is the only -- that`s what I`m hearing from my constituents, as you -- your question asks. And that is the sentiment that myself and many of my colleagues, including Mayor Frey, have been calling for. And I believe that we will continue to see unrest, though I am calling for all of my beloved community members to be safe, to understand that we are still in the midst of a pandemic.</p><p>Nothing has changed. There is no vaccine. There is no treatment. And so gathering in groups of 8,000 and 10,000 people, it`s just creating more unnecessary harm to our community members than we have to.</p><p>I understand that people are upset, rightfully so. I support our right to democratic, peaceful protests. However, this is a situation unlike -- it`s unprecedented, as the common phrase has been used to refer to this, and we can`t have the same kinds of protesting that we have had in past years.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Councilwoman, let me ask you.</p><p>I think that we just had a tweet from the president saying the FBI and the Department of Justice are now investigating George Floyd`s death. It`s worth pointing out, too, there have been policy changes in Minneapolis in the past.</p><p>The reason those other officers were fired was because they didn`t intervene when they saw their colleague using excessive force. We only have a minute left, and I apologize, but what else do you think needs to happen now?</p><p>ANDREA JENKINS: So, I`m glad to hear the president has called on the FBI and the Department of Justice to investigate this.</p><p>The police chief here has called on the FBI to get involved. This is about human rights, the violation of human rights. And so what I think needs to be done is, we need a -- to declare an emergency on the other virus that is killing black America, and that is racism.</p><p>And so I hope that the president will condemn the racism that is inherent in our institutions and our systems, particularly our law enforcement and law enforcement communities, and call for a cease of killing of black unarmed people in the United States of America.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: That`s Councilwoman Andrea Jenkins, vice president of the Minneapolis City Council, with us tonight.</p><p>Thank you so much for your time, Councilwoman.</p><p>ANDREA JENKINS: Thank you, Amna. I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you tonight.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn now to a different protest, this time in Asia, where the calls for freedom and justice are just as fierce.</p><p>In Hong Kong, demonstrators have grown increasingly violent, as the threats from China mount.</p><p>Last week, Beijing said that it would make anti-Chinese behavior illegal, a move that is prompting the Trump administration to take action.</p><p>How far will the U.S. go, and what does it all mean?</p><p>Our Nick Schifrin is here to explain.</p><p>So, Nick, hello.</p><p>First of all, tell us about this declaration or statement the administration has made today and the significance of it.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Judy, make no mistake. This statement in this moment in U.S.-China relations and for Hong Kong really could determine the fate of the city as a global financial hub.</p><p>Now, as you know, for 30 years, the U.S. has treated Hong Kong with special status. You and I can go without a visa. Goods can travel without any kind of tariffs. And the U.S. and Hong Kong can make trade deals independent of Beijing.</p><p>And that`s pushed 1,300 American companies to open up shop in Hong Kong. Now, that special status was legislated by the U.S. Congress before the 1997 handover from the United Kingdom to Beijing. And for those freedoms to continue, the law required that the president certify that Hong Kong was sufficiently independent of Beijing.</p><p>And that is what we have seen the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, saying today in this statement: \"I certified to Congress today that Hong Kong does not continue to warrant treatment under U.S. laws in the same manner as U.S. laws were applied to Hong Kong before 1997. No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground.\"</p><p>Now, what are those facts on the ground? As you mentioned in the introduction, pro-democracy advocates say that Beijing has systematically eroded all of the freedoms that they have enjoyed in Hong Kong, and they launched the city`s largest protests we have ever seen beginning last year.</p><p>But in those protests, Beijing saw something very different. Beijing saw a -- quote -- \"weak link\" in Chinese national security and a way for -- quote -- \"foreign forces\" -- translation, the United States -- to threaten Beijing.</p><p>And so that`s why we have seen this new national security legislation expected to be passed out of Beijing in the next couple hours. What it does is -- quote -- \"ban acts of secession, subverting state power and organizing and carrying out terrorist activities\" and bans interference in Hong Kong`s eternal -- internal affairs by external forces.</p><p>That is obviously very vague language that pro-democracy forces say could be used to further erode their freedoms. And that`s why we saw another protest today out in the streets, thousands of Hong Kong residents protesting for their rights. More than 300 were arrested, but they say they`re going to continue that protest.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Nick, given all this, what are the Trump administration`s options from this point on?</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Yes.</p><p>So, the declaration today doesn`t trigger anything automatic. So, senior administration officials say there is a robust debate inside the administration on how far to go.</p><p>And those who are advocating for an aggressive response say this, that there needs to be sanctions of senior government officials, Communist Party officials, known as the CCP, and their families, and also to end Hong Kong`s special economic and travel treatment.</p><p>That would include imposing tariffs, visa restrictions, and could leave U.S. businesses to leave the city. And the argument there is that sanctions could impact the people right around Xi Jinping and put pressure on him. And, also, ending special status would also hurt Beijing, because Beijing benefits from all of the international capital that goes through Hong Kong.</p><p>So, take a listen to Dan Blumenthal of the American Enterprise Institute.</p><p>DANIEL BLUMENTHAL, American Enterprise Institute: You have to put a lot of pressure on Xi Jinping and his closest coterie, also because there`s an internal backlash against him inside the CCP because of his various mishaps, not least of which is COVID-19 reaction and approach.</p><p>And so you have to create enough of a backlash that, inside China, it pressures him to reverse course, and I think that`s doable.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: And that, critics say, is ineffective and self-defeating.</p><p>They say that tariffs and sanctions don`t work, would hurt those U.S. businesses in Hong Kong, and any visa restrictions would actually hurt the pro-democracy advocates who are advocating for Beijing to allow Hong Kong to maintain its freedoms, Judy.</p><p>And so senior State Department officials are hinting in a conference call just about an hour ago that their response, an executive order by the president, will be targeted, will try to support those democracy advocates, but also, at the same time, punish senior Chinese government officials.</p><p>But the decision, Judy, is on the president`s desk right now.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: But, finally, just quickly, Nick, today, meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, the House passing legislation that has to do with the treatment of the Uyghur minority.</p><p>How significant is that in the midst of all this?</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Yes, this is the most significant attempt to punish China for a widespread program that has detained more than a million Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, China.</p><p>It`s now on the president`s desk. It calls for the president, again, to sanction senior officials in the Communist Party, as well as the companies that created the camps that are holding these Muslim leaders and the companies that created the surveillance state inside Xinjiang.</p><p>Now, these are authorities the president already had, but they do put public pressure on him to punish Beijing for this, Judy.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Nick Schifrin following it all for us.</p><p>We thank you, Nick.</p><p>NICK SCHIFRIN: Thank you.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: As states begin reopening, one issue looms large for working families: Who will care for their children?</p><p>Special correspondent Cat Wise reports on the child care situation in Oregon.</p><p>CAT WISE: Her kids were all smiles in recent Mother`s Day photos, but the past few months have been rough for single mother Lydia Verschuren.</p><p>She`s a home health care provider in Salem, Oregon. And like many essential workers around the country, she had to keep working even after her children`s schools closed down in mid-March.</p><p>LYDIA VERSCHUREN, Mother: I was getting pretty stressed, to be honest.</p><p>CAT WISE: Then she learned about a new emergency child care program for first responders and health care workers in the Salem area. It`s free and run by the local public school district.</p><p>LYDIA VERSCHUREN: I jumped from joy. I was like, I need to get in on that. I got accepted, and they could start right away after a weekend or Monday. So, it was just like that.</p><p>CAT WISE: Now, most mornings, around 7:30, Verschuren brings her 4-year- old son and 6-year-old daughter to the East Salem Community Center, where the program is run.</p><p>During drop-offs, every child`s temperature is taken, and families are asked a series of health questions to screen for possible infections. So far, none of the 64 enrolled children have tested positive for the coronavirus.</p><p>Oregon is one of a small number of states where school districts have stepped in to provide child care for essential workers during the outbreak. The Salem-Keizer School District was one of the first in the state to comply in mid-March after an order from Governor Kate Brown.</p><p>STEPHANIE WHETZEL, Salem-Keizer Public Schools: We hadn`t practiced for providing care for -- emergency care for first responders. That was something we didn`t have a manual for.</p><p>CAT WISE: Stephanie Whetzel is the district`s early childhood coordinator.</p><p>STEPHANIE WHETZEL: We`re happy that we`re able to help parents provide a service that was much needed. I know how stressful this is for parents. We`re doing everything we can possibly do to keep kids safe, staff safe, families safe, our own families at home safe.</p><p>CAT WISE: Some of those safety measures include rigorous sanitizing, a nurse on site, and twice-a-day temperature checks of students and staff.</p><p>Children, who range in age from 1 to 11, are kept in separate small groups with dedicated staff to reduce the risk of spreading the virus if a case does occur. The program is funded by the district, state and federal government.</p><p>Salem is just one of many communities in Oregon and around the country grappling with work force impacts from the sudden lack of child care. Before the pandemic, every county in Oregon was considered a child care desert, where there are three or more children for every licensed child care slot.</p><p>Today, the situation is more grim. According to the state, about 40 percent of licensed child care providers are closed. Others applied early on for emergency child care licenses from the state to remain open, but, in some cases, providers have had unfilled slots because families have chosen to keep their children home, out of safety or other concerns, like finances.</p><p>LYNETTE FRAGA, Executive Director, Child Care Aware of America: Well, child care around the United States prior to the pandemic was already challenged and really fractured. Now that we`re in the context of the pandemic, it is really breaking.</p><p>CAT WISE: Lynette Fraga is the executive director of Child Care Aware of America, a nonprofit focused on improving access to quality, affordable child care.</p><p>The organization has been advocating for more federal money, around $50 billion, to keep the child care industry from crumbling during the pandemic.</p><p>LYNETTE FRAGA: As we`re moving through reopening, because it`s going to be more expensive to provide child care because of the cost of supplies and equipment and group sizes and so forth, what we are going to see is that parents are going to have to bear the price burden, potentially.</p><p>Might they have to be making decisions not to go back to work because they can`t find child care for their children that`s safe and reliable?</p><p>CAT WISE: In Oregon, economic recovery will depend in part on child care providers like Shannon Aden, who has run a home-based program in Portland for more than 30 years.</p><p>Over the last several months, she`s been providing care for children of essential workers, but, due to state regulations, she had to cut her enrollment from 16 to 10 children. Aden estimates she`s spent about $1,200 more on extra cleaning supplies and higher food costs.</p><p>She`s kept her staff paid, but that`s meant she`s not had any income since the end of February.</p><p>SHANNON ADEN, Child Care Provider: I think that this pandemic has shown the country that, without child care providers, the country can`t run very well.</p><p>We`re not in the hospitals, and we`re not putting out the fires and transporting the patients, but we`re taking care of the most precious thing we have. And that`s our children, so that the parents can go do those important jobs.</p><p>CAT WISE: Back in Salem, Lydia Verschuren and many other families are trying to figure out child care plans for the coming months.</p><p>The Salem-Keizer School District recently announced their program will end on June 9, when schools in the area close for the summer. But they are trying to connect families with some of the local child care providers that will be open.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Cat Wise reporting from Portland, Oregon.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Such an important issue.</p><p>And that is the \"NewsHour\" for tonight. I`m Judy Woodruff.</p><p>Thank you for joining us. Please stay safe, and we`ll see you soon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSHR-2020052701cb112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSHR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600S-X881-DXH2-6305-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152462</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8325\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MacNeil/Lehrer Productions All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>PBS NewsHour (formerly The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 27, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Hong Kong</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Protests</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nancy Pelosi</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Anthony Fauci</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>House of Representatives</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Senate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Children</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Minnesota</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Minneapolis</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Death</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Police</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Diseases</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Mayors</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc5QjBGQUU4M0Y4NDVEMEI4Njk1MUVGRjU1NzREMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

We will see how it works out, but we are going to get massive border security as part of that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HARI SREENIVASAN: Bringing a bipartisan deal to the table, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and Democratic leaders negotiate the future of the nation`s dreamers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also ahead: Mr. Trump travels to Florida to witness Irma`s wrath, as crews race to restore power for the most vulnerable.</p><p>Plus: A new Ken Burns documentary 10 years in the making takes on the people and politics of the Vietnam War, and its lessons for today.</p><p>KEN BURNS, Documentary Filmmaker: I think a lot of the divisions that we experience today had their seeds in the Vietnam conflict, and we haven`t really gotten over them.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and more on tonight`s \"PBS NewsHour.\"</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: There`s not a full-scale deal yet, but it looks like one`s in the works.</p><p>The president talked with top Democrats last night on replacing DACA, the Obama initiative that shielded youthful migrants from deportation. That, in turn, touched off a long day of verbal maneuvering.</p><p>John Yang begins our coverage.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Leaving the White House to survey Hurricane Irma damage, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>said he wants to find agreement.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>President of the United States: Well, we are working on a plan, subject to getting massive border control. We are working on a plan for DACA. People want to see that happen. You have 800,000 young people brought here, no fault of their own.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Later, when he returned, Mr. Trump said even a though a border wall, a signature campaign promise, doesn`t have to be in the DACA bill, it`s still a requirement.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: DACA now and the wall very soon. But the wall will happen.</p><p>JOHN YANG: The president talked about the way forward on DACA over dinner Wednesday night with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and <person><nameText>Chuck Schumer. </nameText></person>An open mic on the Senate floor captured Schumer talking about the dinner.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>CHUCK SCHUMER </nameText></person>(D-NY), Minority Leader: He likes us. He likes me anyway.</p><p>Here`s what I told him. I said, \"Mr. President, you`re much better off if you can sometimes step right and sometimes step right. If you have to step just in one direction, you`re boxed.\" He gets that.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Then, speaking for public consumption, Schumer was measured in his optimism.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>CHUCK SCHUMER</nameText></person>: There is still much to be done. We have to put meat on the bones of the agreement. Details will matter.</p><p>JOHN YANG: On Capitol Hill, the challenges to ultimately agreeing on those details were evident. Democrats focused on Mr. Trump`s commitment to DACA.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>CHUCK SCHUMER</nameText></person>: I think it was a very, very positive step for the president to commit to DACA protections without insisting on the inclusion of or even a debate about the border wall.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Republicans focused on stemming the tide of undocumented immigrants.</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the House: If we don`t fix problems we have with border security and enforcement, and we would only fix DACA, we`re going to have another DACA problem a decade for now.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Reaching a final deal is also complicated by divisions among Republican lawmakers, especially in the House. After initial reports, Representative Steve King of Iowa, an immigration hard-liner, tweeted: \"Trump base is blown up, destroyed, irreparable, and disillusioned beyond repair. No promise is credible.\"</p><p>But Representative Pete King of New York told the conservative Freedom Caucus: \"Trump base is the American people, not a small faction of obstructionists.\"</p><p>Criticism from conservative commentators was brutal.</p><p>Breitbart News, run by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, accused the president of caving.</p><p>And Ann Coulter tweeted: \"If we`re not getting a wall, I would prefer President Pence.\"</p><p>Administration officials say the president`s recent alliances with Democrats are strictly pragmatic, an approach even some staunch opponents of illegal immigration understand.</p><p>REP. LOU BARLETTA (R), Pennsylvania: Does he have much of a choice? If he can`t get things done with the Republican Party, then he has no choice but then to sit down and talk with the Democrats.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Democrats seem eager to respond.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House Minority Leader: There are plenty of areas to find common ground. This is one of them. And maybe on some other issues, we won`t find common ground.</p><p>JOHN YANG: The contentious issue of immigration will be a big test of how much common ground is enough.</p><p>To talk more about how all this is playing on Capitol Hill, we`re joined by Yamiche Alcindor of The New York Times.</p><p>Yamiche, welcome. Always good to see you and talk to you.</p><p>The president flying back on Air Force One from Florida said, \"If the Republicans are unable to stick together, then I`m going to have to get a little help from Democrats.\"</p><p>You have been talking to Republicans all day long. How did they respond to that? What does that make them feel?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR, The New York Times: Well, that common ground has really left Republicans on the Hill both confused and on the defense today.</p><p>Republicans that I talked to said that they still support the president and want to see something that has to do with border security, but even Representative Dave Brat from the House Freedom Caucus told me that he still is interested in having a wall built.</p><p>So, really, the idea that Democrats, who don`t control the White House, who don`t control either House of Congress, may actually be the people who are passing this legislation really has a lot of Republicans on the Hill frustrated. In interview after interview, people were telling me that they really don`t understand why the president is in some ways going this direction.</p><p>But I should say that Leader McConnell might actually want this to happen, because if <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>owns the issue of immigration, if he is the one that then becomes the point person on this issue, he will own it if anything fails, and, of course, the last two presidents, both President Bush and President Obama, tried to pass immigration legislation and both failed.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Yes, I wanted to ask you about the leaders. Speaker Ryan said he didn`t know about this or wasn`t briefed on this until after the president left for Florida. Leader McConnell`s statement rather snippily said, I`m looking forward to seeing the legislative proposal.</p><p>How are they responding to this?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Well, they`re understandably frustrated. Both of them are somewhat caught off-guard. This doesn`t look good if Democrats are going to the White House and over Chinese food and over chocolate pie are talking to the president and making deals without Republicans in the room.</p><p>But Paul Ryan said today at his press conference, and his aides are telling The New York Times, that while the Republican leaders might be upset or even frustrated with what`s going on, they`re going to support the president and their members are going to have to support the president. And whatever Republicans end up putting on the floor and whatever legislation is presented will have to be legislation that is supported by the president.</p><p>And I should say that when I talked to aides for both of those leaders, they are telling me on background essentially that Republican leaders are OK again with the president playing point, if he ends up owning this, because, if it fails, then it`s his problem.</p><p>So, in some ways, it`s a double-edged sword. Republicans don`t want the look as if they`re not part of the deal, as if they`re not at the table when all these decisions are being made, but they also now understand that they are protecting themselves if for some reason this falls through.</p><p>JOHN YANG: We have less than a minute left. Are there any Democrats who have reservations about this?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Yes, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Asian-Pacific American Caucus all met today.</p><p>And the members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus have a lot of reservation, because they`re fearful that they`re going to have to vote for something that might enhance border security measures, and as a result hurt the parents of dreamers.</p><p>I talked to the chairwoman of the caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, today, and she told me that she would be OK with having two separate bills, one that deals specifically with the DREAM Act, and another one that deals with border security. And I`m told by aides that would be the case, because they would want their members to be able to vote for the DREAM Act, while also not being able to vote for the border security measure.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Yamiche Alcindor of The New York Times, thanks so much.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day`s other news: Power crews across Florida worked all-out for another day, trying to turn the lights back on. By this evening, just under five million people were still in the dark.</p><p>Meanwhile, the confirmed death toll for Hurricane Irma rose to 70, and <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>made a day trip to see storm damage up close. We will have a full report after the news summary.</p><p>The president is also defending, again, his views on the violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. He drew fire last month for saying opposing protesters shared the blame.</p><p>Today, he said that, since then -- quote -- \"A lot of people have actually written, gee, Trump might have a point. I said, you got some very bad people on the other side also, which is true.\"</p><p>In Iraq, Islamic State attackers killed at least 60 people and wounded 80 today. Gunmen and suicide bombers struck near the city of Nasiriyah, attacking a police checkpoint and a restaurant. Burned-out cars and debris littered the area after the assault. The Sunni militants said they targeted Shiite pilgrims.</p><p>The Trump administration has again extended sanctions relief for Iran, temporarily, under the 2015 nuclear deal. Today`s announcement came as <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>said Tehran continues to violate the spirit of the deal.</p><p>In London, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson explained it`s about more than nuclear activities. He pointed to Syria and other issues.</p><p>REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of State: Their actions to prop up the Assad regime, to engage in malicious activities in the region, including cyber-activity, aggressively developing ballistic missiles, and all of this is in defiance of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, thereby threatening, not ensuring, but threatening the security of those in the region, as well as the United States itself.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: The administration is still reviewing whether to withdraw from the nuclear deal completely.</p><p>Russia has begun large-scale military exercises, putting its European neighbors on edge. Russian state television showed tanks and missile launchers on maneuvers in Belarus today. It said 12,000 Russian troops, plus 7,000 Belarusians, are taking part. NATO said the numbers of Russians could actually be as high as 100,000. Moscow insisted the war games are purely defensive.</p><p>Myanmar came under new international pressure today to stop the violence against Rohingya Muslims. Aung San Suu Kyi, the Buddhist nation`s leader, faced appeals from both the European Union and the United States. Separately, the U.N. pleaded for major increases in aid for Rohingya refugees. Some 400,000 have fled into Bangladesh since late August.</p><p>Back in this country, Motel 6 says it didn`t know that employees at two locations around Phoenix, Arizona, were sharing guest lists with immigration officers. Agents arrested at least 20 people at the motels between February and August. The sharing of guest information wasn`t illegal, but Motel 6 says it has ordered the practice stopped.</p><p>On Wall Street today, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 45 points to close at 22203. The Nasdaq fell 31 points, and the S&amp;P 500 slipped two.</p><p>And the world`s oldest giant panda has died in China. Caretakers say the female named Basi had liver and kidney problems. She was 37 years old, nearly twice the age that wild pandas usually reach. Thirty years ago, Basi visited San Diego on a goodwill tour and drew more than two million visitors.</p><p>Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": the slow recovery after Hurricane Irma, millions still without power; the strange story of U.S. diplomats experiencing hearing loss in Cuba gets weirder; Making Sense of how big tech companies shape the way we think; and much more.</p><p>The hurricane headlines out of Florida tonight: new efforts to safeguard some of the state`s most vulnerable and a presidential visit.</p><p>William Brangham begins with this report.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: With new urgency, emergency workers moved more elderly residents out of Florida facilities that lost power, and air conditioning, in the hurricane. The state health care association estimated at least 60 nursing homes still lacked electricity.</p><p>The state`s main utility company said it`s doing everything it can.</p><p>BRYAN GARNER, Florida Power and Light: Getting hospitals and other critical facilities online is essential to getting a community back on its feet following a disaster like this one.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All of this after eight patients died Wednesday at a sweltering rehabilitation center in Hollywood, Florida, on the Atlantic Coast. City officials said a criminal investigation is still under way, and police executed a search warrant, but there`ve been no arrests.</p><p>RAELIN STOREY, Spokeswoman, City of Hollywood: We`re looking into the temperature inside the facility, the staffing inside the facility, and all of the conditions inside the facility in the hours leading up to this situation.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>visited the state`s southwestern coast, where Hurricane Irma came ashore last weekend. He got a first-hand look at recovery efforts in Fort Myers and Naples.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>President of the United States: The job that everybody has done in terms of first-responder and everybody has been incredible. And, by the way, that includes the people that live here because you see the people immediately getting back to work to fix up their homes.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Mr. Trump also spoke of his well-known fondness for Florida. He has an estate in Palm Beach.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: We are there for you 100 percent. I will be back here numerous times. I mean, this is a state that I know very well, as you understand. And these are special, special people and we love them.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The president was joined by first lady Melania Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Together, they helped hand out food and water to storm victims in a mobile home park.</p><p>To the south, parts of the Florida Keys remained inaccessible, but more reports emerged of extensive property damage.</p><p>MAN: We were in a big house on the ocean which we thought was going to be safe because it was three stories. And the house basically caved in. I mean, we barely made it.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Meanwhile, the U.S. Virgin Islands are also in desperate need after being blasted by Irma, when the storm was at full strength.</p><p>People on St. John and St. Thomas have been living off military food rations distributed by U.S. Marines and the National Guard.</p><p>WILLIAM MILLS, Hurricane Victim: It`s not enough, but it`s better than nothing at all. You know, it`s something that you can eat for the day. You know, it keeps you sustained for the day if you don`t have much. Much of the stores aren`t still open.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A Royal Caribbean cruise ship brought more than 500 evacuees into Puerto Rico today. It`s loading up supplies to take to French St. Martin tonight.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m William Brangham.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: As we heard, the Florida Keys are still reeling from a devastating hit. They`re largely inaccessible and conditions remain very difficult.</p><p>To get a sense of what communities are dealing with, I spoke by phone this afternoon with the vice mayor of Marathon, Florida, Michelle Coldiron, and asked her how her city was doing.</p><p>MICHELLE COLDIRON, Vice Mayor of Marathon, Florida: We received a lot of damage. We currently do not have our electric on. We do not have water services. We do not have cell services. We don`t have Internet connections.</p><p>So it is pretty sketchy right now. However, we do have a very collaborative, structured team on the ground. They`re working in collaboration with Monroe County. We have a well-trained recovery effort in progress as we speak.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: What are your greatest needs right now?</p><p>MICHELLE COLDIRON: Right now, our greatest needs are food, fuel, and water. Our Marathon Airport has been cleared so that official planes can arrive. They are coming in. We have C-130s that are arriving with the needs our city is requiring to rebuild. We have the Florida Department of Transportation is working tirelessly.</p><p>The electric company is working, first-responders. So we really are doing our best to get our city back open again.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Are residents being allowed back in?</p><p>MICHELLE COLDIRON: No, sir, they are not yet. It is still too unsafe for them to come back in.</p><p>Currently, we have, as you know, the Florida Keys, we have one road in and one road out. We had to do a cut-and-clear to get all of US-1 Highway open. Then the Florida Department of Transportation had to check the integrity of all of those bridges. They`re all cleared and are passable.</p><p>Now our crews on the ground, our city staff, Marathon city staff and the utility department are going street by street to do the search-and- rescue and to continue with the cut-and-clears. So until that is finished and until we get our electric and until we get our water running, i.e., toilets to flush, it will not be safe for our residents to return.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: We have heard some are angry trying to get back in. What would you tell people who are probably anxious, homeowners, business owners?</p><p>MICHELLE COLDIRON: And I understand that anxiety level, as I too am off-site. And it is very frustrating, and it`s heart-wrenching.</p><p>However, we need to let the 2,000 volunteers that are professional volunteers, the lines men, the first-responders, we need them there so that they can get our city safe to open up again. We currently -- our hospital is not open right now. So if all of our residents came back in and somebody got hurt, there would be no way for them to get medical services.</p><p>Even though we have set up a walk-in clinic behind Marathon City Hall, it is still too soon. It`s four days. We need to put it in perspective. We`re four days out of a catastrophe, and we`re doing a remarkable job.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: The folks who decided to ride out the storm, when you say there`s no food, fuel or power, what`s the condition of people in the shelters on the ground?</p><p>MICHELLE COLDIRON: They`re doing all right.</p><p>We have had some food delivery. We had -- FEMA is on the ground now. Red Cross is on the ground now. We have a shelter set up. And we`re doing distribution of food and water at the Marathon High School is one of the stations.</p><p>We do have a base camp set up in Marathon. So there is some fuel and water. It`s just that is what is in high demand for all of the professional staff and folks that are there working on the ground.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Michelle Coldiron, thanks for joining us.</p><p>MICHELLE COLDIRON: Thank you so much. Appreciate the call.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: As we heard, there are still millions of people without power in Florida and Georgia, close to six million as of this evening.</p><p>The pace of restoring power has undoubtedly been picking up speed. But it`s a difficult situation, given the magnitude of the outages.</p><p>To help us understand the scope of the challenges, we`re joined by Scott Aaronson of the Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor- owned utilities.</p><p>I have covered a few hurricanes, and never seen a rollout this big with, this many different agencies, this many volunteers. How`s it going?</p><p>SCOTT AARONSON, Edison Electric Institute: That`s exactly right.</p><p>It is a huge rollout. It was an historic storm, as you`re seeing from all of the footage. It`s historic impact, and it`s requiring a historic response.</p><p>So, I want to update the number. You said close to six million outages. We`re actually right now, as of just about an hour ago, 2.1 million outages still in Florida.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, are those customers or people?</p><p>SCOTT AARONSON: So, those are customers.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.</p><p>SCOTT AARONSON: And so a little bit more on the people side, but, to say the least, we started with 7.8 million outages just three days ago. We`re at 2.1 million now. You see the pace of progress is really picking up.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: I often realize that the last 5 percent, 10 percent are the hardest ones to get to. Are there dates, are there goals that you have on when everybody in this region is going to have their power back on?</p><p>SCOTT AARONSON: So, the estimated times of restoration, yes, in the less hard-hit areas, we`re looking for most people by the end of this weekend at the latest.</p><p>By the really hard-hit areas, you`re talking about places that had flooding, catastrophic flooding, places that hard tornadoes, maybe toward the end of next week. But, again, 60,000 workers from all over North America are descending on the affected area to respond to this historic storm.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Give us an idea of the complexity here. We saw in some pictures that it`s not just about getting the person there, that there is sort of a tangled web of things that have to happen in order for the light to come back on.</p><p>SCOTT AARONSON: That`s exactly right.</p><p>It`s an interconnected system. There`s a lot of things that have to happen, sort of gating items, if you will. First, we have to make sure that generation is on, up and running. Fortunately, with this storm, that wasn`t an issue.</p><p>But then we go for the biggest swathe that we can possibly get. And that`s going to be the transmission system, the interstate highway system of the electric grid, if you will.</p><p>And then from there, you get into the neighborhoods. And that`s where sort of the onesies, twosies that are going to take a little bit more time to get to.</p><p>But because of the way that companies practice this and because of just the absolutely monumental effort from all across North America to come support the companies in Florida and Georgia, by the way, we`re seeing that pace quicken.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: What are the areas that are going to be hardest to get to? Is it the edge of the Keys, where this vice mayor was talking to us from?</p><p>SCOTT AARONSON: I think that`s right.</p><p>I think you`re going to see some of those barrier islands, some of the Keys, some of those places that were hit by tornadoes, some of those places that were hit by catastrophic flooding. There is going to be an instance where a customer simply can`t take power because their homes have been damaged too much.</p><p>And so we`re seeing that in the restoration from Hurricane Harvey over in Houston as well, so much flooding, we`re going to have the wait until those homes can actually accept electricity.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: And it doesn`t also just seem like it`s just about the power poles. It seems like a lot of these trucks, the debris needs to be cleared before they can even get there safely.</p><p>SCOTT AARONSON: In this particular case with Florida, Mother Nature had not done a house-cleaning in Florida in about a decade. And we are seeing a lot of vegetation on the ground.</p><p>In the business, it`s known as vegetation management. And so what we`re doing actually was one of the impressive things about this particular restoration. There was a need for more veg management folks, as they`re known in the business. And we were able to bring them into the affected area, get more of them, so we can start clearing that debris and then ultimately restore the power.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Scott Aaronson of the Edison Electric Institute, thanks for joining us.</p><p>SCOTT AARONSON: Thanks so much for having me.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Now the latest from the Northeast Caribbean, where Irma hardest.</p><p>Thousands of people are still desperate for help on St. Martin and Anguilla.</p><p>We get more from Alex Thomson of Independent Television News.</p><p>ALEX THOMSON: The jetty`s broken on this Anguilla beach. Most pumps are wrecked. So you fill up by hand. But, as we do, people arrive desperate to help their families over in St. Martin.</p><p>MAN: It`s not good news, what we`re hearing about St. Martin, so it`s about getting my family over here right now.</p><p>ALEX THOMSON: The British Anguillans keep saying that French St. Martin, up ahead, was far worse hit, but the French government responded quicker. We want to find out.</p><p>Approaching St. Martin, the waterside concrete buildings gutted, as if some passing army has done its worst and moved on. The entire green forest slopes burned brown by blown seawater, every leaf stripped by Irma`s passing. And, as ever, the poorest get hit hardest.</p><p>ALEX THOMSON: What is the biggest problem?</p><p>MAN: I was living there.</p><p>ALEX THOMSON: You live in there?</p><p>MAN: I was.</p><p>ALEX THOMSON: What are you going to do?</p><p>MAN: What can I do? Nothing.</p><p>ALEX THOMSON: Are you getting help?</p><p>MAN: How?</p><p>ALEX THOMSON: The government?</p><p>MAN: We don`t know. I cannot tell you nothing. I don`t know nothing yet.</p><p>ALEX THOMSON: For now, Francisco`s sleeps at a friend`s, his shock, bewilderment a week on mirrored everywhere here.</p><p>But here in the poorer, low-lying suburbs of St. Martin, the damage is worse because of two factors. First, the eye of the hurricane pushed over this whole area, which means they were hit by extreme winds from one direction, then a pause, a calm, then extreme winds from the opposite direction, but not only that. This low-lying area close to the sea was also demolished by a sea surge, at least a meter deep.</p><p>The brutal calling card of the surge and tsunami everywhere here, cars cast about randomly by the water, then garlanded with debris.</p><p>At the town`s tennis court, Thomas Urigsa`s vehicles, taken without consent by the joyriding Caribbean, then dumped.</p><p>Tell me, what`s the most -- your biggest problem right now?</p><p>THOMAS URIGSA, Hurricane Victim: My biggest problem is now that`s my van to work. No have a van, I no can work.</p><p>ALEX THOMSON: Right, no van, no business.</p><p>THOMAS URIGSA: No business, everything done. All my materials inside my van, all the things damaged.</p><p>ALEX THOMSON: Some might laugh at the playthings of the rich smashed by Hurricane Irma, smirk at the even bigger playthings of the even richer also dispatched, except, like the wrecked hotels, these reporter jobs lost for local people who are not wealthy and depend on tourism. Not quite so amusing., but rightly not part of the clear-up priority.</p><p>The damage on St. Martin is way worse than Anguilla, but the scale of the French response is, frankly, startling. French warships patrol against piracy and secure their marine frontiers. You don`t see British warships doing that. The French energy giant EDF everywhere, trenching cables. We saw no major British power company on Anguilla.</p><p>Roads long since reopened, even bridge railings patched up, and already a vast operation to dump the continents of a shredded town and the plan to do it. Nothing on this scale in Anguilla.</p><p>And, yes, people have noticed it.</p><p>THOMAS URIGSA: For now, it`s OK. Now they start to clean the place. After they clean the place, maybe today, they open the gas station.</p><p>JOHN FRANCIS, Hurricane Victim: It just start coming in, like the water, but no food yet, but I think it will come.</p><p>ALEX THOMSON: The evidence of a difference in approach is all around you. This isn`t scientific, but on St. Martin, we couldn`t find anybody who felt the French government had done too little too late.</p><p>On British Anguilla, with half the damage, it`s hard to find anybody who doesn`t feel that.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Headaches, nausea, ringing in the ears, even brain swelling, all symptoms of unexplained illnesses that have afflicted more than 20 American diplomats in Cuba since late 2016.</p><p>Some have been left with speech, memory and hearing impairment. Were they victims of some spy games gone awry? No one seems to know, but the FBI is on the case. Cuba`s government is reportedly cooperating, and denies any involvement.</p><p>For more on this Cuban mystery, I`m joined by Associated Press diplomatic correspondent Josh Lederman.</p><p>Thanks for joining us.</p><p>I mean, are those descriptions pretty accurate of the people that you have been speaking with?</p><p>JOSH LEDERMAN, Associated Press: Those descriptions of symptoms that have been experienced by diplomats in Cuba are accurate.</p><p>But what we have to emphasize is, they`re not consistent. That isn`t the set of symptoms that all of these people have had. And that`s why this is such a difficult puzzle for investigators to crack.</p><p>There`s inconsistencies. Some people heard things. Some people felt vibrations. Some people felt and heard nothing at all. Some people heard -- had symptoms like mild traumatic brain injury, permanent hearing loss, nausea.</p><p>But without a clear pattern where you can say, OK, in this circumstance, this happened, investigators are really at a loss to be able to reverse-engineer what might have caused this and try to stop it.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Was there any consistency on where it happened? Did it happen in their office? Did it happen in their home, a hotel?</p><p>JOSH LEDERMAN: Well, we know that many of these diplomats had these incidents take place in their homes in Havana where they live with their spouses and families.</p><p>But new details that we`re reporting at the AP today show that also there was at least one incident in a Havana hotel, the Hotel Capri, which is a Spanish-run hotel in downtown Havana.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: And did this also happen to Canadian diplomats? So it`s not just the U.S. that were targeted?</p><p>JOSH LEDERMAN: We know there were several Canadian diplomats that were confirmed to have some type of incidents. Some of them went back the Canada for treatment. Others were treated in Havana.</p><p>It doesn`t appear that the Canadian incidents were as severe as some of the American incidents. But the fact that Canadians were hit, despite the close ties that Canada has long had with Cuba, has really made it more difficult for investigators to try to figure out, what was the motive for this attack?</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: We have heard about technologies like sound cannons before that militaries have used, but when you talk to scientists, what could cause something like this?</p><p>JOSH LEDERMAN: That`s really the mystery here.</p><p>Nothing they have been able to point to could cause most of this or really all of it. There are sound cannons. There is something called an LRAD, which beams sound at long distances, high-powered, in narrow directions.</p><p>But it creates really irritating noises to try to disperse people. It doesn`t cause traumatic brain injury. Actually damaging brain tissue is something that researchers say isn`t really you can do with sound waves. And that`s why the initial explanation of a sonic weapon has become so much less fathomable now that we know that there were people that experienced mild traumatic brain injury or concussion.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: And this wasn`t over a large area at the same time? One of the things that you describe in the report is that people almost felt like they can walk into and out of it?</p><p>JOSH LEDERMAN: This is the part that really feels like it`s ripped from a sci-fi novel.</p><p>We had investigators telling us that patients would say, I would wake up in bed. I would hear this grounding, excruciating noise. I would jump out of bed. Two feet to the left, I wouldn`t hear anything. It would disappear. I would move back, and then, bam, there it is again, as if there was some type of invisible wall that was separating part of the room from another part of the room.</p><p>So, that really casts doubt on the typical speaker that you would think of in a room, where the sound would go everywhere.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: This also was only made public months after the incidents took place. What`s the administration doing about it now?</p><p>JOSH LEDERMAN: The administration is not doing anything different than they were doing before. The U.S. knew about this at least since late last year.</p><p>They first raised it with the Cubans in February. They have been trying to get to the bottom of it. They have offered that if American diplomats don`t feel comfortable serving in Havana while this is unsolved, they can have a different job elsewhere.</p><p>But, meanwhile, they`re continuing to staff the embassy. They`re continuing to have a full mission there. And people are going about their business while investigators continue to search every avenue to try to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Josh Lederman from the Associated Press, thanks so much.</p><p>JOSH LEDERMAN: Thanks.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.</p><p>Coming up on the \"NewsHour\": 10 years in the making, Ken Burns` new documentary series, \"The Vietnam War\": and \"Fresh Air\" host Terry Gross explains why she prefers to work on the radio and not television side of things.</p><p>But first: Tech giants are increasingly under scrutiny from politicians, regulators and experts on the left and the right. Some are concerned about their growing power, even calling them monopolies.</p><p>And the tension keeps building, whether over privacy, politics or the displacement of workers by automation. Yet their role in contemporary life certainly isn`t shrinking.</p><p>We, too, at the \"NewsHour\" have worked and collaborated with Facebook, Google and many other new media businesses. A new book zeros in on some of these criticisms.</p><p>Economics correspondent Paul Solman has a conversation for his weekly series, Making Sense.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: So, what`s the problem?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER, Author, \"World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech\": Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple are among the most powerful monopolies in the history of humanity.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Journalist Franklin Foer, former editor of \"The New Republic\" magazine, author of the new book \"World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech.\"</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: So, the problem is, is that they have tremendous ability to shape the way that we think, the way that we filter the world, the way that we absorb culture.</p><p>And if they were just companies, maybe we shouldn`t be so concerned about them, but they play an incredibly vital role in the health of our democracy.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: The most powerful gatekeepers ever, Foer calls them, the first, second, fourth and fifth most valuable companies on the U.S. stock market. Microsoft is third.</p><p>Add them together, and they account for some 10 percent of the stock price of the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: And it`s not just the size of these companies that we should be worried about. Their ambitions are to essentially control the entirety of human existence.</p><p>And I know that sounds outrageous, but it`s true. They`re trying to stay with us from the moment that we wake up in the morning until the moment that we go to bed at night. They want to become our personal assistants. They want to become the vehicles to deliver us news, entertainment, to track our health. They want to obey our every beck and call through Amazon Alexa and Google Home.</p><p>They`re...</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: And Siri.</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: And Siri.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: But corporate titans have always wanted to control everything. John D. Rockefeller, oil, but the trains that bring you the oil.</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Yes. You`re right. We have always had ambitious corporations, but we have never had everything stores and everything companies in quite this sort of way.</p><p>And I think the crucial difference is that John D. Rockefeller never really set out to control the way that you think or to shape the way that you think.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Worse still, Foer claims, we don`t realize what`s happening to us as a result.</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Fifty years ago, the way that we consumed food was revolutionized. We began eating processed foods, and it seemed amazing.</p><p>And then we woke up many, many decades later, and we realized that food was engineered to make us fat. And I think that these companies are doing the same thing with the stuff that we ingest through our brains. They`re attempting to addict us, and they`re addicting us on the basis of data.</p><p>So, right now, Facebook wants to make money off of video. And so, even though I prefer words to video, it`s giving me video constantly when I look at my Facebook feed. And even though I`m somebody who likes to read conservatives, likes to read people on the far left, it`s essentially only giving me screeds against <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>because that`s what, based on my data, it thinks that I want.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: So, it`s actually even funneling you. I mean, it`s narrowing your vision in terms...</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: It`s funneling my vision. It`s leading me to a view of the world. And it may not be Facebook`s view of the world, but it`s the view of the world that will make Facebook the most money.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: You use the word pander several times in the book, pander to our taste. But what could be better, says economics, than that we get exactly what we want.</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Yes.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: That`s consumer preference. That`s the whole point.</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Sure.</p><p>Well, that`s fine when it comes to picking out socks and diapers, but it`s different when it comes to the information that we use to understand and process democracy. We exist right now in two separate political tribes. And those tribes are delivered information that confirms their biases, and that does pander to their instincts.</p><p>It tells them what they want to hear.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Well, wait a second. I have got The New York Times here. I subscribe. The New York Times is a gatekeeper kind of pandering to my interests, isn`t it?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Well, The New York Times and PBS are gatekeepers of a sort. And they perform that role of gatekeeping with a set of rules and aspirations about where they want to lead their viewers and their readers.</p><p>They value objective facts, and they attempt to transmit a comprehensive view of the world. And they do have values. And they do lead their viewers and their readers to certain conclusions. But it`s different than these companies which are dissecting information into these bits and pieces, which they`re then transmitting to people. And it`s about -- really, it`s about clicks.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: A vivid example, Cecil the lion.</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: So, Cecil the lion was killed by a hunter from Minnesota who posted a picture on the Internet, and this picture went viral.</p><p>It became -- it generated 3.2 million articles, according to The New York Times.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Articles. This is not hits?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Articles. Articles.</p><p>And so every publication saw that this was a topic that was trending on Facebook, and they tried to glom onto it. And so everybody wanted their piece of this traffic rush. And so even publications that we couldn`t respect more, like \"The New Yorker\" or \"The Atlantic,\" ended up writing pieces about Cecil the lion.</p><p>And the reason that this is important is, it shows the way in which something that`s kind of relatively trivial can go viral, and it also shows the way in which we have a certain amount of conformism in our culture.</p><p>And my argument is that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>started off as a curiosity and a joke, but the media glommed onto <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and covered him, perhaps even when he didn`t deserve coverage, because he brought clicks.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: In your book, you say this all began with hippies, basically, a hippy, Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Catalog.</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: Yes.</p><p>So, one of the fantastic things about Silicon Valley is that it`s both the birthplace of technology and it was one of the birthplaces of the counterculture. The Internet and the personal computer were going to be like the communes, where we would all be networked together, and we would be able to achieve this state of global consciousness.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: And it was utterly benign. It was a benign vision, right?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: It was a beautiful vision. And so, the idea of this network in one context could be this hippy dream, but in another context could be the basis for the biggest monopolies in human history.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: And that`s what we have got?</p><p>FRANKLIN FOER: That`s what we have got.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Shortly after we talked, Foer`s fears appeared to be supported. The liberal Washington-based think tank New America, recipient of millions in funding from Google, announced it`d fired scholar Barry Lynn, just after he criticized Google`s monopoly power.</p><p>New America denied that Google forced the firing.</p><p>But Foer, once a New America fellow himself, wrote to say it`s a prime example of the abuse of power he`s worried about.</p><p>Finally, how do the tech companies respond to Foer and his concerns? We solicited their thoughts on Foer`s book. Amazon declined to comment on the record. Google, Facebook, and Apple didn`t respond.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" economics correspondent Paul Solman, reporting from Washington, D.C.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: This Sunday night, PBS will air the first of 10 episodes of the new Ken Burns and Lynn Novick documentary \"The Vietnam War.\"</p><p>It`s been 10 years in the making.</p><p>And Judy Woodruff met with the co-directors at the Vietnam Memorial recently to talk about why this topic and its resonance now.</p><p>LYNN NOVICK, Documentary Filmmaker: Thinking about every single name here as a story.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: That`s the tall older of the latest Ken Burns and Lynn Novick documentary, \"Vietnam.\"</p><p>LYNN NOVICK: We just tell a few of them.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: The team culled hundreds of hours of footage into 18. It`s a flash point in history that`s been examined countless times, but they say it`s still not fully understood.</p><p>KEN BURNS, Documentary Filmmaker: There`s one way to think about it, is there`s really only one name on the wall here, which is your name, your story, your brother, your uncle, your father. That`s the important thing.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Vincent Okamoto is the most highly decorated surviving Japanese American veteran of the Vietnam War.</p><p>VINCENT OKAMOTO, Vietnam War Veteran: The real heroes are the men that died, 19-, 20-year-old high school dropouts. They didn`t have escape routes that the elite and the wealthy and the privileged had. And that was unfair. They weren`t going to be rewarded for their service in Vietnam.</p><p>And yet, their infinite patience, their loyalty to each other, their courage under fire was just phenomenal. And you would ask yourself, how does America produce young men like this?</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: After tackling the Civil War and World War II, Novick and Burns vowed:</p><p>KEN BURNS: We`re not going to do any more wars.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: But as they realized hundreds of Vietnam War veterans were dying each day, they decided to take on what they call the most important event in the second half of the 20th century for Americans.</p><p>KEN BURNS: There`s an interesting thing, having done these three wars, that the Civil War and the Second World War are really encrusted with the barnacles of sentimentality.</p><p>And that`s not a problem with Vietnam. And so, in a way, we get it raw. Nobody`s going to sentimentalize Vietnam. It defined who we were. It was this horrible loss. And I think a lot of the divisions that we experience today had their seeds in the Vietnam conflict, and we haven`t really gotten over them.</p><p>LYNN NOVICK: It`s still with us in this very present way.</p><p>I think we came across a quote after we finished the film that all wars are fought twice, on the battlefield and in our memory.</p><p>I think we`re still fighting the Vietnam War in many, many ways. The great gift for this project was that so many of the people who lived through it are in their 60s and 70s, and they`re here today, and they remember it very, very well. And they told their stories to us in the most generous and brave way.</p><p>People took tremendous risks to kind of open themselves up and just tell us what it was really like.</p><p>MAN: You adapt to the atrocities of war. You adapt to killing and dying. After a while, it doesn`t bother you. Let`s just say it doesn`t bother you as much.</p><p>I was made to realize that this is war and is what we do. And that stuck in my head. This is war. This is what we do.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: The documentary comes at the war from all sides, the divisions among Americans and the divisions among Vietnamese. Burns and Novick say they wanted to include all voices, but avoid passing judgment themselves.</p><p>KEN BURNS: In addition to a whole cast of American characters, every possible stripe, we have also got North Vietnamese soldiers, and Vietcong guerrillas, and North Vietnamese civilians, and South Vietnamese civilians, and South Vietnamese soldiers, and South Vietnamese diplomats.</p><p>But we`re not putting the thumb on the scale of any kind of political agenda. We are just interested in sharing the stories of a remarkable set of people.</p><p>NARRATOR: As many as 230,000 teenagers, many of them volunteers, worked to keep the roads open and the traffic moving. More than half of them were women.</p><p>Le Minh Khue, who had left her home in the North with a novel by Ernest Hemingway in her backpack, observed her 17th birthday on the trail.</p><p>LE MINH KHUE, Lived Through Vietnam War (through translator): We all had to endure. The jungle was humid and wet. Bombs fell day and night. We women had to find a way to survive. We thought it was terrible.</p><p>MAN (through translator): My brother, the seventh child in our family, joined the local resistance. The Americans came through on a sweep and killed him. Another brother was ambushed while he slept, shot through the heart.</p><p>MAN: I never considered the Vietnamese our enemy. They had never done anything to threaten the security of the United States. They were off 10,000 miles away, minding their own business. And we went there to their country, told them what kind of government we wanted them to have.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: There have obviously been hundreds, if not thousands of books...</p><p>LYNN NOVICK: Indeed.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: ... written on this here and, I`m sure, in Vietnam.</p><p>Do you think you now understand this war, Ken?</p><p>KEN BURNS: No, I think there`s something -- just like you can be married for years and years and years, and that other person remains kind of inscrutable to the end, this is the arrogance of history and biography, that we think that we can know, go into the past, and do it.</p><p>Every day was a daily humiliation of what we didn`t know. We always had not just scholars, but veterans present. And their B.S. meters are so fine. And they would go, you know what, I`m not so sure about that. And they`d say, in my experience, it was like this.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: The documentary team shot about 40 times the footage they eventually used, and spoke with more than 1,000 witnesses in the U.S. and Vietnam, one-third of them Vietnamese or Vietnamese-American.</p><p>Research took them to almost 20 countries. Facts were checked and rechecked. In addition to sorting through 5,000 hours of historical footage and photos -- one took a year to locate -- they wove 120 pieces of music from the period in with original music, led by composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who did the soundtrack for hit movies like \"The Social Network\" and \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,\" as well as from Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble.</p><p>The filmmakers say they hope that, by airing this documentary, what happened will become clearer, even if the why continues to provoke debate.</p><p>The documentary comes out at a moment in American history when we`re thinking a lot about America`s role in the world and how important Americans are and America compared to the rest of the world. And judgments are being made. So there`s a timeliness here, isn`t there?</p><p>LYNN NOVICK: Yes, people ask us how -- what does it feel like to have the film coming out in this moment?</p><p>And it`s just the sense that we live in this extraordinarily polarized and divisive moment, and we don`t seem to be able to talk. We don`t seem to be able to listen. We don`t seem to be able to agree about basic facts. And yet so much of that really started escalating during the Vietnam War.</p><p>The resonances of where we are in the world and who we are in the world, especially -- we have been in several wars that are not unlike the Vietnam War for the last 15 years.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And, inevitably, there are the questions of lessons from this war, so many lessons that may or may not have been learned.</p><p>What do you think they are?</p><p>KEN BURNS: Well, they`re legion, but the one that we could agree on is that we`re not going to blame the warriors anymore.</p><p>History is the set of questions we in the present ask of the past. If we can`t talk about the current toxicity, let`s go back and look at the other one, and maybe, with the kind of courageous conversations you can have, permitting people to have and hold views opposite of your own, you could really begin to have something, and not just the talking at or the shouting over that we do today.</p><p>MAN: For years, nobody talked about Vietnam. It was so divisive. And it`s like living in a family with an alcoholic father. Shh, we don`t talk about that.</p><p>Our country did that with Vietnam. And it`s only been very recently that I think that the baby boomers are finally starting to say, what happened? What happened?</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: You can see more of my conversation with the filmmakers in our next piece.</p><p>The documentary will air for the next two weeks.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: \"The Vietnam War\" premieres Sunday at 8:00 p.m. Eastern on most PBS stations.</p><p>You will find more online information right now, including an excerpt about a Navy pilot who spent more than eight years in captivity, making him the second longest held American prisoner of war.</p><p>That`s at PBS.org/NewsHour.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to another in our Brief But Spectacular series, where we ask people to describe their passions.</p><p>Tonight, we hear from veteran public radio host Terry Gross. She`s celebrating her 30th season of \"Fresh Air\" this year, which is produced by WHYY in Philadelphia and distributed by NPR.</p><p>TERRY GROSS, NPR: The only woman I ever heard on the radio when I was growing up was Alison Steele, The Nightbird, who was an FM disc jockey in New York on WNEW, the progressive rock station.</p><p>And she had this kind of late-night, like, sexy voice. And I never listened to that and thought like, yes, someday, that`s going to be me.</p><p>I fell in love with radio the moment I started doing it. It had everything I wanted. I was probably like 23 when I started. I felt very young and inexperienced. And the earliest tape I have of myself is from 1974.</p><p>I kind of sound like this. I find it both like surprising and in a way deeply upsetting...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TERRY GROSS: ... when I listen to old tapes, because I think, like, they let me on the air? How did that happen? And the answer is because it was mostly an all-volunteer operation.</p><p>When I`m preparing for an interview, I do as much research as I can in the limited time that I have. I like the questions to have a narrative arc, so, at the end of the interview, you feel like, I have heard the story of somebody`s life or the story of their work and how they came about doing it.</p><p>It`s pretty nonstop, but, you know, on the weekends, I try to take time out, in addition to doing the food shopping and stuff like that, to go to the movies or to a concert. And, of course, what I`m thinking is, who might I want to interview from this movie?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TERRY GROSS: But that`s a good thing, because it makes the movie even more interesting to think about the possibility of talking to somebody about it.</p><p>One of the many reasons why I`m on radio and not TV is that, when I`m listening, my face goes just slack, like this. When I was a kid and I would walk around lost in thought -- and I was usually lost in one thought or another -- strangers would come up to me and say, oh, dear, what`s wrong? Are you lost?</p><p>And I would go, damn, no, I`m thinking. Like, what`s your problem?</p><p>My kind of interview, the kind I do, is about the person I`m talking to. Now, I have listened to a lot of interviewers, like Marc Maron, who talk a lot about himself in the interview. And that`s part of the reason why I listen, because I love hearing Marc Maron talk about himself.</p><p>But if I were to talk about myself a lot in my interviews, you would be hearing me, like, talk on and on about why I love Charles Laughton in \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" and why I love Stephen Sondheim`s \"Sweeney Todd,\" and what it`s like to be married to my husband, Francis.</p><p>And as great as that stuff is, it would get a little old.</p><p>MAN: I bet there`s an audience for that, though.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TERRY GROSS: There are several advantages to doing a long-distance interview.</p><p>One is, if you`re a little bit of a coward, which I confess I am, and you want to ask some challenging questions, it`s easier to do when you`re not looking the person in the eye.</p><p>Another nice thing about long-distance interviews is that you`re not judging each other by your clothing. Like, I`m wearing my favorite leather jacket today. Usually, I`m just wearing a schmatta, because it just doesn`t matter what I look like, and I like it that way.</p><p>I`m Terry Gross, and this is my Brief But Spectacular take on interviewing.</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN: You can watch additional Brief But Spectacular episodes on our Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour/Brief.</p><p>A news update before we go.</p><p>There`s word that North Korea has launched yet another missile.

TIM KAINE </nameText></person>(D), VIRGINIA: Everyone who has a big, big idea should put it on the table. Graham-Cassidy is an idea. Fine. It`s on the table. Bernie`s got one. It`s on the table. I would like there to be a publicly offered insurance police that any individual could buy if they chose. That`s on the table.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And it`s Friday. Mark Shields and David Brooks are here to talk about the health care news and President Trump`s war of words with the leader of North Korea.</p><p>All that and more on tonight`s \"PBS NewsHour.\"</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: <person><nameText>Senator John McCain </nameText></person>today dealt a serious blow to Republicans` latest effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>In a statement, the Arizona Republican rejected a reform proposal by fellow GOP Senators Lindsey Graham and <person><nameText>Bill Cassidy. </nameText></person>The move leaves his party`s leaders with diminishing hope of repealing President Obama`s signature health care law.</p><p>We get the latest from our Lisa Desjardins.</p><p>So, Lisa, what reason did <person><nameText>Senator McCain </nameText></person>give?</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: <person><nameText>Senator McCain </nameText></person>said, first, in good conscience, he could not support the bill because he said it`s been rushed through. And he thinks now is the time and this issue is so large it requires bipartisanship.</p><p>Let me read one quote from what he wrote: \"The issue is too important and too many things are at risk for us to leave the American people guessing from one election to the next whether and how they will acquire health insurance. A bill of this impact requires a bipartisan approach.\"</p><p>What he`s saying here is leaving this up to states for another two years is just unacceptable. And, moreover, what he wants is a full debate through committee. He wants months and much more thought spent on this issue.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Where does this leave Republican efforts? They have tried again and again and again to get this done.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: We have so many metaphors, the zombie bill. It keeps coming to life.</p><p>I think this Republican plan is down on the mat if this was a boxing match, and the referee is counting, because <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>was a vote they needed. They can only lose two Republicans. He`s a hard no. Rand Paul is a hard no, his office confirmed to me today. He is still a hard no.</p><p>Susan Collins today said she is leaning no. We`re waiting to hear from Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, who supported a bill that did not go as far -- who voted no on a bill that wasn`t this broad in scope. So it`s very unlikely that this bill will get the support it needs in the next two days.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So these are the key Republicans. There have been some bipartisan efforts.</p><p>Some other Republicans, Democrats have been getting together to see if they could come up with something that could work across the aisle. Where does all that stand?</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: That`s right.</p><p>When last we were talking about this on the program, we had heard from Senator Alexander, who was leading that effort, that that was frozen, the bipartisan effort was frozen.</p><p>Well, now that might be changing. We heard from Senator -- Iowa Senator Joni Ernst today, unexpected voice in this, Republican. She told her constituents at a town hall that she wants that bipartisan talk between Murray and Alexander to restart next week.</p><p>And she said -- get this, Judy -- today that she doesn`t think Graham- Cassidy will come up for a vote and she doesn`t think the votes are there. And so there is now a renewed attention perhaps to the bipartisan effort.</p><p>Democrats told me that they actually did -- were ready to make some compromises in that effort. They may have to actually show those cards now if we get to that.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And so it`s Senator Patty Murray who has been leading the charge on that, Democrat of Washington, with Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: That`s right.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins watching it all, thank you.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: Sure.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And in the day`s other news: Rescuers in and around Mexico City combed through mountains of debris, desperately searching for signs of life. The death toll from the 7.1-magnitude quake has now climbed to at least 293. More than half of those have been in the capital. We will take a closer look at the scope of the destruction later in the program.</p><p>North Korea`s leader ratcheted up his war of words with President Trump today, warning that he would face consequences \"beyond his expectations.\" Kim Jong-un`s statement came days after President Trump threatened to \"totally destroy North Korea\" in his United Nations address.</p><p>A newswoman read Kim`s response aloud on North Korean state TV.</p><p>WOMAN (through translator): \"Now that Trump has denied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world and made the most ferocious declaration of a war in history that he would destroy North Korea, we will consider with seriousness exercising of the corresponding highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history. I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.\"</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Later, North Korea`s foreign minister suggested that they would next test a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific ocean. President Trump reacted on Twitter, saying -- quote -- \"Kim Jong-un, obviously a madman, will be tested like never before.\"</p><p>Iran`s president also had a defiant message for the West today, vowing to continue building up his country`s arsenal of weapons. At a military parade in Tehran, a new ballistic missile capable of reaching Israel was unveiled. President Hassan Rouhani spoke to the crowd, pushing back against President Trump, who had singled out Iran in his address at the U.N. Monday.</p><p>HASSAN ROUHANI, Iranian President (through translator): Whether you want it or not, we will increase our defensive and military capabilities as a deterrent, as much as we deem appropriate. We will not just strengthen our missile capabilities, but also our ground forces, air forces and naval forces. For the defense of our country and our land, we will not seek permission from anyone.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Today marked the first time Iran had showcased the medium-range ballistic missile in public. But its military test-fired the same type of weapon back in February.</p><p>There was word today that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security notified 21 states that Russia potentially targeted their election systems in the run-up to the 2016 election. But most were not successfully breached.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Trump and the Kremlin are both dismissing reports that Russia planted thousands of paid advertisements on Facebook in a bid to help candidate Trump with the election. Facebook said yesterday it`s turning over copies of the ads to Congress` Russia investigation. This morning, the president tweeted -- quote -- \"The Russia hoax continues. Now it`s ads on Facebook.\"</p><p>The Trump administration is revoking Obama era guidelines on investigating sexual assaults on college campuses. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos had said that the previous policy was unfair to accused students. Now interim rules will permit universities themselves to choose how to handle assault complaints, until the Education Department drafts permanent rules.</p><p>Critics fear that victims will lose protections or feel pressured to stay silent.</p><p>Former FBI Director James Comey was heckled today while delivering a convocation address at Howard University in Washington. Protesters sang civil rights songs as he took the stage, delaying his speech. Calls of \"No justice, no peace\" continued as Comey began his remarks at the historically black university.</p><p>JAMES COMEY, Former FBI Director: It`s hard sometimes to find people who will listen with an attitude that they might actually be convinced of something.</p><p>Instead, what happens in most of the real world and about four rows of this auditorium is that people don`t listen at all. They just try to figure out what rebuttal they`re going to offer when you`re done speaking.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: It was Comey`s first public appearance since testifying before Congress about his dismissal by President Trump.</p><p>Federal officials are investigating reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price used costly chartered jets for official business. The agency`s Office of the Inspector General said today that it`s looking into whether the flights complied with federal travel regulations that generally require officials to minimize travel expenses.</p><p>Price`s office said that he sometimes uses chartered planes when commercial flights aren`t feasible.</p><p>British Prime Minister Theresa May tried to revive stalled Brexit negotiations with the European Union today. She proposed a two-year transition period after Britain leaves the E.U. in March of 2019, to give both sides time to adjust to the changeover. She also indicated a willingness for Britain to pay a financial settlement, but she stopped short of specifying an amount.</p><p>May spoke today in Florence, Italy.</p><p>THERESA MAY, British Prime Minister: Let us not seek merely to adopt a model already enjoyed by other countries. Instead, let us be creative, as well as practical, in designing an ambitious economic partnership which respects the freedoms and principles of the E.U. and the wishes of the British people.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Brexit talks are set to resume next week in Brussels. But several key sticking points remain, including how much the U.K. should pay to leave the bloc, and how to protect the rights of E.U. nationals who are living in Britain.</p><p>London`s transportation agency is stripping Uber of its license to operate in the city, over public safety and security concerns. The ride- sharing service`s license will expire at the end of the month. The regulator specifically took issue with Uber`s approach to reporting criminal offenses, and the way in which it conducts background checks for its drivers. Uber said it plans to appeal the decision.</p><p>On Wall Street today, stocks were searching for direction. The Dow Jones industrial average lost nine points to close at 22349. The Nasdaq rose four, and the S&amp;P 500 added more than a point. For the week, both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 added a fraction of a percent. The Nasdaq fell a fraction.</p><p>And NASA has bestowed a new honor upon Katherine Johnson, the African- American mathematician whose life inspired the hit feature film \"Hidden Figures.\" A ribbon-cutting ceremony officially opened a new research facility bearing her name at NASA`s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The 99-year-old who calculated the trajectories for America`s first spaceflights in the 1960s was on hand for the festivities.</p><p>What an inspiration.</p><p>Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": Hurricane Maria`s wrath moves on after ravaging Puerto Rico; the search for survivors stretch into the fourth day after Mexico`s deadly quake; <person><nameText>Senator Tim Kaine </nameText></person>on the future of health care reform; and much more.</p><p>Hurricane Maria continued her march across the Caribbean, still as a powerful Category 3 storm. Puerto Rico is dealing with a dam failure in the western part of the island; 70,000 people are in the process of being evacuated.</p><p>Damage estimates have already reached $45 billion for the Caribbean islands in the storm`s path. And all told, at least 27 have been blamed on Maria.</p><p>John Yang has more.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Across waterlogged Puerto Rico, many of the 3.4 million residents have been forced from their homes. Two days after Maria made landfall, knocking out power and communications, the personal stories of facing the storm`s wrath are just emerging.</p><p>These women live in Salinas, along the southeast coast.</p><p>WOMAN (through translator): A lot of trees and many, many houses destroyed and boats on the ground. The power and the water are out, everything, everything. We don`t have anything. We have got nothing and we don`t know for how long we will go without.</p><p>WOMAN (through translator): It came when my son said that we have lost everything. It took our house. It`s tough, but we`re going to start over.</p><p>QUESTION: What are you going to do now?</p><p>WOMAN (through translator): We`re going to the shelter.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Governor Ricardo Rossello reports complete devastation. Damage estimates reached $30 billion on Puerto Rico alone.</p><p>With areas submerged beneath floodwaters, the U.S. military and Federal Emergency Management Agency began airlifting aid, water, food, generators and temporary shelters.</p><p>MAN: We`re able to fly on our mobility aircraft, firefighters, search-and-rescue and other civil support as well. Until probably today, there was no real understanding at all of the level, the gravity of the situation.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Today, Maria kept churning north, lashing the Turks and Caicos. The Eastern Bahamas are next, and then is forecast to make a slight turn east into the open Atlantic.</p><p>Damage to Saint Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands and the tiny island of Dominica was also extensive. Both islands have no power and curfews are in place to prevent looting.</p><p>It could take years for some of the Caribbean islands to fully recover from Hurricanes Maria and Irma. That includes nation of Antigua and Barbuda.</p><p>Sir Rodney Williams is the governor general. A family physician, he is currently on a medical mission in the United States. He joins us from Annapolis, Maryland.</p><p>Your Excellency, let me -- can I start by asking you what conditions are like on Antigua and Barbuda?</p><p>GOV. GEN. RODNEY WILLIAMS, Antigua and Barbuda: Well, in the phase now where we`re trying to rebuild.</p><p>And the whole question is, how do we deal with the people from Barbuda in particular, because we are concerned about their well-being, their protection and their social needs. And the persons from -- all the people from Barbuda are now in Antigua, and some living with family, some living with friends, and some living in shelters.</p><p>I must say that the government and the various agencies did a very good job in educating the population prior to and during the hurricane. And now it`s time to rebuild. We have actually accommodated 500 schoolchildren in schools in Antigua.</p><p>And we have also put their teachers to those schools so that they can be feeling comfortable. Presently, the government is working on some accommodation to make them more private and more comfortable by restructuring a hotel. There`s an old nurses` hostel that is being renovated as well.</p><p>And there`s an old Pan Am base on the island that they`re putting things in order so that the Barbuda on Antigua and Barbuda can have their own private accommodation. And things are moving along rather smoothly.</p><p>JOHN YANG: And, as you say, all the people from Barbuda have been moved to Antigua.</p><p>How long do you think they are going to have to stay there?</p><p>GOV. GEN. RODNEY WILLIAMS: Well, that is a very difficult question for me to answer.</p><p>A lot will depend on what they find on the ground. Right now, they`re cleaning up Barbuda. They have been able to bury the dead animals and they`re cleaning up the debris on the island. And persons from Barbuda have been allowed to go back on a daily basis to protect their assets and then they return at night to Antigua.</p><p>There are teams on the ground looking at Barbuda and looking at what is needed. From my understanding, they are trying to ensure that the rebuilding of Barbuda takes into account the type of island that we want to bring back.</p><p>We have got to develop innovative ways and ensure that we have some of the best engineers and technicians who will advise as to how we will build the country, the island, because we`re going to have to make sure that the buildings that we put up are durable and that it is sustainable in the long run.</p><p>JOHN YANG: Sir Rodney Williams, governor general of Antigua and Barbuda, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GOV. GEN. RODNEY WILLIAMS: Thank you for having me on, sir.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: As we reported earlier, the death toll in Tuesday`s earthquake in Mexico neared 300 today, as rain hampered rescue efforts in the capital, Mexico City.</p><p>In a moment, William Brangham will have a look at how the city has sought to harden itself since the last big quake in 1985.</p><p>But, first, William joins me again tonight from Mexico City.</p><p>So, William, what can you tell me about the rescue efforts of people who reportedly are supposed to be trapped in that office building behind where you are?</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Yes, Judy, it is a really extraordinary story that has given people here a lot of hope.</p><p>Using a whole series of very high-tech technology, thermal camera,s motion detectors, apparently, even an Israeli piece of equipment and an Israeli team that was able to zero in on cell phones, they believe that they have found six, at least six people in that office building behind me that are trapped there. And they are all believed to still be alive.</p><p>The family members of the missing are camped out just a few yards away from over this way. They have been told, and they are telling the press that food and water has been able to be sent to the people that are trapped there. But efforts are under way right now to try to get them out.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I know that finding out they`re there is one thing, but getting them out in time is something else altogether. What are you hearing about the prospects?</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, that`s absolutely right. It`s obviously a race against time.</p><p>Rescuers have said that they think that they have got nine different access points that they can use to access where they are. And so they are slowly working their way into it.</p><p>The tricky part is, is that`s a very fragile building behind me. And, as you can see, unlike a lot of the other sites that we visited here, it`s not swarming with people. It`s just a few people up there, because they`re worried about collapsing the structure.</p><p>But the idea is, if they can get through one of these access points, they might be able to reach those people inside.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, William, this is still an active rescue site, but I understand, at a number of other sites, they have stopped the searching.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Yes, that`s right.</p><p>The Mexican president today said that of the 38 sites that use to be rescue operations, only 10 of them remain active rescue operations.</p><p>And there is one other larger concern that`s been going on here, which is not just for the buildings that have been collapsed, but what to do with the thousands of other buildings across Mexico City that are damaged.</p><p>While most of the attention remains on search-and-rescue across the city, there are an untold number of victims like Silvia Barroso.</p><p>SILVIA BARROSO, Earthquake Victim (through translator): I was in the house doing chores when it started shaking. It was really, really strong.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Her apartment wasn`t destroyed by Tuesday`s quake, but she`s been told it`s too dangerous to go back and could crumble at any minute. So, she now lives here with what soaking belongings she could grab in this leaky shelter inside this vast makeshift community response center.</p><p>SILVIA BARROSO (through translator): We`re feeling desperate. We really can`t go anywhere. We don`t have money to rent a new place. Everything has gotten wet from the rain here. There are tons of people coming and going.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There are likely thousands and thousands of people like Barroso.</p><p>The government estimates that at least 2,500 buildings were damaged on Tuesday, and they have received reports of 4,000 others. These are buildings that weren`t flattened, but will likely remain uninhabitable for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Mexico City, of course, is no stranger to big earthquakes. The worst quake was in 1985, 32 years ago to the day of Tuesday`s quake. Mexico City was terribly damaged. Thousands of buildings, including many newer ones, collapsed fully.</p><p>The official 5,000-person death toll is considered a gross underestimate. After the `85 quake, government officials said reforms would come: better rescue and response, better public education, and stronger, enforceable building requirements.</p><p>Daniel Rodriguez Velazquez has consulted the Mexican government`s disaster prevention board. He`s an expert in urban planning, and he says many of those reforms did in fact come.</p><p>DANIEL RODRIGUEZ VELAZQUEZ, Urban Planning Expert (through translator): Before 1985, building standards didn`t consider such large earthquakes. That`s been an important change, the stronger building standards for the city.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Many point to the fact that Mexico City largely survived intact from Tuesday`s quake. Yes, 45 buildings collapsed entirely, but the vast majority of this sprawling city of over 20 million remains untouched.</p><p>In fact, on most blocks, it`s hard to even tell there was an earthquake at all. Daniel Rodriguez agrees those post-1985 reforms did save lives and saved structures. But he worries that, in the rush to cleanup, the lessons of why some buildings failed will be lost.</p><p>DANIEL RODRIGUEZ VELAZQUEZ (through translator): We need to see if the buildings that fell met construction standards. There`s suspicion that many buildings were built through corruption to bring investment and generate the image of a modern city.</p><p>We need to have the scientific and technical information to be able to determine the causes of collapses, and, when applicable, criminal responsibility.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In fact, just a few blocks away, Rodriguez showed us what he`s concerned about. Four families lived in what was a five-story apartment building here. It looked like this on Tuesday, and now it`s being completely demolished. People here said no investigation had been done.</p><p>Javier Morales Acosta lived here with his wife, daughter, and grandson. He was at work when the quake struck.</p><p>JAVIER MORALES ACOSTA, Earthquake Victim (through translator): My first thought was of my wife and family. My wife was at home. I tried to call, but she didn`t answer, so I knew something had happened.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: His wife was injured, but got out alive. She`s at the hospital now. He says they have lost absolutely everything.</p><p>JAVIER MORALES ACOSTA (through translator): We haven`t been able to recover anything. When something like this happens, the first thing people ask you for is I.D., but everything we had is buried.</p><p>DANIEL RODRIGUEZ VELAZQUEZ (through translator): There is a rush to bring in heavy machinery and clean up the rubble, to demolish buildings. Just like in 1985, it`s a political move. The government is in rush because a presidential election cycle is just starting.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Morales` house and all his family`s belongings are being carted away in an afternoon, as officials here face the competing demands of trying to learn from this disaster vs. cleaning up and getting back to normal.</p><p>In Mexico City, I`m William Brangham for the \"PBS NewsHour.\"</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: As we reported earlier, Senator John McCain`s announcement that he will not vote for the Graham-Cassidy Republican health care bill tosses the fate of current Obamacare repeal efforts into serious doubt.</p><p>We look at what all this could mean, and at a couple other issues, with <person><nameText>Senator Tim Kaine, </nameText></person>Democrat from Virginia, who was his party`s vice presidential nominee last year.</p><p><person><nameText>Senator Tim Kaine, </nameText></person>thank you for talking with us.</p><p>Let`s talk health care first. Senator John McCain`s announcement today that he will not vote for the latest Republican effort to overhaul Obamacare, the Graham-Cassidy bill, is this the death knell for that proposal?</p><p><person><nameText>SEN. TIM KAINE </nameText></person>(D), Virginia: Judy, I wouldn`t call it that.</p><p>Until we get to the end of next week, we have to be very diligent and defeat efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and, instead, force it back in to the bipartisan discussion that my committee, the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee, under the leadership of Senators Alexander and Senators Murray, were having.</p><p>We owe it to the American public to improve health insurance and health care, but we have got to do it, I think, in a bipartisan way. We were doing it. We were very, very close to a bipartisan deal to stabilize the individual insurance market going forward. But the president and the speaker and Leader McConnell kind of blew that effort up, at least temporarily, this week.</p><p>So we have to defeat Graham-Cassidy, and my hope is, as <person><nameText>Senator McCain </nameText></person>indicated today, then we will get back to doing it the way we should, which is, in an albeit Republican Senate, but have full discussions in committee with amendments and full debate on the floor.</p><p>We shouldn`t jam something through on health care at the 11th hour that affects the most important expenditure of anybody`s life and one-sixth of the American economy.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, two other questions on that, because one of the arguments Republicans were making to advocate for this proposal was that states need more flexibility in how they spend their health care dollars.</p><p>And, in fact, there`s a Kaiser Foundation study out saying Virginia, your state, would have received something like $4 billion more under this proposal.</p><p>Isn`t that -- you`re a former governor. Why doesn`t that make sense?</p><p><person><nameText>SEN. TIM KAINE</nameText></person>: Well, because it`s -- the reasoning is true. States need more flexibility. But the Graham-Cassidy bill is being sold as states need more flexibility, but, Judy, every one of the 50 state Medicaid directors said this would be a horrible idea.</p><p>They said you can`t do something like this with no CBO score and people not knowing the consequences, and you shouldn`t be cutting this much out of Medicaid.</p><p>And then, second, as for, did Virginia benefit, we didn`t benefit, if you look at the entire 141 pages of Graham-Cassidy. There is, in the early years, a slight uptick. If you block grant the Affordable Care Act money to Virginia, there is a slight uptick in that. But then the moneys go away completely.</p><p>So we get a little bit of an uptick in the short-term.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>SEN. TIM KAINE</nameText></person>: Then all the money goes away.</p><p>But the real sucker punch for Virginia is this. Separately from repealing the Affordable Care Act, Graham-Cassidy act goes into the base Medicaid program, didn`t have anything to do with Obamacare, was there before Obamacare, and they cap it and they take $120 billion out of it over the next 10 years.</p><p>In Virginia Medicaid recipients, nearly 60 percent of them are children. And they would have been badly hurt by this piece of Medicaid. So, if you look at the whole bill, Virginia gets hurt. And that`s why our governor and our Medicaid director are against it.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, several other things I want to ask you about. So, I`m going to move through this quickly, but still on health care.</p><p>You say what`s needed is a bipartisan approach. But Senator Bernie Sanders, a number of your Democratic colleagues this past week, came out in favor of a Medicaid -- Medicare expansion bill that really didn`t have the earmarks of bipartisanship.</p><p>Isn`t the Sanders proposal that many of your Democratic colleagues signed on to -- that is not a bipartisan approach. So how does that move you in the direction of something that`s going to win approval?</p><p><person><nameText>SEN. TIM KAINE</nameText></person>: Well, let me tell you, Judy, about Bernie Sanders` proposal. He put an idea out on the table, yes, with Democratic co- sponsors.</p><p>He didn`t say vote on it immediately. He didn`t say, I want a vote before the CBO scores it. Bernie`s a member of the Health Committee with me. He`s putting an idea on the table.</p><p>Graham-Cassidy`s an idea. Fine. It`s on the table. Bernie`s got one. It`s on the table. I would like there to be a publicly offered insurance policy that any individual could buy, if they chose, more choices, rather than less. That`s on the table.</p><p>But the way to legislate is to first stabilize the market. And we can do that in a bipartisan way. And then, once we have stabilized it, we can, with care and deliberation that is warranted, given the seriousness of health and health care to regular people, we can consider the ideas and possibly find concepts from a number of proposal that we can put together to help Americans.</p><p>So, putting ideas on the table is fine, but don`t try to jam them through and hurt people with no score, no debate, no amendment, no meaningful opportunity for the public to participate.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, just quickly now, wearing your hat as a member of both the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committees in the Senate, what is your assessment of the heightened tensions between the United States and North Korea this week, with President Trump calling Kim Jong-un, leader of North Korea, a madman, President Kim, the leader, Kim, in turn calling President Trump deranged?</p><p>What is the state of these relations? How worried should Americans be?</p><p><person><nameText>SEN. TIM KAINE</nameText></person>: Well, it`s very troubling.</p><p>I will say, I am a fairly frequent critic of President Trump, but I do think the national security team that he has, after a lot of bad people were chased out, is actually now a very solid team. There`s no good military option here, but we have got a good military team that is looking at what we need to do to keep the country safe.</p><p>However, even the secretary of defense, Secretary Mattis, says over and over again that, we`re diplomacy first, we`re never out of diplomatic options.</p><p>And what the president shouldn`t do is poison the diplomatic well. Big rhetoric, calling names, that starts to poison the well. And the president is even contemplating backing the United States out of a nuclear deal with Iran.</p><p>If he does that, when the IAEA and other nations say that Iran is complying with the deal, there is no chance North Korea would do a diplomatic deal with the United States if they felt certain that the U.S. would back out of the deal and not follow it.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: <person><nameText>Senator Tim Kaine, </nameText></person>we thank you very much.</p><p><person><nameText>SEN. TIM KAINE</nameText></person>: Absolutely.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.</p><p>Coming up on the \"NewsHour\": Mark Shields and David Brooks take on the week`s news; and from the \"NewsHour\" Bookshelf, new reads to look out for this fall.</p><p>But let`s go right now to Shields and Brooks. That`s syndicated columnist Mark Shields, as you just saw, and New York Times columnist David Brooks.</p><p>The only thing better than seeing you guys once is seeing you guys twice, three times.</p><p>MARK SHIELDS: Just a great...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the health care story.</p><p>David, the Senate Republicans have been trying to so hard to once again resurrect an effort to repeal Obamacare. They thought they were getting -- or at least they sounded like they were getting somewhere.</p><p>But, today, <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>throws down the red flag, says he`s not voting for it. Where does this leave all this?</p><p>DAVID BROOKS: It`s pretty grim. Francisco Franco is still dead, to quote that old \"Saturday Night Live\" joke.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DAVID BROOKS: It`s -- I should say, first of all, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with having state flexibility and sending the health care thing back to the states. We`re a diverse country. We might profit from different systems.</p><p>And there is nothing wrong with reducing the rate of increase in the cost, the amount we spend on health care. We would spend a lot more than other countries. Personally, I would be happy if we spend a little less on health care and a little more on education.</p><p>But the way the Republicans have done this yet again is without a deliberate process in a way that seems to have magically offended every single person outside the U.S. Capitol Building, no matter what party, and in a way that raises anxiety on every single level.</p><p>And so, it`s very easy for <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>to say, you haven`t followed regular order, you haven`t worked with Democrats, you haven`t held hearings, and so I`m going to be against this thing.</p><p>And that`s him being very consistent with the way he`s been over the past several months. And one would have to suspect that Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski will follow suit. And, therefore, it`s down the tubes.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: What does it look like to you?</p><p>MARK SHIELDS: I hate to say that I agree with David, but I agree with David.</p><p>And I would just add this. It`s no accident, Judy, that the Republicans find themselves in this position. It`s really since the retirement of John Chafee of Rhode Island in 1999 or David Durenberger from Minnesota in 1995 that there`s been any Republican senator who has any earned credentials or any deserved reputation for working on health care.</p><p>They have just been an against party. That`s all. So, who`s the sponsor of this? Lindsey Graham. I happen to like Lindsey Graham. Lindsey Graham`s credentials, military, national defense. He`s worked bipartisan on global warming, campaign finance.</p><p>Is there a -- Lindsey Graham on health care? And <person><nameText>Bill Cassidy, </nameText></person>who got to the Senate a year ago, not exactly a long-toothed, long-term legislator.</p><p>I mean, all they have succeeded in doing this year is taking the Affordable, which had always been controversial and never had majority support, and now has majority support in the country. And they have convinced voters that Democrats care much more about health care than they do.</p><p>And Democrats had an advantage. They believe in Medicare and Medicaid. They believe in federal action. There is no coherent Republican organizing principle or philosophy about health care. Everybody should have it, and it should be private.</p><p>It`s an abstraction. It doesn`t work in the real world. And voters have concluded it doesn`t. And Pat Roberts, to his credit, the senior senator from Kansas, said, this is not the best bill possible. It`s the best possible bill. And this is the last stage out of Dodge. Because of the quirky rules of the Senate, they need 50 votes until the 30th of September, when the fiscal year ends.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.</p><p>MARK SHIELDS: After that, it`s 60. So, they`re trying to pass something. And they won`t.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: It`s a tough moment for Republicans.</p><p>DAVID BROOKS: They`re caught with a divide.</p><p>I do think there is a defensible case that an intelligent market-based system could reduce -- cause efficiencies. There`s models around the world that Republicans and conservative policy wonks can get to, to point to that.</p><p>But if you are going to get people to entertain the idea of some sort of reform, you have to give them universal coverage. We`re at the point where even a lot of conservative health care economists think, if we give them universal coverage, if your get your preexisting, you`re going to have coverage, then we can work on the reforms.</p><p>But the Republican Party and the Republican Congress -- congressional party is basically out of touch with their voters. Their voters are not libertarians. Their voters are insecure economically and want some security. And Medicaid and Medicare and even now Obamacare offers some of them security. And they will not support their own Republican Party when it takes that away.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, while we`re talking about Senate Republicans, President Trump, Mark, is headed to Alabama tonight to campaign for the man he endorsed in that runoff Senate election down there, Luther Strange. He`s the appointed senator.</p><p>What`s made this race so interesting is, the man he`s running against is Roy Moore, the state chief justice, who made a name for himself by trying to get the Ten Commandments publicly displayed in the state capitol building.</p><p>This is a race that probably otherwise wouldn`t be getting a lot of attention, but Roy Moore is now ahead in the polls. And, last night, I want to show everybody just a clip from the debate that Moore and Strange had last night, because Trump`s name was front and center.</p><p>Let`s listen.</p><p>SEN. LUTHER STRANGE (R), Alabama: I know you may get tired of hearing this, and you may resent that the president is my friend and is supporting me in this race.</p><p>But I think it`s a good thing that the president of the United States has a personal relationship with the junior senator from Alabama.</p><p>ROY MOORE (D), Alabama Senatorial Candidate: The problem is, President Trump`s being cut off in his office. He`s being redirected by people like McConnell, who do not support his agenda, who will not support his agenda in the future.</p><p>SEN. LUTHER STRANGE: And to suggest that the president of the United States, the head of the free world, a man who is changing the world, is being manipulated by Mitch McConnell is insulting to the president. That`s why he`s chosen me.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, what does this tell us about the Republican -- the state of play among Republicans in the Senate right now?</p><p>MARK SHIELDS: Well, first of all, Judy, we must understand this.</p><p>Alabama, Donald Trump`s sixth best state in public polling. He`s the most popular there. A leading Republican campaign manager who`s deeply involved in this race on behalf of Strange, or at least on the side supporting Luther Strange, told me they will spend, they being Mitch McConnell`s Senate leadership fund, political action committee, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States and the National Rifle Association, over $12 million on behalf of Strange against Roy Moore.</p><p>What it tells me is, Luther Strange is presenting himself as Donald Trump`s new best friend, and that Roy Moore is running as: I am the real Trump candidate. I`m going to go to Washington and let <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>be <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>He`s trying to make it a referendum on Mitch McConnell, who this week in The Wall Street Journal/NBC poll was at his all-time low, 11 percent favorable. And so I think what Strange`s side is counting on is <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>the president, going there to Alabama and convincing Trump voters, who are more comfortable with Roy Moore, to vote for Luther Strange.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the president`s poll numbers, David, have ticked up a few points in the last week or two.</p><p>DAVID BROOKS: Yes, because he`s done something with the Democrats, and bipartisanship is popular. So, he gets ticked up on there.</p><p>But, in Alabama, the revolution devours its own. He ran as the anti- Washington candidate, Trump, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>did, got to Washington, and has to play a little by some Washington rules, which is supporting guys in the Senate who are supporting you. So, he`s supporting Strange.</p><p>Roy Moore is a Trumpian before -- of the letter, as they say, before Trump, and a guy who made his name on the Ten Commandments, on some gay marriage issues. It`s Alabama. And so he`s saying: I`m actually the Trumpian.</p><p>And so what -- I think what we see for the Republican Party is that this populist tide is not ebbing. If Moore wins, then there are some signs -- Alabama is unique, Moore is unique -- but there are some signs the party is still getting more populist.</p><p>And that`s caused by two things. First, as Mark said, McConnell is still the enemy for a lot of Republicans. The Washington Republican establishment is still more than ever. And the things that fueled the populist rise, rise of the opioid crisis, the decimation of the economy, the white identity issues, all those things are still rising, not ebbing.</p><p>And so the populism that Trump tapped into might be getting more extreme.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, turning quickly from populism to foreign policy, Mark, the president made his debut, first big speech before the United Nations General Assembly this week, and notable because he came out and said, basically, we will destroy North Korea if they make a wrong move.</p><p>Does he come away looking more like a statesman? He`s followed that with days of squabbling, in effect, with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea. How do we -- how do we now look upon President Trump as somebody who`s leading foreign policy?</p><p>MARK SHIELDS: An embarrassment.</p><p>I mean, you compare the words of presidents in the past, measured, you know, John Kennedy in Berlin, wherever free men live, to come to Berlin, they are citizens of Berlin, ich bin ein Berliner.</p><p>Or Donald -- Ronald Reagan, Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate, tear down this wall.</p><p>They were expressing principle. They were expressing coherently and lucidly and compellingly. And there was a sense of pride in the national direction.</p><p>That was totally missing. I gave him a B for bombast and bullying and belligerence. You know, it was a -- it wasn`t a speech in which Americans could take pride or direction or comfort.</p><p>DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I don`t mind a little tough talk. When Reagan called the Soviet Union the evil empire, he was telling the truth, and that`s fine.</p><p>The problem with Donald Trump`s -- with the rhetoric there is that it`s self-destructive. First of all, it may put the North Koreans in a corner, where they can`t back down because of their own psychic needs. And it creates a context in which North Korea can test whatever they want to do apparently in the atmosphere, where -- and then, weirdly, against North Korea, somehow, suddenly, we look like the bad guys.</p><p>And that`s the interesting thing about the speech, was so nationalistic.</p><p>MARK SHIELDS: Yes.</p><p>DAVID BROOKS: If you`re the country who is the top dog in the world, which we are, you need international organizations and alliances as a way to extend your power. And if you take that away, you are diminishing your own self.</p><p>And so his nationalistic pose makes sense if you`re Vladimir Putin, if you`re a second-rate power. But if you`re a top-rate power, it`s a self- destructive thing. And we see it here, where we actually end up having less leverage, rather than more.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mark, what do we look for in the weeks to come, because, right now, it`s just a war -- it is literally a war of words.</p><p>MARK SHIELDS: Yes.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot of people are out there listening to this, thinking, are we going to go to war?</p><p>MARK SHIELDS: I certainly pray not. I hope not.</p><p>I take some comfort, quite frankly, as a citizen, in your interview with <person><nameText>Tim Kaine, </nameText></person>the senator from Virginia, who said that he, who had been - - not hesitated to criticize President Trump`s policies, had great confidence in the defense team of chief of staff...</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Defense secretary.</p><p>MARK SHIELDS: General -- chief -- I`m sorry -- of Secretary Mattis, General Mattis, and General McMaster and General Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p>I mean, they are -- they provide him direct -- confidence and direction and maturity. And that`s our best hope.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, he`s surrounded by people who are getting some high marks, some of them, David.</p><p>DAVID BROOKS: Yes, he`s got very good people.</p><p>But I have been watching the Vietnam series on PBS. And countries can do really stupid things. And the veneer of civilization sometimes gets slender.</p><p>World War I, there were a lot of very talented diplomats and world leaders at that time, but events just spun out of control. So I don`t think we`re going to go to war. I still think there`s some reason on both sides.</p><p>But you look at the realm of history and you have a little cause for concern.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes, and watching the Vietnam series, which is a superb series -- for any of us who haven`t started watching, you can do that.</p><p>All right, David Brooks, Mark Shields, thank you both.</p><p>MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a look at some must-reads for this fall.</p><p>Jeffrey Brown has this special edition of the \"NewsHour\" Bookshelf.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: And this time, we`re turning for recommendations to two authors with new or recent books.</p><p>Louise Penny is the author of the popular murder mystery series featuring the Quebec chief inspector of police, Armand Gamache. The latest installment, \"Glass Houses\" was published earlier this month. And Pamela Paul oversees book coverage at The New York Times and is editor of its Book Review. Her latest work is \"My Life With Bob,\" a book about the many books in her life.</p><p>And thank you both for joining us.</p><p>And, actually, I want to start with a quick question about the books in your life.</p><p>Louise, what kind of reader are you, and how do you pick what you`re going to read next?</p><p>LOUISE PENNY, Author, \"Glass Houses\": I read everything.</p><p>But, you know, the only sadness in my life now is that I can`t read crime novels anymore, even though I love them.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Why?</p><p>LOUISE PENNY: Because, if I read a great crime novel, that`s the only book I want to write now, is the book I have just read. If I read a really bad one, I`m just all upset.</p><p>And part of my brain is always turned on, of course, trying to figure out how it worked.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Pamela, I know you get millions of books being sent to you every day, so how do you pick what you`re going to read?</p><p>PAMELA PAUL, Author, \"My Life With Bob\": Well, there`s work reading and there`s fun reading.</p><p>And I`m going to focus on the fun reading. I always admire the single-minded dedication of like the hard-core detective novel reader who will just read every single novel in a series or by an author.</p><p>But I`m like Louise. I`m really omnivorous. And, for me, deciding what book to read next is really a question of mood. It`s almost like, on a gut level, I need to read something, and I have to figure out what that book is.</p><p>And if I try to read something that`s not, that doesn`t sort of match that mood, it doesn`t work, it doesn`t take, and I end up putting it down.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: OK.</p><p>Our category is new or soon-to-come books, fall books.</p><p>Louise, you start.</p><p>Let`s take a couple of nonfiction books.</p><p>LOUISE PENNY: All right, my first choice is Toni Morrison, because I would read anything by Toni Morrison, of course. If she wrote cereal boxes, I would collect them.</p><p>\"The Origin of Others,\" which is a collection of essays, and the theme is race. It`s about belonging, our yearning to belong, about community, about why race matters even, and how we came up with the concept of other, us and them, and why is it that, once we had come up with that concept are we predisposed to look at the other with suspicion.</p><p>So, that`s my first pick.</p><p>The second one is Daniel Mendelsohn. And his book is called \"An Odyssey.\" He is a critic, a reviewer, but he also teaches an undergrad course in Homer`s The Odyssey.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Right.</p><p>LOUISE PENNY: And his father, 81-year-old mathematician, joined one of his courses. And so it`s really an odyssey into literature, but also into their relationship. So I`m dying to read that one as well.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Pamela Paul, what are you -- start with nonfiction for you too.</p><p>PAMELA PAUL: Sure.</p><p>Well, I have spent the entire summer, really actually the entire year, doing escape reading. And I think fall is a great time to reengage. And, luckily, there are a lot of books, a number of books that really try to take on serious topics that have been in the news, the cultural news, political news, social headlines, and to delve a lot deeper than the Twitter feeds and headlines have been able to do.</p><p>So, a couple that I`m really interested in are Franklin Foer`s new book, which is called \"World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech.\"</p><p>Frank Foer was the editor of The New Republic until shortly after it was purchased by Chris Hughes, formerly of Facebook. There was a sort of major falling out between them.</p><p>But what he does in this book is not just write a memoir about that experience, but really takes on the issue of how technology has sort of infiltrated journalism, the media and really our daily lives, and what some of the negative impacts of that, those changes are. So I think that`s one.</p><p>Another book I`m recommending is Mark Lilla`s \"The Once and Future Liberal,\" which is a controversial book. Again, you might not agree with all of it, but it`s about identity politics. And it`s interesting to read that along, I think, together with Ta-Nehisi`s forthcoming book, which is called \"We Were Eight Years in Power,\" which is a lot of the work that he`s done in \"The Atlantic,\" but it`s his first big book since \"Between the World and Me.\"</p><p>And I think, together, these books take on the issues of identity, race, class, and also electoral politics.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: OK. There`s four coming books in nonfiction.</p><p>Now, Louise, a novel.</p><p>LOUISE PENNY: All right.</p><p>\"Happiness.\" This is a Canadian one. It is by Will Ferguson.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Which you couldn`t resist?</p><p>LOUISE PENNY: I couldn`t resist. I know. And you didn`t necessarily ask. And it`s an older one, too. I have to admit that.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: All right, we`re breaking the rules.</p><p>LOUISE PENNY: We are. I`m going rogue here.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: OK.</p><p>LOUISE PENNY: I read a lot. I know how cruel the world is. And I read a lot to just -- to feel good about it, as Auden said, that goodness exists.</p><p>So, \"Happiness\" is a hilarious book about a self-help book that actually works.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: We should say the author.</p><p>LOUISE PENNY: Oh, I`m sorry, Will Ferguson, of course, Will Ferguson.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.</p><p>LOUISE PENNY: This book is put out there. And it works. But everybody`s emotional ills are actually healed and everyone becomes happy, except for the publisher, who`s thrilled how many books are being sold, but he`s a cynic. And he`s trying to figure out who wrote the book and why it works.</p><p>It is -- I highly recommend it.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: One other quick new novel?</p><p>LOUISE PENNY: All right.</p><p>This is by Ayobami Adebayo. And it`s called \"Stay With Me.\" She`s 29 years old. It`s a debut. She`s a Nigerian. And it is big-hearted. It`s lush. It`s an exploration of a marriage that starts out loving, begins to have a problem when she can`t get pregnant. A second wife is brought in. She gets pregnant, and then all sorts of family secrets are brought out.</p><p>But I love the fact that it is so big-hearted. So, again, it goes in with the happiness thing.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Pamela Paul, for fiction, you`re going happy or tragic on us?</p><p>PAMELA PAUL: No.</p><p>It is another book that I think really grapples with contemporary issues. And that`s Jesmyn Ward`s \"Sing, Unburied, Sing.\"</p><p>And Jesmyn, I don`t know, I feel like she can do anything. Her first novel was \"Salvage the Bones.\" And this is her latest novel. They all take place in a fictional town called Bois Sauvage in Mississippi, where Jesmyn Ward lives and where her family is from.</p><p>It`s a bit timely and sort of post-Katrina novels. This is about sort of the people who are left behind and the people who stay behind and why and what their lives are like. And it`s about race. It`s about class.</p><p>She has been compared to William Faulkner, Toni Morrison and Herman Melville in the reviews of this latest book. And while I think she is her own voice, those aren`t terrible people to be compared with.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: No, they certainly are not.</p><p>Pamela, let me give you one more, any category you want.</p><p>PAMELA PAUL: All right.</p><p>Well, this is -- this is about fiction, but its nonfiction. And that is Bruce Handy`s book \"Wild Things,\" which is about the joys of reading children`s books as an adult.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Oh, yes.</p><p>PAMELA PAUL: And I am a huge fan of children`s books. And I do think that you read them in a different way as a child, and then you read them in a different way with your children. And then, if you read them on your own, you also see in them different things.</p><p>And I think one of the things that he makes clear in his book is that the children`s -- children`s literature is really -- that`s when we become readers. And those stories really stay with us. And the themes that they raise, whether it`s Maurice Sendak`s books, or \"The Chronicles of Narnia,\" or \"Little House on the Prairie,\" those are stories that really stay with us for life.</p><p>And he explores why that is and really just the joy of reading them again.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: OK, eight books to get our readers started. And we`re going to have more online.</p><p>For now, Pamela Paul, Louise Penny, thank you both very much.</p><p>LOUISE PENNY: Thank you.</p><p>PAMELA PAUL: Thanks so much.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: On the \"NewsHour\" online right now: Recognition has not always come easy for Yoko Ono, a conceptual artist and wife of the late musician John Lennon.</p><p>But, this summer, the Smithsonian`s Hirshhorn Museum celebrated Ono with a whole season of appreciation. We look at her career and how she`s been honored now on our Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.</p><p>And Robert Costa is preparing for \"Washington Week,\" which airs later tonight on PBS.</p><p>Robert, what do you have?</p><p>ROBERT COSTA: Judy, Arizona<person><nameText>Senator John McCain </nameText></person>gave a big thumbs down to the Graham-Cassidy health care bill today. One of the main reasons, he wants to work with Democrats on a plan to overhaul health care. Could that happen after seven years of partisan bickering? Plus, rising tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, as President Trump and Kim Jong- un exchange insults.</p><p>We cover it all tonight on \"Washington Week\" -- Judy.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be watching.</p><p>And on tomorrow`s edition of \"PBS NewsHour Weekend\": the latest updates from Mexico and Puerto Rico.</p><p>Plus: Germany`s Chancellor Angela Merkel seeks a forth term in Sunday`s national elections.</p><p>NARRATOR: Andreas Rinke says Merkel`s case for a fourth term rests on her leadership of the European Union, at a time when the U.K. is withdrawing from the E.U., and American leadership of the West is in doubt on issues ranging from battling climate change to standing up to Russia.</p><p>ANDREAS RINKE, Reuters Germany: I notice, since I accompany her on her foreign trips, that, in China, in the U.S., in the Gulf states, they all said, you are the one responsible for the euro. You are responsible for fixing Europe.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: That`s tomorrow night on \"PBS NewsHour Weekend.\"</p><p>And we will be back right here on Monday with a look at the political stakes for health care reform.</p><p>That`s the \"NewsHour\" for tonight. I`m Judy Woodruff.</p><p>Have a great weekend. Thank you, and good night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSHR-2017092200cb112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSHR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ7-DD21-DXH2-64HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152462</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8947\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 MacNeil/Lehrer Productions All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>PBS NewsHour (formerly The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 22, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Entertainment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Art</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tim Kaine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hurricane Maria</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Puerto Rico</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mexico</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Earthquakes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Barack Obama</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democratic Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000833</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002075</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE REFORM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000C49J</classCode><className>OBAMA HEALTH CARE REFORM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001473</classCode><className>RESCUE OPERATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009J14</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkUxMkVDQjJDOEY5NDVDQ0E5NTFEMTlDMjIwNzVERjc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode><className>Healthcare</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001194</classCode><className>NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009J1H</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH &amp;

Wall Street Journal's[1] columnist Peggy Noonan wrote that Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg were using conservatives as 'pawns.' </p><p>In an June 6 column that eviscerated Zuckerberg as a 'prince in his castle,' Noonan called for Facebook to be broken up. She said, 'Break them up. Break them in two, in three; regulate them.' She expressed frustration with conservatives who had worked with Facebook in the past. She quoted a Wired piece about the 2016 meeting between noted conservative figures and Facebook, which said, 'conservatives failed to unify in a way that was threatening or coherent.' Her own story about the meeting explained how she was invited as a 'conservative activist.' When she replied that she was a columnist, she was told 'That wouldn't do.' In the summer of 2018, she was consulted again by Zuckerberg, who invited her to a meeting of conservatives in his own home. Noonan refused, saying that she found Zuckerberg to be an 'imperious twerp.' Noonan wanted conservatives and members of the GOP to start doing the same. She urged people not to take the massive lobbying checks offered by Big Tech giants like Facebook and Google. She wrote a call to 'do something.' Otherwise, she lamented, Republicans will be used by these tech giants to keep going. Corinne Weaver[2] is a staff writer for MRC Culture, and she contributes posts at the NewsBusters[3] site.

They don't care about the impact on children, they don't care about truth. ... All they want are their tax cuts and no anti-trust action against them.

There is a lot of misinformation on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. But that is only one issue. One social media issue is users scumming, snubbing, bullying or shunning one another. </p><p>It is quite another when the platforms censor and control the users. It is a third when, after luring in users the platforms with ways for people to make money from their own content, to then demonetize the users.Response?All of these things are ethically challenged. The level of misinformation, censorship and demonetization are real concerns for the average American. The concern is most especially felt by those whose views are targeted by the big tech elites. The truth is probably something a little different. Never fear Nancy Pelosi's is here. The Speaker has a plan. Her plan would make a bad situation worse. At Reason.com Nick Gillespie explains in an op-ed. Pelosi's plan would turn the internet from a creative realm with both good and bad into yet another aspect of American life controlled remotely for the concentration of power in the District of Columbia.The Speaker takes controlHere's the Gillespie quote: ' The internet is being slow-choked by politicians on both sides of the Atlantic who want to have a bigger role in what we're allowed to do and say online. To be sure, lawmakers are being greatly aided in their efforts by major tech players such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Apple's Tim Cook, who are explicitly calling for regulation to maintain current market positions in a sector defined by creative destruction In an interview with Recode's Kara Swisher, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) pronounced that in the tech sector, the 'era of self-regulation' is over when it comes to privacy and speech rules she zeroes in especially on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act as the thing that needs to be torched. Section 230 comprises 'the twenty-six words that created the internet.' Author Jeff Kosseff explains that by immunizing websites, platforms, and service providers from 'lawsuits over materials that their users upload,' Section 230 'fundamentally changed American life.' Indeed, the internet as we know it is based on both 'content created not only by large companies, but by users,' writes Kosseff, who observes that of the top 10 most-trafficked websites in the United States in 2018, only Netflix 'mostly provides its own content.' All the rest\u2014Facebook, Wikipedia, YouTube, Twitter, et al.\u2014either rely heavily on user-generated content (including potentially actionable reviews and comments about everything under the sun) or exist to guide users to such content (Google, Yahoo). Pelosi is done with all that, telling Swisher that the freedom of expression empowered by Section 230 is 'a gift' and a 'privilege' that can be rescinded if major tech companies don't move in the direction she and other politicians want.'Wrap it upPower grabs by federal politicians take many forms. They come from both sides of the aisle. Now Pelosi et al are claiming free speech as a privilege the government has authority to regulate, legislate tax and control. That's unconstitutional. That's un-American. It is time we take back our government. We have the power to limit the scope and jurisdiction of the federal government. Some regulation may be desirable; however, D.C. seems to think that they have authority over everything in our lives \u2014 from healthcare to car emissions to the internet. Enough Enough ENOUGH! It is time for back to basics. The post Pelosi Claims Control of Free Speech[1] appeared first on Granite Grok[2].

KEVIN MCCARTHY (D), CALIFORNIA, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: He need to mark it as a moment that the new Democratic socialist swing of the party overtook their own leadership.</p><p>The socialist grip could not be tighter. This isn't the Democratic Party that we've come to know. The transition is now complete that the Democrats socialist wing of the party controls their own leadership.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: It's interesting, Brian, that Nancy Pelosi really owes her speakership not to these new fire brands, the freshmen that are making all the noise in the news, but to the moderate that won in swing districts and beat those Republicans that are having a tough time. But now it's like the only one that can get attention are the freshman members that are making a lot of noise.</p><p>BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST: It's unbelievable because in the beginning it was like, look how powerful she is. Look at the command she has. And look at how Paul Ryan dropped the ball. And then they thought, well, can she going to be able to go to the middle to make sure those moderates keep those seats.</p><p>And now the story is how did she get this so out of control where need to 48 hours just to have a resolution that would say anti-Semitism is wrong. Now we have a resolution that says everything we've learned in first grade still holds. Don't be mean to people.</p><p>And now we have a situation where somebody actually told us to these freshmen, this Minnesota freshman, in particular, Omar. When she came out and said, oh, by the way, I need you to change the rules because I'm going to be wearing this headdress. One hundred eighty one years, no one was allowed to wear anything on their heads, now they can.</p><p>Then they go out and go Lindsey Graham is compromised. I thought to myself, what's going on here? And then we find out about all these other past tweets and apologies and back tracking. And then you see a situation where no one can rein them in. I thought she chose in the beginning not to, now I realize she can't.</p><p>PERINO: Yeah. Lisa, hasn't gotten away from them like this is like, basically, a defining moment or do you think that now they've gotten past this week that they can pull things back together?</p><p>LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I mean, I don't think they've really gotten past it because the resolution was a joke, right? And even Democrats criticized it like Representative (ph) who is a Jewish Democrat member of Congress called his party out for failing to specifically address the anti-Semitism.</p><p>But to your point earlier, Nancy Pelosi is facing this big challenge because there's no doubt that the party is gearing towards the left. You look at something like Medicare for all which Bernie Sanders introduced during the 2016 election. That was once considered outside of the mainstream. Now it's a mainstream part of the Democratic Party. And you see the front runners for the 2020 presidential election embracing it. It's almost a litmus test.</p><p>You look at things like the green deal. You look at extreme stances on abortion. So the party is certainly going to the left. And the problem for Democrats, which you pointed out Dana, is a lot of these moderate Democrats members who represent Republican leaning districts who could be jeopardy in 2020.</p><p>And also alienating independent voters headed into 2020. And also some of these rustbelt states and critical states that Democrats need to win.</p><p>PERINO: But even a Nancy Pelosi, Juan, she has tapped the brakes on impeachment, on Medicare for all, and on the green new deal. She's basically to kind of dismiss all of them in public comments. And yet, it is what's getting all the attention.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think that's the media. But, you know, I think that's a legitimate thing because this is the controversy. This is what people are talking about. To my mind, the big slip up here is that otherwise we'd be discussing things like the Republican revolt against the president on the emergency claim for the border, or we would be talking about the Democratic bill, HR 1, which tries to layout new rules with regard to ethics and campaigns and voting.</p><p>So, essentially, they have run over what Pelosi wanted to be the message at this time. I will say this I think Pelosi did a great job. I don't think she's under the pressure you guys describe because she held her caucus together.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KILMEADE: She said you're not going to listen to me I'm going to leave. She left.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Right. But the 23 votes, Brian, that went against this resolution. Not one, Lisa. Not even people who've said, oh, we kind of think you should have been more specific about Omar and about anti- Semitism. Not one Democrat voted against this. The party held together.</p><p>And for her, that's a major triumph because if they had split just like we're talking about the dissension within the ranks, we would really be focused on people, especially, if a Jewish member had voted against this resolution.</p><p>PERINO: Let's get Greg in here.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: No, thank you. I'll stay out of it for now. I'm looking forward to the Michael Jackson segment. Hey, I got to tell you one thing about Omar, no one is safe, right? She just, today, slammed President -- or former President -- oh, you have the sound, go for it.</p><p>PERINO: Let's listen to it. It's a quote, sorry. Well then, I will do it.</p><p>KILMEADE: In your voice.</p><p>PERINO: No, not today. I'm not going to try to do it in her voice. All right, Omar says the hope and change offered by Barack Obama was a mirage, recalling the caging of kids at the U.S. border, and the droning of countries around the world on Obama's watch.</p><p>She argues that the Democratic president operated within the same fundamentally broken framework as his Republican successor and said, we can't be only upset with Trump, his policies are bad but many of the people who came before him also had really bad policies. They were just more polished than he was, Omar said.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right. So back to what I was saying.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD: Michael Jackson -- no one is safe, including President Obama. She slammed President Obama. Doesn't she know that is our job?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD: There's turf in this place and she's coming in in our turf. Look, this is what they did that was --which was hilarious and clever. What the Democrats did, OK. She does something wrong. She has a litany of anti-Semitic slurs. Instead of acknowledging it and putting her name up there like they did -- with Steve King, they threw it into a bucket of other wrongs which dilutes the actual condemnation.</p><p>I think we know that that's the obvious strategy by inserting it with other kinds of hate crimes and hate thoughts and so on and so on. So she's kind -- it's like taking a bruised apple at a farmer's market and putting it in a pile with other bruised apples. They all look the same. That's what they've tried to do.</p><p>PERINO: Nobody likes a bruised apple.</p><p>KILMEADE: But it's the other thing that's clever. I think it's a win for her.</p><p>GUTFELD: No.</p><p>KILMEADE: I think it's a flat out win for her.</p><p>GUTFELD: No. I'll tell you why it's clever. It's clever because then you have the Republicans saying, OK, now they can point to you and go, you, Republicans, didn't vote for an anti-hate bill. You must really be haters. So it's a nice little -- it's a nice little -- it's jujitsu, is that what it is?</p><p>But here's the thing that I find interesting, it's amazing how traditionally liberal the right is now and how right-wing -- old school right-wing the left is because you have Republicans considering -- I mean, condemning anti-Semitism, fighting for free speech on campus. Peace talks in North Korea.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Dems can't agree on anti-Semitism. They want a cold war with Russia, again, North Korea and the Saudis. And they want to shutdown dialogue on campus. We have a totally flip-flopped world.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yeah, especially when you are going after Obama -- or defending Obama --</p><p>PERINO: Juan, sorry, but I do want -- they want us to get this other topic in because House Democrats aren't the only ones divided. The 2020 presidential hopefuls are also split over what the party's vision of America should be. The latest progressive shift comes from Elizabeth Warren, announcing a proposal to catch -- excuse me, to break up big tech giants including Google, Facebook and Amazon. Warren claims they are monopolies with too much power.</p><p>Brian, she's like -- she doesn't care about the Pocahontas stuff. She's like I'm putting policies on the table.</p><p>KILMEADE: Right. And very interesting policies, breakup of the successful companies and make sure they're not successful. I don't know what she's going to go on legally to break up Google because there is Bing. We don't use it. There is Yahoo, they're not just as good. So I don't know.</p><p>Take the most successful thing about America and then destroy it. That's a good way -- way to run. Being that Kamala Harris wants to legalize prostitution, she can't do that. Or legalize pot-core, Booker had that. Or Medicare free pre-school, Sanders has that.</p><p>She's got to pick out something else that makes her unique. I just don't think this is going to resonate with anyone who has to somewhat a respect for the free market.</p><p>BOOTHE: You know who people should be looking at and people aren't giving him enough attention is Bernie Sanders. He's the only Democrat who threw his name in the hat that is generating an excitement on the left. You're seeing --</p><p>KILMEADE: Who's genuine, though.</p><p>BOOTHE: Yeah, exactly. And unlike all these other people, he comes across as authentic as well. I think when you have such a crowded primary field unique situations happen. I think there's very much a plausible situation where Bernie Sanders is the one that emerges as the frontrunner in the Democratic Party.</p><p>PERINO: Greg, does she gets any credit for doing something that they haven't -- no one else has done, which is like, here are specific policies proposal and putting forward.</p><p>GUTFELD: I just -- you know what? She's all about co-opting someone else's character. First it was Cherokee, now it's AOC. I think that she is -- she's trying to be AOC.</p><p>PERINO: That's funny because she was in Long Island City today making this announcement.</p><p>GUTFELD: Interesting. That is funny.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Get me a beer.</p><p>BOOTHE: And baking her husband for being in their house.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, actually, it's very difficult for the Democrats because initially they were very pro -- these high-tech firms because the high-tech firms give a lot of money to the Democrats, very supportive. But you know what, when it comes to issues -- and we see this week with Facebook, they're looking at the privacy, they're trying to revamp, especially after 2016 -- channel: 118 date: 03/08/2019 time</p><p>PERINO: Yeah, they know it's coming.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: And so, I think you're wrong, Brian. I think there are lots of people in this country who say you've got to regulate. You see the Europeans already saying these high-tech companies right now are running over our society.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: No responsibility.</p><p>PERINO: I'm not sure about following the Europeans right off a cliff. New questions over Michael Cohen and whether he was coached by Democrats before talking to Congress, we have details next.</p><p>BOOTHE: Welcome back. Bombshell new development in the wake of Michael Cohen's hearing on Capitol Hill. Republicans now asking if he was coached by Democrats beforehand, sources say that Cohen met with the staff of Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff four times over ten hours leading up to his public testimony last week. Cohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis, defending the move saying it was, quote, completely appropriate and he would have done the same thing for Republicans had they asked.</p><p>Dana, I'm going start with you because I know --</p><p>PERINO: Brian is writing this on my page and I can't read what it says.</p><p>KILMEADE: We've had a pre-game --</p><p>BOOTHE: For the people at home, the reason I'm going to Dana and Brian first, they're getting into this before so they're both fired up.</p><p>PERINO: I'm not fired up. I don't really care.</p><p>BOOTHE: Well, OK --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOOTHE: All right.</p><p>PERINO: Here's the thing, you think it's a huge deal that Adam Schiff is shifty --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOOTHE: So, Dana, do you -- Adam Schiff is downplaying this saying it's completely normal, is it?</p><p>GUTFELD: I want to hear her yell at Brian. Brian, you yell back at her</p><p>BOOTHE: Will someone start and then the other --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOOTHE: Dana, you go first.</p><p>PERINO: I -- look, Lanny Davis is the lawyer, right? He's a good one. He's been through this before. And the committee have said you're coming up here because you've got to have to talk to us because you've lied to us the last time you were here. We want to hear -- we want to see up here -- go through this and we can walk it through.</p><p>Maybe that's inappropriate except for that they've offered it to the Republicans as well, and Republicans they didn't want to do it. Fine. That's fine. But the two biggest headlines that came out of Michael Cohen's testimony, the number one thing that President Trump wanted, Michael Cohen said no evidence of collusion, number one. So did the Democrats coach him to say that?</p><p>And the second headline was President Trump did not directly tell me to lie. OK. So those are the two things that were -- the president could possibly in trouble for. Michael Cohen sides with the president on those two things. So if the Democrats are trying to coach him, they didn't do a very good job.</p><p>BOOTHE: So, Brian is raising his hand. So, Brian, ding, ding, ding, you're next. Go.</p><p>KILMEADE: OK. First off, what bothers me is the deception, when he asked -- he originally -- Adam Schiff said we're just talking about logistics and he was worried about his security. That's not true. They've met five times for 12 hours. My goodness. And you told me something I didn't know. I did not know Republicans were invited to come to New York and meet with him. So that's true --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KILMEADE: They were a little bit surprised. Then it was this link they have no idea. That's why Turner wrote that letter saying, do you actually rehears this? Was this a rehearsal? Some of these -- the Q&amp;A's that got on the record. Number 2 is the Benghazi hearings. All the controversy with the Benghazi hearings.</p><p>There was one time in which a Democrat was not invited to a one-on-one session with a key witness because the whistle blower wasn't too secure with what he's going to say that it wouldn't have leak out to the media. And Elijah Cummings went crazy. So just do with the same way where there's no legal reason to bring Republicans in, but it's the right thing to do traditionally.</p><p>And it did come out. They've said that he change -- they've said that Trump lawyers changed his remarks and they didn't. That turned out to be wrong. They didn't change his remarks because they found his original -- the Moscow tower talks stopped in January, that's exactly what he intended to say.</p><p>PERINO: If you look at the Cohen hearings at the end of the day, did it help or hurt President Trump? And I would argue that it absolutely helped him.</p><p>BOOTHE: And to that point, Greg -- I want to get you in on this --</p><p>GUTFELD: Please do.</p><p>BOOTHE: -- to the point that Dana just make. Does it help --</p><p>GUTFELD: I wasn't listening.</p><p>KILMEADE: You're not interested. You're not listening. What's going on with this show?</p><p>GUTFELD: I'm kidding. I'm joking. Unlike your crazy show in the morning.</p><p>KILMEADE: You didn't even know what's on in the morning, you're sleeping until noon.</p><p>BOOTHE: Does it help order in the court. Does it help anyone to embrace Michael Cohen because --</p><p>GUTFELD: No, he's --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: I -- to your point about Adam Schiff being shifty, I don't think -- people keep saying he's like Joe McCarty, right? He's on this witch hunt. That's what the Republican compare. He's more in my opinion like Charlie McCarthy, and that he's a doll on string and the strings are pulled by an activist media. He's doing all of this because he's being rewarded with the spotlight. And he's so wouldn't in stiff.</p><p>He makes John Kerry look like a gummy worm. But he's like -- he is in control of the media. As long as the media is chasing this, he'll keep chasing them.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I got to say, I got to introduce you to Devin Nunes, because --</p><p>GUTFELD: I know him, nice fellow.</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- who was --</p><p>GUTFELD: We play racquetball.</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- playing with the media and absolutely (ph) for President Trump. Guess what? That was Devin Nunes when he was in charge of House intel. So, I mean, I don't see --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Let me just finish. And I think that when you stop and review the idea that this is a witness who had lied to them and 17 to the Congress, the idea that they would say, well, we want to review what you're going to talk about. We want to know what you have knowledge of so that we could prepare going over things like catch and kill stories with the National Enquirer, exactly what was the relationship --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOOTHE: So David Axelrod put out a tweet in response to the House Judiciary Committee sweeping document request from 81 people saying that this plays in to President Trump's witch hunt narrative, doesn't it?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, it plays into --</p><p>BOOTHE: Why not?</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- the media narrative that tries to say -- because the Congress has a legitimate oversight --</p><p>BOOTHE: But all these people --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: This is a distortion. I'm so sorry that David Axelrod bought in to this distortion because you want Congress to ascertain the facts before bringing any charges or going after impeachment. They are doing that. They're gathering facts. That's their legitimate role.</p><p>BOOTHE: But isn't it redundant though when Mueller has already been doing this investigation since 2017?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, it's not. We don't even know what is in the Mueller report. So, I mean, let's assume that Mueller comes up with nothing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Jussie Smollett got indicted on 16 felony count. We should do that story.</p><p>BOOTHE: Funny you say that because breaking news out of Chicago, as Greg just said, there's more legal trouble for Jussie Smollett. We have the latest coming up ahead on THE FIVE. Plus, the fall intensives over that explosive new documentary about Michael Jackson, all of those details when we return. Stay tuned.</p><p>WILLIAMS: HBO's controversial documentary, Leaving Neverland, prompting new questions about Michael Jackson's legacy, and now more outlets distancing themselves from the world's biggest pop star. The Simpsons announced they're pulling an episode featuring Jackson's voice after the documentary alleged the late singer sexual abuse two children.</p><p>All of this comes after several radio stations across the world have decided to stop playing Jackson's music. And one of the singer's biggest defenders now pulling back his support, long-time friend to Michael Jackson, actor Corey Feldman saying this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COREY FELDMAN, ACTOR: I don't want to be perceived because I'm here to defend Michael because I can no longer do that. I cannot in good consciousness defend anyone who is being accused of such horrendous crimes. But at the same time I'm also not here to judge him because, again, he didn't do those things to me and that was not my experience.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, so this is a kind of a telling moment. So we have The Simpsons pulling an episode with Michael Jackson voice in it. We have a Canadian radio stations and other stations around the world pulling his music. A statue in Manchester, England, being pulled down. The estate, the Michael Jackson estate now dropping. This concert film that they were going to run and ending a Broadway musical that was going to be on display in Chicago. Lisa, why now because we knew so much of this?</p><p>BOOTHE: Right. Isn't that sort of pathetic that it's taken this long for there to be this kind of response to Michael Jackson? You can go back in 1993 where he faced a police investigation, reached a settlement with a young child and their family for $23 million. You have a sister, Latoya Jackson in 1993, telling MTV, basically, accusing her brother of being a pedophile saying what business does a 35- year-old man have having little boys stay with him for 30 days, right?</p><p>So this information we have known. There was, again, another documentary in 2003 by Martin (ph) talking about all of this. A 12-year-old cancer victim saying that Michael Jackson told him if you love me, you'll spend the night in my bed, so why now?</p><p>It's pathetic that it's taken this long. And I think the reason is because we put celebrities on such a pedestal that we basically let them get away with so much when this has been in our face. And it's -- all clear for so long.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, Greg, The Simpsons people was asked, you know, why are you pulling this now because you knew just what Lisa was talking about. And the answer was -- but he was acquitted in 2005, although he had settled one case back in 1993.</p><p>GUTFELD: To me, a lot of this stuff is very easy virtue signaling. I don't think it's that impressive. When you reduce the supply of something, what happens? You have scarcity that increases the value. So hold on to your Michael Jackson records. Big question that -- like they're talking about -- OK, a radio station will say we'll no longer gonna play his music. It's about who sells the music. Will they actually stop selling the music?</p><p>You can still, you know, go see Roman Polanski movie. You could see Charlie Chaplain movies if you want. There are a lot of artist spanning across the history of art, in paint, in poetry, in acting who are profound scoundrels, and we still listen to them. We still enjoy their music. There's an interesting point that Eric Weinstein makes, the radio station banning Jackson should actually shutdown because the inventor of the radio, Marconi, was a fascist supporter of Mussolini.</p><p>So if you're going to go -- if you're going to take virtues signaling to the ultimate level you will have nothing left to listen to. You'll have nothing left to watch. So I think that -- if the rubber hits the road is will you sell that thing?</p><p>PERINO: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: Not removing something from The Simpsons because you're not losing any money. Will you sell that album?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, Dana --</p><p>PERINO: It's the same with Harvey Weinstein.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yeah.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Let's go to that point. If you have music that you know was produced by, in this case, an alleged pedophile, are you going to associate his reprehensible actions with Billy Jean?</p><p>PERINO: Well, I've got to say, when I first heard that the BBC had decided -- I think they were the first ones to say, OK, we're never going to play Michael Jackson's music on any BBC radio program. And I asked Peter, of course, British, and he said that's exactly what the BBC does, they overreact.</p><p>I think that your point is a good one, which is that -- we still see those movies. You know the music is going to be there. I don't understand why it's happening now. And it's fascinating how those documentaries are driving decision making like this. Like, this is a lot -- like, on Harvey Weinstein, nobody is suggesting that those movies --</p><p>GUTFELD: Shakespeare in love, was that still -- I mean, people still go to that movie?</p><p>PERINO: Right. And I'm sure that the actors in that movie don't want it to stop.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yeah.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, Brian, Paris Jackson whose daughter --</p><p>KILMEADE: Feel bad for her.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well she just says, chill out, what are you guys getting yourself all uptight about?</p><p>KILMEADE: Reacting with a calm mind usually is more logical than acting without rage. It feels better to mellow out, smoke weed, and think about the bigger picture. Chillix my dudes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I think she's in trouble, that is a cry for help, number one. Here's a problem, Michael Jackson's really not my speed, but I understand he's mostly considered great, and the problem is his music is so good, how are you going to walk away from it for generations.</p><p>They're also the people who--</p><p>GUTFELD: So your - whether you like it or not matters?</p><p>KILMEADE: No, I'm saying, I don't like it, but there's nobody going to get rid of it, it is so - considered so elite, so great by musical experts and he made such an impact over the course of three maybe four decades. How do you get rid of all that? That's a heck of a dumpster fire.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, we may be in the mood for a dumpster fire.</p><p>GUTFELD: But I mean, I don't--</p><p>WILLIAMS: Because that's when - when you look at what's going on with R. Kelly right now, black radio stations are saying, hey you know what, R. Kelly not running it and is very popular music, I believe I can fly, but they're saying what he did to black women is so awful, they can't tolerate it. You say it's virtue signaling, I think it may be people taking responsibility, because they could--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: There's no question, I mean if you can be understandably and legitimately obviously repulsed by the actions of any of these artists, what I'm saying is that there are certain people like R. Kelly, I don't believe has been found guilty yet right?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No.</p><p>PERINO: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: They dropped Kevin Spacey from House of Cards and it looks like that case in Boston is looking pretty shaky, I don't know. But I think that we're entering a place, I don't know where it goes, because there's just so many - Roman Polanski raped a girl, a fourteen-year-old girl, in a hot tub and he's considered Hollywood royalty.</p><p>KILMEADE: Standing ovation at the Oscars.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, standing ovation of the Oscars.</p><p>BOOTHE: But doesn't it seem--</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm not - I'm sorry.</p><p>BOOTHE: I mean, but isn't the issue not just if he had faced legal problems, but just the fact of him spending the night with little boys should have been enough on its own?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well that's weird. I mean there's no question, and when you think about Neverland, it was intended to draw in little kids.</p><p>KILMEADE: Millions of billions at stake.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right, breaking news about actor Jussie Smollett, this is hot and it's late here on THE FIVE. Stay with us.</p><p>KILMEADE: All right, here we go, a Fox News alert, even more legal trouble for Jussie Smollett, a grand jury in Chicago has reportedly indicted the Empire actor on 16 felony counts of disorderly contact, conduct for filing a false police report, in the wake of his arrest last month, after police say he alleged to - paid two men to help him stage a fake attack. He later claimed it was a racist and homophobic hate crime.</p><p>Matt Finn is in Chicago with this latest chapter. Matt, is this - 16 counts, were you expecting this?</p><p>MATT FINN, FOX NEWS REPORTER: Right now, we are working to independently confirm this Brian. I just spoke to a clerk at the Cook County Criminal Court who over the phone told me that a grand jury did return 16 additional charges against Jussie Smollett. The courts just closed here, so unfortunately don't have the documentation in front of us to confirm this.</p><p>But there are several news outlets here in Chicago right now that are reporting a grand jury just returned an indictment with 16 additional charges against Jussie Smollett for disorderly conduct, for filing a false police report, apparently for all of the additional follow-up interviews and reports that Jussie Smollett gave to officers and detectives.</p><p>Smollett was originally charged with just one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report for his alleged hate crime in which he claimed President Trump supporters beat him, put a noose around his neck, and called him racial and homophobic slurs.</p><p>The actor now is apparently in much more legal trouble. This new set of charges each carries a possible sentence of probation to four years in prison. He's already pleaded not guilty to that initial first charge, but he's currently free on $100,000 bond, Brian.</p><p>KILMEADE: All right, Matt. Well, have not heard from that camp, I will have to say that it's getting a lot more serious. Meanwhile let's work this around the table. First off, what do you think, Juan, 16 counts?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I imagine that what they've - what the indictment says I'm reading here there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed. So Smollett says not guilty, and in fact he went to the set of Empire and told his colleagues that this was not true that he in fact was sticking by his original story.</p><p>Apparently, even after the delays orchestrated by his lawyers to try to introduce more evidence, the grand jury didn't buy it. And so, Smollett, it seems to me is in deeper water as a liar.</p><p>KILMEADE: Not at least he's got to free up his friends. He's got Queen Latifah and other on the set standing by him because of their friendship, come on.</p><p>BOOTHE: Well it was just surprising, because just on its face, the story didn't seem to be credible right. But what Smollett knew was he understood how so many people in the media on the Left see the world and so that's how this story played into that, and also their assumptions about Trump and Trump supporters, that they are racist, that they're homophobic, that they're all these things.</p><p>It's the same thing as the Covington kids story where the media bought the narrative, because it's the way that they view the world.</p><p>KILMEADE: He's scheduled to be arraigned on the 14th. We'll find out for sure, Matt Finn couldn't independently confirm that. Let's--</p><p>PERINO: Yes, and I think it's pretty solid. And also the other thing is, remember his defense attorney said that they were going to prove to all of us that it was a hoax. We haven't heard one thing about that since then. And a grand jury is made up of the citizens of Chicago, who have returned this indictment in a grand jury setting and that's obviously very serious. That doesn't happen if there's nothing there.</p><p>KILMEADE: Right, Greg you are writing something down, is it your list for this weekend, you got something to say?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, I was just - I was writing one of my Brian Kilmeade insults.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD: I keep forgetting them when I speak to Dana.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I thought it was number four at aqueduct business.</p><p>GUTFELD: I wish.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I predict that he will become - he will choose the victim route, right. He will say that work pressure, maybe drug addiction, a life of discrimination, and the consensus media will probably embrace that and they will - and they will already - I think it was already happening with The Hollywood Reporter or maybe Variety that put him up there and said he's a victim, he's a victim, so he will go the victim route.</p><p>Will the media learn? No, right now on CNN, I was watching CNN, they had a chiron hate in America right. That was it, so what they actually did to the police years ago, where they create the illusion of panic, they're doing with hate crimes and they can't even realize that they're burning their hands on the Smollett stove that they haven't learned a single lesson. They are going to cling to this hysteria and it's going to create more hoaxes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So go back over what you said.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You said drugs, he's going to use drugs in this--</p><p>PERINO: He already has.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What was the other one?</p><p>GUTFELD: I will say that he would claim that it is lifetime of discrimination. I will say work pressure.</p><p>KILMEADE: It's happened to him before, but this is just a - or he made it up?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, that's the argument.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's what I - as a lawyer, that's what I would tell him.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Really? I'm not high--</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD: And I'm not a lawyer.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think the drugs is the best guess. Apparently he's on record buying drugs through these two guys that he's then hired, right.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. Ma'am?</p><p>KILMEADE: Dana?</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE: When's this going away? I mean I've never heard of Jussie Smollett before. Can I soon forget him?</p><p>PERINO: You can, but I think to Greg's point, there will be others. This is - it is something you think that how could this possibly happen that you have these hoaxes, but you had so many over the years. And because you have this people, remember Eric Dezenhall who Greg interviewed on his Fox Nation Show, and he's a crisis communications guy.</p><p>He says that these people that perpetrate these hoaxes, these celebrities, especially that they don't even realize that they've been had or that they've been caught. And we're all way ahead of him, like the grand jury's way ahead of him, and he in his mind so thinks that he's a victim. It's just something that you and I can't really understand, because we wouldn't do this, hopefully.</p><p>WILLAIMS: Well I will say this, I mean as much as I and I think the grand jury - and grand juries as the famous saying goes will indict a ham sandwich if the prosecutors wanted, but I think in this case the amount of evidence is becoming pretty persuasive in my mind.</p><p>But I do think that hate crimes and the spike in hate crimes is very real in this country, and I think that the victim here is not Jussie Smollett, it's all the people who have to endure real hate crime and now will be doubted.</p><p>GUTFELD: But Juan, I agree with you on the last part, but I still have to disagree with you - there's no spike. But there are people who are victims of hate crimes, I'll give you that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Okay.</p><p>KILMEADE: All right, that's all.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD: That's all.</p><p>KILMEADE: You just take my camera and I'll just--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>-- and then argue with Dana in the break.</p><p>PERINO: I'm going to win.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KILMEADE: Yes, as usual. Hey, don't go anywhere, fan mail is next. Why didn't I get my own shot, why do I have to share with--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Dancing Queen, not by ABBA. Fan Mail Friday, let's get started. Kimberly W. writes, I know Greg will love this one - of course - if a robot could just take over one of your daily tasks, I know which one mine would be, what task would you give it? Brian? Come on.</p><p>KILMEADE: Is that what this is--</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE: --generic thing though.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: You know what, do you not watch this show?</p><p>KILMEADE: On Friday, I don't. I'm usually at some Happy Hour, and there's a Ladies Night.</p><p>GUTFELD: There's no Happy Hour here.</p><p>KILMEADE: But I would say this.</p><p>PERINO: You got a Ladies Night?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KILMEADE: I would--</p><p>GUTFELD: You are a strange man. Answer the question.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: Maybe the robot should do THE FIVE for you.</p><p>KILMEADE: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: I think that's what we figured out.</p><p>KILMEADE: No, I would say--</p><p>WILLIAMS: Don't you dare put any money in my garter.</p><p>KILMEADE: I would like the robot to walk my dogs.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh there you go.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KILMEADE: It is too cold right now, and they are prepared for this, I'm not.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think driving, but that's coming, isn't it?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Because I get - but the thing is I don't like losing the control by not driving, because I like driving to some extent.</p><p>KILMEADE: It's like therapy for him.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PERINO: Every Friday.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD: He works through the answer. Dana?</p><p>PERINO: I'm going to say making my bed, because I like a real tight corner.</p><p>GUTFELD: Don't make it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PERINO: You always make your bed, that's the number one first thing you do.</p><p>GUTFELD: You like it, you feel great, when you come home to a made bed.</p><p>BOOTHE: That's true though, also you just feel more organized as you start your day. I would say laundry because living in New York, I don't have a washer dryer in my apartment. You walk down the hall, then you've got to do the laundry, then you have to wait, it takes like two hours and then you have to fold and it's just this entire process that wastes a bunch of time.</p><p>PERINO: That's happening now, there's a robot that's going to fold.</p><p>BOOTHE: Well, they fold, it would be a lot more efficient and better at folding than I am.</p><p>PERINO: Exactly.</p><p>KILMEADE: We are going to have nothing to as people.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: My daily task would be helping children. It takes up a lot of my time.</p><p>KILMEADE: You want a robot to do that?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, because it takes most of my morning.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BOOTHE: You have such a big heart.</p><p>GUTFELD: I do, yes, medically even.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>All right, frenchifirecracker of course, have you ever sent a text message- -</p><p>BOOTHE: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: --to the wrong person? Who?</p><p>PERINO: Yes, so I can't - I don't remember who it was but, it wasn't bad, thank goodness.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, well that's a great story.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PERINO: One time it happened at The White House, it was an email though, and instead of setting it to Dana Perino, my staffer sent it to Dana Milbank of The Washington Post. It was - thankfully it was not fatal.</p><p>GUTFELD: You know what's interesting - do you have - but you're a more famous Dana.</p><p>PERINO: I don't know, I mean Dana Milbank is pretty famous.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, you're way more famous than Dana Milbank.</p><p>PERINO: I'm not in a contest with Dana Milbank.</p><p>GUTFELD: People at home don't even know who Dana Milbank is.</p><p>KILMEADE: Now my producer - our producer here for this, which used to be the Fox &amp; Friends producer--</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE: Megan, do you remember the text message I sent by mistake, could you--</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>--could you what you think I spellchecked it to? Can you tell me? All right, I'm not allowed to say.</p><p>PERINO: Wow, it must've been bad.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's amazing, because he--</p><p>KILMEADE: It was so bad.</p><p>GUTFELD: At people at home, we have producers in our ears and they told Brian, he's not to tell that story.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KILMEADE: Okay, Lisa?</p><p>BOOTHE: (inaudible) this is probably, well so when I was working on Capitol Hill, I accidentally sent, it's an email, not a text message, to a constituent and I had meant to send it to one of my coworkers, it was about our happy hour plan.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD: The constituent was happy?</p><p>BOOTHE: I know, but it was like super embarrassing, yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I mean I've hit reply all when I sent it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But the biggest one was you write an email and then all of a sudden WikiLeaks or somebody scoops in, like I sent an email to (inaudible) and suddenly everybody's telling me, hey why did you say that, why do you do that, and I was like Oh my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: I forgot about that, yes you were actually - that's what scares me, that's going to happen to me. Thank God I don't send any like reply-all emails or things like that.</p><p>PERINO: That's tricky sometimes.</p><p>GUTFELD: I - somebody sent the wrong message to me and that was hilarious.</p><p>PERINO: Was it about you?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes it was about me, so the person--</p><p>KILMEADE: Was it good?</p><p>GUTFELD: No, the person used to work - doesn't work here anymore, but was talking about me and how I dressed and sent it to me.</p><p>PERINO: Oh my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: It was fantastic.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: How you dressed?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, I was--</p><p>PERINO: What's wrong with how you dress?</p><p>GUTFELD: I will tell you later. It was just it was just a really--</p><p>KILMEADE: Was it Phil Hammer (ph)?</p><p>GUTFELD: No, the person's gone now.</p><p>This is a great question, what one thing did you not realize you were dead wrong about your whole life until the last few years?</p><p>PERINO: Always for me, it's always music. I don't know that songs are about whatever and usually I find out right here on set, because oh I like that song, like oh you like that, oh I didn't know what that was all about.</p><p>GUTFELD: You know what (inaudible) is about right?</p><p>PERINO: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh somebody tell her. Brian?</p><p>KILMEADE: Pass.</p><p>I have no idea, this is such--</p><p>GUTFELD: So you've been - you've never changed your mind?</p><p>KILMEADE: I like to prepare for segments, who do--</p><p>PERINO: No, you need to - okay, if you are going to be our favorite villain with Jesse, you've got to be able to do this, that's the thing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, while I ask it to somebody else, you can think. Juan, one thing you didn't realize you were dead wrong about your whole life until the last few years?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know, this one is hard. I thought I was wrong once but I was mistaken, I don't know.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD: Lisa?</p><p>BOOTHE: Gosh, I don't - yes, this is a hard one. I mean, there's a lot of things I have probably been wrong about my entire life. Maybe I'm still wrong about them.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, there you go. Brian, you just can't think of any?</p><p>KILMEADE: Well, I'll say this, I thought it would be fun to have a rabbit.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And I thought (inaudible) checking every day, I'm like why is he still alive? It was not fun. The rabbit lasted 10 years.</p><p>PERINO: You know what, you should let your dogs go after the rabbit. Kidding, everybody! Kidding.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KILMEADE: But the rabbit had 10 great years and I miss him today.</p><p>GUTFELD: Interesting.</p><p>I realized it would be - I used to think having Brian on the table would be fun.</p><p>KILMEADE: That's wrong.</p><p>GUTFELD: I had something else, but I got to go. One More Thing is up next.</p><p>PERINO: Time now for one more thing. Greg?</p><p>GUTFELD: Some sad news to start this off. Tom Shillue's father passed away today. His name is Bill Shillue. I didn't know him, but I figure he must have been a great guy, because he raised a great guy. Everyone loves Tom and loves Tom.</p><p>So, if he is like Tom, he was an awesome dude and I'm sure he had a long and great life. So, our condolences from everyone here on THE FIVE and The GG Show and everywhere else at Fox.</p><p>All right, so let's get to the less deep stuff. Greg Gutfeld Show tomorrow Saturday 10 p.m. I got Heather Zumarraga, Rob Long, Kat Timpf, Tyrus. That's 10 pm, greatest show in the universe.</p><p>PERINO: Best show ever. Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right, he hit the jackpot, yes, $273 million in the Mega Millions Jackpot game. But first, Mike Weirsky had to find the lottery ticket. He had left them at the store. Here's Mike.</p><p>PERINO: That's amazing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE WEIRSKY, MEGA MILLIONS JACKPOT WINNER: I put the tickets down to put my money away, did something with my phone and just walked away.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: After realizing he lost the tickets, he went back to the Phillipsburg QuickChek, and to his surprise, he was told that someone turned in the tickets, a stranger. Two days later, the unemployed Weirsky realized, hey these are the winning numbers and he was a multimillionaire. As for the stranger who found the tickets, listen to Mike.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEIRSKY: I'm looking for the guy that handed them in. I have got to find him and thank him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, well I think that's great. He should thank the lucky stars. St. Patrick's Day is coming, he's a lucky guy.</p><p>PERINO: I've got a nice story here. So, most kids spend their snow days sleeping in, but not these kids in New Jersey. Patrick Lanigan is a senior at Persephone High School, he rallied his friends and classmates to help shovel a neighbour's driveway at 4:30 a.m.</p><p>So, the neighbor is Natalie Blair (ph) and she's currently on kidney dialysis and would not have been able to make her 6:00 a.m. treatment because an ambulance has to come and pick her up. So, Patrick and friends had a sleepover, where they played video games all night, to make sure they wouldn't dozen off before morning.</p><p>And within just half hour of shoveling, they cleared the path and of course Natalie (ph) said Patrick is a wonderful young man and thanked all of his friends. And what a good example they set, these nice young guys. Brian?</p><p>KILMEADE: Yes, this is a great story. So, happy birthday to the most - to the highest paid lineman on the Cleveland Browns. What a classy thing to do, they witnessed - they said happy birthday to 29-year-old Kevin Zeitler. Isn't that nice?</p><p>Two hours later, they traded Kevin Zeitler to the New York Giants for Olivier Vernon. So, he is now in New York Giants, but he just knows that his old team wished him happy birthday. It looks like an even swap. Vernon was getting paid too much for not doing enough. He also sat during the national anthem. So, the Giants offensive lineman, and now the Browns have another great player. The Browns are going to be a force this year.</p><p>PERINO: Okay, well we will revisit back next year. Lisa?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BOOTHE: All right, well don't mess with three year old preschooler Kenley (ph) McFetridge, she got in trouble with her teacher for putting little Jack in a headlock after he asked her to marry her. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What happened at school?</p><p>KENLEY (ph) MCFETRIDGE: I took a headlock down on Jack and took him down.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You took him down? Why, what did he say?</p><p>KENLEY (ph) MCFETRIDGE: Because kids don't get married.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOOTHE: So, when her mom Kristen (ph) told her that she's not supposed to put boys in a headlock, she replied but that's the greatest thing ever.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: It is International Women's Day of course. All right, that's it for us. We'll see you back here on Monday. \"SPECIAL REPORT\" is up next with Chris Wallace tonight.</p><p>Hey, Chris.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019030801cb258</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKR-2HV1-JB20-G2RH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7577\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Michael Cohen</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Music Industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sexual Harassment, Chicago</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Empire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jussie Smollett</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tom Shillue</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bill Shillue</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>R.

That's right; Pelosi suggested that freedom of expression for social media companies is a #8216;gift#8217; and a #8216;privilege.#8217;[1]Related: FIRE Gives UNH Green Light for Free Speech (Again) Despite Social Media Policy[2] She believes freedom of speech can be rescinded[3] if tech companies don't move in the direction she wants.The Pelosi starting pointThat campaign has had some opposition. It has not gone far, but Pelosi hasn't given up. </p><p>In a press conference earlier this month, she slammed Facebook for #8216;misleading the American people[4].#8217; According to #8216;The Verge[5]#8217; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took Facebook to task during her weekly press briefing. She was accusing the social media company of #8216;schmoozing[6]#8217; the Trump administration out of tougher regulation. Pelosi said about the social media giant: They have been very irresponsible I think their behavior is shameful Facebook's business model is strictly to make money. They don't care about the impact on children. Facebook doesn't care about the impact on truth. They don't care[7] about where this is all coming from, and they have said that even if they know it is not true, they will print it. The first step in controlling social media is discrediting the companies in the space. That is done by discrediting them in the minds of the American people. It looks like that's exactly what Pelosi plans to do. Maybe that will be the Democrats next big lie[8]. Big tech is not blameless, but Pelosi's agenda begs the question: If Facebook can't decide what appears on its platform, who can[9]?Trust big government or trust big tech? Pelosi and federal officials[10] would suggest that they are more trustworthy than private companies. They would be wrong. The companies in Silicon Valley have huge investments in the products and services they provide.Those companies should operate within the framework of the law. One thing we know for sure is the American people can trust politicians to dictate what does and doesn't go viral because they have our best interests at heart Right? Well, maybe not, just think about their past performance. Federal politicians are, if anything, less trustworthy[11] than big tech companies. It's time their big-government campaigns end. We have free speech. We like free speech and it is a very good idea to continue it. Politicians like Pelosi will never stop trying to accrue power. John Emerich Edward Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton, 13th Marquess of Groppoli, KCVO DL (10 January 1834 #8212; 19 June 1902), from #8216;The Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage of Great Britain and Ireland. London: Whitaker and Co.#8217; said #8216;Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men[12]#8217; It is just as true for women. Pelosi is a democrat, her party follows[13] her lead. She has power in mind, not your best interest. Pelosi plans to control what people post on social media and she may do it if we don't stop her.

Many of them are based just outside her San Francisco district, and they've been her donors. She's been their booster. Lately, the relationship has been a bit rocky. Scandals in the tech industry plus Russia's use of social media to spread disinformation have given Pelosi pause. And now House Democrats are looking at whether the tech industry has grown too powerful. NPR's Tim Mak has more.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TIM MAK:                 Prior to 2016, big tech was a sector where Democrats could obtain clean money - uncontroversial funds to propel their campaigns. Jeff Hauser heads a watchdog group - the Revolving Door Project.             </p><p>JEFF HAUSER:                 The Democratic Party in the '90s found Wall Street money to be quite amenable. They liked all these well-educated elites on Wall Street. That became toxic in 2008, and that funding source for Democrats has been replaced by big tech for the last decade.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Speaker Pelosi is no exception. Over her career, she has received six-figure sums from Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent of Google. She has also taken in more than $76,000 from Facebook. Here's Sheila Krumholz, who leads the Center for Responsive Politics, talking about the total amount of money Pelosi has received from tech firms.             </p><p>SHEILA KRUMHOLZ:                 They've delivered over $1.3 million over many years.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Congress has had a hands-off attitude for this industry. But for many Democrats, the 2016 Russian disinformation campaign was a turning point, and there have been rising concerns about consumer privacy. Here's Sarah Miller, who is a co-chair of Freedom From Facebook, a progressive coalition calling for Facebook's breakup.             </p><p>SARAH MILLER:                 I don't think that progressives really understood the core business models of these companies and how they are based on kind of deep surveillance of their users.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 And this problem was made personal for Facebook when this altered false video, suggesting she was drunk, made the rounds on Facebook.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>NANCY PELOSI:                 Basically saying back to me, why would I work with you if you're investigating me?             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 In reality, Pelosi doesn't even drink. But Facebook kept the video up, choosing instead to flag it as false and limit the video's distribution. Pelosi was indignant in an interview with NPR affiliate KQED.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)                </p><p>NANCY PELOSI:                 Facebook has proven, by not taking down something they know is false, that they were willing enablers of the Russian interference in our elections.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Pelosi and her fellow Democrats have now launched an aggressive investigation into whether tech giants have become too powerful. Congressman David Cicilline leads that probe and says the concentration of power in America is part of the reason for wage stagnation.             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 We are living in a monopoly moment. And if you look at, in particular, the digital marketplace - these large, dominant platforms - there's tremendous market concentration. And that presents special implications for workers and consumers and users of those platforms.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Following the fake Pelosi video that made the rounds on Facebook, CEO Mark Zuckerberg made a phone call to the speaker. A source familiar with Pelosi's views told NPR that even now, weeks after the call, she hasn't called Zuckerberg back. And not only that, the source says she has taken a meeting with Chris Hughes, an original Facebook co-founder who is now calling for Facebook to be broken up. Cicilline also said that he had met with Hughes.             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 It's very clear these technology companies cannot be trusted to regulate themselves.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Some of the same tech companies who have been among Pelosi's strongest supporters may soon discover that the instinct to celebrate their innovation is being replaced with an inclination to regulate.             </p><p>                Tim Mak, NPR News, Washington.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-2019070207</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGG-0VD1-JBJH-33JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"750\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 2, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I don't know how all of these should be painted with the same brush, but I think that's a look that should be taken.\"</p><p>Warren released an aggressive plan last month to break up tech giants, targeting the power of Silicon Valley with her populist message as sprawling Internet giants face mounting political backlash ahead of the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>The far-reaching proposal would impose new rules on certain kinds of tech companies with $25 billion or more in annual revenue, forcing Amazon and Google to spin off parts of their companies and relinquish their overwhelming control over online commerce. The plan also aims to unwind some of the highest profile mergers in the industry, like the combinations of Amazon and Whole Foods, and Google and DoubleClick, as well as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>CNN's MJ Lee, Lydia DePillis and Gregory Krieg contributed to this report.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Elizabeth Warren's proposal to break up big companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon, but said \"there could be some clear lines that we see in our community, of companies that maybe could be easily broken up without having any impact, one on the other.\"</p><p>\"I'm a big believer in the antitrust laws, I think that's very important for us to have them and to use them, and to subject those who should be subjected to it. I don't know how all of these should be painted with the same brush, but I think that's a look that should be taken.\"</p><p>Warren released an aggressive plan last month to break up tech giants, targeting the power of Silicon Valley with her populist message as sprawling Internet giants face mounting political backlash ahead of the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>The far-reaching proposal would impose new rules on certain kinds of tech companies with $25 billion or more in annual revenue, forcing Amazon and Google to spin off parts of their companies and relinquish their overwhelming control over online commerce. The plan also aims to unwind some of the highest profile mergers in the industry, like the combinations of Amazon and Whole Foods, and Google and DoubleClick, as well as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20190412nancy-pelosi-tech-regulation-recode-interview1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW5-CCV1-DY60-M133-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"410\"/><timeReceived>4:01 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The company\u2019s equipment commands hefty prices\u2014its cycling bike retails for roughly $2,500 and treadmill (launched in 2018) for roughly $4,000. Plus, it charges $39 for a monthly app membership for online classes.     Its CEO has hinted at releasing a  cheaper bike  within a few years. In the meantime,  Mergermarket  reported last month that the company could engage in acquisitions to take advantage of its strong stock price.     Peloton shares more than doubled from $29.74 in January to $83.03 as of September 1. It has seen a 2.3x increase in share price since its September 2019 IPO at $25.24.     In December 2019, Peloton was facing a social media backlash over a Christmas TV ad that  missed the mark . It suffered a 10.5% fall in share price within a few days and a $1 billion drop in market capitalization.     But when the COVID-19 pandemic shut down gyms across America and spurred stay-at-home orders, Peloton became the \u201cgold standard\u201d in home fitness machines that keep you socially \u201cconnected\u201d while indoors, said several investment bankers.      CFO Jill Woodworth said during the company's third quarter earnings call that the COVID-19 pandemic has expanded Peloton\u2019s market opportunity \u201cmeasurably\u201d and accelerated adoption of connected fitness. Peloton will continue to \u201cinvest aggressively in new products, software (and) fitness programming\u201d, she said.     Competition is growing from fitness clubs, in-studio fitness classes, health and wellness apps, and other branded equipment providers, Peloton has said.     In June, yoga apparel giant  Lululemon Athletica  became a competitor with the $500 million acquisition of  Mirror , a roughly $1,500 connected cardio machine that looks like home furniture and offers online classes with Instagram influencers via an app.       To stay ahead of the curve, Peloton could use its stock position and brand power to buy one or more private equity-backed competitors that complement its cardio portfolio. It could also launch products organically, the bankers said.     Hot M&amp;A targets include California-based  Zwift , which simulates competitive bicycling races like the Tour de France via \u201ctrainers\u201d that cost $800 to $1,200 and attach to one\u2019s bike. The company raised $120 million in a Series B round of funding in 2018.     California-based  Tonal  offers a roughly $3,000 digital strength-training machine that looks like a mirror and has digitally resistant weights. It was valued at $185 million after its $45 million Series C raise in April 2019.      California-based  Tempo Interactive  sells a roughly $2,000 mirror that uses 3D sensors and artificial intelligence to give users real-time feedback on their weight-lifting technique and form. It raised $60 million in new funding this year.     Massachusetts-based Hydrow's rowing machine costs about $2,200. The company raised $27 million last year to fuel national expansion.     Peloton could also use M&amp;A to cross categories into consumables such as energy drinks, protein bars, protein powders or health supplements, said the bankers, reasoning that its customers are likely already buying these products elsewhere.     Down the road, athletic apparel strategics like  Adidas  or  Nike  could follow Lululemon into the category of home workout machines and become a Peloton competitor, they noted. Nike already has the Nike Fitness Club app while Adidas has running and training apps.    Perhaps best suited though to handle the R&amp;D expenses and upkeep of hardware-and-software fitness gadgets, noted the bankers, are consumer-focused Big Tech companies like  Google, Amazon  or  Apple .    Media reports have speculated about a hypothetical  \u2018iBike\u2019  for Apple, for example. And Amazon last month announced the launch of  Halo , a wearable fitness device.    However, the collection of health data by Big Tech is being scrutinized by regulators worldwide.  Google \u2019s $2.1bn acquisition of  Fitbit,  announced in late 2019, awaits a decision by the  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  and the  European Commission . The U.S. Department of Justice began a \u201c second request \u201d review of the acquisition in April.     At-home fitness will remain strong\u2014at least until a COVID-19 vaccine is found, said the bankers. Consumers who have already invested thousands of dollars in at-home gyms are unlikely to return to a shared gym, they noted.     On the Q3 earnings call, CFO Woodworth said Peloton has 2.6 million members and foresees a long runway for growth as there are more than 90 million gym memberships across its target markets of the U.S., UK, Canada and Germany.      Peloton declined to provide comment for this story, citing its quiet period in the run-up to its next earnings report on 10 September.

Since then, the Australian government has proposed new legislation, including prison time for executives and billions of dollars in fines, should platforms fail to rapidly remove \"abhorrent violent material\".</p><p>Mr Walker declined to comment on the legislation, saying he was yet to see it, but acknowledged the reaction globally to the events in Christchurch had been significant.</p><p>\"I think there's no question that the pendulum has swung from the relatively uncritical support of technology to significant concerns about unintended side effects and abuses of technological platforms,\" he said.</p><p>In response to the events in New Zealand, he said the search giant was rethinking some of its technology to stop terrorists online.</p><p>\"We're working on the question of limits on livestreaming [and] other things we can do to be able to quickly respond to these kinds of attacks on our systems,\" Mr Walker said.</p><p>He admitted that videos of terrorist attacks were \"not a new development\" but said the difference this time was how many people worldwide were re-uploading the footage in a co-ordinated way.</p><p>\"That's what created the challenges in removing so much. We saw tens of thousands of uploads, Facebook saw many more than that, which effectively overwhelmed the system, which had effectively been satisfactory up until that point,\" he said.</p><p>\"We're now trying to build systems that allow us to respond quickly in the event of these kinds of attacks or state-sponsored attacks or other sorts of things on the platform.\"</p><p>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims on Sunday welcomed Mr Zuckerberg's \"recognition\" that big tech companies such as Facebook and Google \"have to be accountable for what people see [on their platforms]\".
