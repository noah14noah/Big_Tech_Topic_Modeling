And the answer is definitely 'Yes'.So we will just ride the waves.</p><p>In India, e-commerce and some other consumer internet sectors are still cash-guzzling.Fighting Amazon needs capital...</p><p>Or, you don't have to fight them. There are plenty of other businesses to start where you don't have to burn $50 million per month. There are people who are experts in these businesses where you burn huge amounts of cash, and I'm not one of them. But there are many good companies that can be started that I understand, I just don't have instincts for e-commerce.</p><p>Which companies are you picking from India from the YC batches as the ones becoming big?</p><p>It takes 10 years to find that out, so I'll tell you after seven years. One of the things that has really surprised me about this business is that it takes really long to see results. We invested in Dropbox in 2007 -it is 2017 now and it's still a private company.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_164_07112017016005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PX3-H4F1-JB3N-T4HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Altman says YC -which has backed Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe and boasts of a portfolio of companies valued at $85 billion -has no doubt that India will support a number of important and huge tech startups in the long term. He spoke to TOI about why he's bullish on India, the ever-increasing power of big tech companies, regulation around cryptocurrency and his involvement in bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and the rest of America.Edited excerpts:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">YC's 2017 India intake numbers are the highest in any year. How's that happened?</p><p>We have been going to India for the last few years. We've been fortunate enough to be an investor in a few of the successful companies in India. These founders talk to the startup community there about us. We see this in all the markets across the world: Once we can get the first few wins in a new geography , that perpetuates in the local community and then people say, 'Oh, we've heard of them, founders said they were great'.</p><p>Will you look at setting up an India outpost?</p><p>Our goal is to take the 18 intakes in 2017 and keep increasing that number. We have no current plan to open an outpost, but I bet someday we would. That may be a few years off though.</p><p>Why are you bullish on the Indian startup ecosystem amid uncertainties?</p><p>I like to be bullish when everyone else is bearish.There are very few longterm investors, I think it is</p><p>a big advantage for us that we are one. Most are chasing fashion or trying to make their LPs (limited partners) happy.</p><p>So what's wrong with the tech investing class?</p><p>It is not only about the way funds are structured but also about what they are expected to do that particular year. So if India is hot, they'd be in India. If India is cold, you don't want to be there. But we are excited and will happily make a lot of money in their absence.</p><p>When we met in 2015, a slug of money was coming into India. It's been tougher for startups to raise capital since then...</p><p>We try and not get caught up in what other investors do.The way I look at investing is that, on any given day , what the stock market or any other investor is doing is a random number generator. But over time it does converge to reality . We continue to believe that there is something real happening in India. Like any exciting new thing, there will be ups and downs, there will be bubbles and busts, but we try and take a very longterm view here and not get too distracted by the ups and downs.</p><p>You told me during the heady days that you were not as much worried about the eye-popping valuations as you were about the cash-burn across startups. Is it looking different now?</p><p>I don't know the current cash-burn situation at Indian startups. But in the US,</p><p>in general it feels okay. There are plenty that are burning too much and will die.But on the whole, the burn is relative to the cash on hand, it's reasonable.</p><p>So, are we out of the bubble territory?</p><p>Bubbles are an interesting phenomenon -for bubbles to happen, there has to be something real for people to get too excited about. So, smart people get tricked by bubbles, very famously Isaac Newton fell for the South Sea bubble.Similarly, in India, there was something real going on, people got too excited and then they stopped. It's likely they will get excited again and then stop again.What's important here is that, in the next 20 years, is India a country that supports huge and important technology startups? And the answer is definitely 'Yes'. So we will just ride the waves.</p><p>In India, e-commerce and some other consumer internet sectors are still cash-guzzling. Fighting Amazon needs capital...</p><p>Or, you don't have to fight them. There are plenty of other businesses to start where you don't have to burn $50 million per month.There are people who are experts in these businesses where you burn huge amounts of cash, and I'm not one of them.But there are many good companies that can be started that I understand, I just don't have instincts for ecommerce.</p><p>For full report logon to http:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.timesofindia.com\">www.timesofindia.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_161_07112017016041</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PX3-H4F1-JB3N-T4B1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"719\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Altman says YC -which has backed Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe and boasts of a portfolio of companies valued at $85 billion -has no doubt that India will support a number of important and huge tech startups in the long term. He spoke to TOI about why he's bullish on India, the ever-increasing power of big tech companies, regulation around cryptocurrency and his involvement in bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and the rest of America.Edited excerpts:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">YC's 2017 India intake numbers are the highest in any year. How's that happened?</p><p>We have been going to India for the last few years. We've been fortunate enough to be an investor in a few of the successful companies in India. These founders talk to the startup community there about us. We see this in all the markets across the world: Once we can get the first few wins in a new geography , that perpetuates in the local community and then people say , 'Oh, we've heard of them, founders said they were great'.</p><p>Will you look at setting up</p><p>an India outpost?</p><p>Our goal is to take the 18 intakes in 2017 and keep increasing that number. We have no current plan to open an outpost, but I bet someday we would. That may be a few years off though.</p><p>Why are you bullish on the Indian startup ecosystem amid uncertainties?</p><p>I like to be bullish when everyone else is bearish.There are very few longterm investors, I think it is a big advantage for us that we are one. Most are chasing fashion or trying to make their LPs (limited partners) happy.</p><p>So what's wrong with the tech investing class?</p><p>It is not only about the way funds are structured but also about what they are expected to do that particular year. So if India is hot, they'd be in India. If India is cold, you don't want to be there. But we are excited and will happily make a lot of money in their absence.</p><p>When we met in 2015, a slug of money was coming into India. It's been tougher for startups to</p><p>raise capital since then...</p><p>We try and not get caught up in what other investors do.The way I look at investing is that, on any given day , what the stock market or any other investor is doing is a random number genera</p><p>tor. But over time it does converge to reality . We continue to believe that there is something real happening in India. Like any exciting new thing, there will be ups and downs, there will be bubbles and busts, but we try and take a very longterm view here and not get too distracted by the ups and downs.</p><p>You told me during the heady days that you were not as much worried about the eye-popping valuations as you were about the cash-burn across startups. Is it looking different now?</p><p>I don't know the current cash-burn situation at Indian startups. But in the US, in general it feels okay.There are plenty that are burning too much and will die. But on the whole, the burn is relative to the cash on hand, it's reasonable.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_129_07112017013030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R8J-2781-DXJR-H18G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"527\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Parler reportedly has over 1 million users which is dwarfed by Twitter's 330 million users.

Now that Google Inc. is officially taking bids for its much-hyped initial public offering of stock, it could be my chance to get lucky.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But how much to bid, and for how many shares?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To try and chronicle Google's IPO through the eyes of an average investor, the boss agreed to give me $1,000 of Cox Newspapers' money to join in the fun.</p><p>Any profits, we agreed, will be donated to charity. Any losses hopefully won't affect my employment.</p><p>Like everything about the Web search engine company, Google's $3 billion IPO is unconventional.</p><p>Instead of simply setting an IPO price and selling stock, Google set an \"expected\" range of $108 to $135 for its more than 25 million shares. Prospective investors must submit bids for what they're willing to pay.</p><p>Sometime early next week, Google executives will examine the bids and announce a final offering price. Anybody who bid at or above that price gets to buy shares. Anybody who bid lower is out of luck.</p><p>By using this modified \"Dutch auction\" process, Google hopes to make the IPO process simpler and more democratic, letting little guys like me into a world that up until now was the near-exclusive domain of deep-pocketed venture capitalists and Wall Street investment bankers.</p><p>Since that system used to give the bankers IPO stock at a discount, much to the benefit of big customers and cronies who were cut into the deal, the auction also helps Google squeeze every nickel of value out of its offering.</p><p>Before even getting to the point of figuring out what to bid, I had to leap some unexpected hurdles, ranging from getting a bidder ID to filling out an \"eligibility\" form listing my investing experience and assets. While many small-time investors were apparently found \"ineligible,\" I wasn't one of them. Lucky already, I thought.</p><p>I also had to get some money to my brokerage company, Ameritrade _ and quick, since until a few days ago nobody knew exactly when bidding would open. That took a $20 wire fee and a trip to the bank.</p><p>All along, I kept thinking: What to bid?</p><p>My trials in the run-up to the IPO were nothing compared to final-stretch snafus at Google.</p><p>There was the news that California regulators were investigating whether the company may have illegally sold shares to employees.</p><p>Then came the announcement that rival Yahoo Inc. was settling a patent lawsuit, but only if Google gave it nearly 3 million shares of its stock.</p><p>Then Playboy magazine hit the stands, featuring an interview with Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. The company had to issue a warning that the Securities and Exchange Commission might decide that the article violated the \"quiet period\" that companies are supposed to observe when big stock offerings are pending.</p><p>Despite all that, Google and its designated brokerage firms started taking bids Friday morning.</p><p>I was back to my underlying question: What to bid?</p><p>I tried to think like an individual investor. I re-read Google's 125-page-plus prospectus. I looked for research on the Web and read as much about the company that I could stand.</p><p>Then I did what any astute investor might do. I asked my neighbor, the stockbroker, for advice.</p><p>\"I wouldn't spend a dime on it,\" he said, warning of the unusualness of the IPO, Google's short history and the expensive bid range.</p><p>But this is my job, I told him, and went back to pondering: What to bid?</p><p>That's when I started trying to think how Google's executives, who will have ultimate say over the final IPO price, might be thinking.</p><p>When I met Brin a year or so at the company's headquarters, he rolled in on his weird Segway personal transporter. I had lunch with other \"Googlers\" in the big tent out back. I admired the corporate Lava lamp collection.</p><p>Even without visiting the \"Googleplex,\" anybody knows that this company and its executives thrive on being cute and clever, right down to the kitschy themed cartoons Google uses to adorn its Web site _ on Friday, as opening ceremonies for the Summer Olympic Games were being held, it was Greek gods.</p><p>That's when I decided what to bid.</p><p>My offer: $123.45 per share, a numerical series for a company named after a number.</p><p>That's well within Google's recommended range and lets me buy the minimum five shares required under IPO rules without busting my budget.</p><p>It's also within the only forecast for an eventual valuation range that I could find, the $121 to $127 per share suggested by credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's.</p><p>I was tempted to place my bid of $123.45 for six shares, just to out-cutesy those clever Googlers. But I remembered some things I read about the company's history.</p><p>Google was founded Sept. 7, 1998. It got its first big round of venture-capital funding June 7, 1999.</p><p>There must be something to the digit 7, I thought. At the very least, the innate luckiness of the number 7 might help offset the unluckiness of the date of my bid, Friday the 13th.</p><p>Besides, while I could've afforded eight shares, I wanted enough of the bosses' $1,000 left to pay for brokerage and wire fees, and for some celebratory Mai Tais to mark my entry into tech moguldom.</p><p>So there it was. I placed my bid for $123.45 for seven shares Friday afternoon.</p><p>Now I have to wait until next week, when Google will announce the \"clearing\" price _ the highest price that will encompass bidders for all 25.7 million shares. Soon after, GOOG stock will begin trading on the NASDAQ exchange.</p><p>If I get in, and the IPO performs like Netscape's 168 percent first-day gain in 1995, my $1,000 might soon be worth more than $2,300.</p><p>Of course, plenty of financial analysts have warned about expecting big gains from this IPO. Many warn the price range suggested by Google is far too high.  And recent history, of course, is filled with failed tech companies that had promising IPOS _ including Netscape.</p><p>Even the stock registration form that Google filed with the Securities Exchange Commission lists about 60 specific risks and other warnings to investors, from the fierce competition in the online business to the dangers of fluctuating currency exchange rates.</p><p>But forget all that.</p><p>I'm feeling lucky.</p><p>Bob Keefe's e-mail address is bkeefe(at)coxnews.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COXNWS2004</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4D38-D5F0-000H-C1KS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157001</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1032\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Cox News Service</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2004 Cox Enterprises, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2004\"><dateText>August 13, 2004 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>GOOGLE INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0YAHOO!

The publication attempts to offer a conceptual framework to categorise new digital monies, identify some of their risks, think through the implications, and offer some policy options for central banks to consider. This script, for its informative purpose, largely identifies itself with the 20-page report and the highpoints therein.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New Digital-Money Categories</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Central bank money in the form of cash (the traditional notes and coins) is the most recognisable. Cash is an object-based means of payment. It is denominated in the local unit of account, issued by the central bank, settled in a decentralised fashion among transacting parties, and obviously has a physical appearance.</p><p>The other object-based means of payment that has been categorised in the report is crypto-currency. It is denominated in its own unit of account, it is created (or 'minted') by non-banks, and issued on a block-chain \u2013 commonly of the permissionless type.</p><p>The report also says: \"The most widespread use of claim-based money is b-money, which typically covers commercial bank deposits. In many countries, most payments entail the transfer of funds from one bank account to another; often from one bank to another, and possibly across borders. We associate b-money with debt-like instruments denominated in a unit of account, redeemable upon demand at face value. Transfers are most commonly carried out through centralised technologies, as in the case of debit cards, wire transfers, and cheques\".</p><p>Fourth, it states: \"E-money is emerging as a prominent new player in the payments landscape. Its single-most important innovation relative to crypto-currencies is to issue claims that can be redeemed in currency at face value upon demand. It is a debt-like instrument and redemption guarantees are not backstopped by governments. They merely rest on prudent management and legal protection of assets available for redemption. Transfers can be centralised, as in the case of many of the popular payment solutions in Asia and Africa \u2013 including Alipay and WeChat Pay in China, Paytm in India, and M-Pesa in East Africa (also called 'stored value facilities').</p><p>Fifth, it reveals that \"I-money is a potential new means of payment, though one which may or may not take off. I-money is equivalent to e-money, except for a very important feature \u2014 it offers variable value redemptions into currency; it is thus an equity-like instrument. I-money entails a claim on assets, typically a commodity such as gold or shares of a portfolio. Examples of gold-backed i-money are Digital Swiss Gold (DSG) and Novem\".</p><p>Adoption of e-money could be rapid</p><p>Regarding the adoption e-money, the report in part states:\" If a means of payment\u2014either claim or object\u2014has stable value in the unit of account most relevant to users, it is much more likely to be widely adopted. For one, parties will agree to hold it at least for the time it takes to complete the transaction. In addition, they will more easily agree on its value relative to the contracted transaction price, usually expressed in a common unit of account. Stable value is thus a necessary condition for an object or claim to be widely used as a means of payment\".</p><p>Effects of E-money on the Banking Sector</p><p>In the highlights: \"If e-monies took off because of their attractiveness as means of payment, backed by large big-tech firms with large existing user bases \u2014 or nimble fintech start-ups \u2014 will that spell the demise of b-money and the banks behind them? Will retail bank deposits migrate to e-money providers in large amounts?\" The report identifies these three (3) scenarios:</p><p>Coexistence</p><p>E-money and b-money will coexist \u2013 but associated with what the report describes as the \"battle\", wherein banks are often in a position of strength. \"They have captive users\u2014though potentially much smaller user bases than large big-tech firms \u2014 and strong distribution networks. They can cross-sell other financial services to customers, including means to overcome cash-in-advance constraints by offering overdraft protection or credit lines.</p><p>\"Moreover, e-money providers might recycle many of their client funds back to banks, as certificates of deposit or other forms of short-term funding. Clearly, from the banks' standpoint, the outcome is not optimal. First, they would swap cheap and stable retail funding for expensive and runnable wholesale funding. Second, they could be cut off from client relationships, and third, they could lose access to valuable data on customer transactions.</p><p>\"In addition, funding from e-money providers might be concentrated in a few large banks (though it would eventually trickle down to other banks). So, smaller banks might feel greater funding strains or, at least, experience greater volatility in funding.\"</p><p>It further states: \"Banks have leeway to raise interest on deposits. Since banks make profits from maturity transformation (holding assets of longer-term than deposit liabilities), they may be able to offer higher interest than e-money providers, even than conservative i-money providers (note, Libra has announced that it will not offer any interest to users). E-money providers must hold very liquid assets, and thus could offer approximately overnight money market rates. Higher rates on deposits could be met with greater operational efficiency, lower profits, and potentially slightly higher lending rates\".</p><p>Andolfatto (2018) argues that if banks start from a position of market power, there is leeway to increase rates on deposits without significant macroeconomic consequences. Drechsler, Savov, and Schnabl (2018) point to banks' market power as a prime explanation for the low and stable rates they tend to pay on deposits across countries. However, banks must cover distinct costs such as deposit insurance fees, regulatory costs, and branch networks.</p><p>\"Banks could also rival the quality of payment services in e-money, at least domestically, though not necessarily across borders. In fact, b-money has grown increasingly convenient thanks to payment innovations such as touchless cards and phone-based apps that facilitate payments by debit cards\u2014such as Venmo, Zelle, or Apple Pay Cash in the United States.\"</p><p>Again, the insightful report identifies the fact that \"more fundamental change is also possible through \"fast payment' systems rolled out by central banks in many countries (as TIPS\u2014TARGET instant payment settlement\u2014in the euro area), allowing banks to settle retail transactions in near real-time at negligible cost. A related example, though developed by a consortium of banks, is Swish in Sweden. Even JPM Coin is a prominent example of how banks are fighting back by entering the e-money space.</p><p>But will banks adapt fast enough? Can they live and breathe online customer satisfaction, user-centred design, and integration with social media the way big-techs do? Are they sufficiently agile to change business models? Some will no doubt be left behind. Others will evolve, but must do so quickly\".</p><p>It continues: \"In the transition, central banks can help. They can provide temporary liquidity if banks lose deposits rapidly. But central banks will be reluctant to offer this crutch for too long, as their balance sheets might grow and they could become embroiled in difficult lending decisions. Short of this, banks can also find alternative forms of funding by issuing longer-term debt or equity\".</p><p>Complementarity</p><p>In the second scenario, \"e-money providers could complement commercial banks. This outcome is already visible in some low-income and emerging market economies. E-money can draw poorer households and small businesses into the formal economy, familiarise them with new technologies and encourage them to migrate from making payments to seeking credit; more complex saving instruments; accounting services, and financial advice provided by commercial banks. In Kenya, for example, credit growth increased steadily for several years as e-money was being rapidly adopted after 2008\".</p><p>\"But even in advanced economies, a partnership can be envisioned. E-money providers could leverage their data to estimate customers' creditworthiness and sell their findings to banks or intermediate bank funding for a more efficient allocation of credit. Moreover, it is perfectly possible that some of the larger e-money providers will eventually migrate to the banking business \u2013 bolstered by the data they have accumulated and their scale, and attracted by the margins from maturity transformation. Thus, while today's brands could disappear, the banking model is unlikely to be forgotten.\"</p><p>Takeover</p><p>Thirdly, \"a radical transformation of the banking model whereby banks mostly rely on wholesale funding, and credit is increasingly intermediated. Commercial banks' deposit-taking and credit functions could be split. The deposits we hold for payment purposes could migrate to e-money, and in turn could be held abroad in government bonds, or in central bank money. And those we hold as savings could be channeled to mutual funds, hedge funds, and capital markets for the allocation of credit\".</p><p>Alternatively, they could remain in banks \u2013 which would themselves mostly rely on wholesale funding. The result would be a very different world and a very different banking model. It would greatly limit fractional banking. Fractional banks take deposits but only hold a fraction of them in liquid assets such as central bank reserves and government bonds; the rest is lent to households and firms and thus helps the economy grow.</p><p>Today's World</p><p>The IMF 'Fintech Notes' confirm the traditional role of central banks and other regulators. Thus, they help ensure the safety of our deposits by supervising banks and offering liquidity when needed. They also settle payments between banks since banks hold accounts at the central bank, and a payment from one to the other is settled by transferring perfectly safe funds (called central bank reserves) from one account to another. The question for tomorrow's world is: what If E-money providers could hold central bank reserves?</p><p>Concise and interesting responses to this question and other implications of e-money are contained in the full report via:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fintech-notes/Issues/2019/07/12/The-Rise-of-Digital-Money-47097\">https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fintech-notes/Issues/2019/07/12/The-Rise-of-Digital-Money-47097</url> Thank you for reading!

Among such challenges, I would like to focus on Fintech and climate change. In many respects these issues are fundamentally different, one involving the Earth's complex climatic system and its interactions with the economy, while the other concerns technical innovations shaping the structure of the financial system. But they have some similarities, most importantly in the fundamental need for close cooperation within the global community.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fintech</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Financial technologies, or \"Fintech,\" are advancing rapidly, and have already significantly altered the way that many people and companies make payments, borrow money, manage their savings and investments, insure their risks, and receive financial advice. Fintech builds on the foundations of mobile communications especially smartphones, cryptography, and on the interlinked rise of Big Data and data science including AI.</p><p>Sweden has been on the cutting edge of these developments, as seen in the rapid rise in digital payments via Swish, a company that I enjoyed visiting earlier today! It is also seen in the efficiency of Swedish banks measured by their relatively low cost-to-revenue ratios.</p><p>On top of reducing financial service costs, Fintech holds promise for financial inclusion. This has already been evident in low income countries where mobile phones have bought payment and credit services with profound impacts on economic opportunities. In Kenya, for example, about 90 percent of the population over 14 years of age pays with M-Pesa.</p><p>So there are good reasons for countries to be open to the development and use of Fintech. But, we need to be aware that new technology can also lead to very rapid change. One scenario is that \"Big Tech\" companies enter the payments and credit markets, and quickly become major players in financial services given their large user base. Another scenario is that some banks adapt more quickly to Fintech than others, leading to sizable movements in market shares over time.</p><p>Change is part of the process of benefitting from Fintech. But very rapid and deep changes in financial systems can entail stability risks. Recall the financial liberalizations of the 1980s, when the transition from credit controls and other regulation to reliance on market forces led to an easing in credit standards, asset price booms especially in commercial real estate, culminating in serious banking crises including in the Nordic countries.</p><p>Countries around the world therefore face a shared challenge of finding a balanced framework that promotes financial innovation while preserving stability. As the Nordic-Baltic region is now aware, financial integrity is also essential to a sound and stable financial system, so the framework for Fintech must also address money laundering and other threats to integrity along with consumer protection.</p><p>The IMF is an institution charged with a mandate for economic and financial stability, including by supporting inclusive growth, so we must find ways to support countries in developing such frameworks.</p><p>How are we doing our job? In October 2018, we launched the \"Bali Fintech Agenda\" which is a framework of 12 high-level issues for consideration by countries, that is organized around four objectives:</p><p>- Building an enabling environment for fintech innovation;</p><p>- Ensuring an adequate financial sector policy framework;</p><p>- Addressing risks and resilience; and</p><p>- Encouraging international collaboration.</p><p>In terms of an enabling environment for Fintech, it is clear that small start-up companies are not ready to deal with multiple financial regulators, or to properly manage the type of off-site and on-site supervision expected of an established intermediary. So the authorities in some countries are using regulatory \"sandboxes\" and other tools to facilitate Fintech.</p><p>But new entrants should not gain competitive advantage from lighter regulatory standards, nor should consumer protection, financial integrity, or macroprudential goals, be compromised. Supervisors around the world need to keep a close eye on market developments, and act quickly to ensure the playing field remains level.</p><p>Sweden's FSA set a sound example in this respect by applying consistent consumer protection and macroprudential requirements to nonbanks entering into the mortgage market. This approach, of applying financial sector policies to activities rather than entities, will be critically important to managing stability and integrity risks from Fintech.</p><p>Central banks and supervisors have well developed tools for monitoring and reporting on financial sector risks. This work will increasingly need address how technology is reshaping the system and its risks. Ensuring that the data used covers financial activities wherever they occur is key. Sweden's Financial Stability Council, and their equivalents elsewhere, have an essential role in avoiding supervisory gaps related to Fintech.</p><p>International collaboration is more important than might first appear. By the nature of the internet and telecommunications, Fintech is global in reach, and payments and other financial services can cross borders at little cost seeking arbitrage opportunities. Fintech innovations can also spread rapidly across countries. In many respects, this mobility is welcome, but it also calls on countries to keep an eye on trends beyond their borders.</p><p>We at the IMF need to help countries by providing visibility on emerging Fintech developments, and also on practices that could help countries enjoy the benefits of Fintech and manage stability and integrity risks. But I should caution that the effects of technological change can be difficult to anticipate, so we are all in a \"learning by doing\" process.</p><p>It is therefore very encouraging that Sweden, as a leader in thinking through the implications of many Fintech issues, is also active in sharing its experiences with other countries.</p><p>Climate Change</p><p>I will now turn to the second topic of relevance to the Fund and its membership in the medium and long term. Indeed, it is a topic that deserves our full attention, given its potential to affect the entire world in the years ahead. The process of climate change is set to have a significant economic impact on many countries, with a large number of lower-income countries being particularly at risk.</p><p>Climate change matters to the IMF because it may have profound implications for economic and financial stability, which we are charged to protect under the IMF's Articles of Agreement. The world will need to learn to live with climate change over the medium and longer term, and this adaptation will have macroeconomic and fiscal implications. But with concerted action, the world can also do more to mitigate climate change.</p><p>Given our fiscal policy expertise and universal membership, the Fund is uniquely positioned to help countries formulate their climate strategies. Our climate-related work at the Fund encompasses carbon taxation, climate mitigation and adaptation; resilience to natural disasters, and energy subsidy reforms. For example, a recent Executive Board paper develops, for 135 countries, a tool for assessing the emissions, fiscal, and economic welfare impacts of carbon pricing and a range of other mitigation instruments to help policymakers understand tradeoffs.</p><p>Finance ministries around the world remain poised to play a pivotal role. A key challenge for you is how best to use your expertise and experience with macroeconomic and fiscal policy, public financial management, and financial regulation to respond to the climate crisis. Your actions will be critical, whether this be in administering charges on the carbon content of fuels and ensuring the revenues are put to good use, or by providing other incentives to reduce energy consumption, use cleaner fuels, and mobilize private finance.</p><p>At the Fund, our work has found that carbon taxation is a practical way to price carbon. It raises revenue that permits tax reductions in other areas and creates incentives to shift to cleaner forms of energy. In many cases, carbon taxes are a straightforward extension of existing motor fuel excises, which are well established in many countries and among the easiest of taxes to administer. Countries need only build a carbon charge into the existing tax scheme and apply similar charges to other fossil fuel products.</p><p>Of course, some countries may prefer other ways of pricing carbon, for example, through emissions trading systems. The point is to establish, one way or another, a price on CO2 emissions and thereby incentivize the entire economy to shift to cleaner energy sources and conserve on the use of electricity and fuels. Our own message here at the Fund continues to be \"price it right, do it smart, and do it now.\"</p><p>Support for concerted action is growing, as is the commitment among policymakers to act. At the grassroots level, the younger generationpeople like Greta Thunbergare increasingly urging that stronger action be taken now. Likewise, at the international level, encouraging steps are underway. At the IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings last April, a group of finance ministers committed to respond to the threat posed by climate change by implementing the Helsinki Principles that will help strengthen nuts-and-bolts policymaking. The principles are designed to support finance ministers to share best practices and experiences on macro, fiscal, and public financial management policies for low-carbon, climate-resilient growth.</p><p>For its part, the IMF is committed to strengthening the international community's ability to address climate change through the policy advice and capacity development that we offer to governments, with our research capabilities, and by providing programs and financing tailored to climate-related needs.</p><p>I look forward to hearing your views on the Fund's climate-related work during today's discussion.</p><p>IMF Communications Department</p><p>MEDIA RELATIONS</p><p>PRESS OFFICER: Gediminas Vilkas</p><p>Phone: +1 202 623-7100 Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:MEDIA@IMF.org\">MEDIA@IMF.org</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122998945</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB7-XG91-DYTH-G378-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1700\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 13, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Among such challenges, I would like to focus on Fintech and climate change. In many respects these issues are fundamentally different, one involving the Earth's complex climatic system and its interactions with the economy, while the other concerns technical innovations shaping the structure of the financial system. But they have some similarities, most importantly in the fundamental need for close cooperation within the global community.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FINTECH</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Financial technologies, or \"Fintech,\" are advancing rapidly, and have already significantly altered the way that many people and companies make payments, borrow money, manage their savings and investments, insure their risks, and receive financial advice. Fintech builds on the foundations of mobile communications especially smartphones, cryptography, and on the interlinked rise of Big Data and data science including AI.</p><p>Sweden has been on the cutting edge of these developments, as seen in the rapid rise in digital payments via Swish, a company that I enjoyed visiting earlier today! It is also seen in the efficiency of Swedish banks measured by their relatively low cost-to-revenue ratios.</p><p>On top of reducing financial service costs, Fintech holds promise for financial inclusion. This has already been evident in low income countries where mobile phones have bought payment and credit services with profound impacts on economic opportunities. In Kenya, for example, about 90 percent of the population over 14 years of age pays with M-Pesa.</p><p>So there are good reasons for countries to be open to the development and use of Fintech. But, we need to be aware that new technology can also lead to very rapid change. One scenario is that \"Big Tech\" companies enter the payments and credit markets, and quickly become major players in financial services given their large user base. Another scenario is that some banks adapt more quickly to Fintech than others, leading to sizable movements in market shares over time.</p><p>Change is part of the process of benefitting from Fintech. But very rapid and deep changes in financial systems can entail stability risks. Recall the financial liberalizations of the 1980s, when the transition from credit controls and other regulation to reliance on market forces led to an easing in credit standards, asset price booms especially in commercial real estate, culminating in serious banking crises including in the Nordic countries.</p><p>Countries around the world therefore face a shared challenge of finding a balanced framework that promotes financial innovation while preserving stability. As the Nordic Baltic region is now aware, financial integrity is also essential to a sound and stable financial system, so the framework for Fintech must also address money laundering and other threats to integrity along with consumer protection.</p><p>The IMF is an institution charged with a mandate for economic and financial stability, including by supporting inclusive growth, so we must find ways to support countries in developing such frameworks.</p><p>How are we doing our job? In October 2018, we launched the \"Bali Fintech Agenda\" which is a framework of 12 high-level issues for consideration by countries, that is organized around four objectives:</p><p>- Building an enabling environment for fintech innovation;</p><p>- Ensuring an adequate financial sector policy framework;</p><p>- Addressing risks and resilience; and</p><p>- Encouraging international collaboration.</p><p>In terms of an enabling environment for Fintech, it is clear that small start-up companies are not ready to deal with multiple financial regulators, or to properly manage the type of off site and on-site supervision expected of an established intermediary. So the authorities in some countries are using regulatory \"sandboxes\" and other tools to facilitate Fintech.</p><p>But new entrants should not gain competitive advantage from lighter regulatory standards, nor should consumer protection, financial integrity, or macroprudential goals, be compromised. Supervisors around the world need to keep a close eye on market developments, and act quickly to ensure the playing field remains level.</p><p>Sweden's FSA set a sound example in this respect by applying consistent consumer protection and macroprudential requirements to nonbanks entering into the mortgage market. This approach, of applying financial sector policies to activities rather than entities, will be critically important to managing stability and integrity risks from Fintech.</p><p>Central banks and supervisors have well developed tools for monitoring and reporting on financial sector risks. This work will increasingly need address how technology is reshaping the system and its risks. Ensuring that the data used covers financial activities wherever they occur is key. Sweden's Financial Stability Council, and their equivalents elsewhere, have an essential role in avoiding supervisory gaps related to Fintech.</p><p>International collaboration is more important than might first appear. By the nature of the internet and telecommunications, Fintech is global in reach, and payments and other financial services can cross borders at little cost seeking arbitrage opportunities. Fintech innovations can also spread rapidly across countries. In many respects, this mobility is welcome, but it also calls on countries to keep an eye on trends beyond their borders.</p><p>We at the IMF need to help countries by providing visibility on emerging Fintech developments, and also on practices that could help countries enjoy the benefits of Fintech and manage stability and integrity risks. But I should caution that the effects of technological change can be difficult to anticipate, so we are all in a \"learning by doing\" process.</p><p>It is therefore very encouraging that Sweden, as a leader in thinking through the implications of many Fintech issues, is also active in sharing its experiences with other countries.</p><p>CLIMATE CHANGE</p><p>I will now turn to the second topic of relevance to the Fund and its membership in the medium and long term. Indeed, it is a topic that deserves our full attention, given its potential to affect the entire world in the years ahead. The process of climate change is set to have a significant economic impact on many countries, with a large number of lower-income countries being particularly at risk.</p><p>Climate change matters to the IMF because it may have profound implications for economic and financial stability, which we are charged to protect under the IMF's Articles of Agreement.

The Facebook founder was talking about harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability - all areas where regulatory action might increase barriers to entry.</p><p>Zuckerberg, one can guess, would be more worried if the US's ultra-permissive approach to tech takeovers became threatened. If the IMF helps to fuel that debate, that's a good thing.</p><p>                   Bramson's Barclays battle                   </p><p>It is the season for attempted boardroom coups and, after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/03/imf-warns-that-tech-giants-stifle-innovation-and-threaten-stability\">Julian Dunkerton's success at Superdry</url>, the camera will turn to weightier matters than a punch-up at a \u00a3400m retailer of hoodies and jackets.</p><p>Next in the spotlight is Barclays, where Edward Bramson, an activist agitator, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/03/imf-warns-that-tech-giants-stifle-innovation-and-threaten-stability\">wants to get himself on the board</url> to tell the sleepy, overpaid current crew, as he might regard them, how to run the bank. \"Make the investment banking division smaller\" seems to be the gist of his thesis.</p><p>The trouble is, it is hard to know exactly what Bramson thinks. His Sherborne fund, in control of a 5.5% stake in Barclays, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/03/imf-warns-that-tech-giants-stifle-innovation-and-threaten-stability\">tabled the paperwork for a vote in early February</url> and nothing resembling a manifesto has yet appeared. One assumes a document will be published soon, possibly next week, since the vote is on 2 May. But the tactic of lobbying fund managers only in private for the first two months of a campaign does not breed trust.</p><p>Barclays is not like Bramson's past small-beer conquests such as fund manager F&amp;C or Electra Private Equity. It is a large, regulated bank with 82,000 employees; about 25% of UK payment transactions go through its pipes every day. If you want to try to call the shots, your audience should be broader than a couple of dozen City suits.</p><p>As it is, Bramson has already alienated one backer. Aviva Investors, the third largest investor in Sherborne, has said it won't vote its Barclays shares in his favour. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Sherborne is using a derivative \"collar\" to limit its losses should Barclays' share price fall. That looks to be an obvious case of misalignment with other shareholders, as the bank has argued.</p><p>Parallels with Superdry don't run very far - Dunkerton co-founded the business and his stake was his own. But Bramson could usefully borrow one approach: say what you'd do early and be happy to be questioned publicly on your record. Anything else deserves to lose votes.</p><p>                   AA recovery programme is slow going                   </p><p>How's the AA getting along with its debt-reduction programme? The bald statistics at the roadside recovery firm look horrendous: net debt was \u00a32.7bn at the end of January, versus top-line, pre-interest trading profits of \u00a3341m in the latest year. That's leverage of eight times, against an ambition to achieve three to four times.</p><p>The better news for shareholders is that the AA finally stopped trying to drive on empty a year ago. The incoming chief executive, Simon Breakwell, ordered more long-term investment in the form of digital services, more staff, better IT and a beefier insurance offer.</p><p>The costs will weigh in the early years but, if all goes to plan, trading profits should re-emerge above \u00a3400m, at which point a few chunks can be taken out of debt.</p><p>The absurd borrowing levels were, of course, imposed under private equity ownership, before the AA's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/03/imf-warns-that-tech-giants-stifle-innovation-and-threaten-stability\">flotation in 2014</url>. One suspects Breakwell will get the leverage ratios into vaguely normal territory eventually, even if it takes half a decade. The moral of the tale, though, is old: when buying from private equity, look under the bonnet.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-52786665</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT4-62T1-F021-60W0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"779\"/><timeReceived>6:36 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Italy, France and Britain plan digital taxes to capture their mobile profits and a broader body of tax work has begun at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Last month, the UK put itself at the forefront of plans to reform anti-trust rules after an independent review called for a new digital competition unit and for people to have more control over their data. Elizabeth Warren, 69, a Democrat senator and presidential candidate in the United States, has vowed to break up Amazon, Facebook and Google.

The dominance of \"winner takes most\" firms, a term often used in reference to Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and other digital platforms, could \"stifle innovation\", deter investment and drive up income inequality if left unchecked.</p><p>The intervention comes after a backlash against technology companies in Europe, where America's West Coast firms have faced multibillion-dollar fines and outrage over tax avoidance. Italy, France and Britain plan digital taxes to capture their mobile profits and a broader body of tax work has begun at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Last month, the UK put itself at the forefront of plans to reform anti-trust rules after an independent review called for a new digital competition unit and for people to have more control over their data. Elizabeth Warren, 69, a Democrat senator and presidential candidate in the United States, has vowed to break up Amazon, Facebook and Google. The IMF study claimed that the market power of this group of companies could even make it harder for central banks to handle a recession. It was careful not to name individual firms.</p><p>Although \"rather modest\" to date, the impact would be \"increasingly negative if the market power of high mark-up firms were to continue to rise\", it said, adding that if there were further increases \"investment would weaken, innovation could slow, labour income shares would fall further and monetary policymakers find it even more difficult to stabilise output in the event of major downturns\".</p><p>The increase in power has been most evident in mark-ups, a measure of how much a company charges for its products compared with how much it costs to produce. Mark-ups in advanced economies have increased by 8 per cent since 2000.</p><p>\"Since the early 2000s, rising markups have contributed to some reduction in companies' investment - a key ingredient to sustained growth,\" the IMF said. \"[It] has also accounted for at least 10 per cent of the overall decline (0.2 out of two percentage points) in the share of national income paid to workers in advanced economies. This has contributed to greater earnings inequality between workers since rising capital income tends to mostly benefit high-income individuals.\"</p><p>The IMF stopped short of recommending a break-up of large companies, but advocated measures such as slashing domestic barriers to entry and changing competition policy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Elizabeth Warren has the big technology groups in her sights</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-147990030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT7-VH51-JCBW-N1HV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"429\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 4, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000D9JR</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION &amp;

It was careful not to name individual firms.</p><p>Although \"rather modest\" to date, the impact would be \"increasingly negative if the market power of high mark-up firms were to continue to rise\", it said, adding that if there were further increases \"investment would weaken, innovation could slow, labour income shares would fall further and monetary policymakers find it even more difficult to stabilise output in the event of major downturns\".</p><p>The increase in power has been most evident in mark-ups, a measure of how much a company charges for its products compared with how much it costs to produce. Mark-ups in advanced economies have increased by 8 per cent since 2000.</p><p>\"Since the early 2000s, rising markups have contributed to some reduction in companies' investment - a key ingredient to sustained growth,\" the IMF said. \"[It] has also accounted for at least 10 per cent of the overall decline (0.2 out of two percentage points) in the share of national income paid to workers in advanced economies. This has contributed to greater earnings inequality between workers since rising capital income tends to mostly benefit high-income individuals.\"</p><p>The IMF stopped short of recommending a break-up of large companies, but advocated measures such as slashing domestic barriers to entry and changing competition policy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Elizabeth Warren has the big technology groups in her sights</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-148004161</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT7-VH51-JCBW-N18M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"429\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 4, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000D9JR</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION &amp;

It could not be more of a contrast. Instead of the gothic splendour of Westminster, I will be surrounded by the gleaming glass and steel of Silicon Valley. Instead of the clout of the state in Whitehall, I will now experience the dynamism of the private sector in Palo Alto. Instead of the impact of Brexit, I will now be focused on the impact of tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A job at <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is - literally and metaphorically - a long way from SW1. I have mixed feelings about leaving the UK's public debate about the future of our country's relations with the rest of Europe. Since the referendum, I have devoted my energies to making the case - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/19/facebook-hires-nick-clegg-as-head-of-global-affairs\">often in uncompromising terms</url> unavailable to those still in office - for a rethink of what I believe may turn out to be the greatest act of self-harm committed by a mature democracy. It is being made against the interests and wishes of those who have to bear the heaviest consequences: the young.</p><p>The Brexit drama will soon move to - and possibly culminate in - the place where it arguably belonged all along, parliament. I am no longer a member of parliament and have never had any desire to sit in an unreformed House of Lords. So once I had decided to accept a new role at <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>there was little merit in delaying my move any longer.</p><p>It is, of course, deeply distressing to see the UK become marginalised in world affairs, distracted by the grinding Brexit psychodrama at Westminster. If the prime minister gets her way, we will soon take a step without precedent in the modern era. Britain will, voluntarily, enter into a protracted negotiation about our future relations with the EU, having thrown away the remaining leverage we possess as current members. It is unthinkable that statesmen and stateswomen of the past would have placed our country in such a weak position.</p><p>So I sincerely hope, when they finally come to pass judgment, MPs will put the long-term fortunes of our nation before the short-term prospects of their party. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/19/facebook-hires-nick-clegg-as-head-of-global-affairs\">case for a people's vote</url> on any final deal is overwhelming. But I will no longer seek to play a public role in that debate myself.</p><p>Instead, as vice-president of global affairs and communications at <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>I hope to help it navigate the numerous challenges it faces, in common with other leading tech companies, as the data-driven technological revolution continues to affect every aspect of our everyday lives: the control we have over our personal data; the integrity of our democratic process; the power and concerns about artificial intelligence; the tension between the global internet and national jurisdictions; the balance between free speech and prohibited content; and the wellbeing of our children.</p><p>I do not arrive in Silicon Valley with a monopoly of wisdom on these crucial questions, but I have been impressed in my numerous conversations with Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg in recent months by the seriousness with which they recognise the profound responsibilities that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has - not only to its vast number of users but to society at large.</p><p>As with most big decisions I took in politics, I expect my decision to move to Silicon Valley will be shouted down by people from the left and the right. As concerns about the impact of technology grow, the left has tended to condemn \"big tech\" as representative of everything that is wrong in an unleashed market economy. The right regards it as a threat to traditional family values. Some criticisms - especially the tech world's libertarian indifference to the wider responsibility of governments and regulators in its early days - are fair. Others are wide of the mark.</p><p>But, as a general rule, I believe in engaging and grappling with difficult questions. If Silicon Valley were to disappear overnight, the technology invented in it would not. Global tech leadership would instantly transfer from the west coast of the US to China. We cannot wish away technological progress. Nor can we simply bemoan the social, ethical and political dilemmas raised by the tech revolution. Every major technological breakthrough in human history has created challenges as well as opportunities. We need to find solutions, not succumb to the easy emotions and polemic of a \"tech-lash\".</p><p>I remain a stubborn optimist about the progressive potential to society of technological innovation. It can transform how we work, play and build relationships. It can help to protect our environment and keep our streets safe. It will fundamentally change how we teach our children at school and at home. It is transforming healthcare and transport. If the tech industry can work sensibly with governments, regulators, parliaments and civic society around the world, I believe we can enhance the benefits of technology while diminishing the often unintended downsides.</p><p>The worlds of politics and tech too often speak past each other. The temptation for one side to condemn or ignore the other is great. But this standoff will, in the end, leave everyone worse off. It is time to build bridges between politics and tech so that tech can become the servant of progress and optimism, not a source of fear and suspicion.</p><p>Nick Clegg is a former UK deputy prime minister and former leader of the Liberal Democrats</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-48429529</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MRC-7MT1-JCJY-G2RN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"886\"/><timeReceived>4:28 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

How fitting,\" she says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It does feel like a meaningful coincidence that Shahani, NPR's technology correspondent, whose voice is familiar to public-radio listeners from her on-air interviews with Silicon Valley tech titans, is discussing her new memoir, \"Here We Are: American Dreams, American Nightmares,\" on the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a flash point for the United States' complicated view of immigrants.</p><p>Shahani's heartfelt, galvanizing new book charts the protracted criminal justice nightmare her own immigrant family endured after her father was arrested for mistakenly selling electronics to the infamous Cali cartel in the mid-'90s. He suffered under threat of deportation for a decade after that. Shahani's deep, personal commitment to advocating for immigrant rights was profoundly shaped by those events, as well as the unfortunate aftermath of 9/11.</p><p>\"I write in my book about being on the front lines of a history that's really important to remember, and it includes aspects of post-9/11 life in America which were toxic and awful, and which we have to watch out for, like the near-immediate roundups of brown men,\" Shahani said. \"But seeing President Obama's tweet this morning about veterans volunteering to clean up Ellis Island, I found myself thinking that this day also reminds us of the sense of unity we're capable of, the good things we find in service and in loyalty to each other.\"</p><p>That duality - Shahani's abiding love for an adopted country's inclusive ideals, and her scorn for those ideals being debased through policies that discriminate against immigrants and the poor - is at the heart of the provocative book she says she \"ran away from writing for a number of years.\"</p><p>\"Here We Are\" begins in 1981 when 1-year-old Aarti, her two older siblings and her parents, both Indian refugees who had been displaced by the India-Pakistan-Bangladesh partition, arrive with just a few thousand dollars in teeming, multiethnic Flushing, Queens \"one of the most diverse tracts of land on the planet\", from Morocco, where Shahani was born, to start a new life.</p><p>Undocumented at first, the Shahanis received their green cards a few years later, but carving out a new life remained a steep uphill climb. Shahani's mother found work in a bridal sweatshop. Her father, Namdev, an introvert with a head for numbers, resigned himself to manual labor, until he was eventually able to start a wholesale electronics store with his younger brother in Manhattan.</p><p>\"Utopia was so close,\" Shahani, 39, writes in a chapter describing how that vision fizzled in 1996, the moment she arrived home from high school she had won a scholarship to the prestigious Brearley School to find that her father and uncle had been arrested for unwittingly selling watches and calculators to Colombian drug lords.</p><p>Led astray by a lawyer who convinced him a trial would be too risky, Shahani's father pleaded guilty to money laundering and was sentenced to eight months at Rikers Island. His conviction, followed by a rapid decline in his health and spirits, transformed teenage Aarti overnight from a brainy 12th-grader focused on Model U.N. and wanting to be \"supernormal\" into a tenacious young activist attuned to the injustices of a broken immigration system.</p><p>Shahani spent the next 15 years doing everything she could think of - writing letters to the judge, speaking out publicly, lobbying Congress - to exonerate her father and avert his deportation. In 2002, she founded the nonprofit Families for Freedom to defend other families facing deportation.</p><p>\"I spent my 20s regurgitating legal facts and talking points - 'first time, nonviolent offense, eight-month sentence, the judge said on the record he's paid an inordinate price, et cetera' - because I was campaigning to make my father stay here,\" Shahani said. \"I had that rap down. What I had never explored was, 'What was it doing to our father-daughter relationship?'\"</p><p>Her father's residency in the U.S. was secure only after he became a U.S. citizen in 2009. He died not long afterward. Shahani herself became a citizen at 21 during the year she took off from the University of Chicago to work on her dad's case.</p><p>\"Here We Are\" is a persuasive critique of the impossibly stacked deck against poor immigrants like Namdev Shahani who are pressured to take plea bargains Aarti Shahani's explanation of the \"trial penalty\" he faced is indispensable, but it's also a coming-of-age story of an ambitious, whip-smart daughter getting to know herself better as her Old World father comes into clearer view.</p><p>\"It's about me exploring, how did this guy who was basically a stranger growing up become my best friend in the context of the case that destroyed his life?\" Shahani said.</p><p>In conversation, Shahani is a sharp thinker and articulates with matter-of-fact candor the ins and outs of her father's prolonged legal jeopardy. But her voice slows and grows quieter when she reflects on the deeper reason she wrote the book: \"I needed to give him a proper eulogy,\" she said. \"I think that he lived an extraordinary life, but the kind of life that often goes uncelebrated.\"</p><p>She admits she put off the idea of writing about her family's painful past for years, out of fear of being engulfed by emotion. But in 2015, after she had transitioned to journalism and moved to the Bay Area she decided to stay in California following a three-month fellowship at KQED and started working for NPR, she decided \"to report New York v. Shahani her father's case like any other assignment.\"</p><p>She dug into the facts and wrote a first draft over the summer of 2017, in the solitude of two separate Buddhist retreats. \"It felt very, very cathartic,\" she said.</p><p>It also felt like a timely act of resistance to President Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric.</p><p>\"Following the 2016 election, many Americans were asking themselves, 'What am I doing for my country besides complaining?' Well, I'm a writer, and whether or not I wanted to admit it, I had become a person of some privilege, with a megaphone I never could have imagined having. How did I want to use it?\"</p><p>Sharing her family's embattled immigration story \"became my unique contribution at a moment when people like us, who are the essence of America, are under attack. I believe we have a president who wants to erase the fact of people like me, and it's not accurate and it's causing harm. I know I'm not alone in having a sense that we're in a historic moment where every voice counts.\"</p><p>Shahani said she hopes that by telling the heartbreaking details of her family's tortuous path to citizenship, she'll open readers' eyes to the fact that \"while policy debates put issues into separate buckets, immigration and criminal justice, for instance, our story is proof that they're all interwoven. Working-class immigrants get caught up in these systems because of the things you don't know, can't access or can't afford.\"</p><p>\"I hope people read Aarti's story and get a much better understanding of what immigrant families really go through, and are able to see how connected and at times arbitrary the criminal and deportation systems are,\" said Benita Jain, an Oakland attorney for the Immigrant Defense Project who's known Shahani since 2001.</p><p>\"There's an unfairness to both of those systems that people are often not aware of unless they're inside it. Aarti's never-back-down approach, that she would cross any bridge to keep her dad here, is an inspiration.\"</p><p>Shahani didn't expect to be a journalist as a young girl, she wanted to be a prosecutor, but she has found an obvious talent and satisfaction chronicling Big Tech's advances and misdeeds. She has reported on Mark Zuckerberg's congressional testimony, and recently interviewed Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, on the need for regulation.</p><p>\"I chose tech as a beat because it felt like a safe distance from everything I had come from,\" she said, \"And yet it's amazing to me how some of the issues I cover come full circle, for example the protests around companies like Palantir and Google helping with tracking and surveillance tools for the government's immigration enforcement agencies.\"</p><p>Tech reporting also threw into relief for Shahani the \"double standard of who pays the price in this country,\" she said. \"It's just amazing to me that ousted Uber founder Travis Kalanick has not been arrested. Reporting on Uber in particular, and Facebook secondarily, has really opened my eyes to how justice works in America. If you're wealthy, at most you face civil penalties. If you're working class, you face criminal penalties.\"</p><p>\"What impresses me most about Aarti's coverage of Silicon Valley is that even when reporting on unhuman technologies, whether big tech or small startups, she manages to always tie her stories back to people,\" said NPR CEO Jarl Mohn. \"I didn't know her personal story when I first got to know her, but now that I do from reading her riveting book, I understand how her life experiences deepen her reporting.\"</p><p>Talking with Shahani, who has sharp observations about everything from the jail-to-deportation pipeline and tech industry malfeasance to the shared sense of humor that kept the Shahani family together through dark times, it's clear why she describes her outlook on America in \"Here We Are\" as \"rage in the moment and hope in the long term.\"</p><p>\"I think it's funny that Trump's family and mine both come from Queens,\" she said. \"We have very different lessons from there, and I would say mine is correct. Growing up, I had the United Nations working-class style. I was constantly being exposed to people from different countries, with different accents. My parents fled the partition of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh because you had Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs killing each other. They moved into a building where those same people were exchanging milk and sugar, and babysitting for each other.</p><p>\"What more can I say?\"</p><p>As for Aarti's lanky nephew, Akshay, who finally took his smoothie into his room to give his aunt privacy to talk about her family's saga? He's her older brother Deepak's son, and he figures into \"Here We Are\" too, as an infant caught up in a dramatic residency struggle of his own after his mother kidnapped him to India - and, yes, his tenacious aunt Aarti spearheaded working with lawyers in New Jersey and London, even Interpol, to secure his return.</p><p>Akshay now lives with his proud aunt and attends college. \"He's hardworking, like us,\" Shahani writes in her book's poignant epilogue, \"Dear Dad.\"</p><p>\"Life is just fascinating,\" she said. \"I think if you're open to what might happen, man, things can really happen.\"</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aarti Shahani: </emphasis>Author appearance. 7 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 17.

Thank you all for being here. I want everyone -- preliminarily, I want to say that everyone present to be able to watch the hearing without obstruction. If people stand up and block the view of those behind them or speak out of turn it's not fair or considerate to others, and officers will remove those individuals from the room. </p><p>Before we begin with opening statements, I want to explain how we will proceed today. We have one panel of witnesses today.  I will make an opening statement followed by the opening statement from Senator Durbin. Each witness will then have five minutes for an opening statement.  Following their statements, we will begin with the first round of questions in which each senator will have five minutes. After the first round, if any senator wishes to continue to ask questions, we'll have a second round of questions.  With that, I'll turn to my opening statement. </p><p>I want to thank all of you for being here and for my colleague Senator Durbin and his leadership. We've had considerable agreement on this issue and I co-sponsor a bill with he and Senator Grassley that will deal positively with this subject.  So the hearing will focus on the impact of high skilled immigration on U.S. workers. </p><p>Last month, Barron's reported that a financial analyst had done a study, and they expect that information technology companies will cut at least 330,000 jobs this year, news that has become all too familiar in recent years.   Yet CEOs and those aligned to promote legislation continue to perpetuate the myth that there is a shortage of talented workers to fill positions in technology and other high skilled employment sectors. </p><p>Indeed, a letter sent to President Obama and congressional leaders in 2013 by number of tech companies made the assertion that, quote, \"one of the biggest economic challenges facing our nation is a need for more qualified highly skilled professionals, domestic and foreign, who can create jobs and immediately contribute to our economy.\"  Closed quote.   But many of those same companies adjust cut thousands of American jobs, and they have continued to cut thousands of jobs since. </p><p>Nevertheless the claims of a shortage of workers continues. As a lobbyist for Qualcomm claimed last year, quote, \"although our industry and other high-tech industries have grown exponentially, our immigration system has failed to keep pace.\"  Closed quote.  </p><p>After a few weeks later, Qualcomm announced it would cut its workforce by 15 percent, roughly 5,000 jobs. And earlier this month, it was reported that Yahoo is cutting approximately 1,500 jobs. And they're doing what businesses do, we recognize that.  The question is, what about our immigration policy? </p><p>And are these corporations have spent hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, lobbying for bills that would bring in even more foreign workers into the United States such as the Gang of Eight Bill. And the push for high skill workers is being promoted by other legislation. So today we'll hear the fact -- the facts. </p><p>Data shows that there is no shortage of highly qualified working American professionals, nor is a shortage of American STEM college graduates every year. Science, technology, engineering, mathematics.  I used to think there was. I took it as a given we had a shortage. We'll have expert testimony today that I think is supported by plethora of evidence that we don't have a shortage. </p><p>The sad reality is that not only is there not a shortage of exceptionally qualified U.S. workers, but across the country, thousands of U.S. workers are being replaced by foreign labor.  The picture next to me is from Northeast Utilities, a company based in Connecticut that announced it was going to lay off employees in its IT department and to hire outside companies that used H-1B employees from abroad to provide their IT services.  These U.S. workers were forced to train their foreign replacements. They weren't unqualified, they had to train their replacements. And this was all done apparently according to current law. </p><p>According to one of these workers who contacted my staff and requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, quote, \"the only way we can make a statement was by placing small American flags outside our cubicles and aisles gradually as we got replaced by the H-1Bs, the flags disappeared just as we did.\"  </p><p>So the fight for changes in the law that serve the interests of American people has begun in the Senate.  I'm a co-sponsor of S.2266, the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act of 2015 which has been introduced by Senators Grassley and Durbin who have worked on to reform these programs.  In December, I joined Senator Cruz in introducing S.2394, the American Jobs First Act of 2015, a bill that would stop the abuses we are seeing in our immigration system and protect the interest of American workers.  And I've also joined with my colleague, Democratic Senator Bill Nelson from Florida, in introducing 2365, the Protecting American Jobs Act which would also, I think, fixed the problem. </p><p>So with that, I'll turn to our ranking member Senator Durbin for his opening statement. </p><p>DURBIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We disagree on many issues, particularly in this area of immigration.  But I believe that Senator Sessions and I are seeking and we may find common ground on this issue about H-1B visas.  On those rare occasions when that occurs, we've been able to enact some good law, and I hope that this is another one of those occasions. </p><p>At the outset, let me point out the title of today's hearing is not accurate. The H-1B visa program is not a high skilled immigration program.  In fact, the H-1B program is a non-immigrant visa that allows an employer to a hire temporary guest worker.  Guest workers are not immigrants. Their ability to stay in the country completely depends on the employer. And therefore, they can be forced to accept low wages and bad working conditions. That's bad for guest workers and it's bad for American workers. </p><p>If a company cannot find a qualified American worker for particular job and they wish to import foreign talent, the immigrant worker should have a green card.  When employees have lawful permanent residence, an employer does not have the same leverage over them that they do when they have this temporary non-immigrant worker on H-1B status. </p><p>I look around the hearing room today and I have a strong feeling of deja vu. The committee held a similar hearing a year ago. In fact three of today's witnesses were here. The reality is that Congress has been debating H-1B reform for a long time but we haven't done anything. For many years we've known and identify the problems but we have to fix them. </p><p>When most people think of H-1B visas, they think of big tech companies, Microsoft, Google, hiring top-notch computer engineers and paying them top dollar. But the reality is extremely different. In fact, the top recipients of H-1B visas are foreign outsourcing companies that use loopholes in the law to displace qualified American workers and offshore American jobs. </p><p>Congress intended the H-1B program to allow an employer to hire a skilled foreign worker in a specialized occupation when the employer could not find an American worker with needed skills and abilities.  We didn't intend for foreign outsourcing firms to exploit the program to bring foreign workers to our country to be trained by talented American workers, as Senator Sessions has alluded, in order to ship ultimately American jobs overseas. </p><p>Senator Grassley and I first introduced legislation to reform the H-1B visa almost a decade ago, 2007. That same year, I worked to include many of our reforms and comprehensive immigration reform legislation. That bill was filibustered. </p><p>In 2013, I was part of the Gang of Eight, Democrats and Republicans who sat down and wrote the comprehensive immigration reform. One member of the Gang of Eight, a junior senator from Florida, fought hard to keep H-1B the reforms out of the bill. Nonetheless, we made several important changes in the program. </p><p>I offered the provision of the bill to prevent large outsourcing companies from hiring additional foreign workers. It would have prohibited companies from hiring additional H-1B and L visa holders if they employed more than 50 people and more than 50 percent of their employees and more than 50 percent of their employers were H-1B or L workers. </p><p>Under current law, employers are permitted to pay H-1B visa holders substandard wages which creates an incentive to hire foreign workers and discourages Americans from taking the job.  The vice president of Tata, an Indian corporation and one of the leading foreign outsourcing firms, acknowledged this. And here's what he said about using H-1Bs to undercut American workers.  Quote, \"our wage per employee is 20 to 25 percent less than U.S. wages for a similar employee.\"  The issue is that of getting workers in the U.S. on wages far lower than the local wages.  </p><p>I wrote provision in the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill that would've discouraged companies from hiring foreign workers as a source of cheap labor by doubling the minimum wage for H-1B employees from the 17th to the 33rd percentile. And employers of large numbers of H-1B visa holders would've been required to pay at a minimum the average wage paid to workers in that occupation. That's why the chief executive of Tata, when he read my provision, said this bill was very tough on outsourcing companies. It was supposed to be. </p><p>The Senate passed our bill on a bipartisan vote, 68 to 32.  The House never took it up. Since then the problem of H-1 abuse has gone -- H-1B abuse has only grown worse. </p><p>In the most recent year where data's available, foreign outsourcing companies received the majority of new H-1B visas.  Follow what I'm saying here. This isn't Microsoft or Google looking for that top-notch engineer, it's a major overseas company that swallows up the H-1B visas and then hires the workers at a fee, sends them over here to work at lower than the average wage and then brings them back to compete with American companies.  That is never what this program was designed to do. </p><p>Last April. I joined in a bipartisan letter with Senator Sessions, eight other senators to Departments of Justice, Labor and Homeland Security asking for an investigation of the replacement of American workers by H-1B workers.  But unfortunately, because of loopholes in the existing law, this broken law, it's very difficult for these agencies to punish. </p><p>Now, two of the leading Republican presidential candidates, Mr. Trump and the junior senator from Texas, have jumped on the bandwagon and say they want H-1B be reform as well.  I welcome them to the debate. Their track records raise some questions. </p><p>Mr. Trump owns companies that have sought to import at least 1,000 temporary guest workers while turning away hundreds of American workers. And in 2013, when the committee considered the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill, the junior senator from Texas offered an amendment to increase -- increase -- the annual cap of H-1B visas to an astronomical 325,000 per year.  Last November, Chair Grassley and I reintroduced our H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act to end these abuses.  Mr. Chairman, I thank you for co-sponsoring that bill. </p><p>Let me make one final point before my voice goes completely.  Ending H-1B abuse is not the only reform that is needed to fix our broken immigration system. We have millions of undocumented immigrants in our workforce.   Because they do not have legal status, they are paid below market wages and they work in unsafe conditions. This is bad for immigrant workers, but it's bad for those workers, American workers, who compete with them. We need a path to citizenship and legal status so that these workers will be paid at the prevailing wage and so that American workers are then not undercut in terms of their own wages. </p><p>I think this is a fair outcome.  Senator who was chairing I'm sure disagrees.  But that is something that we'll hold for another discussion.  So let's say about this one, we must reform the H-1B visa program, then fix other parts of our broken immigration system.  I hope this hearing is a kick-off for that effort. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Thank you, Senator Durbin. I think you've summed up many of the problems with this legislation very well. And I would add that I conclude that just by the numbers themselves of foreign workers brought into the country, that's impacting adversely American workers when you look at the fact that since 2000, every job in the country has, mathematically speaking, been taken by a foreign worker. There had been no increase in American working since 2000. </p><p>So we'll have to wrestle with those issues another day. Senator Blumenthal, I know you had some -- an opening comment, and I would be pleased to hear from you now. </p><p>DURBIN:  If I could ask to put Senator Leahy's record -- statement in the record too. </p><p>SESSIONS:  We will make it make it a part of the record. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL:  I really appreciate, Mr. Chairman, the courtesy of making a few brief opening comments.  And I want to thank you for having this hearing and also mentioning the Northeast Utilities situation, which is a Connecticut situation and is extraordinarily troubling for all the reasons that you have mentioned and others. </p><p>And I want to thank Senator Durbin for his remarks. I'm a co-sponsor of his bill, along with Senator Grassley. And I'm also a sponsor of the I-Squared Bill because I believe there should be the availability of more H-1B visas. But I think there has to be stronger enforcement and an overhaul of the program to prevent the kinds of abuses that both of you have highlighted today. And I know as a former United States attorney, you share my interest in strong and effective enforcement to prevent exactly these kinds of abuses. </p><p>The Eversource situation that you mentioned, Eversource in effect took over Northeast Utilities, came to my attention because of an article in a magazine called Computerworld. And the reason that it was through that means was that a gag order was placed on the employees who were replaced by H-1B visa workers.  Only because of their discussion with that reporter -- anonymously because they were under that gag order as a condition of their receiving severance -- did that kind of abuse come to my attention.  And I found it shocking. </p><p>I wrote to the company.  I've asked for additional information.  I ask, Mr. Chairman, that my letter and their response be included in the record. </p><p>SESSIONS:  We'll make it part of the record. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL:  Thank you. I am going to enter into the record longer remarks. I know we want to get onto a full schedule of witnesses that we have before us, but let me just say that these programs are useful if they're used legally and legitimately.  If they are, on the other hand, abused to import cheap labor and export good American jobs, I think we have a very strong bipartisan consensus that they need to be enforced more stringently and effectively so that American workers are protected.  And right now, there are indications that this system is failing to fairly protect our workers in the way that it should. So thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Thank you. Thank you. Will our panel please stand and I'll administer the oath.  Would you raise your right hands?  Do you affirm that the testimony you're about to give before this committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God. </p><p>WITNESSES:  I do. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Thank you very much. I'll briefly introduce each witness before they each provide a statement to us. For reference. their full biographies are available on the committee website. </p><p>First, we have Mr. Leo Perrero, former Disney IT engineer. Mr. Perrero is a -- an IT engineer. He's had a long successful career in the information technology field, having been employed by some of the largest Fortune 500 companies.  As indicated already, he was laid off by Disney and forced to train his foreign guest worker replacement.  Mr. Perrero? </p><p>PERRERO:  I made a change in the direction of my career because January 31, 2015 was my last day in the technology field.  That day, 20 years of hard work, a bachelor's degree in information technology and n IT job for Disney were all over when my team along with hundreds of others were displaced by a less skilled foreign workforce imported into our country using the H-1B visa program. </p><p>The former Disney employees with far superior skills and knowledge were the trainers and the guest workers just entering the technology field were the trainees. This situation is far from the original intent of this program and is shocking to everybody that hears it. </p><p>I worked at Disney in Orlando in some capacity for well over 10 years and received the very highest employment performance review. Quotes included, \"Leo continues to provide value to our team\"; \"This year Leo was instrumental\"; \"Leo saved the company over $10,000.\" And finally, \"I look forward to another great year of having Leo on our team.\"</p><p>During the holiday season of 2014, I was sent a meeting invitation by a prominent Disney executive.  With an excellent review in hand along with the company announcements of record profits, my mind buzzed with thoughts of promotion or a bonus. I walked into a small conference room with about two dozen highly respected fellow IT workers. The Disney executive made a harsh announcement to us all. </p><p>\"All of you in this room will be losing your jobs in the next 90 days. Your jobs have been given over to a foreign workforce. In the meantime, you'll be training your replacements until your jobs are 100 percent transferred over to them. And if you do not cooperate, you will not receive any severance pay.\"</p><p>The only glimmer of hope during that meeting was the announcement that new more exciting jobs would be opening soon. However, we found out that only four people would be directly re-hired by Disney of the hundreds that were lost. I was completely silent during this meeting thinking how I was going to -- how this is going to affect my co-workers. How I was I going to break the news to my family and pay all of our expenses?  I would soon be living on unemployment.  </p><p>Later that same day, I clearly remember going to the local church pumpkin sale and having to tell the kids I couldn't buy any that year because my job was being turned over to a foreign worker.  I started to think what kind of an American I was becoming. Was I going to become part of reinter (ph) country by taking severance pay in exchange for training my foreign placement?  How many other American families would be affected by the same foreign worker that I trained? </p><p>The first part of my 90 day period was focused on capturing all that we did with our jobs.  We all felt extremely humiliated when the foreign worker sat next to us and watch everything that we did.  The final period of the 90 days was the most disgraceful and demoralizing as we had to watch the foreign workers completely take over our jobs and we came to grips that the upcoming Disney jobs promised didn't exist. </p><p>Then finally on January 31st of 2015, we were ordered to turn in our company badges, laptops and then ushered out the door.  How can it be that everybody that hears these stories about Disney and the like from the barbers to the bankers are completely shocked, yet our lawmakers continue to evade the topic and take no action? </p><p>The reason that more effective IT workers don't come out into the public is two-fold, and that is why most lawmakers mostly hear from the tech giants and are very rarely from -- heard from the displaced American workers that -- who will disclose themselves publicly. The first reason is they're scared of finding the next IT job after being displaced when that job pool is shrinking for Americans. If they speak out, they will certainly not improve their prospects of landing the next job. But this could permanently bar them from the field when a large portion of large technology companies are exploiting these visa programs. </p><p>One of my former peers who is now working for a consulting company decided to speak out publicly. He was told he had to stop immediately since most of his clientele were large Fortune 500 companies and they use the H-1B program extensively. </p><p>The second reason that more of them don't speak out is for legal intimidation reasons from gag order signed when American workers sign severance package agreements. The American IT worker feels they're legally bound to keep that situation quiet and at most speak anonymously. I'm appearing today because I'm one of the few workers who speak out in public because I made the decision to walk away from technology. </p><p>This abuse of the H-1B visa program is not about the lack of talent here in the U.S. If our own pool of IT professionals were so incompetent, then why would companies like Disney and many others have us spend months training our replacements? And also, why would such a low ratio of U.S.STEM graduates land a STEM job? </p><p>The situation at Disney is not an anomaly. The same abuse is happening nationwide. Some quotes from IT workers that I've worked with:  \"I know that jobs like mine are scarce because they're filled with H-1B employees.\" Jeff (ph), current Disney employee. </p><p>\"The big tech giants say they don't have enough skilled workers which is false. This will become a self-fulfilling prophecy as we have more students opt out of technology as they continue to recruit from developing countries.\" Matt (ph), former Disney employee. </p><p>\"Unemployment hurts. I ran out of benefits and I have to pay for COBRA -- full COBRA insurance which is over $3,000 per month because my young daughter suffers from anxiety.  Besides that, I have a mortgage, utility, schooling and job searching to pay for.  As my young daughter outgrows her clothes, that is even more money.\"  Former IBM worker. </p><p>That's all I have to say this afternoon.  Thank you for listening. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Thank you, Mr. Perrero, for that moving testimony. Mr. John Miano, is attorney for the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers. He is an attorney who specializes in representing Americans who've been injured by the immigration system. </p><p>Prior to becoming an attorney, he was a computer programmer. He is the current -- he is the recent office -- author of a book with Michelle Malkin about abuses in H-1B and other visa programs. Mr. Miano. </p><p>MIANO:  Thank you, Chairman Sessions and members of the committee. As Senator Durbin pointed out, we were here a year ago after Southern California Edison and Disney had replaced their Americans with H-1B workers. So now nearly a year has passed and we can add to the growing list of companies that have H-1B booted Americans to include Toys 'R' Us, New York Life. Citizens Bank, Caterpillar, Catalina Marketing, SunTrust, Pasol (ph) and others where Americans are afraid to come forward. And in fact, just yesterday, we learned -- and the senator might be interested that Abbott Labs in the Chicago area has -- yesterday announced to its employees that it was canning 180 Americans and replacing them with H-1B workers. </p><p>So I worked in the computer industry for over 20 years and I saw the same kinds of things that Mr. Perrero described.  And I won't repeat that -- repeat the same similar story.  Rather, I'd like to focus on why the H-1B disaster is happening from a legal perspective. There are several factors at work and I'll start with the two biggest. </p><p>First, in 1998, Congress made it explicitly legal to replace Americans with H-1B workers. Under the law enacted that year, it is legal to replace an American at will with an H-1B worker unless three things happen. One, the H-1B worker is paid less than $60,000 a year; two, the H-1B worker does not have a graduate degree; and three, the employer has 15 percent of its total workforce on H-1B visas, not counting those making $60,000 a year or having graduate degrees.  Unless all three of those conditions are met, it is perfectly legal to replace an American with an H-1B worker. </p><p>The law governing H-1B is so convoluted that you have to follow several levels of indirection in the code to figure this out. The person who wrote the 1998 bill went through a lot of effort to ensure that it was legal to replace Americans.  So what happened at Disney is not an accident, it was clear statutory design. </p><p>The second issue is that in 2004, Congress changed the H-1B prevailing wage system to allow employers to pay these workers extremely low wages.  Normally, the prevailing wage is the median wage, the 50th percentile. However, under the H-1B prevailing wage system, the normal prevailing wage is the 17th percentile, and so in most locations, a employer can legally pay an H-1B computer programmer about $20,000 a year less than the true prevailing wage for the area. And its high wage locations like Silicon Valley, it's even higher.  In Silicon Valley it's about $40,000 a year difference for using H-1B. </p><p>So when you combine the two, giving the employer the ability to pay really low wages to the foreign workers with the ability to replace the American workers they already have, you get the predictable result of what we've seen at Southern California Edison, Disney and the other places. And as I've hinted at here, the major structural problem with the H-1B program is it's needlessly complicated. </p><p>No one should need a lawyer to make a guest worker visa petition, but it's not an exaggeration to say that it literally takes a lawyer to determine what the fee is for an H-1B visa in any given circumstance. And this complexity seriously hinders enforcement. Rather than giving the Department of Labor the authority to enforce the H-1B program, the statutes spell out when the Department of Labor can enforce law and when the Department of Labor can't enforce the law. And the Department of Labor inspector in general has reported to Congress every six months for the past 20 years that this system leaves the H-1B program open to abuse. </p><p>On Tuesday, talking about this hearing, I spoke with a woman who was replaced by H-1B in 1994. And she expressed frustration that it seems that all we've accomplished by, you know, hearings over the years is to publicize a fact on to ph employers that they can replace their Americans with H-1B workers and get away with it. </p><p>And finally, you know, I point out that I was on the train coming down here today, I spoke with a -- was having an email exchange with a person who's very well known in the industry. And he's urged me to, you know, point out to you that it seems that the growing consensus among tech workers at this point is that the only way this is going to get fixed is by an executive order by Pres. Trump. I would (ph) say, you know, concluded here that it should not be legal replace Americans with foreign worker ever and that the changes is long overdue. I thank you. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Thank you. Next we have Mr. Mark O'Neill, chief technology officer for JackThreads. Prior to his time at JackThreads, Mr. O'Neill spent eight years as a CTO for Thrillist Media and got his start in the tech industry doing custom search engine work back in late 1990s. Mr. O'Neill. </p><p>O'NEILL:  Good afternoon, Senator Sessions, members the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to address you today. My name is Mark O'Neill, I'm currently employed as the Chief Technology Officer of Jack threads, an online e-commerce retailers selling clothing to men. </p><p>I've worked at startups in the tech sector since 1999 as a developer and in management roles. In that time, I've been able to observe opportunities and challenges of our immigration system firsthand. One of the challenges in the tech sector today is the extreme difficulty of attracting qualified candidates to fill open roles. </p><p>Put simply, there seem not to be enough capable developers to keep up with the pace of innovation. Competition is so fierce that my developer starting salaries have risen by over 50 percent in the last eight years. And senior positions command compensation that meets or even exceeds that of United State Senators. </p><p>Companies must compete globally for the best talent, finding it wherever they can. CTO's like me must spend a huge amount of their time recruiting employees and large industry recruiters has sprung up to for a hefty price find and coach (ph) workers. Coding schools like General Assembly and Flatiron School, to name just two in New York City alone, crank out new developers every six weeks and still jobs go unfilled. </p><p>In my role, I try to shake every tree to find skilled employees. I've traveled to college career fairs and meet ups. Used in and out of house for recruiters. Hired remote workers. Relocated workers from across the country. And also hired through the H-1B visa program. </p><p>In my personal experience, the use of foreign workers has directly contributed to the health of my company and to our ability to offer additional jobs to Americans. One example, as with all online businesses today, JackThreads consumers are increasing not at their other desks, but interacting on phones and tablets. Creating a quality experience that allows a user to easily shop or read on a 4 inch screen is incredibly difficult and requires deep technical expertise and constant refinement. </p><p>Over two years ago though, we could not find developers to keep our iPhone app up-to-date. Finally, opposing (ph) through a recruiting service connect us this with the developer in Spain, Eduardo (ph). After he succeeded in our interviews, we began the visa process and months later, he started work with us in New York. </p><p>We continued recruiting through an expensive third-party recruiter who showed us a number of candidates in the United States. The best qualified was a Chinese citizen man Meng (ph) whom we also hired. </p><p>JackThreads is proud that today 53 percent of our revenue comes from mobile devices. This is exceptional in our industry as many companies still see lots of mobile users but aren't able to get those mobile users to purchase. Eduardo and Meng's (ph) work, has in this way, directly contributed to the growth of our revenue which has allowed us to grow faster and hire more. Because of their contributions, we employ more American workers than we otherwise would have. </p><p>If the system treats those workers unfairly, they live under the constant threat that their lives could be uprooted. The system is full of uncertainty and requires confusing renewal process. Because their visa is tied to their employer, if they lose their jobs even through no fault of their own, they have 30 days to find a new one or leave the country. This makes it harder for them to leave bad jobs and gives them less leverage in salary negotiations, not to mention adding tremendous stress to their lives. </p><p>A far fairer system would allow a worker to stay until the end of his visa, even if his employment is terminated. That said, despite the H-1B's disadvantages, foreign workers demand competitive wages. I've heard fears that immigrant workers drive down wages by accepting the same jobs to lower wage, this has not been my experience. </p><p>Information workers can get competitive pay working remotely from anywhere on the planet. If I want to attract a developer from abroad, I must pay him fairly for his work or he'll go to the competition. Indeed, I have coached H-1B workers from other employers and have seen sponsored employees hired away from my company or flung it elsewhere. </p><p>I have one team and I pay them fairly. The suggestion that I would have my employees sit together yet pay someone differently because of where he was born speaks a misunderstanding of how the marketing (ph) information economy functions. It's just not how we operate. Creating second-tier pay for certain workers would be counterproductive. Neither U.S. nor foreign-born workers would stand for it. </p><p>Now, let me address how the system appears to small business employers. F-1, J-1, H-1B, OPT, visa lotteries, I knew about none of this alphabet soup when I started. My company's been fortunate in that we've had enough success to grow to the point where we can afford lawyers that help us navigate the H-1B process. It's expensive and it takes too long, but it's a lifeline for American companies that allows employers to augment the pool of labor available in the US, filling jobs that would otherwise linger unfilled. </p><p>Still, every dollar paid to the visa process is a dollar I can't spend on more workers to build the software that powers our growth. And early-stage startups can't afford lawyers and can't wait the months for employees' visa to be worked out. So the expense, complexities and delays effectively lock small businesses out of this visa program. This amounts to a regressive tax on small enterprises and hurt small businesses that are creating jobs through renovation. </p><p>It also puts American companies at disadvantage with their global competitors. I can say with confidence that for each of the foreign-born immigrant developers that I've had the good fortune to work alongside during my career, United States economy is stronger and better off with these workers than without them. Far better for the United States to employ these talented ambitious people than to compete against them. </p><p>Let them stay, build lives here, build companies here, create jobs here. Thank you. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Thank you. Thank you for your thoughts, Mr. O'Neill. And Dr. Ron Hira, an associate professor of policy, public policy at Howard University. Former neighbor (ph) research associate with Economic Policy Institute and an associate professor at Rochester Institute of Technology. He's written extensively on off shoring high skilled immigration, innovation and in the decline of the middle class. Dr. Hira. </p><p>HIRA:  Thank you. Let me apologize at the beginning by saying that my throat is a little scratchy today. I want to thank Chairman Sessions, ranking member Schumer and the other distinguished members of this committee for inviting me to testify today. I will also want to acknowledge the leadership of Senators Sessions, Durbin, Grassley, Blumenthal, Cruz and Nelson for shedding light on the abuse of the H-1B L-1 and OPT visa programs. And for offering sensible solutions to improve the programs. </p><p>Last March the full committee held a hearing that spurred much-needed attention to these issues. That hearing was held in the wake of news reports of Southern -- of the Southern California Edison scandal. More than 300 American workers were not only replaced by H-1B workers, the American workers had to train their replacements. </p><p>Why did Edison replace its American workers with H-1Bs, the reason was simple. The H-1B workers were cheaper. The cost savings were $40,000 to $50,000 or 40 to 50 percent per worker. The full story couldn't be told because the displaced workers were under a gag order from Edison and were not allowed to speak publicly to this committee. </p><p>Over the past year in addition to the Southern California Edison case, a number of other cases including Disney, Northeast Utilities, the Fossil Group, Catalina Marketing, New York Life, Hertz, Toys\"R\"Us, and I could keep going on, were highlighted by the press. But these are only the proverbial tip of the iceberg, there are many more cases out there. </p><p>Following the hearing, 10 senators, many of whom are here, requested that the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security investigate whether Edison's use of cheaper H-1Bs is a violation of the law and regulations. The Labor Department refused to investigate without a complaint from an aggrieved worker. In the face of intimidation from gag orders and the threat of being blackballed from the industry, some brave workers stepped forward to file complaints and the department began investigating. The Labor Department recently concluded that investigation finding that no H-1B violations occurred. </p><p>I think there's some important conclusion to draw from this. That Labor Department has affirmed the following. First, American workers can legally be replaced by an H-1B worker. Second, H-1B workers can legally be paid much less than American workers. In the Edison case, it was 40 to 50 percent less. </p><p>I also want to say further we also know, one, is extraordinarily easy to pay an H-1B worker much less than American worker. Two, it is extraordinarily profitable to replace American workers with H-1B. Third, hiring H-1B workers because they are cheaper than Americans is a routine and commonplace practice. </p><p>Southern California Edison and Northeast Utilities are well-known regulated utilities. And Disney and Toys\"R\"Us are household names. And the contractors that hired the H-1B are Tata, Infosys, HCL and Cognizant. While they may not be known to the average American, they are leading H-1B employers. </p><p>Over the past 10 years, those four firms alone brought in nearly 100,000 H-1B workers. These firms specialize in offshore outsourcing. When they get work from customers like Disney, the goal is to ship as much of the work offshore to India and other locations as possible. Those offshore jobs are lost forever. </p><p>New stories play an important role in the public's understanding but they are no substitute for statutory and regulatory changes. First, most H-1B abuses are never reported. Why? Because companies gag American workers and if workers do speak reporters don't want to tell the same story over and over again. </p><p>Second, new stories in public shaming do nothing to alter the business models and the lure of cheap H-1B workers. The Disney story receive much attention but the workers still lost their jobs. While it was displacing its American workers, Disney earned record profits. Its stock price reach record levels. Its CEO Bob Iger received compensation of more than $40 million. </p><p>Further, Disney is a firm that meticulously guards its public image. If a company like Disney will exploit the H-1B program while under the spotlight, which company isn't exploiting that and which company won't exploit those loopholes? </p><p>While I focus on the H-1B, cheap labor is a feature and attraction of two other large guest worker programs. The L-1 and OPT. Both are being similarly exploited and need substantial changes. The L-1 has no wage rules and is routinely used by the same offshore outsourcing firms. The Tatas, the Infosys, the whip rose (ph), that exploit the H-1B program. </p><p>The Obama administration recently proposed rules on the OPT that are downright scary. A three-year unregulated work authorization with no wage roles whatsoever, OPT workers can be legally paid zero wages. And that's not an anomaly, that actually happens. </p><p>Last summer DHS secretary Jeh Johnson was asked at a house hearing about Disney. He said the Congress needs to change the law because his agency \"doesn't have enough tools legally to deal with that kind of situation, the Disney situation\". With April 1 and the next H-1B lottery season just weeks away, it is urgent that Congress and the administration act together immediately to fix the program. We know exactly what will happen if you fail to act, tens of thousands more American workers will be training their cheaper guest worker replacements. Thank you. </p><p>SESSIONS:  ...very much, Dr. Hira. And next we will have Dr. Chad Sparber, on associate professor and chair of the economics department at Colgate University. He directs a program on economic freedom for Colgate Center for Freedom and Western Civilization, an organization promoting intellectual diversity and discourse on campus. </p><p>Professor Sparber, joined Colgate in 2006 and has been an external fellow at the Center for Research and Analysis of Migration at University College London since 2009. Dr. Sparber. </p><p>SPARBER:  I want to thank Chairman Sessions, ranking member Schumer and the members of the subcommittee for inviting me to testify here today. My name is Chad Sparber, I'm an associate professor and chair of the economics department at Colgate University. The economics of immigration has been my sole field of inquiry since arriving to Colgate 10 years ago. </p><p>The tremendous amount of economics literatures found that on average highly educated immigrants increase American wages employment and productivity. There are at least two reasons for this effect. First, among highly educated workers immigrants have a comparative advantage in STEM work. Even within the science field, immigrants are more likely to earn a degree in engineering, computer science and mathematics, whereas native-born Americans are more likely to major life sciences and psychology. </p><p>What this means is that, a, immigrants and native-born Americans do not directly compete with each other for jobs in the same way that a lot of people might imagine. And, be, when foreign-born STEM workers enter the U.S. labor force, it creates an opportunity for native-born Americans to respond by doing other types of work including managerial occupations that often, though not always, pay higher wages. </p><p>Second, immigrants specialize in science and engineering work. Scientists and engineers are responsible for most of the technological progress in recent decades. Technology creates games that spill over to many sectors of the economy and is the key to generating long-term sustained economic growth. </p><p>If you accept that chain of logic, and most economists do, then you can see that immigrants are vital to the American economic growth. Quantitatively, immigrants were responsible for two thirds of the growth of the STEM workforce between 1990 and 2010. And about one third of the productivity growth of the American economy over the same period. </p><p>What this comes down to in terms of wage effects that my co-authors and I've estimated, is that the rising in foreign STEM employment between 1990 and 2010 increased inflation-adjusted wage growth rate of college-educated natives by about 3.7 percentage points. Above what it otherwise would have been. For context, that is equivalent to about one third of the college-educated wage growth during that period. </p><p>I think that these figures alone attest to the problems associated with our current limits to high skilled immigration. But there are other reasons to be concerned as well. One, we know that immigrants who come to the U.S. are very entrepreneurial and innovative. A lot of that has to do with selection bias, but even after controlling for educational attainment, immigrants are more likely than natives to start a company with more than 10 workers. Twenty five percent of high-tech companies founded between 1995 and 2005 had at least one immigrant founder. And over 40 percent of companies on Fortune 500 in 2010 were found by an immigrant or the child of an immigrant. </p><p>Number two, we know that H-1B workers increase patenting activity without crowding out natives. One way to think about it is this. A firm I have a project plan and if they don't get the workers, the foreign workers that they want, they might choose to scrap the project altogether resulting in native employment and patenting activity losses. </p><p>Three, H-1B reductions may have reduced immigrant quality as well. This has happened at the college level. The highest ability foreign students have been deterred from seeking U.S. education because U.S. labor markets are close to them after graduation. This is a problem because whatever immigration policy we put in place1 should be designed to bring the best and brightest into the country. </p><p>Four, if you believe that foreign workers are competing with Americans with in our country's borders, they are certainly competing from abroad. Many countries have immigration policies favoring skilled workers. Simply put, if those workers do not produce goods and services here, they will do so in competing countries. </p><p>Now importantly, while our work finds economic gains for the average worker and the economy as a whole, I do not mean to imply that immigration is a cost free proposition. There is an important parallel here in the case of technology. We know that in recent years technology has contributed to growing wage inequality. It boosts wages of highly educated workers that has hurt or even replaced medium to low skilled workers. </p><p>Technological development has distributional consequences. Yet very few people would advocate into (ph) technological progress. Instead, we try to think about ways to redistribute money or to invoke job retraining programs to help those displaced workers. We can think of immigration in much the same way. As some groups are negatively affected, we should develop ways to assist them. </p><p>Reduced immigration is a counterproductive, non-solution because it harms the country on average. The bottom line is that the H-1B story is inseparable from a technology story and there are only three broad policy alternatives. Allow H-1B workers into the country to produce technology here, keep skilled workers out of the country and import technology from abroad, or close our borders to both skilled workers and technology. Thank you again for the invitation to testify here today and I look forward to answering your questions. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Next we have on Dr. Hal Salzman, professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy and senior faculty fellow of the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University. His research focuses on science and engineering labor markets workplace, restructuring skill requirements and globalization of innovation, engineering and technology design. </p><p>Recently he's been writing on the science and technology policy implications of his research. Dr. Salzman. </p><p>SALZMAN; Thank you. Mr. Chairman, members the committee, thank you for inviting me to speak today on high skilled labor demanding and guest worker policy. Since the hearing last March, we've seen the chasm between evidence and policy grew wider and deeper. STEM careers are being eroded by a shortsighted IT industry exploiting guest worker programs. </p><p>Instead of developing a globally competitive and internationally integrated workforce, all evidence and events suggest the substitution of guest workers for U.S. workers is accelerating. Current programs allow firms to subvert the free market and setting wage rates. And policies deny U.S. workers, whether native or immigrant, the careers and compensation they should expect given their education and skills. Instead of using the market, firms turn to the huge congressionally created lower-priced labor pool of guest workers to staff the vast majority of IT openings. </p><p>The evidence in brief. Our colleges graduate twice the number of STEM graduates has find a job each year. Of the entire workforce, only a third of those with STEM degrees are employed in STEM jobs. The glut of scientists at the doctorate level is so great the National Institutes of Health has an $11 million alternative jobs program for the 30 to 50 percent of recent PhDs who cannot find career science employment. </p><p>Engineers are graduating sufficient numbers for nearly all hiring needs. And the exception approves the rule as petroleum engineering were graduates in short supply until industry raised wages and then the number of graduates quickly tripled. Far more than needed. </p><p>And that leaves the T of STEM, tech workers, only a third of whom have STEM degrees. Another third without any four-year degree. And most are in jobs that do not require a bachelor's level technology degrees. </p><p>So of all the STEM fields, it is only the tech firms that seem unable to find U.S. workers and seem unable or perhaps just unwilling to use the free market to recruit them. Despite claims of unmet demand, this past year IT firms offered new graduates the same salaries as in previous years. Keeping average wage levels at the 1990s level. </p><p>IT firms have a level of exclusion in hiring seldom seen in the past half-century. Some firms are over 90 percent one demographic group, discriminating against nearly all U.S. workers excluding alike those who were American by birth or by choice. Making room for these guest workers, firms announced layoffs of more workers than the total number of H-1Bs provided to the industry with a layoff rate four times the size of its share of overall employment. </p><p>Any new legislation that echoes the recent I-Squared or Skills Act will expand the supply of guest workers to levels greater than the total number of new technology jobs. That is providing enough guest workers to fill every new IT job with a reserve large enough for firms to legally substitute young guest workers for their incumbent workforce. It would increase work freezes for those with a degree in anything from psycholinguistics to air-conditioning to petroleum technician with little consideration of whether there is a demand for work or a glut of U.S. graduates. </p><p>No doubt we will be told all that these firms want is the best talent available, they just can't find it here. But that's not what the firm say in SEC (ph) statements in which firms are required by law to be truthful. Accenture states the restrictions in guest worker supply would result \"newer (ph) higher minimum salary requirements and increase costs\". Another firm says they would have to \"replace existing offshore resources with local resources, namely U.S. workers at higher wages\". </p><p>That is without the congressional discount for guest workers, the highly profitable IT industry would have to hire more U.S. workers and pay them more than guest workers. The most rigorous study of H-1B workers based on actual wage records finds H-1Bs substantially crowd out employment of other workers and lead to lower average employee wages while raising firm profits. So what has happened in the past year, there's been a rising course of industry claims of unmet demand echoed by policymakers on both sides of the aisle, from here to the White House. </p><p>At the same time, STEM workers are available in ample numbers, incumbent workers are laid off by the tens of thousands. And even our brightest young doctoral level scientists struggle to find employment in sciences, much less careers and wages that will allow them to pay off staggering educational loans. Yet the IT industry says that unlike all other STEM fields, it alone can't find workers. That our colleges do not produce enough graduates. That searching the globe for the best talent leads to finding only one specific demographic group of very young workers. </p><p>These are claims from an industry that keeps average wages at levels from the last century. Fires more people in a year than H-1B guest workers it hires. And has allowed to discriminate at hiring at levels unprecedented in half a century. All by one of the most profitable industries on the planet. </p><p>Meanwhile, the tech industry spends $15 million a month in Washington. And perhaps this is a level of lobbying necessary to drive a wedge separating policy from evidence. But ever optimistic, I hope evidence prevails. Thank you. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Thank you Dr. Salzman. I know you've spent a career looking at these facts. And I believe what you say is essentially accurate. Also, I have received a number written statements from other workers like Mr. Perrero who are afraid to come forward. They worry about reprisal. They worry about having to sign an agreement or they couldn't get a severance package. And I'll offer those statements for the record without objection. </p><p>I understand that Senator Cruz and other members of the committee will be offering statements for the record also. I had to say on Mr. O'Neill, I seen no needs into -- need to end this program, but surely you would understand that people who come for (ph) a limited period of time just to take a job who will work for less or quite a different situation than an immigrant who wants to come in and start a company. </p><p>And we needed work on a legal system that would favor the most highly qualified. One way to do that is by salary. If you're paying the salary of United States senator, I think you can get a lot of workers, unless you're in a very expensive neighborhood. I got to tell you, we were blessed by the salaries we are paid. But I suspect you don't get as many vacation days as we do. Government workers. </p><p>Mr. Perrero, thank you for your very powerful testimony. It's truly saddening and heartbreaking what you and others have suffered. You noted you were one of the most respected employees in your division. Would you say that the majority of the workers whose jobs were outsourced were similar to yours? And that they were quality employees and able -- fully able to do the job that was being required of them? And --</p><p>PERRERO:  Yes, they are...</p><p>SESSIONS:  ...and they are to (ph) and doesn't require genius level people to fill those jobs that only can be obtained somewhere around the globe? </p><p>PERRERO:  Well, we were very experienced. We were at the top of our fields. These were top-notch people. They had the top honors that the company offered to us and recognized us as such. And that's why it was such a shock to us to be pulled into this room and be told that we had 90 days to train our replacements. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Well, thank you. Professor Salzman, you note that we have a -- you look with jaundiced eye towards the situation of more technically skilled workers than we have jobs. I've been shocked at the report that was published in Barron's that we would have as many as 330,000 IT workers laid off this year. </p><p>Is that consistent with your studies? And always seeing this rise in demand for IT workers? Or is it flattened out or even declining? </p><p>SALZMAN:  I think you're right. The layoff announcements I've heard were 80,000 most recently from Challenger and Gray of announced layoffs. And we know that they often appear in the hundreds and tens of thousands. So we see these layoffs while they're talking for the need for more guest workers and more work is being shift offshore. </p><p>So I don't -- I don't think there's any indication that demand this increase in anywhere near what you'd expect. Or, you know, from what one industry is saying. The hiring doesn't reflect that. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Professor Hira, on the college campuses, if wages aren't going up, they have increased since the late '90s and if jobs may actually be defining, could this person in a situation in which talented young people wouldn't go into these fields and creating another cycle of decline in American produced technological graduates? </p><p>HIRA:  You know, so we've seen these sort of typical boom and bust cycles. And Professor Salzman talked about petroleum engineering where there aren't a lot of H-1B workers. But where we had a boom in oil prices, there is a large increase in salaries for petroleum engineering (ph). And the market reacted, the education market, students reacted by going into petroleum engineering. </p><p>Now, with the oil prices plummeted, right, there are those kinds of opportunities. And what you'll see is students and engineers will move out of those fields. This is the normal functioning of the market. When you intervene with guest worker programs, you're intervening in that normal labor market to education market signal. </p><p>And that signal, that pricing signal is very very important. People will -- students will vote with their feet. They're going to move into fields that they believe are going to be good careers. And so I think that we should be very concerned about that. </p><p>Secondly, there's another set of workers that's really important that's often overlooked. And that's the incumbent workers. When a company can go to a cheaper H-1B worker, they're going to be less likely to invest in a workforce development of their current workers. They're not going to retrain their workforce (ph)...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SESSIONS:  Do that get an (ph) advantage -- Mr. O'Neill brings an H-1B worker in, he doesn't have to worry about carrying that person through a career which include retirement and healthcare, certain benefits and salary promotions. Is that a factor in what's happening? </p><p>HIRA:  Absolutely there is -- there is definitely calculations going on in terms of age. And age plays a role in terms of benefits costs to the company. As well as mobility. A young person in their 20s can be moved from client to client all around the country much more easily than somebody in their 40s. </p><p>And so what you see is that even these wages that we're talking about in terms of the wage differentials, they actually understate how much cheaper the H-1B workers are to the employer. Also those H-1B workers are captive in a lot of ways to that employer. So they're are indentured in a lot of ways. They don't have the same kind of job mobility and bargaining power that an American worker would have. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Senator Durbin. </p><p>DURBIN:  Thanks Senator Sessions. We start most conversations over the immigration by talking about our broken immigration system. Exhibit a -- you've just heard it right here. </p><p>When they do this auction on H-1B visas likely to encourage (ph) you said Dr. Hira in a few weeks, if it goes according to past history, two companies will get more than half of the H-1B visas for United States. Which American companies are they? No. They're two Indian companies. Infosys and Tata. Outsourcing companies. </p><p>They flood the market when it comes to applying for H-1B visas. And they end up with over half of them. Well, what we do with all those visas? They outsource those visas to companies in the United States. They send them as the vice president of Tata acknowledged, workers with certain skills accepting lower wages than what Americans are going to be paid. And that creates the economic advantage Dr. Salzman talked about. </p><p>So the company could take in the H-1B visas and cut their cost at the expense of American workers. Mr. O'Neill, first let me say nice suit. Second thing I'd like to ask you is this, how many employees do you have in your business? </p><p>O'NEILL:  We have 100 employees right now. </p><p>DURBIN:  OK. And what percentage are H-1B workers? </p><p>O'NEILL:  Two. </p><p>DURBIN:  Two. So you clearly wouldn't fit into the exclusions we've created in the Grassley Sessions Bill. More than 50 workers. More than 50 percent H-1B. And assuming that you didn't displace an American worker to hire the two. And assuming that you are paying market wages, then frankly you are not going to be disadvantaged by any of the reforms we're talking about. </p><p>O'NEILL:  Right. How -- the only thing that, you know, that concerns me when we talk about, you know, the improving the -- that were not displacing an American worker is just the ability to do that. You know, in principle that sounds wonderful. </p><p>My concern is that in practice it's -- the existing visa regime can already be a challenge for us to operate. </p><p>DURBIN:  But wouldn't you conceive that to your right, Mr. Perrero made a pretty convincing case about being displaced for an H-1B. </p><p>O'NEILL:  Absolutely. And I mean, look, the situation you're describing sounds, you know, like an incredible misuse of the program. And it seems very unfortunate that, you know, this has been allowed to happen to Mr. Perrero. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DURBIN:  So, let me just...</p><p>O'NEILL:  My whamming (ph) is that you've introduced legislation that would go a long way towards addressing any of the issues that caused that to happen. </p><p>DURBIN:  So let me go back to Mr. Perrero. And thank you for your testimony. I know it wasn't easy. And Mr. Miano in similar circumstances. </p><p>I think this gag order is what's hurting us dramatically. Dr. Hira talked about a letter that tell of a side a wide array. Imagine if you could get on the same letter that only my friend, Senator Sessions and Durbin. But Bernie Sanders, I mean we're all on the record saying what's happened here in Southern California is just plain wrong. </p><p>And it came back to us Dr. Hira and they said we haven't had anybody complain. You explained why no one complained, they're under gag orders. If they wanted a severance check, they had to sign a legal agreement. They can be sued if they violated the gag order. Dr. Hira is that what we're facing here in many instances? </p><p>HIRA:  Yes. So I think it actually goes beyond that. So the gag order makes people very reluctant to file complaints. But even after they file a complaint, the Labor Department said what happened in Southern California Edison was absolutely legal and fine. You can replace American workers with cheaper H-1B. So why would any American worker ever complain? </p><p>DURBIN:  So what we have done in the proposed reforms is to say flat-out, Mr. Perrero what happen to you cannot help legally. You cannot displace an American worker with H-1B worker. You cannot put you through this embarrassing and insulting experience of training your H-1B foreign worker replacement. Flat-out. </p><p>This law as it's currently written is so loaded and riddled with loopholes and exceptions. I can't even tell you and I asked my chief attorney here what is the number of H-1Bs coming in each year. He said it starts at 65,000 and there's an additional 20,000. But then you can renew. We can't even give you the exact number. </p><p>Perhaps the end of the year you can. But you can't give an exact number of the workers that are coming in here. So there's no accountability, as far as I'm concerned. No protection of American workers when they are available to work. </p><p>Dr. Sparber, let me close by saying, first generation American, my mother was an immigrant. I stand up for immigration. I believe it's part of our country. And I couldn't cheer you on more when you talk about what immigrants bring to this country in term of entrepreneurial spirit, determination to work whatever the dirty job is to make a go of it. This is not the case here. </p><p>We're talking about temporary guest workers who basically work at the mercy of an employer. And hope that at the end of three years maybe they'll be renewed. It isn't the same thing. It's a different thing. And I hope we don't put the two together. </p><p>If you'd like to comment, please do. </p><p>SPARBER:  This is not only a topic that I study, but it's something that I deal with firsthand in the sense that I teach a lot of very, very gifted undergraduate students who go under immense levels of stress every year when it comes job market season. They know that they're talented enough, hard-working enough to get jobs. What they don't know is whether or not they're going to be able to legally work here. </p><p>So I have students who I'm very close with once -- one got a -- got a job a couple years ago at a big firm in Boston. And after one year of working there lost the H-1B. And so...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DURBIN:  What was the degree? What digress do the student have? </p><p>SPARBER:  I believe it was economics, mathematical economics. Mathematical economics. </p><p>DURBIN:  Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill, which I helped to write and voted for said, if you have an advanced degree in STEM subject and you have a job offer, to get a green card. So we give an incentive for those who come to U.S. universities, get educated and skilled to stay here and use their skills to help build the economy. But it only applied to advanced STEM degrees. So I want to give that caution. </p><p>But I understand what you're saying. But we are also trying to make sure we take care of American graduates and American workers first. I think that's our obligation. </p><p>SPARBER:  I understand your position. I think I want to go back to the data suggesting that despite the abuses, the program is successful in generating American jobs, American employment, American wages and American productivity. </p><p>DURBIN:  H-1B? </p><p>SPARBER:  The H-1B and skilled workers. And what I would encourage us to think a little bit more about is the distributional aspects. Let me give you an alternative story, another anecdote if you will. </p><p>Somebody very close to me was working at a grocery store for multiple decades in California. That company decided to restructure and lay off the cutters, cutters are the people who put new products on the shelves, right? And so you're taking stock off the shelves, restocking the shelves and so forth. </p><p>And the reason why the company restructured was because they realize that they could contract with a third party that would work for lower wages and without benefits. So it's much cheaper for the company to outsource that work. The crystals or (ph) jobs that are happening within America, right? So those aren't outsourced to foreign workers, those are jobs cost-cutting measures, right? </p><p>And so I think a lot of what you're talking about. And a lot of these stories are really about job protection. OK. Across the board. Not just for jobs that might've been displaced due to immigration, but other kinds policies as well. </p><p>And frankly that's a -- that's a topic in which I might have strong opinions. I might even be reasonably well-informed. But it's not an area in which I'm an expert in any way. And instead I would say that I'm an expert on immigration issues and where I say that this program...</p><p>DURBIN:  I hate to interrupt you but I have to draw to a close, you've gone beyond time here. My job, I think, is to encourage a growing economy in this country. But to do it in a fair way. </p><p>Taking Mr. Perrero's job away so foreign worker can come in at lower wages for a three year period of time, I don't believe is consistent with fair economic growth. We ought to have a conscience of this country too about the kind of economy we want to generate. We don't want to drive it to the bottom with low wages and foreign workers who were here in a temporary basis. </p><p>When we need them in -- help to grow our economy, I'm for it. But not at the cost of American worker's jobs. And not when we see half of these visas going to two Indian companies. There's something wrong with this pitch. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Thank you Mr. Durbin. Senator Tillis. </p><p>TILLIS:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you gentleman for being here. Mr. Chairman as we -- as we go through, as I think we should some work on reforms, I think it's going to be critically important for us to dig below to really understand the complexity of the subject. Particularly as it relates to information technology. </p><p>To date myself, I started in technology back when the similar language was still very popular. And COBOL was emerging. And I was a COBOL programmer. That's how I got started. </p><p>And now if you take a look at where we are today, you can't -- just because this person says they're an IT person, that doesn't necessarily mean that they are qualified for the IT job. Particularly with the highly specialized nature of the industry today. The tools that are available, the hot skills. </p><p>I came up -- I was a partner responsible for an IT architecture definition and deployment practice at PriceWaterhouse back in the '90s. I moved -- I actually was tasked with creating a diversity recruiting practice within PriceWaterhouse to do everything that we could possibly do to find people coming out of school that have the kinds of skills that we needed to do implementation work. The last thing honestly I ever wanted to do was to have to go through the visa process if I could avoid it. </p><p>I know at Mr. O'Neill 's case of your a smaller businesses, it's very difficult. You worry about whether or not you're darting all of the -- all of the aisle (ph) and crossing all the tees and dealing with all the complexities. Not the least of which is dealing with the federal government and going through that process. </p><p>So I think as we go through this process, it's critically -- there's a lot of other sorts of disruptive things that have occurred over the last 10 or 12 years. You know, back when I had a position at IBM, I was a practice leader at IBM. A lot of companies were moving to pure play outsourced models. They were literally eliminating IT jobs and sending them overseas. </p><p>A lot of the jobs they were sending overseas were a part of the IT skill set that had largely become commoditized. It was a relatively -- in the world of IT, it was a relatively low skilled position. And it was very difficult, given the large base of people that you need to make the numbers work economically. And that's why outsourcing occurred. </p><p>Now, then you saw some on shoring and some hybrid models because you reached a point to where it made more sense to have the people back in the U.S. and different models have occurred. Industries have also had to come to these variable price models for their IT shop to be able to deal with economic fluctuations. In other words, get to a position where they can expand or contract their workforce to deal with the economic realities that the businesses may be facing. </p><p>Now, there are very clearly some bad practices out in the industry. And I think that we have to with these reforms figure out how we get better transparency into those practice where people are exploiting opportunities to pay somebody for less than they should. I can tell you in my 10 years in dealing with this issue on the other side, I've never saw an issue or ever heard a discussion that say go hire a visa worker because we can pay them less. </p><p>In fact, in many instances we pay the more because they happen to have a hot skills in an area and enterprise resource planning, various tools of modeling that you actually had to pay a premium because the market demanded that there was a fairly limited number of resources. So I think if we're going to do this right, doing it right means that the instances that were described by the gentleman here that we have transparency and we make those bad actions not occur. </p><p>I live in Charlotte which is a financial services hub and an IT hub. We've had Wells Fargo acquire Wachovia. And jobs were eliminated, right? So one would naturally expect that any person, any IT job that's in the Charlotte area would be filled because we have a large supply of people. Two years ago we had 1,000 unfilled positions in the Charlotte Mecklenburg area for IT skills because there was a mismatch between the requirements of the job and the skills of the person brought to the table. </p><p>And so when we go through this process, it's just critically important to understand that we've got to drill down and understand the real content of the jobs, the evolutionary nature of the needs. And the reality is, in an IT world, three years is a fairly long time to work on any one thing. </p><p>In my business, if you've been noted, for more than three years, you're probably over budget and over schedule. The nature of a lot of these large-scale projects. So we just need to make sure as we go through this, Mr. Chair, I'm talking more than I'm asking questions, is that this is something that is incredibly complicated. </p><p>It is something that even if we get it right and we should always bias the opportunities to the American worker, we should. And I think the most businesses would want to do that because of the complexity and a number of other factors that come in with having a large base that may come through a visa program. </p><p>But if we don't really understand -- and I'm speaking for IT, would could speak for other, maybe non-STEM related jobs, if we don't understand those then what we could potentially do is create a disruption to a workforce that could ultimately be the single greatest impediment to economic growth once this economy starts recovering again. And Mr. Chairman, if you don't mind, I do have one question for Mr. O'Neill. </p><p>Mr. O'Neill. you said that you have 100 workers, two of them -- can you give me an idea of what led you to hiring them in terms of skill sets? Or what factors made you decide that that's the direction you had to go? </p><p>O'NEILL:  Absolutely. You know, I was -- I was specifically looking to -- we're looking for developers who had experience working on the iOS platform. That's the Apple platform, so it's, you know, the iPhone, iPad. </p><p>TILLIS:  Yes. </p><p>O'NEILL:  Many of us carry them. And so we were looking for developers that had that experience. You know, I think there's a -- the assumption in some of the conversations that I'm hearing, you know, there's the indication that companies are sort of going and searching in some place where foreign workers exist and trying to get foreign workers from that particular window. </p><p>The fact to the matter is, is that the foreign workers that we employed are found in all of the same places. They're in American universities. They're on the job boards that we're looking for. </p><p>We're finding them in all the same places. So it's this global pool of talent that we're looking to find. And so we were looking to fill a particular skill set and, you know, we were looking -- we were looking all over for a long time. And personally I was under a significant pressure to find someone that could fill this role so I was very happy when we found one. </p><p>And then -- and then another. You know, make no mistake, H-1Bs from, you know, -- when -- from as far as I'm concerned, engaging with the system, H-1Bs cost more to an employer because of the -- of the visa program. Because there's a competitive wage. </p><p>But no one want to see American workers displaced like Mr. Perrero...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TILLIS:  No. And that's why I think we need a balanced approach. Because in a doomsday scenario, if we get this wrong, I think back to a point the Dr. Sparber mentioned. Then you could see some of the application portfolio where the numbers may be right to hire workers and do it in the United States move somewhere else. </p><p>You know, unless you eliminate -- my guess is this Internet thing is going to take off. And so -- that the virtual nature of the IT economy is here to stay. And if we -- if we think that we can artificially stop, you know, if we -- if we overreach in our -- in our reforms and reforms that I think that we need to move forward with, then what you actually could see, because of the underlying cost and complexity and the limitations on the supply of workforces that will drive up demand and drive up costs, you could see another migration to lower-cost jurisdictions and a net loss of American job opportunities. That's why it's so important to get this right. </p><p>We have -- we have recovered from what looked to be an unstoppable trend towards offshore -- there was a time when I was an IT shot but I said (ph) there will not be any IT workers in America 10 years from now. They'll all be in the Philippines or in Bangalore, in Mumbai and China and the other emerging markets as those become more competitive and cost drives you to another territory. </p><p>We could if we get this wrong create the stimulus to cause that migration to occurred again. And technology is becoming easier and easier to facilitate that so the barriers are going down at the time that we may be creating an incentive. If we don't get it right. And I think we got an opportunity to get it right. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Well, I hope so. Program is within the limits. Immigration policy should serve the legitimate interests of the American people. It's not interest of some special group would like to make different -- pay lower wages. </p><p>Dr. Salzman these examples you talked about, they were designed -- there were motivated by desire to reduce wages, weren't they? </p><p>SALZMAN:  No question. I think one thing to clarify this conversation a little bit is there's maybe a 15 percent of the demand is for, you know, the talent. You've got about 2 out of a 100. You're talking about a few here. And you're right (ph) --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SESSIONS:  When you say talent, you're referring to --</p><p>SALZMAN:  Hot --</p><p>SESSIONS:  -- really special --</p><p>SALZMAN:  Exactly. </p><p>SESSIONS:  ...highly bright people who could make a...</p><p>SALZMAN:  Correct. And those are the really tough to find. And there is some percentage of that. And you're right, we want to bring that in. </p><p>But something like two thirds of H-1B visa are paid between 60,000 to 67,000. Most of them are going to outsourcing firms. I'm sorry, you know, you (ph) been in industry for a while, but that ship left long ago. Most of the IT outsourcing is already offshore. And the teams here are to support the offshoring. </p><p>You know, maybe we'll bring some of that back. And I think Professor Hira can speak to that. But that's moved out and it's moved out because of the H-1B program. So we're talking about the bulk of the program, not the 2 percent, not the 10 percent. </p><p>We're talking about the primary function of the H-1B, the L, the OPT program. Is to support off shoring low-cost labor. I don't think you can get around it with, you know, a few examples here and there. It's the hundreds of thousands of jobs that have been lost that Perrero's talk about brawn (ph)...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SESSIONS:  Well, I think -- yes, I think there -- you know, there are some things can do. We have that 50,000 year diversity lottery. Which is an unusual idea. They got slipped in to that. </p><p>But what if we made that, you know, an Einstein-like policy. So people who really had exceptional talent on could be admitted into the country. Is that something, Dr. Hira, we -- you would suggest we focus on? Or say (ph)...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HIRA:  Well, I definitely -- I definitely thing what we should -- when we're picking H-1Bs as well as green card applicants, we should be much more selective. </p><p>SESSIONS:  And so the statute that we would draft or something like H-1B or what replaces it should give priority to people who bring exceptional talents, not just a -- a -- a 500 person unit at California Edison and everybody's replaced. </p><p>HIRA:  Yet (ph) the vast majority of the H-1Bs who are coming in have no more than ordinary IT skills. The fact is what we've seen in the Disney case, Southern California's Edison. It's actually the American workers who are training their replacement. </p><p>In terms of off shoring, firms are trying offshore is much as they can. The jobs that are still here in America are the ones that are geographically sticky. Those are the jobs that are difficult offshore. </p><p>      And the -- these off shoring companies that are using H-1B program, they have every incentive to move as much work offshore. You're facilitating the off shoring of the works. So I think the H-1B program overwhelmingly is working in the opposite direction of what you've describe. </p><p>Certainly there are cases and we have to look at -- at -- at balance. You definitely don't want to cut off the program altogether. But overwhelming right now the H-1B program is working to speed up the off shoring rather than keep it here in the US. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Mr. Perrero, Mr. Sparber in his written testimony says \"when foreign-born STEM workers enter the U.S. labor force, it creates an opportunity for native-born workers to respond by doing other kinds of work. Including managerial occupations that often, though not always, play high wages.\"</p><p>Did many of - how many lost jobs --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PERRERO:  Well, we have --</p><p>SESSIONS:  ...you're (ph) working in, how many got managerial jobs? </p><p>PERRERO:  Well, none. There were 300 people that were let go from Disney. Four that I'm -- that we are aware have got new jobs. None of them were managerial. Managerial folks maybe one out of five people are cut out to be managerial. So what happens to the other four that you've lost there? </p><p>And STEM jobs were typically the highest paying jobs in our economy as well. Where do those -- what other field do they go to? The four that loss their jobs and the one that became a manager. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Well, I tell you what's demanded (ph) to me -- I mean, this idea of we're going to transform our economy, you know, Senator Tillis, steel mills closed and textile mills closed, but don't worry we're all going to get IT jobs. And we're all run computers. </p><p>I happen to know that Facebook has 7,000 people only and they now be laid all 330,000 perhaps this year in the IT field? We're not going to replace American workers all of them are going to be computer geniuses. And then so the question is how many should we bring in abroad to take routine work that our people need to be doing? </p><p>Else they're going to be on welfare. They're going to be depressed. What are they going to do with their lives? I got to say the Atlantic had an article this summer, you know, The End of Work in America. </p><p>I mean, like End of Jobs in America. I mean, we have a declining job, robotics, computers, technology that was making us to be more productive. Which in the long run should be good and I don't intend to try to stop. But I just -- this is the reality we are dealing. </p><p>And Mr. Miano, can we write statutes? You looked I suppose that the statue -- the bills that are being proposed. Can we do something and then would put us back on the path of doing what people thought this bill was H-1B program was doing anyway? </p><p>MIANO:  Well, I think you have two very good bills. Yes, I think you've done a very good job in. Senator Grassley has done a good job as well. But, you know, if I were give my druthers, I just start from scratch. And I've given some people on the Hill copies of my bill of clue to (ph) rewriting the entire H-1B program months (ph) three pages compared to the 30 or so pages. You get -- 20 to 30 pages you get when you print it out now. </p><p>SESSIONS:  In this bill as is currently written among other things is exceedingly complex. </p><p>MIANO:  Which bill, senator? </p><p>SESSIONS:  The current H-1B law is complex. </p><p>MIANO:  The current H-1B program is just absolutely bizarre in complexity compared to what it does. I mean, it's like some Rube Goldberg contraption that all it does is clip a light switch. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Thank you. Senator Schumer. </p><p>SCHUMER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Thank you for joining us in, our distinguished ranking member. </p><p>SCHUMER:  Thank you and I thank you chairman for having the hearing. I want to welcome all of our panelists, but particularly to New Yorkers, Mark O'Neill from great New York company, JackThreads. And so we have upstate and downstate representation. </p><p>Dr. Chad Sparber of Colgate University of Hamilton New York. Hamilton University's in the same county but not in Hamilton New York. It's always perplexing to people. It's in Clinton New York. And we have a Clinton County. So there you go. </p><p>Anyway, not close to as confusing as some people find the H-1B program. I don't. OK. I want to thank you for coming. And I'd like to point out the chairman has had several hearings that point out the many improvements we could make to our immigration system. In fact, the Gang of Eight passed a bill in 2013 and that's the basis for this. </p><p>But when you consider these hearings they demonstrate the distinct clarity, with distinct clarity the need for our immigration bill. In a rapidly changing economy that continues to generate high demand for high skilled labor, especially in tech, companies need the flexibility to hire the best person for the job. That's what the H-1B program was intended to provide. And every day there are companies who use the program exactly as intended. </p><p>But it must be carefully calibrated of course to make sure the H-1Bs are not abused to the detriment of American workers. We've all seen and heard, today as well, too many examples of foreign corporations abusing loopholes in the law to outsource jobs and undercut American workers. I find that outrageous</p><p>And that's why in the bill we passed we tighten these things up. Many of the companies that prey on H-1B wouldn't be able to do so under our legislation. What we sought to do is encourage the best and brightest individuals to come to America to create new technologies. And discourage businesses from using our immigration laws to replace capable American workers with temporary and less-expensive foreign labor. </p><p>Today's hearing is not an indictment of immigration reform. It's an indictment of doing nothing. Which in all fairness, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they rail against this bill but they don't have any replacement. Therefore, the status quo, until we see a comprehensive bill on the other side of the aisle we'll be able to say that. </p><p>SESSIONS:  We have three bipartisan bills, fenick (ph) --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SCHUMER:  Yes, but they're not comprehensive. They're a little tiny...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SESSIONS:  Well, if you mean comprehensive, we double a lawful flow of immigration...</p><p>SCHUMER:  Yes. </p><p>SESSIONS:  ...across the board. Or...</p><p>SCHUMER:  No. Excuse me. OK. You're my -- we see each other in the gym on -- by every morning so we can talk to each other like this. </p><p>SESSIONS:  I should be...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHUMER:  I'm making him a little more Brooklyn. I don't know if he's making me a little more Alabama. But in any case, this our (ph) bill passed, as everyone knows with 68 bipartisan votes, we crackdown on outsourcing. Something I know you'll care about, Mr. Chairman. Something we've heard about today. Something that I care about. While increasing protections for the workers. </p><p>So I'm hopeful we can get that. Now, what did our bill do? We double the fees on H-1B and L-1 abusers. And I know I'm not supposed to say this, but many of these companies from India are not in the spirit of H-1B. Now, we'll a call from the Indian ambassador so be it. American jobs come first to me. </p><p>And they abuse it. And I want to do, when we did H-1B, I want to increase the number of legitimate H-1B, but go after these abuses. And that's what we did. </p><p>But unfortunately, Department of Justice and Homeland Security tell us that a new legal authority, just the kind we provided in immigration reform. Because the truth is that while there may be some illegal activity act here, the basic practice of replacing an American work worker with a high skilled visa holder is not illegal right now. </p><p>So, we need comprehensive reform both to increased number of H-1B and to get after the abusers. We want to help the middle class, Democrats do. We want to create jobs, get wages rising. That's what CBO said about our bill there, nonpartisan they said our bill would grow GDP by 3.5 percent. More than any Democratic spending program or Republican tax-cut. </p><p>At the same time, it would reduce the deficit. It's hard to believe that this bill was turned down. Seriously, we have the support of business. We have the support of labor. We have the support of the religious community including evangelicals. </p><p>Dr. Land (ph) testified in favor of our bill. And bad for America that the bill went down. It's bad for American workers is my judgment. </p><p>Immigrants raise wages for America. And less people think there's not a shortage, I go to companies throughout New York State. Downstate, like Mr. O'Neill, but upstate too. What's their biggest problem? One of the top three always is they can't get the labor they need, particularly engineers. </p><p>And look, we have RPI in Albany. We have RIT (ph) just -- the president was just here visiting me in Rochester. Big engineering schools. We have big engineering schools in New York City, we still have a shortage of engineers. </p><p>And everybody you talk to tells you that. Business people, Republicans. They tell me that. And I don't hold it against them that they're Republicans or that they're business people. </p><p>But in any case, so we need them. We need them. And Congress has to play this important role. We simply -- it simply doesn't make sense to have an immigrant's need not apply policy when we have so many help-wanted signs in our high-tech, manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture and research sectors. </p><p>Let's pass comprehensive immigration reform. That's what's needed. The bill that Eight -- the Gang of Eight. And I'll name the people, Senator Durbin, Senator Menendez, Senator Bennett and myself on the Democratic side. Senator McCain, Senator Flake, Senator Graham and Senator Rubio on the Democratic -- on the Republican side, work to pass-- I had fun doing that -- work to pass this legislation. </p><p>Can I ask a question, Mr. Chair? </p><p>(OFF-MIKE)</p><p>SCHUMER:  Sorry, then I won't. OK. First from Mark O'Neill, just tell us how you recruit talent? How of the H-1B and another high skilled visa programs helped you? How could the programs be improved to help small businesses like yours in our innovation economy? </p><p>Just give us some personal experience in addition to what you told us in your testimony. </p><p>O'NEILL:  I mean, the personal experiences is what I come armed with today. First of all, I just want to thank you and other members of the Senate for advancing comprehensive immigration reform. You know, it's my understanding that a lot of the horror stories that we've been hearing for other members of -- others who are testifying today would have been avoided if we had passed that bill. So I think that would make a lot of sense. </p><p>You know, Dr. Salzman describes an industry that I don't recognize. For people on my team, you know, wages are high. We don't have a budget for lobbying in Congress incidentally. But we still have difficulty in attracting people. </p><p>And so the method that we use, you know, I'm going to meet up, I'm traveling the country to go to a different college career fairs. Attempt --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHUMER:  Type (ph) what are the skills that you're short of in your business, Mr. --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>O'NEILL:  So the skills I'm looking for, I'm looking for talented developers who know JavaScript, who know PHP, who know Ruby, who can code on the -- on the Apple or the android platform. Those are the primary platforms that generate all of our revenue ejector as we have no physical store. And so the only store that we have is what we build electronically and so it's very important that we handle our clients' money correctly and that the right pants get in the right box and get to the right house. </p><p>SCHUMER:  Right. </p><p>O'NEILL:  And all that is complicated. So we're seeking engineers who have those skills and are able to come on and join our team...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SCHUMER:  And you a rough time finding them? </p><p>O'NEILL:  We have an extremely difficult time finding them, you know. We've had -- we've had roles sit open for months at a stretch. I know...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHUMER:  Any reason an American engineer who wanted a job wouldn't walk in and talk to you? </p><p>O'NEILL:  None that I can think of. </p><p>SCHUMER:  Right. </p><p>O'NEILL:  I've been -- I've been criticized occasionally for my personality, but no, I think --</p><p>SCHUMER:  You seem to have -- you're not from New York originally, I can tell by your accent. But we have...</p><p>O'NEILL:  Yes, very good...</p><p>SCHUMER:  What? </p><p>O'NEILL:  Very good. Yes, I am a Boston fan. </p><p>SCHUMER:  Wait a minute, Mr. Chairman. But, no, we in New York welcome all these great entrepreneurs who come here and open up businesses and create jobs. OK. My time's up. </p><p>I just wanted to make one more point to Mr. Perrero. And that is this -- that is this, if our bill had passed, you wouldn't be in the pickle you're in. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Well, the Gang of Eight Bill did double the number of H-1B workers and made very little reform in the process. And may will ask about that in a minute. Senator Tillis. </p><p>TILLIS:  Yes. Actually I was thinking (ph) first Dr. Hira and Dr. Salzman. I actually agree with your points on outsourcing. The point -- and actually if you've studied it, you probably gone in more depth than me. Then you all know that when the first wave of outsourcing occurred a lot of businesses got out in front of their blockers. They put a lot offshore. They had a lot of problems with implementations which is what gave rise to this reverse migration the we're talking about today. </p><p>The reality however is that they're becoming more sophisticated. And if we don't get this right, then we're -- we talk about tax aversions here. We talk about, you know, companies reorganizing and going offshore because of the complex and onerous tax code that we have in the United States. If we get these changes wrong, you can see a labor inversion. </p><p>You could see a net reduction in IT, I'll speak for the IT industry. You could see a net reduction in jobs if we don't get this right. The fact that I can sympathize with the folks -- I don't (ph) have many colleagues who could share stories similar to those that were shared earlier. And that I can agree to a point on everything that you're saying in your comment at those from different perspectives suggest the complexity of the issue and the need to be thoughtful and get it right. </p><p>More than anything, I'd love to see a copy of your three-page bill, Miano, Mr. Miano. </p><p>MIANO:  Yes, Senator. </p><p>TILLIS:  Because the only thing -- you know, working with the federal government is a very difficult task. As a U.S. senator -- as it for a constituent, so you all work and say with the Department of Labor. Yet is a nightmare for me. It's scarier than the flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz for me to have to go pick up the DoL and trying to figure out their immigration processes. They're absolutely broken. </p><p>So as we do reform, we need to simplify and we need to work on -- I mean, this is a multifaceted highly complex issue. And if we're not careful then what we could end up finding is that Mr. O'Neill won't get the resources that he needs. The -- the -- the jobs right now that are at least generating some revenue to the extent they're employed in the United States and paying taxes associated with that, on another migration if we don't get this right. </p><p>So I wanted to speak less about the specific policy in the bill and speak more to the several facets that we have to look at to get it right. And along the way (ph) provide the constant protections we should for the American worker. </p><p>HIRA:  If I may, I agree with everything that you're saying here. In fact, I wrote a book called Outsourcing America 11 years ago now that describe what was going on and what was likely to come in terms of -- particularly in terms of IT outsourcing. A couple of things, IT companies have every incentive to offshore as much work as possible right now. </p><p>Although their billing rates out of India, which is where most of the work goes, are (ph) about $35 an hour. Much lower than the billing rates in the U.S. The margins are much higher. </p><p>Just to give an example, my cousins in India, you know, are typically getting about $6,000 or $8,000 a year. Which should be about $3 or $4 an hour in India. So it's cheaper for them and more profitable to offshore as much work as possible. </p><p>The work that's remaining here is geographically sticky. And those jobs should go to Americans, except when Americans aren't easily found. Now, how do you determine whether someone is easily found or not I think is where you're going in terms of the balance. </p><p>TILLIS:  Exactly. </p><p>HIRA:  And I think the easiest way to do that is to raise wage floors very significantly so that H-1B workers are not hired for cheaper labor. As I said in my opening statement, right now it is extraordinarily easy to bring in H-1Bs at much lower salaries. Mr. O'Neill 's company may not do it and he may not be aware of it, but just to give you an example he said he has two H-1B workers, you know, Cognizant probably has 25,000 H-1B workers here and hardly any Americans. </p><p>They have another 200,000 in India. So we're talking about apples and oranges in terms of the scale of what the H-1B is doing terms (ph) is speeding up off shoring as opposed to keeping and creating jobs in the US. And so it's that -- the kind of balance that it's -- there is no balance right now is what I would say. It's all balanced towards cheap labor. </p><p>UNKNOWN:  If I can just over one example about the existing system that you talk about, the danger of getting it wrong. You know, I've seen -- I have a good friend men of Krishna (ph) who graduated from Columbia University here in United States. He has a degree here in United States. </p><p>He began working on H-1B for a local company but he founded a business here, a company called the Hun (ph) that's teaching English to non-English speakers. And unfortunately the way the current system is set up, he was not able to have his own company and sponsor his own visa. And so for that reason, he wasn't able to remain and had to go back to India and took five more jobs with him. </p><p>One of the dangers of getting it wrong as you -- as you say, is that we create disincentive to create information hubs and we sort of push expertise. We've essentially create areas that are competing directly with us outside of the United States. </p><p>TILLIS:  Thank you. </p><p>SESSIONS:  All right. Thank you. Well, I don't know. I'll start with you Dr. Salzman but maybe Dr. Hira would answer. With regard to the Gang of Eight Bill and the H-1B reforms, my understanding was that the bill essentially double the number of H-1B people that would be admitted into United States for the simple purpose of taking jobs. </p><p>They don't come to become a citizen or not but never (ph), they come to fill a specific job. And there was very little reform in the bill. Senator Durbin suggested -- he suggested some reforms but indicated they weren't approved. And I think that's -- as I remember exactly what happened. </p><p>Dr. Hira you're seeing them -- your remember that? Or --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HIRA:  Yes. </p><p>UNKNOWN:  I would probably answer that because I've been the one that it tends to approve (ph) promotion. But one of the things I did was go through the entire tangle in the 1,198 pages, pull out all the itch (ph) of the bill. Pull out all the H-1B provisions and added them to the code for it (ph). And they are in the book sold out, it's filling out exactly what the bill would've done. </p><p>I mean, I think one of things for example is it turns -- part of a (ph) link, it turn the H-1B quota from being, you know, basically a paragraph to two pages of typed text that only a lawyer can understand. And even then, it's a -- it's a tough bits. </p><p>So I didn't -- I was kind of upset that Mr. - Senator Schumer's adhere that is to say that. But if anyone wants a copy, I will get them. Get the copies so you can see exactly what bill does. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Exactly. Do you want to follow up, Dr. Hira? </p><p>HIRA:  Yes, I'd like to follow up. There certainly were some positive of provisions in the -- in the H-1B provisions in the S.744, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill. But on that, it would've been much worse for American workers than the status quo. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Well, I just want to say, I've been through this battle. We've been through it a lot. You can't rely on the talking points. </p><p>HIRA:  And I think that -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SESSIONS:  They may have agreed to the bill and they may have had the Chamber of Commerce agree and will rise (ph) agree and politicians agree and other people. But the law enforcement officers weren't in the room. Explain what the loopholes were and how they were not being closed. And neither did the American people agree and that's why it didn't pass. </p><p>HIRA:  And could I -- could I just add that --</p><p>SESSIONS:  Yes. </p><p>SALZMAN:  ...in the case of Mr. Schumer, Senator Schumer said that Mr. Perrero's job would've been lost if the bill had passed. In fact, his job would've been lost instead of being lost to HCL, the company that he -- that brought in the H-1B worker for Disney. It would have been lost to Accenture., to IBM which would be imported an H-1B or an L-1 worker and replace them at a lower rate. </p><p>UNKNOWN:  Senator, juts make a point illustrate (ph) ...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SESSIONS:  Yes. </p><p>UNKNOWN:  ...the entire immigration system is created 1952 and 120 pages. It went through the most radical change every in 1965 in 12 pages. But reforming that system cratered in 100 -- in 120 pages apparently requires 1,198 pages of -- I mean, it's kind of puzzling how we reach that level of statutory proliferation. </p><p>SESSIONS:  What a tango (ph) where we create when we first practiced to regulate as always a knot (ph) of loophole that has to be closed and another one (ph). But I think I hear what you're saying. This is an important subject. </p><p>I do believe United States on can benefit from the immigration. We absolutely need (ph) to look from our most talented creative people. We do not need to have a system in which somebody's capable of reaching an exceedingly high level and they can't get in the country. But I also would say to you that I'm a little bit uneasy, more than a little uneasy. </p><p>I oppose firmly the idea that if anybody from America comes -- from the world comes to America and managed to get a degree from some college, they should automatically be given citizenship or permanent legal status. I mean, that can't be. I mean, a nation has to establish an immigration system that serves its interest over the long term. </p><p>We have -- we admit a million people a year to permanent residence and a guaranteed pathway to citizenship. Every year. No nation admits that many on a consistent basis. And I think we need to understand that. </p><p>We have 500,000 students. And many of them are able to work while they're here. And we have 700,000 guest workers. Is that about right Dr. Salzman? Do you or Dr. Hira? </p><p>UNKNOWN:  It's closer to a million. </p><p>SESSIONS:  A million? </p><p>UNKNOWN:  Yes. We don't know because the DHS doesn't hackle (ph) people</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SESSIONS:  And those people came for one purpose, the guest workers basically, that's to work. Now, some of these aren't seasonal workers and there are and here's the country where they come and work for a period of time in your home and that gets (ph) a lot on taking truck driver jobs, in construction jobs, landscaping jobs. That I see in my neighborhood are native born Americans every day doing that work. </p><p>It's nuts that these are jobs Americans won't do. They do it every day. So I think the country has to be careful as we bring in large flow and ask ourselves is Mr. Perrero and people like him being laid off? Are he and his colleagues finding their wages going down or not going up? </p><p>And what is the right amount? So we have this big bill that came up. And to my knowledge -- well, Dr. Salzman and Dr. Hira and Mr. Sparber you might have been and Mr. Miano, were any of you asked to come, bring your expertise to these people who met in secret for several months to write this Bill? </p><p>UNKNOWN:  Not at all, senator. </p><p>SESSIONS:  Or you Dr. Hira? Good. Dr. Salzman? I won't (ph) very few at a contrary view I think were involved in that process. </p><p>So look, thank you all. This is an intense subject. We want to get it right. We're not against immigration. We need a policy that affects you, effectively allows a flow that serves the interests of the United States, strengthens America and that gives people an opportunity to come here. </p><p>There are no other questions? Comments? We're adjourned.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDNEW-565681</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FEDNEW2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J6P-2XW1-DY7X-Y18G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"17177\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Federal News Service, Inc.

Meanwhile, Congress will be getting used to new faces atop critical agencies.</p><p>LOOKING BACK</p><p>The immigration reform bill that passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in May made Big Tech a big winner. After spending years and millions of dollars building up its collective lobbying presence, Silicon Valley showed its growing clout in the Gang of Eight compromise.</p><p>The revised bill would allow the number of H-1B visas for high-skilled jobs to potentially rise over time to 180,000 and increase the number of green cards for foreign graduates of American schools with advanced science, technology, engineering and mathematics degrees. The measure also loosens earlier restrictions that would have forced major tech companies to show they made an effort to hire Americans first.</p><p>The House passed the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act in April, approving for a second time a measure that President <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>threatened to veto last year. Overall, concerns about cybersecurity rose dramatically amid numerous high-profile hackings, and U.S. allegations of Chinese cyberespionage took a starring role in a meeting between the presidents of America and China.</p><p>In early June, Obama announced a package of executive actions and legislative recommendations to fight abusive litigation threats from so-called patent trolls.</p><p>Major firms, including Google, Facebook, Verizon and Apple, were put on the defensive after it was revealed that the NSA, as part of anti-terrorism programs, had been accessing and combing metadata from phone records as well as Internet activity.</p><p>Obama elevated his Harvard Law classmate Edith Ramirez to Federal Trade Commission chairwoman. And over at the Federal Communications Commission, the president tapped venture capitalist and former telecom lobbyist Tom Wheeler to lead the agency after Julius Genachowski stepped down. Currently, Mignon Clyburn is the acting commissioner, the first woman to helm the FCC.</p><p>LOOKING AHEAD</p><p>Immigration reform will remain at the top of the agenda in Congress. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he expects the Senate to vote on the Gang of Eight package by July 4, and House Speaker John Boehner wants committees to wrap up work on a version of legislation before the holiday.</p><p>One issue sure to persist in the immigration debate is a provision to expand the E-Verify employment verification system. Civil libertarians on the left and right -- from the American Civil Liberties Union to tea party darlings such as Sen.

It is in this capacity that anonymity is often understood as instrumental and conducive to citizens' personal privacy vis-a-vis said apparatuses. Yet there is another sense to anonymity less immediately aligned with or intelligible within these privacy-centric narratives. In the motto that epitomizes the liberatory role attributed to online anonymity in early net culture ('On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog'), anonymity designates a particular mode of sociality and culture that is impersonal or even anti-personal, ephemeral, collective, authorless and in that sense 'nameless' and 'faceless'. Today, imageboards like 4chan continue to cultivate and embrace anonymity in this sense, as a mediatic condition post-humaine. The article aims to show that these forms of anti- and impersonal media prosumption have their roots in a more encompassing tradition of popular mass media culture, against which the right to privacy was originally asserted. </p><p>As a value, privacy is linked to class-specific anxieties over the increasingly anonymous and impersonal forces of mass modernity and its new media publics, whose profane curiosity desired to 'bring things closer' by means of their technological reproduction. The emergent mass culture threatened dominant bourgeois values of personal autonomy and selfhood historically and culturally implied in the idea of a right to privacy. The resulting understanding of anonymity and its relation to privacy suggests an alternative perspective on what is at stake in the politics of online anonymity today.</p><p>Introduction</p><p> 'On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog'. This caption to a famous cartoon by Peter Steiner published in The New Yorker in 1993 epitomizes the positive role attributed to anonymity in early net culture. But since then much has changed.</p><p> With the rise of mass surveillance, big data analytics and a booming platform economy, the Internet, rather than fostering anonymity, is said to contribute to its demise (Froomkin, 2015). Moving toward an Internet of things as the backbone of a society of control, where every interaction is instantly identified, tracked, mined and so rendered exploitable and manipulable by corporate and state actors that themselves remain in the dark, Steiner's cartoon no longer rings true. Confronted with the growing precarity of online anonymity and its negative effects on privacy, Steiner's dogs may in retrospect come to nostalgically mark a relic from a blissful past in which online anonymity - and thereby privacy - was still possible.</p><p> The last decades have shown that online anonymity is indeed no longer (or perhaps never was) given, but instead something that needs to be constantly created and updated, and with uncertain returns, if any at all. In line with this dominant narrative, societal actors concerned with the withering of online anonymity generally situate it in a liberal-democratic rights problematic which revolves around questions of personal privacy and free speech. A recent UN report claims that 'Encryption and anonymity, today's leading vehicles for online security, provide individuals with a means to protect their privacy' as well as 'exercise the rights to freedom of opinion and expression' (UN General Assembly, 2015: 3). Various apps (Signal) or services (Tor) claim to improve their users' privacy by providing anonymous means of communication. Finally, following the postSnowden and WikiLeaks rise in consumer awareness, tech and social media giants like Apple and Facebook have also become more attuned to new privacy needs, by offering encryption for their devices (iPhone) and apps (WhatsApp), or by allowing Tor-access to its platform (Facebook, since 2014).</p><p> These examples serve to sketch in very broad strokes the context in which the language of online anonymity is presently spoken, and in which the terms 'anonymous' and 'anonymity' acquire their particular meaning and political legibility, as an instrument and stake in citizens' battle for privacy and free speech against governments and big tech. Yet the kind of online anonymity Steiner's cartoon suggests can also be read in a different key, namely as referring to the various modes of impersonal sociality and anonymous media prosumption that early net culture harboured. Rather than exclusively or even primarily geared towards individual and personal privacy concerns, the way the cartoon mockingly celebrates online anonymity refers to the joy and thrill of engaging in ephemeral encounters with unknown others, of momentarily suspending one's 'real' life in dissimulative role-playing, and of losing oneself in a proliferation of digital masks on forums and chatrooms, or in virtual environments and multiplayer games. Despite the general trend towards social media platforms like Facebook, where most content is organised around personalised timelines and friend-communities, imageboard repositories like 4chan (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.4chan.org\">www.4chan.org</url>) continue to affirmatively cultivate anonymity in Steiner's sense (Bernstein et al., 2011). On these imageboards, masquerade forms 'an integral part of social interaction' in which 'suspicion, pranking, and unreality are pervasive', issuing in the specific understanding of 'anonymity as culture' (for this concept see Auerbach, 2012: online). These practices of online anonymity explore the ephemeral and multiple, pseudonymous, and collaborative forms of media prosumption that the Internet uniquely enables. It is to this sensibility that 4.chan's founder refers when he claimed - in mocking defiance of social media platforms like Facebook - that 'anonymity is authenticity' (Christoper 'moot' Poole, quoted in Bodle, 2013: online).1</p><p> What these preliminary observations on two rather different ways to situate and interpret the meaning and value of online anonymity reveal, is simply that there are indeed these different dimensions to the question of online anonymity. The larger discourse or problematic by means of which we try and make sense of a cartoon such as Steiner's will largely determine what aspects of online anonymity stand out as meaningful or politically significant. This raises the question: where do these different aspects and interpretations of online anonymity overlap, and where do they come apart?</p><p> It seems to me that when anonymity is spoken of as instrumental or conducive to ensuring citizens' privacy, it is typically framed as an informatic condition or statistical measure of non-identifiability and non-traceability of digital communications or personal data. It is in this capacity that anonymity is thought to safeguard communication of a personal and private nature against intrusion by external parties operating 'off-stage' (e.g. the NSA or even your local Wi-Fi fraudster). Instead, in the case of Steiner's cartoon and imageboards like 4.chan, anonymity refers to a social and cultural modality of mediatic interaction. Here anonymity is attributed to impersonal and public forms of online spectatorship and media presumption, whose participants are anonymous and unknown to each other.</p><p> The following example clarifies this distinction: you can access Facebook via Tor and be relatively anonymous in the first 'informatic' sense, but not in the second, 'socio-cultural' sense, given the nature of Facebook as a platform, which is designed to facilitate personal interactions between known others in a sheltered community environment built around personalised time lines and verified 'real names'. Instead, whereas 4.chan does little to protect its users' anonymity in the first sense (it is not using HTTPS and it logs its users' IP-addresses) it does enable anonymity in the second sense, by allowing users to post and share images under any pseudonymous banner without registration, and by organising content in comprehensive public threads to which anyone can contribute, but which are quickly deleted once contribution to them fades. So although it is true that anonymity in the first sense typically helps to establish or maintain anonymity in the second sense, just as, conversely, a culture of anonymity tends to foster values sympathetic to 'actual' informatic anonymity, the above example shows they can come apart in significant ways.</p><p> How are these different dimensions to online anonymity aligned with the notion of privacy? Whereas it is only natural to link privacy and the first, informatic sense of anonymity, in this article I argue that anonymity in the second sense - as an impersonal mode of sociality and culture cultivated on imageboards like 4.chan - is more problematic from the perspective of privacy as itself representative of an historically and class specific, socio-cultural ideal. Returning to the moment where a right to privacy was first explicitly formulated in the context of mass media related issues, more specifically the rise of so-called 'yellow journalism' and its use of new reproductive technologies like photography, the first section reconstructs how privacy as a value arose from anxieties over the increasingly anonymous and impersonal forces of modern life and its new mass media, whose new mass publics transgressed established cultural codes and social privileges.</p><p> The second section expands on this reconstruction through the eyes of the generation of 'Weimar' critical theorists and artists like Walter Benjamin, Siegfried Kracauer and Bertolt Brecht, who were among the first to perceive and critically contemplate the growing influence and pressure of 'the masses' and new media technologies on prevailing social divisions and cultural paradigms. The masscultural logic that manifested itself through the new publics' profane curiosity to bring things closer by way of their technological reproduction, Benjamin claimed, harboured an enormous culturally destructive potential, and suggested new, potentially emancipatory forms of collectivity and practice, anticipating what Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge (1993 [1972]) later theorised as the 'blocked' elements of a 'proletarian public sphere'. Using these writers' critical insights on the profane, plebeian thrust of mass culture, it becomes clear that from the end of the 19 th century onward, the former slowly eroded and forced into crisis the auratic root of the person and its immunity. It is this crisis in the context of which anxieties over personal privacy were first voiced, and which still resonate in current understandings of privacy as control and ownership over one's personal information. Despite many important differences between Warren and Brandeis' historical conjuncture and the way they argue for a right to privacy, and ours, the longue dur\u00e9e problematic of mass culture and the resulting crisis of autonomous personhood nevertheless connects their present to our own.</p><p> Immunising the person against an epidemic of 'ruthless publicity': Reconstructing the societal problematic at the core of Warren and Brandeis' 'The right to privacy'</p><p> There are not many concepts that have been subjected to so much critical scrutiny as privacy, even within the liberal-bourgeois legal traditions whence it came. Communitarian and socialist critiques typically reject privacy's possessiveindividualist premises; whereas feminist critiques focus on its historical function in reproducing and sanctioning a patriarchal organisation of the domestic sphere.2 These critiques have led some to abandon it in search of less tainted concepts. More frequently however, a transformed idea of privacy that salvages the criticised aspects is proposed, implying that the relation between these aspects and the concept itself is ultimately contingent. Consequently, privacy is spoken of in many ways today. Brunton and Nissenbaum note that 'the house of privacy has many rooms' and that within different uses of the term 'are divergent concepts' (2015: 45). Static notions of privacy construe it as the state of being private and the right to privacy as each person's right to be let or even lejt alone, to live undisturbed and in absolute independence from others. Instead, more dynamic, control-oriented or social accounts take privacy to refer to the ability to manage access to one's personal sphere across different public/private registers (Altman in Kerr and Steeves, 2009: 206). The fact that there is such a plurality of different privacy concepts seems to preclude any one criticism of 'privacy in general'. Yet despite crucial differences and historical shifts in emphasis on different aspects of privacy, in Laws of image: Privacy and publicity in America Samantha Barbas locates as one of the fundamental continuities at the core of most privacy concepts the importance of 'the exercise of autonomy and control over the self' (2015: 33). Taking this continuity as its premise, my approach differs from the above-mentioned critiques of privacy in its specific angle namely that of the rise of a popular, mass media culture, and the alternative understanding of anonymity as a social and mediatic condition implied therein.</p><p> Regarding the relation between privacy and anonymity, Alan Westin - former professor of public law at Columbia and author of the influential book Privacy and freedom - listed urban anonymity and anonymity of publication as one of four distinct types of privacy, the other three being solitude, intimacy, and reserve. Solitude, which refers to the state of each individual 'freed from the observations of others', is 'the most complete state of privacy that individuals can achieve' (Westin, 2006 [1967]: 36-37). Intimacy refers to forms of 'corporate seclusion', small social units of personally related people like family, friends or colleagues. Finally, the term 'reserve' seems inspired by Georg Simmel's sociological observations on the transformations of mental life in the city, where reserve and indifference designate the behavioural attitudes of discretion and mental distance that respects the personal demands and psychic requirements of interactional partners under metropolitan conditions.</p><p> Subsuming such a broad range of different phenomena under the single rubric of privacy, raises the question: what allows these four phenomena to be categorised in this way? What do they have in common such that they can be understood as four separate instances of privacy? The answer to this question must be sought, I think, in a certain expansion or naturalisation of privacy that transcends the classspecific character of its original historical context of enunciation. As such it implies both a dehistoricisation and a depoliticisation of the socio-cultural conditions by which privacy as a value, ideal and specific right came to be, as a moral stake and legal instrument in deciding the direction and resolution of various societal transformations and frictions present at the time. By contrast, the following sections situate the right to privacy in the context that gave rise to it, namely the emergence of a mass society and its new forms of mass publicness, which allowed new publics to bring into the formerly privileged spheres of cultural representation new experiences, tastes, styles, affinities, and interests not necessarily aligned with the ruling cultural and moral paradigms.</p><p> Westin's categorisation provides a clear example of a more general tendency to understand the value of 'anonymity in public space and of publication' in terms of privacy. Expanding the scope of application and relevance of privacy even further, Westin claims that while many people believe that '[Man's] desire for privacy is distinctively human', it can in fact already be found as a primal need in less developed animal species (1984 [1967]: 56). This innate animal and human desire for privacy manifests itself in evolutionary terms as a 'tendency toward territoriality, in which an organism lays private claim to an area of land, water, or air and defends it against intrusion by members of its own species' (56). Such a founding of privacy in our 'animal natures' is the most extreme but - from its own perspective - logical end point of its understanding of privacy, which draws and collapses all possible, highly diverse and often incommensurable states of privateness and publicness into its concept.</p><p> Historicising Westin's categorisation, we can concede that personal and corporate seclusion clearly fit the label 'privacy' insofar as both originate in the private/public sphere divisions underlying liberal-bourgeois traditions of imagining and legally codifying social space. Through a series of internal spatial codifications, the private dwelling provides to each family member a measure of personal solitude vis-a-vis the relatively more public living quarters. This kind of individual solitude is deemed essential to the development of certain capacities of psychic interiority conducive to personal autonomy, understood as a kind of 'mental privacy'. Together with familial seclusion, solitude is constitutively related to what it excludes: the public sphere as well as the world of private property and the market, as reconstructed by Habermas (1991), Rorty (2009) and others: 'the public sphere emerges in private, and it emerges via a particular mode of subjectivization. Indeed, that there was a domain of privacy anchored the possibility of a public precisely insofar as it guaranteed this subjectivization' (Dean, 2002: 145). The rights of the person are thus relatively defined to each domain. Instead, the uncontrolled, unsanctioned mixture or passage between realms is understood as a permanent danger to social order. Yet it is not that their separation should be made absolute: what is at stake is a social pragmatics of boundary management in a way properly attuned to the particular forms of life it thereby sanctions.</p><p> It is with regard to 'urban anonymity and anonymity of publication' that Westin's expansive and naturalising conception of privacy proves to be more problematic. Tracing this naturalisation in reverse, the present article always links back the idea of a right to privacy to the specific societal problematic in which it originates. The point here is not that anonymity cannot be legitimately understood in the way Westin suggests, but precisely that it can be so understood, that applying this rather than that hermeneutic frame or ideological template determines what is at stake in a particular situation, implying that any given situation is fundamentally open to contingent and competing determinations. This conception of how discourse works and influences how and what we perceive as objective and significant in a situation, is informed by the observation that discourse is always 'penetrated by a system of values inseparable from living practice and class struggle' (Bakhtin, 1984: 471), which is to say simply that 'our utterances necessarily reflect systemic social contradictions, the social location of particular speakers, and the forms of material and rhetorical power that regulate the relevant speech genres' (Gardiner, 2004: 36). Westin's categorisation displaces and obscures the historical problematic of mass society in which the idea of a right to privacy is rooted, replacing it with abstract relations between individual persons possessing an a priori, innate need for privacy. Doing so he transcends the multilayered, conflictual, class-cultural realities to which privacy as an ideal responded, and in which it intervened. At the end point of this displacement, it becomes possible to construct true statements about privacy as an undeniable human condition relevant to almost all aspects of life, including urban anonymity, as Westin indeed proceeds to do.</p><p> In order to understand why this is problematic, we need to return to the original formulation of the right to privacy at the end of the nineteenth century, by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis. In what is now recognised as one of the most influential law articles ever published, they propose to ground the right to privacy in the 'immunity of the person' (Warren and Brandeis, 1984 [1890]: 83). The rationale behind this particular approach is that they hope to establish such a right independent of already existing (intellectual) property and copyright laws (ibid.: 7981) as well as available slander and libel laws (ibid.: 77-78; Post, 1991; Barbas, 2015; The Harvard Law Review Association, 1981). The right to privacy ideally encompasses the whole of a person's bodily integrity, feelings, thoughts and peace of mind, his or her dignity as a person. Doing so, Warren and Brandeis rely on the concept of 'immunity' as the legal and political halo that surrounds the person and protects it from outside intrusions that may impede upon its autonomy (Blackstone, 1899: 223). In his treatise on torts to which Warren and Brandeis refer, justice Thomas M. Cooley defines the right to one's person in terms of privacy as 'a right of complete immunity: to be let alone' (Cooley, 1880: 29). For the American sociologist Edward Shils as well, 'Intrusions on privacy are baneful because they interfere with an individual in his disposition of what belongs to him. The \"social space\" around an individual, the recollection of his past, his conversation, his body and its image, all belong to him' (1966: 306).</p><p> For Warren and Brandeis, however, a right to privacy deals with the somewhat narrower issue of control over one's reputation, 'the legal right to control one's public image' (Barbas, 2015: 26). This problem of control over one's image first becomes urgent when that image can be splintered and circulated in various new media networks, reaching new publics in a way that is beyond that person's control or consent. Theirs was an attempt to find a 'remedy for the unauthorized circulation of portraits of private persons' (Warren and Brandeis, 1984 [1890]: 193, 195). So rather than geared to the already established and more encompassing right to a private or personal sphere, the specific and novel societal problematic that propelled Warren and Brandeis' proposal was the emergence of new forms of mass publicity and popular media consumption: the proliferation of illustrated magazines filled with gossip and 'fake news' that catered to the ever greater and relentless curiosity of an expanded group of readers from all - but increasingly also the lower - classes (Schoeman, 1984: 203). Added to this was the growing availability of cameras and the means of reproducing and disseminating images in ever wider and less controllable circuits of private and public circulation, multiplying the possibilities for unwarranted exchange of personal information beyond the grasp of any one person (Whyte, 2009: 102).</p><p> Warren and Brandeis speak of an epidemic of 'ruthless publicity' (1984 [1890]: 214) caused by 'a media environment in which otherwise proper portraits [...] circulate in ways that countermand the cultural ideal of individual self-ownership' (Osucha, 2009: 76). Such publicity represents the increasing mixture and confusion of different class forms of life that before remained separate, and that by the end of the nineteenth century come together in the new mass public spheres: 'For Warren and Brandeis, the institution of the press symbolized the impersonal mass culture that threatened preexisting social institutions that, in turn, enforced cultural values' so that 'privacy represented the person's freedom from the undistilled attention of the masses through the media' (Bezanson, 1992: 1138). As such, the endangered 'sacred privacy of domestic life' entails much more than questions of ownership: it concerns a way of life and the world view implied therein, as well as a mode of subjectivation and its institutions. In this the right to privacy 'looks back to a period before mass society and its information technologies that threatened to burst the bubble of the sheltered life of the upper classes' (Gaines, 1991) and represents 'a record of legitimation of a bourgeois view of life: the ultimate generalized privilege, however abstract in practice, or seclusion and protection from others (the public)' (Williams, 1976: 243).</p><p> The following example serves to show how, even before Warren and Brandeis, 19th century criticasters of mass society employed the language of anonymity and impersonality to describe and motivate their distaste for the popular press and its new publics. In The present age (1962 [1846]) Kierkegaard bemoans what he calls the Phantom Public as a 'monstrous abstraction' driven by what he deems the two main 'powers of impersonality': the press and anonymity (Dreyfus, 2004). The modern-day author, he argues, 'is often only an x, even when his name is signed, something quite impersonal, which addresses itself abstractly, by the aid of printing, to thousands and thousands, while remaining itself unseen and unknown, living a life as hidden, as anonymous, as it is possible for a life to be' (Kierkegaard, 1967: entry #3219). Insofar as the publics Kierkegaard criticises because of their impersonal, inauthentic and irresponsible character, resemble those against which Warren and Brandeis aim to formulate their right to privacy, these observations capture precisely in what respects the relation between privacy and these kinds of anonymity is more problematic than intuitively apparent.</p><p> The anxieties of and over the person swallowed up and stumped upon in the relentless massification of life and its reproductive technologies sketched by the above authors becomes even more pertinent when we reflect on the specific problem of images of persons circulated in the press. On the opening pages of Crowds and power, Elias Canetti claimed that 'There is nothing that man fears more than the touch of the unknown', and that in fact 'All the distances which men create round themselves are dictated by this fear': the repulsion, panic and fear of being touched, which 'never leaves a man when he has once established the boundaries of his personality' (1981 [i960]: 15). The fear of being touched by strangers and the formulation of a right to privacy are connected, if only by the terminology used. The gendered metaphor often used to highlight the importance of privacy is that of an innocent and vulnerable woman's body or face violated by a stranger's gaze or touch. A few months after the publication of 'The Right to Privacy', the U.S. supreme court proclaimed, in a case involving the physical examination of a woman (Clara Botsford) for insurance purposes, that 'to compel any one, and especially a woman, to lay bare the body, or to submit it to the touch of a stranger, without lawful authority, is an indignity, an assault, and a trespass' (in Smith, 2000: 133). Warren and Brandeis make use of similarly gendered examples to make their case.</p><p> It is in the image of a violation of intimate female parts by a stranger that an important tension between the concept of anonymity and privacy is brought to light. Whereas in the late 19th and early 20th century privacy refers to the enclosed private space of both a community of letters, familial intimacy and individual seclusion, anonymity in the sociological literature of the same period refers to the indifferent and contingent co-presence of strangers in urban-industrial environments. To their benefit, Warren and Brandeis did not understand privacy to include anonymity in the sociological sense at all. In a state of privacy, family and friends are the very opposite of anonymous to each other. Neither is the secluded individual anonymous to himself, nor for that matter are they anonymous to others outside of the domestic sphere. These relationships are persistent and personal, rather than ephemeral and impersonal, based on mutual trust and shared social codes, rather than suspicion and indifference. In this context, it makes no sense to speak of anonymity as conducive to privacy, as these two concepts belong to mutually exclusive socio-cultural registers.</p><p> On the contrary, it is precisely the kinds of anonymous, mass publicness with which Warren and Brandeis take issue, fearing an inversion of 'the relative importance of things' by the commercial exploitation of gossip by and to the vicious and the idle (1984 [1890]: 77). In this the curse of 'ruthless publicity' signals not merely a spatial but a social and political crossing of boundaries, making for a kind of general societal pollution whose violence lies in its contagious character. As the emergence of privacy as the right to be let alone is thus rooted in an experience of intrusion by anonymous strangers (the curious gaze of the mass public enabled by new visual technologies of reproduction), to confuse the personal privacy of the home with the impersonal anonymity of the street by subsuming them under one overarching concept of privacy, as Westin and other privacy theorists do, erases this important tension between them. On the basis of this insight, the next section takes a closer look at the specific, mass-cultural media logic of 'curiosity' that triggered the idea of a right to privacy by Warren and Brandeis.</p><p> 'To detonate a prison world': The class-cultural dialectic between mass curiosity and privacy</p><p> Contributing to public debates on the nefarious effects of the popular 'yellow press', Warren and Brandeis sided with the journalist E.L. Godkin's claim that 'the chief enemy of privacy in modern life is that interest in other people and their affairs known as curiosity' (Godkin, 1890: 66, emphasis added). According to Warren and Brandeis, privacy legislation is needed because 'the press [and by implication the mass publics it caters to] is overstepping in every direction the obvious bounds of propriety and decency. Gossip is no longer the resource of the idle and the vicious, but has become a trade which is pursued with industry as well as effrontery' (Warren and Brandeis, 1984 [1890]: 76). In the very last sentence of the article, hinting at the fait accompli that is the legal protection against unwarranted government intrusion, they comment: 'Shall the courts thus close the front entrance to constituted authority, and open wide the back door to idle or prurient curiosity?' (ibid.: 90).3</p><p> The popular press brought previously excluded subjects into the public sphere and its means of representation, as a result of which the public sphere was expanded, diversified, and structurally transformed (even when this apparent democratisation was bought at the price of the further commercialisation and commodification of culture). But as Shils in the aforementioned article also suggests, rather than a nuisance per se, for some of the lower classes 'awareness about the doings of one's neighbors, the gratification of impulses of curiosity about and malice toward them, were perhaps among the main pleasures available' (1966: 290). Likewise, the following commentator observes that 'Curiosity, fascination, repugnance, fear, sympathy, greed, hostility, love, hate and the thousand-and-one other conflicting emotions which affect people living in close association with one another - especially people of different races, creeds, nationalities, and economic levels - created a desire to know more and more about the intimate details of the lives, the actions, the habits, the customs, the thoughts, and the activities of those about them' (O'Connor quoted in Pember, 1972: 8).</p><p> These observations are important not only because they testify to the larger conjuncture from which privacy concerns arose, but also because they imply that such concerns were not equally or homogeneously shared by everyone, revealing their class-specificity. Once acknowledged, curiosity appears in a different light, namely in that of a class-politics of anonymous spectatorship and the social pleasures of gossip that created a common world, in a way that temporarily suspended the desocialised, atomised and reified relations that prevailed under industrial labour and urban living conditions. In this the gratification of the masses' curiosity perhaps constituted a kind of symbolic revenge, a returning of the gaze that was cast upon them daily by the disciplinary apparatuses that controlled the streets and the factories. The pleasure of peeping into the private lives of the better-off must have conferred a sense of power, a power of looking accorded to those who were normally at the other end of the gaze. Doing so, they exploited and enjoyed the anonymity that new forms of spectatorship provided to attain the asymmetrical position of the voyeur, which sees but itself remains unseen.4</p><p> The critique of 'idle or prurient' curiosity that motivates Warren and Brandeis's proposal for a right to privacy has a longstanding moral-philosophical and theological tradition. After Plutarch, Augustine chastises curiosity as the pathological mark of an 'inordinate desire for knowledge derived from sense experience' that signals the unregulated intellectual appetite for things other than God (Fitzgerald, 1999: 259-261). Curiosity - the 'lust of the eyes', or concupiscentia oculorem - is a disease of the mind that affects both plebs and scientist, under whose spell men desire nothing but to know (Augustine, 2006 [AD 397-400]: 10.V). Among the most influential critiques of curiosity in 20th century philosophy is Heidegger's Being and time, where it designates one of the main modalities of Das Man (the impersonal 'They' or anonymous 'Anyone-self1) - the collective pseudo-subject that inhabits the diffuse, inauthentic being-in-the-world of everyday life. Together with idle talk or 'chatter', for Heidegger curiosity promotes 'an indifferent intelligibility for which nothing is closed off any longer' (2010 [1927]: 163) and through which 'every mystery loses its power' (ibid.: 123).5</p><p> In his discussion of Heidegger's critique of the curiosity of Das Man, Paolo Virno shows that curiosity and mechanical reproduction together indeed 'strive to abolish distances, to place everything within hand's reach (or better, within viewing distance)' (2004: 92). Contrary to Heidegger, however, Virno sees in curiosity and idle talk an 'authentic' mode of sociality and communication of the the masses (or 'multitude' as he calls it). Doing so he links Heidegger's notion of curiosity to Benjamin's observation in his famous The work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction, that 'Every day the urge grows stronger to get hold of an object at very close range in an image [Bild], or, better, in a facsimile [Abbild], a reproduction' (Benjamin, 2008 [1939]: 23). Rather than designating the 'fallen' and inauthentic life of the impersonal Anyone-self, for both Virno and Benjamin mass media and new media technologies like photography and film bear witness to a positive 'desire of the present-day masses to \"get closer\" to things, and their equally passionate concern for overcoming each thing's uniqueness by assimilating it as a reproduction' (23).6</p><p> These observations are at the heart of Benjamin's theory of mass modernity as entailing the 'withering' of the aura, where the aura refers to 'a strange tissue of space and time: the unique appearance of a distance, however near it may be' (2008 [1939]: 23). The concepts of uniqueness and distance that an emerging mass consumer culture - in tandem with new reproductive technologies - are in the process of eliminating, are also central to understand the person as an historical configuration of legal and subjective selfhood. The dignity and respect accorded persons is premised on an auratic separation and distancing from the profane world of things that surrounds it, including animal and human non-persons. Precisely this immunity of the person is compromised when it is made into a mass-circulated image.7</p><p> By projecting the human body in its ephemeral anonymity as merely one interchangeable thing or image among others, the auratic 'ritual value' that secures the distinction between person and thing collapses into the aesthetic 'exhibition value' that both immanently possess. Benjamin's ironic commentary on a short opinion piece by literary critic Friedrich Burschell in Die literarische Welt (No 7, 1925) may help in understanding his position. In the piece, Burschell bemoans a recent magazine cover of the then highly popular Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung for showing a miniature photographic portrait in remembrance of esteemed German writer Jean Paul right alongside a series of images depicting, among other things, 'the children of Thomas Mann, the petty bourgeois hero of a dubious trial, two tarts all done up in feathers and furs, and two cats and a monkey' (Benjamin, 1972 [1925]: 449). It is this leveling juxtaposition of disparate things normally perceived to be categorically distinct, which induces and motivates Burschell's sentiment (which, Benjamin taunts, reflects an attitude that is 'kleinb\u00fcrgerlich'). Instead, Benjamin positively recommends the cover's 'higgledy-piggledy' construction as among the best modern journalism has to offer. It is this reduction of the individual portrait and singular 'authentic' face of the person (especially a highly esteemed artist-personality like Jean Paul) to a mere part of a larger visual ensemble of printed matter whose proponents are judged by their exhibition rather than their cult value, that for Benjamin signals the illustrated magazine's progressive, even emancipatory tendency. What would be more boring, he asks, referring to Burschell's own cultural paradigm and aesthetic ideal, than a fullblown portrait of the artist on the cover? (Benjamin, 1972 [1925]: 449).</p><p> As to the photographic portrait, whose public mass circulation is at stake in Warren and Brandeis' article on privacy, Benjamin observes that 'for the last time the aura emanates from the early photographs in the fleeting expression of a human face [...] But as man withdraws from the photographic image, the exhibition value for the first time shows its superiority to the ritual value' (2008 [1939]: 27; Costello, 2005). Rather than the melancholic and conservative attempt to save the aura of the human face from its eclipse in the reproducible image, for Benjamin Eugene Atget's photographs of deserted city streets from which all human personality and community has been erased, offer a more realistic picture of the inhuman present. In this he seems to follow Bertolt Brecht's advice not to 'start from the good old things but the bad new ones'. The personal, honorary portrait plays an important role here as it is the singular face that, together with the name, functions as the central symbol of personhood that becomes grotesquely 'defaced' by its mechanical reproduction and circulation. This defence of the 'face' and the 'name' as harbouring the person's reputation, as in the expressions 'saving one's face' or 'defending one's good name', clearly ties into Warren and Brandeis' attempt to protect one's 'image' against the curious masses.</p><p> Along similar lines as Benjamin, Kracauer (1997 [i960]) approached photography and film in terms of a 'redemption of physical reality' that inherently challenges previous value and object hierarchies, including the categorical distinction between persons and things, exposing all equally to a collective curiosity geared towards their public exhibition and common use-value. Early film 'treated the human figure as only one among a variety of objects or sights, a jumble of animals, children and adults, of things, crowds, and streets' (Hansen, 1993: 448). Like the magazine cover Benjamin discusses, the cinematic medium is radically egalitarian and inclusive: the filmic gaze is indifferent to the status of the object insofar as this status transcends the object's materiality, (re)presenting any one object in the dimension shared by animals, marionettes and persons alike.</p><p> Only a few years earlier, in a short article called 'Anon is Dead' the American critic Henry Seidel Canby analyses what he considers the 'almost hysterical attempt to escape from the deadly anonymity of modern life [by] the general man who feels his personality sinking lower and lower into a whirl of indistinguishable atoms to be lost in a mass civilization' (1926: 80). For Benjamin, Kracauer and others, however, this loss is not an oppressive, reifying or alienating process per se. Rather than 'saving' the person from the mass that engulfs it, in the very precise and beautiful statement by Brecht, 'man does not become man again by stepping forth from the masses but by sinking deeper into them' (1977: 69). Elsewhere, Brecht links this idea of individuation through rather than despite the mass (on which liberal-bourgeois notions of individuality are instead premised) to the 'Zertr\u00fcmmerung der Person' [the destruction or 'shattering' of the person]. In modern society '[The person] falls apart, he loses his breath. He turns into something else, he is nameless, he no longer has any face [...]' (Brecht, 1967: 60, see Jonsson, 2013).</p><p> Whereas in liberal-bourgeois ideas of personal autonomy this name- and facelessness can only appear negatively, for Brecht the destruction of the person opens up to an inherently collective, 'transpersonal' realm pregnant of ever new modes of social, cultural and political individuation. Similarly, in his famous essay on the mass ornament Kracauer frames the Tiller girls as exemplary of the new, emancipatory forms of sociality and culture potentialised in mass modernity as a whole (1995 [1927]). A then popular form of entertainment, these girls move as one in a serial, repetitive and synchronous manner, locked arm in arm. In said essay, Kracauer finds that these girls form a kind of 'anonymous figure' in which the individual person (das Vollindividuum) dissolves into prepersonal bodily elements of a larger ensemble that never add up to anything remotely resembling an organic community. This figure's very 'mass' character resides in this dissolution of both the unity of the individual person and the organic community, in a new social choreography of impersonal and (con)dividual elements that mirror modern labor and urban living conditions. What is left of the individual is ultimately only a 'partial self (das Teil-Ich).</p><p> 'Wasted upon the many': Mass media culture beyond the person?</p><p> This becoming anonymous - in the sense of being unrooted by the deterritorialising powers of modernity in which slowly but steadily, in Marx and Engels' famous wording, 'all that is solid melts into air' and 'all that is holy is profaned' (1969 [1848]) - points to a liberation from premodern social formations and traditions, in a process Agamben calls 'profanation' (2007). The latter designates the emancipation of all bodies and values from previously established stratifications as they enter the sphere of incessant circulation and exchange. Taking up Kracauer's theory of the mass ornament, Agamben states that 'the commodification of the human body, while subjecting it to the iron laws of massification and exchange value, seemed at the same time to redeem the body from the stigma of ineffability that had marked it for millennia' (1993: 48). Lyotard goes even further when he suggests that</p><p> the industrialized masses actually enjoyed the mad destruction of their organic body which was indeed imposed upon them, they enjoyed the decomposition of their personal identity, the identity that the peasant tradition had constructed for them, enjoyed the dissolutions of their families and villages, and enjoyed the new monstrous anonymity of the suburbs. (1993: 214)</p><p> Whereas in the modern political-philosophical tradition, persons are constituted in a relation of mutual recognition to a virtual centre of the one, capital-letter Person (e.g. State or God), the carnivalesque and materialist 'chain of being' of the urban and labouring masses is marked by a relation of bodily immanence to a temporality of anonymous becoming. Whereas 'to exist as a person is to maintain all one's parts and their properties under one's own control' (Lingis, 2001: 61), it instead suggests a release of self in an endless proliferation of masks. Doing so it moves in a direction diametrically opposed to that of Augustine, when he attempts to gather and 'collect' himself out of 'that dispersed state in which my very being was torn asunder because I was turned away from Y ou, the One, and wasted myself upon the many' (quoted in Coyne, 2015: 98).</p><p> James Ensor's Self-portrait with masks (Fig. 1) may serve as an illustration of this dialectic between the masked mass and the authorial, personal self. In this selfportrait, a swarming crowd of grotesquely deformed and grimacing faces and carnival masks flood the pictorial frame from all sides, encroaching on the portrait of the artist classically positioned in the centre. In contrast to conventional bourgeois portraiture, in which the masked crowd is always already exorcised from the frame and its field of visibility, Ensor paradoxically includes this exclusion constitutive of individuality on the very pictorial stage where it is classically performed. The suggestion of a non-immunitary relation to the carnivalesque crowd is reinforced by the fact that, rather than threatened by it, Ensor seems quite at ease within it, as if temporarily overcoming what for Canetti marked any person's 'fear of being touched'. Yet by gazing directly and somewhat conspiratorially at the viewer, Ensor does in the end seem to want to shock us into a belated recognition of the artist's heroic ability to endure, defy and transcend the violently usurping crowd.</p><p> In the urban crowds Ensor often depicts as a grotesque masquerade, anonymity is rendered in its modern sociological sense as 'a defining attribute of urbanity' (Garber, 2000: 19) inherent to 'the being together of strangers' (Young, 1990: 237). Likewise, in A World of strangers, urban sociologist Lyn Lofland notes that 'To experience the city is, among many other things, to experience anonymity' (1973, ix).8 This understanding of anonymity as a structural aspect of urban forms of mass sociality can be transposed to the realm of popular media culture and new media technologies, as Benjamin and others suggest. From this perspective, contemporary practices of online anonymity on imageboards like 4.chan and in Anonymous partake in the profane and post-auratic thrust of curiosity and its concomitant 'destruction of the person', in response to which Warren and Brandeis formulated their idea of a right to privacy. It is a more adequate grasp of this problematic and conflictual relation between privacy and such practices of collective anonymous media prosumption that the current article aimed to establish, in a way that suggests a rethinking of the politics and aesthetics of online anonymity better attuned to its profane, mass-cultural media logic.</p><p>1 4chan represents a particularly interesting case to think about different aspects and dimensions to online anonymity. For around 2006, contributors to its '/b/ Random' board came to understand and refer to themselves individually as 'anons' and collectively as 'Anonymous'. At this point, anonymity was no longer only implicitly lived as an infrastructural condition but explicitly recognised and cultivated as a collective mode of online existence, whose 'networked individuals' may at any moment morph into mischievous swarms. With the ludic appropriation of this collective pseudonym, these self-styled 'anons' emphasised not so much the ability to exercise control over one's own image or to restrict the circulation and use of images but the freedom to engage the modes of anonymous sociality and media prosumption 4chan enables - an aspect that will be come highly relevant in the following sections, which discuss this type of anonymity's problematic relation to the idea of privacy.</p><p> 2 In response, many privacy scholars argue that privacy is not primarily concerned with keeping one's personal, social or professional life private or hidden from others per se, but rather with the ability to know, negotiate, control and consent to the terms and conditions under which social and communicative interaction takes place, even in places that are ostensibly public or 'social'. Despite persistent associations with privacy and the private sphere, which often take an individual's autonomy to be a priori given, there is such a thing as 'privacy in public' (Nissenbaum, 2010) as well as an understanding of privacy as anchored in social and communicative interaction, rather than in the absence thereof.</p><p> 3Gajda (2008) argues that what Samuel Warren perceived as hurtful 'gossipmongering' about his family's private life in the press was in fact the central motif for writing 'The right to privacy'.</p><p> 4The mass publics to which these 'invasive' and 'immoral' forms of curiosity were attributed are probably under-represented in the literature through which we view the era: we only come to know about their existence through the writings of those that cry out against them. In this they resemble the lowly, insignificant lives of Foucault's 'infamous men': those nobodies, those opaque anonymous masses who are incited to speak by being incessantly spoken of, and whose disparate traces, meticulously recorded, fill the administrative, psychiatric and police cabinets of the preceding centuries.</p><p> 5 On the relation between St. Augustine's Confessions and Heidegger's Being and time, see Coyne, 2015.</p><p> 6 The ambivalence and lack of 'normative clarity' of Benjamin's remarks on these antiauratic tendencies of mass society has always divided commentators. Some quote the above passage to argue for Benjamin's ultimately affirmative stance to this process, while others find passages seemingly incompatible with such a stance, e.g. those in which Benjamin adopts a more conventional Marxist critique of the culture industry. The reasons for this ambivalence must, I think, be sought in the historical circumstances that, first, the masses' desire to bring things closer is always already mediated by capital and appears in the inherently exploitative form of the commodity and its 'fetishism'; and second, this process is structurally open to its regressive, fascist appropriation and channeling, as Benjamin himself witnessed up close and suffered the consequences from.</p><p> 7 For a genealogy of the 'dispositif of the person' and its relation to the logic of immunity, see Esposito, 2011; 2012.</p><p> 8For an overview of how the terms 'anonymous' and 'anonymity' are used and transformed over time, see Ferry, 2002.</p><p>references</p><p> Agamben, G.

''Get over it!'' </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The in-your-face concept had the benefit of being completely prescient and even an understatement. We are now the most data-generating, most uploaded, most share-crazy humans in the history of the world, which means we are also the most monitored, the most data-chomped and, definitely, the most exposed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  [Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]</p><p>  Our information -- much of it private -- is the rocket fuel of the ever-expanding internet. Our data keeps it humming along, even as tech companies abuse that data with increasing frequency.</p><p>  So here's an idea: Maybe we refuse to get over it. Maybe we start to grok what we have become, and think harder about the trades we are making for the convenience we get from our gadgets. And maybe we put in place some rules -- rules that have real teeth -- on big tech companies.</p><p>  The question, of course, is what those rules should look like. Some argue the United States needs a hefty, multipronged national privacy bill that would include more stringent requirements for how tech giants run their platforms. (Some even think there should be a new agency to oversee the industry.) Others think that current law will suffice, with some tweaking including better enforcement and more money for the agencies already charged with regulating the tech sector, like the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>  I would argue that we need both, and fast, before these data-hungry tech companies become even more enmeshed in our lives. Do you like the idea of A.I. comparing your facial expressions to a company's top and bottom performers during a job interview? I don't. Do you want cameras in every device in your home? I don't. Do you want your television-watching linked to your search history linked to your buying data? No, thank you.</p><p>  I have said yes too many times before, thanks to the greatest tracking effort in the history of humanity that we facilitate every day by using a smartphone.</p><p>  Let me be clear -- I love technology, including my deeply felt relationship with that iPhone that spans decades now. But it has never been more urgent to put up some guardrails. While I do not consider the behemoth tech companies monsters, they can and do act monstrously.</p><p>  You don't have to be paranoid to realize that you are being followed, watched and crunched in ways that are breathtaking, and more than a little questionable. We need a national law to signal to these companies that the jig is up and that they need to stop abrogating their responsibilities to their users and to society itself -- and I think it's pretty inevitable we'll get one in the next few years.</p><p>  At the same time, we don't want to impose undue burdens on new start-ups or throttle innovation. That's why I think it would be a mistake to overreact and crack down too hard, as Europe has done in some instances.</p><p>  Europe has put in place strict laws like the General Data Protection Regulation of 2018, the most significant change in privacy law in decades. It gives a lot of power to individuals over how their personal data is collected and used, and is much more punitive when it comes to data breaches.</p><p>  There are also ePrivacy rules there that govern how people can be targeted by advertisers. Some regulations, like the exceedingly complex ''right to be forgotten,'' would slam right into free speech laws here in the United States. This week, for example, Britain proposed creating a far-reaching regulator to punish tech companies, including their individual executives, for damaging content on their platforms.</p><p>  Europe's message to big tech is increasingly clear: You made this mess, so you clean it up, or else.</p><p>  This punitive and suspicious sentiment had already jumped the Atlantic -- all the way across to the Pacific -- with California passing its Consumer Privacy Act last year. Less stringent than the General Data Protection Regulation (and criticized by some for being too soft), it makes California-based companies follow stronger data protection rules, including giving the state's consumers more insight and power over how their data is used and imposing fines when tech platforms don't comply. The law will go into effect in 2020, and there may be further additions to it.</p><p>  There are also privacy bills in play in at least 10 other states, so we are off and running to a confusing patchwork of laws. We need a more unified approach, because right now, our privacy regulation looks like a goat rodeo.</p><p>  We have to figure this out now, because more privacy-threatening technologies -- such as artificial intelligence, 5G, quantum computing, automation, robotics, self-driving cars and above all, facial recognition -- are all part of the next wave of innovation. How the tech giants share data with one another will also be an issue, because the ecosystem is increasingly intertwined.</p><p>  There are some countries that have gone far beyond what Americans would be comfortable with, China being the most aggressive. Beijing has created a surveillance economy that makes our current privacy issues seem trivial. The last thing we want is to get into a race over which country can better stalk its citizens. But we also need to ensure that the version of the internet that was invented in the United States -- one based on a principle of openness -- is the one that should prevail.</p><p>  Given how much is headed our way, I called Mr. McNealy to ask him if he felt the same about privacy now as he did in 1999.</p><p>  He said the harvesting of data was unlikely to get any less invasive and noted that the information that is collected about us is like a ''digital tattoo'' that is impossible to expunge. Nonetheless, Mr. McNealy is not a fan of government regulation. He said that a federal privacy law would be a mistake because it would hinder innovation, and cautioned that the costs of compliance would hurt small companies.</p><p>  He also said that there are still enough alternatives to allow consumers to escape being hostages of Google or Facebook or Amazon, and that if people are concerned about those companies' data collection, they are free to stop using their platforms.</p><p>  ''There is nothing to be done about it but consumer choice,'' he said.</p><p>  Besides, Mr. McNealy said, much of the data that is being collected is not actually that dangerous. ''Amazon knows that I buy toilet paper, but who cares if it is data that does not matter?'' he asked.</p><p>  But at some point, I argued, it does matter. What happens if these companies go too far, and who is to decide how that data is meshed and mixed with other data? Mr. McNealy insisted that current laws, bolstered by antitrust action, should remedy any abuses.</p><p>  ''There are plenty of laws to deal with it if, say, Google is reading my email'' without permission, he said. ''And if these companies do abuse their power by advantaging other parts of their businesses, then regulators ought to have long, hard conversation with them.''</p><p>  Until then, according to the Cassandra of privacy? ''I can live without Google, so it does not bother me,'' he said.</p><p>  In other words, get over it? I don't intend to, and I don't think anyone else should, either. While we may have zero privacy, it doesn't mean that we have given up our right to control our digital selves. In fact, as tech marches on, that might be the one right that needs to be protected most of all.</p><p>  Follow @privacyproject on Twitter and The New York Times Opinion Section on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>DRAWINGS (DRAWING BY MAX LOEFFLER)       </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-523275190414</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWD-RMY1-DXY4-X29T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1295\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/opinion/internet-privacy-regulation.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/opinion/internet-privacy-regulation.html</url><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 14, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Op-Ed</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000243V</classCode><className>ORACLE AMERICA INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS334111 ELECTRONIC COMPUTER MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC7373 COMPUTER INTEGRATED SYSTEMS DESIGN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC5045 COMPUTERS &amp;

technology has made the more powerful and established hierarchies in both politics and business and the media and the BBC were sitting Europe very hierarchical institutions you your self working for the BBC network we actually on television network that the tension at the heart of the book and I'm really fascinated by the white where you you compare and contrast for example Frank and bats and was bringing those acronyms tell us first about fan because everybody watching on there's something about some part of San what Facebook and Amazon Netflix Google are for of the big 5 tech companies often people talk about Apple to their different acronyms I mean the the big tech companies are dominant not only in the United States but whether it's so much online retailer also social networking their dominant in much of the rest of the world except China and that's where backed comes in because the Chinese to think very important strategic decision to exclude the found companies the big Silicon Valley tech companies and essentially build their own behind you Aly Baba 10sec internet companies almost as a barge in terms of market capitalisation and volume of business as the big 4 or 5 in Silicon Valley and that's very exciting and interesting an unexpected development not many people certainly in the 19 nineties expected the Chinese to get the internet right in the way that they have interesting as well when you talk about power and Chinese leaders will think about the Communist party think about the Congress you think about those rows of of men who worked their way up you write about the fact that actually a lot of these networks exist they can't exist to mentor descent that the level reached very cleverly he cannot understand China today or indeed China historically with the idea of a panacea of connections that in many ways the traditional way in which the Chinese think about Ships can actually do rather interesting network graphs of the structure of power in China Daily it today I have one in the book showing the network of power around she and pink but what's fascinating in China is the interaction between the very high rocky core a Communist party which rules the country and these new networks are personified by someone like Jack Ma saw video of Jack Ma performing as Michael Jackson in front of the vast number of Ali Baba employees got a huge fan I admire you just said the Chinese got the internet rights and the Europe because that's facing Europe has no companies in this League and Europe regulators find them where feels they are being predatory right she also meaning contrast to Silicon Valley to America where there is something other sense of fear now about the power and data that has sucked up by his what I say the Chinese got the internet right I mean they are they actually came up with internet companies that can compete with the big American companies in Europe failed to do that I mean it's pretty hard to think of a big European internet company Spotify and that's that Cullen nothing compared with what you see in the United States and China as you say Europe's reduced to being regulator but the key thing in China is that the decision was taken years ago to make sure that these new social networks was subordinate to the party and there's absolutely no question if you give your data to Aly Baba you also giving it the Chinese Communist party the American situation is different because it is as yet unresolved what the relationship is between Silicon Valley and the federal government and that seems to be one of the big questions about time maybe one of the big battles of the coming years which has only just begun it only last week that Donald Trump tweeted ante Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg shot back on Facebook in response that I think is Roan one of what is going to be absolutely fascinating struggle between the established PA the federal government sought for a President Trump and the new part of a social network the right Welcome to HARDtalk, Dock Howard briefs thought about where you stand because here is a quote from about the really jumped out he said the world today frequently resembles a giant network on the verge of a cataclysmic outage I think you finished in praise of hierarchy think you cannot run the world entirely on the basis of networks and it's a great illusion to think that you can if you Chuck away hierarchy altogether we're going to find ourselves in a very market with a place rather as Europe was after the advent of the printing press and the referee nation that's one of the big lessons of history that are offering the square in the attack Neil Ferguson there are competing powers of the public square and the government's power you can get in touch with me in a public square at any time on Twitter I'm at the time BBC Thanks for being with us today here is Hello a weather front digging down across the central plains of the us

practice here that this is a question of the fundamental problems with a business Alex will have to leave it there thanks so much for coming in Thank and Facebook is under pressure not only over the way it uses data Binny is facing questions on tax as well the European Commission has unveiled a new tax proposal taking aim at big tech companies like Amazon and Google and of course Facebook some Silicon Valley giants are accused of shifting their earnings around here to pay lower tax earlier I spoke to the BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Brussels that what the proposal means for big companies have a listen so what this is this is the proposal coming from the European Commission at the instigation of European member states he said they want to look at how tax systems work not just for those firms that you talk about but broadly for all digital firms they say that tax tax systems designed in the past century capture factories offices employees that sort of thing where value is created is easy attacks what hard to tax digital online services and they want to look at how that is done because the minute you have to sit a situation where big online firms particularly can can benefit because they can cite their headquarters in place with low taxes and and only pay tax there all the profits they generate online now what the EU European Commission has proposed today are two things one is that in the long term they should be a measure that they eat taxes are raised where users based so even if the country company has no physical presence in the Hague in a country if people go online if they click if they use a service like Google if they use their data is collected if they buy things online that should be taxed on the basis of the activity happening in that country so they want the EU country EU countries to update their tax systems in future and that they say should apply to a lot of firms so firms with they seem 100000 users minimum in a country The first while that tax system is being designed and created they say now was an interim measure is to tax that turnover of the biggest companies so ones like the ones you mentioned as a way of bringing in profits already an and that is where the accusation that they are targeting big American companies in particular comes in the EU says it's about protecting the tax base in European countries it is being eroded because taxes are not being paid where profits have been generated Damian Grammaticas reporting there from Brussels and two other stories making headlines your impact Boko Haram militants have

than 5 hours of questioning all in a day's work for the founder of Facebook <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>addressing a Senate committee in the US Congress he said that Facebook had not taken abroad enough few of its responsibility with regard to use or abuse of users data something that had been his personal stake overall his performance seemed to go down well on the markets shares in Facebook closed the day for a half percent up for more analysis I'm joined by journalist and technology writer Jamie Bartlett he's written a new book called the people versus tech which covers the story and the issue of data mining thanks very much for joining us here on the programme which say that <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>despite 44 senators questioning him 5 hours being grilled pretty much came out of this unscathed he did pretty well actually I mean he clearly had carefully rehearsed his Lions I imagine he knew quite a lot of the questions that what can He was very contrite which is clearly what people wanted but Here's the thing Yes I think investors were reassured that the company is taking this as seriously as it needs to but it still needs to do more probably to reassure politicians that more regulation is not necessary this is one of the things that worries the big tech companies they don't want too much law and regulation and whether he managed to do that are not quite sure yet clear after all that happened It's the sort of so much pressure on on Facebook in the last few weeks it does feel like business as usual well Yes and no I mean you were obviously it's unusual for <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>himself to appear in front of not one but two committees a back-to-back like this the company has said they will do a lot more to it more proactively police their side this is a lot about the company saying we can self-regulate we understand we need to be more responsible but actually at a fundamental level about how the business actually works the kind of exchange of your data for free services the extent to which it still sees itself was not really a media company but actually a technology platform those fundamentals are unchanged and I'm afraid they get remain unchanged because that's the whole way that Facebook worked it would be such an incredible difference if the company moved away from that models so the basic level not much has changed but there's definitely a change in the tone of the companies adopting and really any his his it continues to apologise but again as you pointed out about reassuring that the politicians and and frankly at this point no one's been been fired he has apologised and says he takes responsibility if it's what actions now that everyone's looking for a fight we must write Them you have noticed anyone watched the hearing having all of 5 marathon hours of it that watched that would have noticed that he very often said the same thing I'm gonna get my team to get back to you there are lots of unanswered questions areas of the senators clearly wanted more detail on that he couldn't give as I imagine right now somewhere in Menlo Park at Facebook's headquarters as a team of people frantically trying to figure out some of the details but this so they can reassure the senators with exactly what they intend to do differently rather than just words in a sort of just the positive language and will be hearing more from <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>in the next few hours that's round two when he addresses Congress

Second-tier players or differentiated participants can then make inroads.</p><p>Locally <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/street-talk/aldi-taps-jll-for-700m-sale-and-leaseback-20200211-p53zm6\">Aldi's entry</url> caused the incumbents plenty of pain. Telstra's assumption that its customers would not move gave the likes of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/telecommunications/tpg-vodafone-to-merge-as-federal-court-overrules-accc-20200212-p54061\">TPG</url> a useful entry point.</p><p>Another inevitable outcome is that an advantage gained from being ahead on technology does not last for ever unless nurtured. That requires investment spending which is likely to constrain or lower the profit margin.</p><p>Fund managers can proclaim that they seek companies with a durable competitive advantage, sometimes referred to as a \"moat\". It may be a perfectly sensible approach, but requires all too rare vigilant, grounded management who take longer-term strategic decisions and may be prepared to compromise profit margins.</p><p>Governments have not helped the natural competitive process in allowing some companies to dominate without restraint on market power. The irony is that new tech industries have has a free run while older sectors have struggled with competition regulators to consolidate.</p><p>Europe recently led the way with its General Data Protection Regulation, which aims to restrict tech firms in using customer information. It does not take much imagination to factor in lower profit margins for the dominant tech companies if they can't take advantage of all the user data they collect.</p><p>Even the US is showing signs of life as the regulator re-examines small acquisitions made by the big tech companies which have resulted in lower competition.</p><p>In recent years another phenomena has muddied concepts of competition and profit margins.</p><p>Investors have been remarkably tolerant of companies that barely make a buck on the basis that all cash is reinvested into an accelerated aggressive growth strategy.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/wealth/personal-finance/how-to-invest-in-private-companies-20190412-p51dgy\">Private equity</url> is even more engrossed in this given the longer holding periods of their investments and access to cheap capital. Yet in its first year as a listed company, Uber, the iconic example of an unprofitable yet dominant company, the CEO is proclaiming this era over and that the ride sharing service industry is becoming more rational, aka raising prices.</p><p>Private equity has the luxury of being outside investor scrutiny on short-term delivery. Typically it takes on higher leverage and does not pay regular dividends. Add to that the regulatory oversight of listed companies requiring endless disclosure and a costly regulatory burden.</p><p>No wonder that fewer companies are in public hands. Based on World Bank numbers, in the US the number of listed companies has more than halved to just 4000 by 2018 compared with 1996. On the other hand, it is no surprise that China has seen a big growth in listings to near 3500 from a bare 500 over the same time frame, but that is shadowed by the whole of Asia, which now is nearing 13000 listings, double 20 years ago. Private equity is less involved in developing regions.</p><p>A lack of new listings inhibits clarity on profit margins within industries given low disclosure from private markets and reduces capital flows to listed entities. Price discovery and valuation of public companies is restricted to fewer examples. Yet private equity relies on listings to establish reported valuations and the final exit into an IPO.</p><p>Eventually excess concentration of power unwinds. New technologies or services undermine the inertia of large corporations that live under the assumption they are unbeatable.</p><p>We are some way from this outcome for the current dominant tech companies but perhaps nearing the maximum operating margin they can extract without losing their revenue growth ambitions.</p><p>Or, for others the reverse, achieving acceptable profit by foregoing revenue gains at any cost. Both trends should have a meaningful impact on the valuation of these companies as their long-term potential unfettered growth is at the heart of the high multiples at which they trade.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520239989</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y75-K3S1-DY19-C15V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"765\"/><timeReceived>09:47 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TGIF. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, November 8th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Possible shakeup to the Democratic primary, billionaire Michael Bloomberg has opened the door to run for president. What it means for the already crowded field and the growing war on the wealthy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moving from 2020 to 2024, superstar Kanye West says he will make a run for the White House the next time around. Find out what else he had to say about that.</p><p>And then some uncertainty this morning on U.S.-China trade once again. We follow the bouncing ball of this story. New questions after one White House advisor said that there is no agreement to roll back any tariffs, the exact thing that the market was trading up yesterday on. Markets are closing out the week in record territory, that's for sure.</p><p>And yet this morning we're looking at a fractional pullback. Dow Industrials down 6. S&amp;P 500 down 2. And the Nasdaq down 10.5. But they are coming off of record highs at the close yesterday.</p><p>Take a look at the markets yesterday where the DowIndustrials were up 182 points, that was two-thirds of 1 percent. The S&amp;P was up 8.5, quarter of a percent. And the Nasdaq up a quarter of a percent at 23 points higher. The DOW and the S&amp;P in unchartered territory.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. European indices right now are down across the board. FT 100 down 19. CAC 40 down 13 and the DAX in Germany lower by 28.</p><p>Mixed messages on the tariffs impacting markets in Asia overnight. As you see there, mostly lower. The Hang Seng down worst, the biggest decliner, down three-quarters of 1 percent.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Friday morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business' Deirdre Bolton; Fox News contributor and a columnist for \"The Hill\" Liz Peek; and the \"Wall Street Journal\" James Freeman.</p><p>We have a lot to talk about this morning, guys.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Oh yes, we sure do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": It's interesting -- the China trade stuff where I wonder if the Chinese are kind of borrowing the Donald Trump strategy. They're saying hey we're going to get a deal, it's going to be fantastic, in fact, all the tariffs are going away and the White House is saying well, maybe not.</p><p>BOLTON: No. I think they front-run ended the White House.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's why yesterday I was like we have to be sure that we're telling everybody this is from the Chinese ministry of commerce that is saying --</p><p>BOLTON: We said that a lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- all the tariffs are going away.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, we did say that a lot yesterday, in fairness to our coverage because we were saying this is particularly one-sided where this news flow is coming from.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEX CONTRIBUTOR: Guess what, they are not stupid. They know that our president and the White House in general is very sensitive to the market. And if the market starts to plunges because these expectations are not met, then you know they probably win.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what does the market do on Michael Bloomberg's news? That's our top story this hour.</p><p>Bloomberg's potential bid for the White House. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg might be the next to take on President Trump. He is now expected to file paperwork today to qualify for the Democratic presidential primary in Alabama. The deadline tonight is 5:00 p.m.so we will know for sure today if this is real.</p><p>The news may come as a surprise to some people. But if you've been watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA, well, you knew this first. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Who do you think is most poised to be a real threat to President Trump?</p><p>STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: I got to tell you right now, and I said this last week, Maria -- I don't see anybody that's on that stage right now that can take President Trump one on one.</p><p>I think you've got to watch guys like Bloomberg, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama -- a whole raft of potential that I think you have to look closely and see if anybody -- because the Democrats' number one focus is to defeat Donald Trump. So I'm not so sure you've even seen the candidate up there right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Who are you expecting to enter the race?</p><p>MARK PENN, FORMER CLINTON ADVISER: I'm not sure exactly who is going to enter. But I think if you're a Michael Bloomberg, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry or Michelle Obama, you're probably sitting there thinking, you know, I could take this field, maybe I should get in. Maybe not. I think all four of them are possibilities.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Steve Bannon and Mark Penn spot-on. Joining us right now is the co-host of \"THE FIVE\", Juan Williams. Juan -- great to see you.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think about Mike Bloomberg entering the fray?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, it's interesting. Obviously I look at polls a lot. And the Fox poll when people were asked about this, it was like 6 percent who said they would definitely back Michael Bloomberg. So it's not as if there's a great market demand on the Democratic side for Michael Bloomberg but I think Wall Street's been freaking out, especially about Elizabeth Warren's rise in the polls.</p><p>And you've seen Joe Biden struggling for money and Joe Biden having I say iffy performances on the debate stage that lead people to think, can he take on Donald Trump, can he go the whole way?</p><p>So Michael Bloomberg is obviously trying to step into that lane. This is a direct challenge, I think, to Joe Biden. The money and all the rest -- Michael Bloomberg has money. He has a certain degree of name ID, especially here in New York, not so much the rest of the country.</p><p>But going into the Democratic field, Maria -- he's got not only the weight of being a billionaire which in these times of income inequality is not a plus among the populace but secondly a lot of his record in New York -- stop and frisk, and the rest -- is going to be an issue for him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Nonetheless Howard Wolfson says hey look, Michael Bloomberg is very clear. He thinks that Donald Trump is dangerous, a demagogue and needs to be defeated and he thinks he can do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And Howard Wolfson. That's his spokesperson. He also said yesterday that Michael Bloomberg doesn't see anybody on that stage who can beat Donald Trump. So that's why he's entering the race.</p><p>But you know they're looking at him Liz as if he's this major moderate. I don't know if some of his strategies are all that moderate. Is he just -- you know, moderate competition to Joe Biden or is he, you know, also sort of flirting with the progressive idea in some of his policies as well?</p><p>PEEK: Well yes. He's a moderate according to today's Democratic field.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>PEEK: I mean he's extremely aggressive on climate change and gun control and that will be the thing that could attract a good portion of the Democratic primary.</p><p>He's not a moderate on fiscal things. I mean I think -- excuse me, he is a moderate on fiscal things.</p><p>I think the real -- the other person I think who is basically hurt by his entry is Pete Buttigieg because I think he was trying to occupy that moderate lane. And I think with Biden kind of looking a little fragile, Pete Buttigieg has really come up in a lot of the early voting polls and I think Bloomberg basically takes him out.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know. I think Pete has -- Mayor Pete has a different lane slightly. I think he's younger. I think he has a more aggressive stand on some issues than Mayor Bloomberg.</p><p>Mayor Bloomberg does enter this race with a little bit to the right of center in the minds of the Democratic Party that is voting in this primary race.</p><p>I would say that it's important to understand though that the money he put in to Virginia was so critical in taking -- in the Democratic win and of course the money was largely on the gun control issue and it led to Democrats now claiming control of both Houses of the Virginia legislature.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. He's got about $100 million to back the candidates on the issues that he wanted to back.</p><p>PEEK: There's a lot of due bills, by the way. There are a lot of Democrats who owe Mike Bloomberg because it wasn't just Virginia.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh no, I agree. I was just making that as a --</p><p>FREEMAN: It also gives him a story to tell. Let's say he NOW spends, I don't know, $300 million on advertising, Juan, telling the story of how he has championed and funded all of these progressive causes -- gun control, climate choice.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. That's a great point. If he gets that messaging, hey, I backed you, right?</p><p>FREEMAN: We're asking how much upside is there from that 6 percent you talked about earlier.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I mean, you know, let's just talk nuts and bolts of politics here. If you're thinking about Michael Bloomberg, you're thinking Joe Biden is struggling with Wall Street to get the money needed to fund his campaign. Joe Biden is already saying what that when it comes to Iowa and New Hampshire, he doesn't expect to win.</p><p>And if he's not winning and the argument for Joe Biden is I can beat Donald Trump and you don't win Iowa, you don't win New Hampshire, it starts to erode that argument for you which is the heart of what he's doing and the key there is that you're losing momentum, you have an even weaker argument to the titans on Wall Street.</p><p>And right now, Michael Bloomberg has the deep pockets to make a run and I think everybody's got to keep that in mind.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So there's another angle here. I mean Michael Bloomberg is the founder of the media giant, Bloomberg, LP. Is this going to be a conflict of interest as they cover the presidential election? His company is going to have to cover him.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't think it's that much of a problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Clearly they'll have to set up some kind of curtain, some kind of thing to make sure there's no ethical violation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He owns the company.</p><p>BOLTON: They did a good fire drill for what it's worth. I mean I worked there at the time when he was mayor. I mean for all that I know, they --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Good point. And you've interviewed him, right?</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. And they were successful. I mean, I know our president says that Jeff Bezos is not separate from the \"Washington Post\" but there was a 12-year fire drill for this to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: But let's just be clear. Bloomberg is absolutely opposed to everything that Donald Trump does. If you listen to the radio station or watch the TV, they hate Donald Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, they do.</p><p>PEEK: So they're already in place, basically.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's exactly right. So I wonder how that's going to, you know, set up or play out with Bloomberg News and how they cover him. You know -- there you go.</p><p>2020 Democrats are already reacting. Juan -- got to get your reaction to this. Because Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren took a swipe at Bloomberg, tweeting this. \"Welcome to the race, Mike Bloomberg. If you're looking for policy plans that will make a huge difference for working people and which are very popular, start here.\" She posted a link to her billionaire wealth tax calculator.</p><p>And then Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders weighed in, tweeting this, \"The billionaire class is scared and they should be scared.\"</p><p>According to Warren's billionaire calculator Bloomberg would pay over $3 billion in taxes under her plan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well so, you know, I was talking to somebody last night. They're reminding me that Bloomberg was not a Democrat. He only became a Democrat in October of '18.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: For the most recent history, he's been an Independent and before that a Republican. And what you're going to see, Maria here -- given the tensions on Wall Street, principally directed at Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, is I think you're going to see now that the responses are going to be you're dealing, Michael Bloomberg, with entry as a billionaire at a time of high income inequality in the country and this is simply the billionaire class lashing out and populists thank you.</p><p>I mean yesterday we saw Bill Gates say I don't know if I can support what Elizabeth Warren is doing. You've seen so many people, Steve Ratner and others, going on about this.</p><p>I think Wall Street is apoplectic about the idea that Elizabeth Warren at the moment looks like she might be the leader of the Democratic pack.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, Michael Bloomberg may not be happy with the comparison but that's how President Trump ran, right, as well. I mean as, you know, party came second after he won.</p><p>PEEK: Good point. And by the way, Bernie Sanders still is not a Democrat.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Right.</p><p>PEEK: So being a Democrat doesn't necessarily qualify you for this race.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think that's the issue with the populist (ph) crowd.</p><p>PEEK: No, I agree.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What does your gut tell you? Will he be the nominee?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Who? Michael Bloomberg? No, I mean -- you know what, Maria -- my gut is always crazy. I mean I never thought Donald Trump would be president. But my gut also tells me that at the moment it's hard for someone who is a billionaire to come into this race when you have Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren largely taking up more than half of the Democratic support.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think Elizabeth Warren is the nominee -- Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No. I think Joe Biden. If I had to bet this morning, I would say Joe Biden is the nominee.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Juan -- good to see you.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Nice to see you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Juan Williams joining us there.</p><p>We are just getting started this morning. Also on deck, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham is here. We'll talk impeachment inquiry with her and a lot more.</p><p>Then former Los Angeles mayor and the co-chairman of Mercury, Antonio Villaraigosa on the state of sanctuary cities. Milken Institute Asia fellow Curtis Chin is here on China trade, and the Wells Fargo senior global equity strategist Scott Wren on today's markets.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big show coming up.</p><p>First though, more trouble for Juul -- the company pulling another popular e-cigarette flavor off of store shelves.</p><p>And then Kanye West he's got his eyes on a move to the White House as well. What he revealed about a run for office.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Troubled e-cigarette company Juul making some changes.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the headlines now -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hey -- Maria.</p><p>Juul Labs said it will stop selling its mint flavored products ahead of an anticipated federal ban on flavored pods. Juul plans to continue selling its menthol flavor. All this as the CDC has tracked more than 2,000 vaping related lung injuries in just the past couple of months.</p><p>General Motors has found a buyer for its Lordstown plant in Ohio. Lordstown Motors, which is a start up company, says it plans to hire 400 workers next year and start making an electric pickup truck for commercial use. This Lordstown plant was closed down by General Motors in March eliminating nearly 1,700 hourly jobs. No word yet on the sale price.</p><p>Well, we have not elected a president yet obviously for 2020 but rapper Kanye West has some big plans for 2024.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KANYE WEST, RAPPER: When I run for president in 2024, we are going to definitely -- what you all laughing at? When I run for president in 2024, we would have created so many jobs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: West was speaking at a festival in New York City. The rapper and clothing designer also promising that his product line Yeezy will be made in the good old United States of America, mostly in the south. And there's a report that he paid his wife, Kim Kardashian, $1 million to not wear rival brands to Yeezy which is his clothing line.</p><p>If you notice, he actually wears a lot of his fashion on social media.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok. All right.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think? Kanye West.</p><p>FREEMAN: The negotiations in every household are different.</p><p>You might at first think that's not the way to handle it. But if it works for them, that's great. I wish politicians and regulators would spend half the time discouraging money used that they spend going after vaping in the list of awful things your teenager can get involved in, it's not very high.</p><p>PEEK: It's interesting how that company has really taken it on the chin. And we don't know much about what causes the problems. I mean I agree with you, the number of people's lives are being saved because they've given up smoking cigarettes. Honestly, that seems more important to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But there are deaths and illnesses related to it, so there's that.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, I know. I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So there's that.</p><p>PEEK: But they don't -- yes. They've got to figure this out. It seems crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Quick break and then we're looking at China trade uncertainty this morning. There are new questions this morning after one White House advisor said that there's no agreement to roll back any tariffs. What was the market trading on yesterday?</p><p>Then the 2020 race shakeup -- billionaire Michael Bloomberg expected to join the Democratic race. What it could mean for the other candidates and the war on wealth.</p><p>Back in a minute right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We are focused on China trade, the status of negotiations up in the air. We are expecting some deal. However, Beijing yesterday said that the U.S. and China had agreed to postpone tariff increases if a phase one deal is reached.</p><p>Then President Trump's senior trade advisor, Peter Navarro told Lou Dobbs last night there is no agreement at all like that. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SENIOR TRADE ADVISOR: There is no agreement at this time to remove any of the existing tariff as a condition of the phase one deal and the only person who can make that decision is president Donald J. Trump and it's as simple as that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: But get this, this morning in a new interview, Navarro is saying that the U.S. is willing to put off the December 15th tariff increases should a deal happen.</p><p>Joining us right now is the Milken Institute Asia fellow Curtis Chin. And Curtis -- it is great to have you here. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>CURTIS CHIN, FELLOW, MILKEN INSTITUTE ASIA: Always great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We know that China wants tariff increases off the table. This is something that China wants. It's why they were saying this yesterday. And the President says he's a tariffs man. What do you think happens with the deal between the two?</p><p>CHIN: You know, it's going to still be a long process. I kind of laughed yesterday. Indeed it's something you were all saying earlier. It's a little bit of China trying to take Trump's tactics.</p><p>Every now and then you see a bit of news about how the U.S.-China trade war might be getting better, might be improving and I think the market goes back to the old days of a little bit of irrational exuberance. I think we've got to focus on the fundamentals.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you know China. I mean do you think China would agree to putting an enforcement mechanism in any deal that requires consequences. That means consequences should the U.S. find that China is still stealing intellectual property.</p><p>CHIN: You know, not to channel speaker Gingrich. But I'm sure China will agree to it but the reality is that the track record of China too often from trade to Hong Kong is broken promises. So I think we really need to think through, not just signing an enforcement deal, but really all the steps and if it's going to mean bring back tariffs, I mean sadly, we might have to do this.</p><p>FREEMAN: Curtis -- it seems like all along one of the hardest things is to evaluate what the pain threshold for the Chinese regime is, how much economic pressure are they under, and at what point does Xi Jinping cut a deal.</p><p>We've seen signs of stress. Certainly their economy has slowed. Hiring by foreign manufacturers has slowed. I don't know if it's related but you've got a few local banks fail there and some bank runs.</p><p>Is this an economy under real stress or is this something they're kind of taking in stride and they can wait out Trump?</p><p>CHIN: You know, clearly, the Chinese economy is under stress. But you remember how big the Chinese economy is. And unlike here in the United States, China doesn't always have to respond to unhappy Chinese consumers, unhappy Chinese people. I think both sides, you know, are focusing on domestic politics and trying to come up with a real substantive, to both sides' credit, face-saving way out of this.</p><p>BOLTON: Is there any indication about what's going on inside of China? Because sometimes when we talk about China, it's monolithic right. It's like China wants this, China wants that.</p><p>I mean I am assuming that there are numerous voices, even though President Xi Jinping is the ultimate voice. So are there people within the Chinese government at a high level who want to make a deal with the U.S.?</p><p>CHIN: You know what, everything sadly is anecdotal. I mean this is the reality of the very opaque (ph) regime what's going on in China.</p><p>I think it's all a good point. You know, Secretary Pompeo is actually -- the Secretary of State is in Germany right now to mark the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. And he's always made an important point to differentiate between the communist Chinese leadership and the Chinese people.</p><p>I mean Chinese people want a better life, they want a deal, absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well so do Hong Kongers. How much pressure does this unrest in Hong Kong create. A student died today after falling into a coma brought on by the injuries sustained when he fell into a multi-story parking garage and the fall occurred during a clash between police and protesters on Monday.</p><p>Do you think what's happening in Hong Kong -- what have we got -- 20 weeks or so -- with these protesters. Is that putting pressure on Xi Jinping?</p><p>CHIN: Absolutely. I think we're up to 23 weeks. And how sad that news is. Sadly, I feel it won't be the only death out of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But is he changing -- is he not going to have the authoritarian rule that he has? I mean is he -- because, you know, Jimmy Lai who's an activist there has come on this show a lot and said everything changed when Xi Jinping became dictator for life.</p><p>CHIN: Yes. Very clearly, you know. He has that potential to be a dictator for life. But I also wonder, you know, is it also a sign of a weaker leader? That in many ways China who's (INAUDIBLE) backward on its governance.</p><p>And so when we look at Hong Kong today, you know, clearly we don't want the violence. I don't think either side wants the violence. But again, it goes back to that same story of broken promises, has Beijing broken that promise of one country, two systems.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It keeps happening.</p><p>CHIN: It's hard on people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It keeps happening. It keeps happening.</p><p>PEEK: They just finished that plenum which basically all the party leaders came together and apparently supported Xi Jinping. Do you have any sense or you have any intelligence on the fact that there really was discord in the party or was that -- was it just as it is seen totally unified, backing his rule?</p><p>CHIN: You know, it's sad we only know what you know, right, what you read in the papers. But clearly you know . My friends' business leaders in Hong Kong feel that right now Beijing is allowing Hong Kong to figure out the way forward.</p><p>But sadly, I think that way forward will require a change in leadership -- leadership in Hong Kong.</p><p>PEEK: Well, they couldn't. They have pretty aggressive sounding security rewrites too about their approach from Xi Jinping, I think, right? So I mean it seemed to me that they were sort of preparing for a serious intervention.</p><p>CHIN: You know, let's all hope that doesn't happen. But there does stand that chance.</p><p>FREEMAN: Xi Jinping just promised Emmanuel Macron, the French leader, that they're not going to sell or they're going to crack down on the sale of counterfeit French cheese and wine in China.</p><p>CHIN: You know, again --</p><p>FREEMAN: I mean can he really say we're not going to stop stealing U.S. software?</p><p>CHIN: China promises so much. And to President Trump's credit, not only has he called them out, but he brought about tactics, tariffs that has resulted in some of these Chinese announcements that they're going to allow more liberalization in the financial and other sectors.</p><p>But again let's go back to their track record. They promise things. We need to ensure they actually follow up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Curtis, real quick -- is there a downside risk to not doing a deal with China?</p><p>CHIN: I'm sorry. I mean yes, of course there's a downside risk.</p><p>BARTIROMO: For the United States. If they keep breaking their promises and we can't get them to agree to not steal intellectual property and force the transfer of technology, you know, rounding up these Muslims in concentration camps. I mean what if the U.S. says, you know what, we're done. What's the risk?</p><p>CHIN: You know, the economies are so closely linked. I think in the long term there will be an evolution in the relationship which we all hope for the better.</p><p>I remember I was at one Milken Institute event with a Chinese CEO. And he said it's like when a husband and wife -- one threatens to stab the other, all then is calm but that relationship will never be the same.</p><p>And I'd say it's the same with the Chinese-United States relationship, it will never be the same. But it can evolve to a better one -- because really, a more sustainable, more reciprocal trading relationship will be to the benefit of both sides. I think that's what we all hope for.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right. Curtis -- it's good to get your insights. Thank you.</p><p>Curtis Chin joining us there.</p><p>Coming up the race to the White House gets more interesting. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg opens the door to a possible run for president. How it could shake up the 2020 race and Wall Street.</p><p>More after the break. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Our top story this half an hour, taxing the wealthy, Elizabeth Warren making the wealth tax a major talking point in the 2020 race. This coming as billionaire Michael Bloomberg is possibly joining the 2020 race. We are expecting him to file today. Warren tweeted out a link to her billionaire tax calculator in response to the Bloomberg announcement.</p><p>And my next guest is out with a look out how Warren's progressive policies could affect markets. Joining us right now is Cornerstone Macro head of U.S. Policy, Andy Laperriere. Andy, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ANDY LAPERRIERE, HEAD OF U.S. POLICY RESEARCH, CORNERSTONE MACRO: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I was reading your research the other day and I thought it was really spot on. Tell us about the impact of Elizabeth Warren's policies given the fact that she is high up there, she may very well be the nominee on the Democrat side and we want to really look at what her policies would do. What's the impact?</p><p>LAPERRIERE: Well, I think from a broader economic point of view I think that her policies would likely be negative for financial markets. I mean, she's made it explicit that she wants to lower corporate profits. So obviously that's going to negatively impact the stocks, both the earnings prospects but also stock multiples.</p><p>And then I think a lot of her policies would put downward pressure on GDP by taxing the factors of production more heavily. And so I think that the -- you know, there's a lot of reasons I think it would be negative for the stock market overall.</p><p>And then of course, there are important sectors that she would be targeting that would be big losers as well. Financials I think are at the top of the list, as well as big tech, healthcare as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, she's got a long list of taxes, right? She wants to increase the corporate tax rate, she wants to do a millionaire's tax, she wants to do a wealth tax. Go through some of the taxes and what industries are most impacted. You said financial services.</p><p>LAPERRIERE: Well, I think financial services, both because of taxes, she's proposed a financial transaction tax, she's proposed a bank tax, just higher corporate taxes as you mention would be -- particularly head financials they benefited disproportionately to the lower tax rates under the, you know, Trump tax plan.</p><p>But also she's targeted -- talked about breaking up the big banks. She's been -- you know, she was the CFPD was her brainchild. She's talked about being very tough, even criminally prosecuting firms and their senior executives. She's gone after, you know, student lenders in the past, the credit rating agencies.</p><p>So the list of policies that could be potentially negative for financial services sector is very long, both in terms of the macro sense, the taxes as well as the specific policies aimed at different parts of the financial sector.</p><p>You know, I could have mentioned private equity. She's got a tough proposal on private equity as well. So the list is quite long.</p><p>FREEMAN: Andy, hi, James Freeman here. I'm wondering I guess this is more of a political question. We were talking earlier about how Michael Bloomberg's entry into the race might be a challenge in terms of a new voice attacking her plans to attack the market economy, but could it actually benefit her if she has a long debate with a billionaire about her wealth tax, which takes away from description of all these other taxes? For example, the middle class taxes the lack -- the -- and the lack of patient choice in the healthcare plan?</p><p>LAPERRIERE: Well, I think that's right. I think it also could potentially benefit her in another way, which is it could end up splitting the opposition. It might make it more difficult for someone else to emerge as a chief challenger to Warren. I'm kind of skeptical that Bloomberg really -- I think he's kind of a man without a home. I mean, I think he's too conservative on fiscal issues and crime for the Democrats and too liberal for the social issue -- on the social issues for Republicans.</p><p>So I'm not really sure he has a great chance of winning the Democratic nomination and potentially coming in, in the race. If he does now, it maybe makes it harder for other Democrats who might have a better chance at challenging Warren to find a voice.</p><p>PEEK: Andy, Liz Peek here. You -- the financial services sector clearly would be in the crosshairs of Elizabeth Warren. But let's not forget energy, insurers, hospital companies, big tech. I mean, it's pretty hard to find an industry that she doesn't want to basically decimate. Have you -- or sat down and kind of looked at how much of the U.S. economy she wants to rip apart?</p><p>LAPERRIERE: Well, we put out some a warm portfolio earlier this week. And you're right; it's not just those sectors in our portfolio, takes look and includes a number of those other sectors, the ones that you mentioned, right, big tech, energy, healthcare.</p><p>And so there's -- you know, in terms of the market cap of the -- of the -- of the sectors that she would be going after, you're talking about, you know, just healthcare, tech and financials are half the market cap and then you have other big areas as well.</p><p>So there's -- and on the flip side, it's tough to find the longs under a Warren portfolio, you could say alternative energy --</p><p>PEEK: Exactly.</p><p>LAPERRIERE: -- companies that would from -- benefit from more infrastructure spending.</p><p>Arguably, some consumer names if you had a big transfer from the wealthy to the lower income, middle class Americans as I think you would under her; you could say that maybe some consumer names could benefit from that.</p><p>But yes, there's a -- there's a lot of -- and then there's other things that we haven't mentioned so far, her labor policies I think are under- appreciated as an important aspect of her agenda that would have important implications for the broader economy but also individual companies as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you haven't mentioned healthcare. And that's one of her landmark plans, right? Medicare for All.</p><p>Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told Reuters that he doubts that Warren's Medicare for All plan could be fully paid for alongside her other programs. Zandi had been supportive of her healthcare reform plan.</p><p>But Andy, you're talking about a plan that's what? $52 trillion and when she eliminates all the private health insurance where 180 million people get their insurance from, you're going to talk about job cuts as well.</p><p>Remember just last week, someone said to her what are you going to do with all of the jobs that are going to be lost when you eliminate private health insurance. And she said, you know, very flippantly, oh, well, they can go work in life insurance or car insurance or auto insurance. I mean, there's going to be a hefty amount of job losses as a result of that, right?</p><p>LAPERRIERE: Yes, I mean, certainly the healthcare sector's going to be at risk and I think, you know, it's pretty clear, it's been the most affected by the election already.</p><p>But I'm very skeptical that Medicare for All is going to pass. Personally, I don't think that Elizabeth Warren would end up making it a top priority. I think her reforming capitalism is really the -- at the heart of what her campaign is about, what she wants to do and given how extremely difficult it would be to take health insurance away from 150 to 170 million Americans, paying for it as you mentioned. So I'm pretty skeptical that Medicare for All would happen under Warren.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>LAPERRIERE: But obviously the stocks are going to get -- are -- it's going to weigh on the stocks if she's the nominee for the next year because it is a possibility.</p><p>BARTIROMO: As we wrap up here, Andy, real quick, bottom line here, how significant a selloff will we see in the stock market? Should Elizabeth Warren be the nominee or the winner?</p><p>LAPERRIERE: I think it's going to come under a lot of pressure. I think that most investors believe that. And I think, you know, for the reasons we've just talked about the -- she's talking about lowering corporate profits; she's going after major sectors of the market. Her proposals would reduce potential GDP and so I think for those reasons and others that this is going to weigh on the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Andy, great to have you. Thanks so much.</p><p>LAPERRIERE: Thank you. My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Andy Laperriere joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, find out why CBS is under fire this morning after a leaked video of ABC reporter Amy Robach goes viral.</p><p>Then, waiting to buy a home, first time buyers are older than ever.</p><p>Then, don't forget to ask Maria. Be sure to send me your questions on Instagram and on Twitter. I'll be answering them next hour and every Friday. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The FBI arresting six people who alleged -- whose alleged scam has national security implications. Lauren Simonetti with the details, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Hi, Maria. So six people were arrested yesterday for allegedly scamming the U.S. government and putting the nation's security at risk. A half dozen executives at Aventura Technologies which is in Long Island, New York, arrested, accused of selling more than $20 million worth of security equipment that were labeled made in the USA but actually came from China. The items included metal detectors, surveillance cameras and turnstiles, imagine that.</p><p>Well, CBS is under fire again this morning, for firing an employee accused of leaking that footage of ABC reporter Amy Robach complaining that her Jeffrey Epstein story was killed by the network. According to reports, the CBS employee obtained the footage while an employee of ABC. Both networks were widely criticized on social media for that collaboration.</p><p>And fewer young people in America are buying homes. This is according to the National Association of Realtors. The median age of a first time home buyer is 33, that is a record high. A number of factors are the cause, including rising home prices, higher property taxes, and student loan debt plus other debt. Tighter lending standards also making it tougher for borrowers who don't have high credit scores.</p><p>So -- but there -- we're doing everything later in life these days, having families later, so we're still doing it I guess. Just pushing it back, I don't know about five, 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And living longer. So there's that.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And living longer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Lauren.</p><p>James wrote an op-ed about that story you just brought us, Lauren. So much for whistleblower coverage at ABC and CBS. And I thought it was a great piece, James.</p><p>FREEMAN: Oh, thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us about it.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, I think news consumers -- this is news you can use. You don't need to take seriously anymore when ABC and CBS do another story worshiping the alleged federal whistleblower pretending that there's some sacred right to remain anonymous while criticizing the president because we're seeing how they treat a whistleblower in their midst. This is an employee who didn't like what was happening at ABC, didn't like that they took so long to tell the Jeffrey Epstein sexual abuse story. That footage you're seeing there was leaked with this employee's assistance, it appears. So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So that employee was at ABC when this conversation happened --</p><p>FREEMAN: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- but then went to CBS.</p><p>FREEMAN: Right. So when this footage comes out, ABC immediately begins a hunt for the -- what we might call the whistleblower.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Who leaked the footage?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. Big pressure inside the organization to figure out this person's identity. Does this sound familiar? So they find out very quickly, they realize that employee's now at CBS. They call CBS. CBS has not been harmed by this but as a doing a solid for ABC or maybe just to make it clear that whistleblowers are not welcome in their organization, they have fired this employee.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is so wrong. CBS was not hurt by this in any way. The employee was there when Amy Robach said it at ABC. Then they -- she went to CBS and then she gets fired because ABC tells CBS, oh, the person who leak this works for you now.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, and I think it's reasonable; businesses can set terms on employment. But this is -- these are the organizations who have run literally hundreds of stories over the last 50 days since this whistleblower story broke, basically taking this anonymous employ -- federal employee's side, refusing to disclose the identity which of course what that does to the public, it means we can't evaluate the potential political motivation.</p><p>But we're seeing now they don't actually believe in this. This is done, because they oppose the president and we see in their own organization, they take a totally different position.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, especially since we know that the apparent whistleblower did work for John Brennan and perhaps may be one of those people who was trying to get the story out that President Trump colluded with Russia.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, we'll see. We -- and we certainly have seen the whistleblower's lawyer pleading a number of people have pointed to the tweets from 2017 talking about impeachment, talking about getting rid of him, the danger he was doing to the country. These are obviously people with an agenda and we should know what it is.</p><p>PEEK: And by the way, all you need to know about the whistleblower is that Adam Schiff doesn't want him around anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, there you go.</p><p>PEEK: He hasn't allowed him to be public, hasn't allowed him to be part of this investigation. That's all you need to know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, so CBS, don't worry about the pedophile who was Jeffrey Epstein. Just protect ABC and CBS at all cost.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: We're not talking about the story which was just horrifying.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Horrifying, terrible. All right, quick break and then champagne fit for bond, James Bond.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your champagne, sir.</p><p>ROGER MOORE, ACTOR: What was that?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your champagne.</p><p>MOORE: Put it on the table. Thanks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, yes, the company behind the iconic spy's choice of bubbly, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PIERCE BROSNAN, ACTOR: As you can see, I have no problem with female authority.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was a clip from the iconic bond film \"GoldenEye\" where 007 shows his affinity for Bollinger champagne. Bollinger unveiling its limited edition champagne for the upcoming Bond film \"No Time to Die\".</p><p>And joining us right now are Bollinger Champagne Deputy Master Cellar, Denis Bunner and Vintus COO Alexander Michas. Gentlemen, great to have you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>DENIS BUNNER, DEPUTY MASTER CELLAR, BOLLINGER CHAMPAGNE: Thank you.</p><p>ALEXANDER MICHAS, COO, VINTUS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we all know the film and the bottle in that -- in that film. Tell us more about this new bottle.</p><p>MICHAS: Well, every few years Bollinger has decided to make a special champagne, Denis has made the champagne in celebration of the 40 years of partnership. So this fall we're releasing this 2011 vintage champagne inspired by the scene you just saw and maybe Denis can talk a little bit about what makes it so special.</p><p>BUNNER: Yes, of course. So normally in champagne we blend different vintage, different variety and different villages and different Cru. And this one is very special because it's single village, single year, and single grape variety. It's 100 percent by Pinot Noir from the Grand Cru of Ay. And that's why it's very rare, it's a limited edition.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What should we look for in a champagne when ordering champagne? There's so many, you know, different choices out there. So what's most important when deciding on a champagne?</p><p>MICHAS: It's a great question. And I think that there are certain producers that have styles associated with them, based on where they're located, based on the grapes they choose to grow in their vineyards and how they make the champagnes.</p><p>You know, Bollinger is known as the -- I would say the powerful, refined, complex producer. So if you like that style of champagne, if you like, let's say the James Bond style of champagne, that's what you're going to look for.</p><p>FREEMAN: I was just reading a biography about Winston Churchill, and it said he drank champagne with dinner every night. I'm sure you'd recommend that. But I'm wondering, would this be just like the Friday and Saturday brand, or would you go with these seven days a week?</p><p>BUNNER: That's a very good question. I think we have to drink with moderation.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, OK.</p><p>BUNNER: And of course champagne is not to be drank for (INAUDIBLE) that I think since we are the house of pinot noir, our champagne are really made for -- to enjoy with nice meal with gourmet food (INAUDIBLE) so we can pair it with many type of dishes.</p><p>PEEK: So this is a very narrow -- I mean, just one village, one type of grape, etcetera. So it can't be a very big production, I presume. This is very limited and special?</p><p>BUNNER: Yes. That's why it's so special. It's limited. We ferment in little barrels and we have selected the best plots of the year the vintage of 2011. It was a very atypical year. And every time something is atypical, we want to try something bold and that's why we decided to make this wine in 11.</p><p>MICHAS: We'll have 5,000 bottles for the U.S.</p><p>PEEK: All right, that's what I was going to ask you. And so in terms of your -- this, the pricing on this compared to a regular bottle of your champagne, what kind of premium are we talking about?</p><p>MICHAS: So I think the suggested retail for this is around $230. Bollinger's vintage champagnes, they vary like La Grande Annee which is probably the largest production of their vintage champagnes is around $150. And then their R.D. is 200, something like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How's champagne sales doing? I mean, we were talking earlier that wine has taken a -- is under attack because of the sugar content. What can you tell us, as the holiday seasons are approaching, how is the business going in terms of champagne sales?</p><p>MICHAS: So through July, from the champagne exports stats, sales are about even. They are slightly up. Bollinger is having an outstanding year, we are up 18 percent this year. So I think the U.S. is probably the most important market in the world today for prestige champagnes, for champagnes at the very top of the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Denis, Alexander, great to have you both. Thanks so much.</p><p>MICHAS: Thank you.</p><p>BUNNER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cheers to you. We'll be right back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019110802cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFV-7C51-JB20-G338-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7437\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Elizabeth Warren</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wealth Tax</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Michael Bloomberg</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CBS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ABC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Whistleblower</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bollinger</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Medicare for All</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amy Robach</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Champagne</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DECC</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp;

This is the thirteenth article in the series. Read our extensive coverage of the Bill here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The tightly regulated financial sector is no stranger to multiple privacy, security and confidentiality obligations, whether imposed by law, contract or accepted industry standards. Despite this, the nuances of a data protection law nevertheless bring in new compliance obligations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A key challenge for the financial sector will thus be to streamline their existing obligations and activities with the requirements of the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (the \"PDP Bill\"). This article looks at the changes in the PDP Bill entail for the financial sector in terms of the impact on certain specific activities, and how present financial laws would need to be aligned with the Bill.</p><p>Fintech companies are providing an increasing number of services to customers (neobanks, personal finance managers), to banks (video KYC services, payment aggregators), to other companies like merchants (risk management services, customer lifecycle management) and even to other fintech companies (credit scoring, analytics). A number of these often fall outside of traditional regulation.</p><p>The PDP Bill brings in major compliance obligations, for the first time for some, and in particular for data intensive activities.</p><p>Impact on API-based banking and consent management</p><p>An increasingly popular fintech service today is API-based banking-as-a-service. This allows third party applications to access data from a bank to provide a service, such as a neobanking app enabling salary disbursals from enterprise bank accounts to multiple employee bank accounts. Relevant data in the bank's database is accessed using an application programming interface (API), that only gives access to the queried and permitted data.</p><p>This exchange of data falls entirely outside the scope of the RBI's account aggregator (\"AA\") framework, a consent management framework introduced to govern a similar exchange, but between regulated entities only (for example: a customer of Bank A approaches Bank B for a loan, and Bank B seeks credit history, etc. from Bank A).</p><p>The AA framework prescribes detailed data protection requirements (explicit consent with strict restrictions for access, sharing, storage, etc.). For fintech provided services, the entire process (relying on user credentials, screen scraping, etc.) is instead governed contractually.</p><p>The PDP Bill will now bring in similar data protection requirements, requiring, for instance, addressing existing issues such as inadequate customer consent and sharing of plain-text data, enabling the exercise of data principal rights like the right to access or portability, and revamping contracts to specify controller-processor obligations, purposes, erasure periods, and so on.</p><p>Consent managers under the PDP Bill</p><p>The Bill also brings in an analogue of the AAs - intermediary data fiduciaries called \"consent managers\". These will help users manage consent given to data fiduciaries, thus enabling both regulated and unregulated entities to now gain consent-based access to data through a third party. Some clarity as to their operations is needed - such as whether they will follow the AA's model of functioning, whether they can be sector-specific, whether API specifications for simplified integration will be issued, etc. Aligning the AA framework with the PDP Bill</p><p>On a separate note, along with consent management, the consent managers additionally allow users to communicate with fiduciaries to exercise any of their rights under the proposed law. The AA framework at present does not permit this exercise. An amendment should be considered to avoid forcing users to have to rely on the AAs for managing consent as well as a separate consent manager for exercising their rights.</p><p>Impact on increasing mergers, acquisitions, and consolidations in the fintech sector</p><p>A notable trend in the financial space bound to reach India soon are varying mergers, acquisitions and consolidation (Visa-Plaid, Fiserv-First Data, Worldline-Ingenico). The coronavirus outbreak may also trigger a certain amount of consolidation in the sector to enable struggling companies to survive. Data will play a significant role in the decisions taken, both as an asset to be valued as well as a risk to be assessed.</p><p>Monitoring notable movements by the proposed Data Protection Authority (\"DPA\"), and conducting independent privacy audits, as a part of prior due diligence procedures by the companies themselves, will become inevitable. The significant fines under the Bill (2-4% of total worldwide turnover) will also necessitate indemnities and warranties from the seller, such as that it hasn't experienced any data breaches, or that its activities are fully compliant with the law.</p><p>Data protection compliance during the process of the M&amp;A itself will be key (such as identifying a lawful basis of processing, providing notice to data principals, etc.). Significantly, the Bill proposes exempting M&amp;As from the consent requirement, as a \"reasonable purpose\" for processing [Section 14(2)]. In view of the classification of financial data as sensitive personal data (\"SPD\"), it is notable that the original 2018 Bill did not allow SPD to be exempted as a reasonable purpose. The 2019 Bill however makes no such distinction. Thus, unless further clarity is given in the final draft, SPD, including financial data, will also be within the scope of the consent exemption for M&amp;As.</p><p>How will existing contracts and relationships be redefined? A closer look at the payments industry</p><p>Relationships in the financial sector are determined not just by law, but also by contract, by custom and by international practices. This creates specific issues in relation to data protection compliance. This is illustrated here with a reference to the payments industry:</p><p>Identifying fiduciaries, processors, and redefining obligations</p><p>A payments transaction made on a merchant site involves a range of players - the merchant, the payment gateway/aggregator, a mobile wallet, card networks, the issuing and acquiring bank, the bank with the nodal account, any service providers involved such as the cloud service providers or SMS service providers, and so on.</p><p>The exact role of each of these, that is, as a processor or a fiduciary, varies based on the specific role as well as the individual contractual arrangements between each player. For example, the banks involved will normally be fiduciaries while the payment gateway/aggregator will normally be a processor. However, if the payment gateway chooses contractually to retain data, say on customer complaints made to them for research for product evaluations, then it acts as a fiduciary with relation to that specific data.</p><p>The PDP Bill requires each of these players, whether fiduciaries or processors, to be compliant with the law. This will also include the card networks, in view of the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the PDP Bill [Chapter VII]. Existing obligations will also need to be re-evaluated for their compliance with the upcoming law - such as revamping contracts to separate obligations and liabilities imposed. In the payments transaction, for instance, the notice and consent obligation will be imposed on the merchant. Another example is imposing privacy by design obligations on the provider, such as when a fiduciary is using a white-labelled payments application/technology.</p><p>Another important point here is the contractual determination of liabilities to pay the steep penalties under the Bill for a violation. It must be remembered here that fiduciaries and processors alike can be required to compensate victims of a data breach for a violation they commit.</p><p>Identifying a lawful basis of processing</p><p>The PDP Bill only identifies Indian laws as an exception to consent. This means that unless exempted as a reasonable purpose, requirements imposed via international law, contract, etc. will require consent. PCI-DSS compliance, for example, is a mandatory international compliance standard for card payments imposed by card networks (i.e., not an Indian law). For every such obligation, the financial sector will have to identify whether a law exists, an exemption applies (for, PCI-DSS for instance, the reasonable purpose exemption for fraud prevention/information security will apply) or if consent will have to be obtained.</p><p>Interacting with existing laws</p><p>Issues can also arise where a law is in place. The PDP Bill, for instance, recognises only purposes \"necessary\" under law. Consider the RBI's Master Direction on KYC, which grants banks certain discretion in relation to disclosures, allowing these for when the \"interest of the bank requires disclosure\" and when there is a \"duty to the public to disclose\" [Section 56(d)]. Whether various discretionary powers satisfy the requirement of \"necessity\" under the PDP Bill, given that this is prescribed law, or whether these will need a separate DPA approval needs to be clarified.</p><p>Similarly, minimum retention periods can be found in the law (the KYC direction for instance prescribes 5 years), but the PDP Bill requires maximum retention periods to be defined. In case maximum periods are not introduced in the data protection itself, companies will be required to define when to erase data on their own.</p><p>A separate conflict that arises is with concurrent jurisdiction for data-related disputes between the DPA/Adjudicatory Officers under the PDP Bill and various avenues under financial laws such as under RBI notifications or laws like the Payments and Settlement Systems Act. The Digital Ombudsman, for instance has jurisdiction over any non-adherence to an RBI instruction, that often includes privacy and security requirements. The PDP Bill thankfully proposes to solve this by allowing the regulator and other authorities to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with the DPA for this.</p><p>Can the Bill be applied retrospectively to existing databases?</p><p>The absence of an adequate data protection law has led to the creation of huge databases, which are subjected to analytics using AI/ML, become the object of data trades/sales, enable revenue generation via cross-selling and upselling of financial products, enable services like wealth-tech, robo-advisory, and so on. Consider alternative credit scoring, which moves past financial data alone to use alternative data - ranging from web browser history to details about phone calls made - to decide whether or not credit should be granted.</p><p>Data protection laws don't have direct retrospective application. However, steps will be needed to continue processing (which includes even mere storage) the data in hand. Companies will have to either erase, anonymise (which is tricky) or make the data compliant. The last can be burdensome, as it involves providing notice to customers, reviewing activities to ensure they comply with privacy principles (data minimisation, purpose limitation, use limitation, etc.), and so on, and where an alternative ground for processing cannot be identified, obtaining proper consent from the customers.</p><p>Is alternative credit scoring a \"reasonable purpose\" for exemption from consent?</p><p>The Bill proposes exempting credit scoring from consent as a reasonable purpose. It is not clear if alternative credit scoring falls within this exemption. Under the GDPR, companies have a certain amount of discretion with identifying processing that they have \"legitimate interest\" in, allowing them to use alternative data for credit scoring thereunder. Under the Indian PDP Bill, the reasonable purposes exemption is not similarly discretionary, but will work in the form of whitelisting by the DPA. It is unclear at the moment if the exact scope of the whitelisted activity will be clarified, or if once whitelisted, defining the scope of the activity will be left to the discretion of the companies. Given the increasing use of alternative credit scoring, particularly as a tool for financial inclusion, there is potential for the DPA to permit it.</p><p>How will the innovation sandbox work? How will it interact with other sandboxes?</p><p>Innovation in general will need to become more privacy conscious. This will be in terms of the data leveraged to create, and also the impact of the innovation itself. Consider Video KYC, which will involve the use of biometric data (say facial recognition techniques). This, in turn, will lead to the creation of multiple biometric databases with various entities using the technology with the RBI (via the regulatory sandbox, since applications have been invited for digital KYC products), with fintech companies providing this service, with banks and other financial institutions using the service and even with the Central KYC registry. Securing these will need to be prioritised. Video KYC services, like other inventions that are based on biometric data (such as device-less payments), will also need to be conscious of Section 92 of the PDP Bill, whereby the Central government can prohibit processing of certain types of biometric data.</p><p>Similar consciousness with data protection norms is also required when creating underlying technology. The blockchain, for instance, is a technology that by its very design brings in certain limitations for privacy compliance. An example is with customers exercising rights to data correction or data erasure. Privacy by design is a factor that will have to be accounted for [Section 22].</p><p>Innovating itself will face its own challenges. The RBI's regulatory sandbox framework, for instance, mandates express customer consent together with demonstrated compliance with data protection laws. Flexibility with repurposing data, however, will be limited given the PDP Bill's norms on data minimisation and purpose limitation. To support innovation, relaxations similar to those allowed for the sandbox proposed under the PDP Bill itself should be extended to the sandboxes in the financial sector as well. These include, for example, relaxation of purpose, collection and retention limitations.</p><p>Interaction with other sandboxes</p><p>Also, with multiple regulatory sandboxes in place (for instance, IRDAI, SEBI, RBI, recommendations for inter-regulatory sandboxes in the financial sector for hybrid financial products), permitting inter-operability between these sandboxes and the one under the PDP Bill, or the ability to seek relaxations from multiple sandbox frameworks for a single product must also be considered. This is important since each framework allows an authority to relax regulations only within the ambit of its specific powers. The RBI for instance will be unable grant relaxations to the regulatory provisions within the power of the DPA, and vice versa.</p><p>How will new players from Big Tech be governed?</p><p>DPA monitoring will also be inevitable with another notable trend - the foray of Big Tech into the financial space. The services offered include payments (WhatsApp Pay, Alipay), credit (Apple card), banking and neobanking (Uber Money, Google's Project Cache), etc. This will involve, on the one hand, repurposing existing data troves (such as creating risk profiles or customised product offerings), and on the other, the greater data access and insight gained on account of the new and increased customer activity on their platforms.</p><p>While developing business models here, Big Tech companies need to take into account that they no longer have a free rein over data. The Bill brings in restrictions like data minimisation and purpose limitation, which impose restrictions on (say) the types of data that can be collected, how long it can be stored and the purposes it can be put to. Consent will often be required as a basis of processing, and even where it is exempted (say for State activities or as a reasonable purpose), notice will still need to mandatorily be provided to data principals.</p><p>The need for a Task force on data protection</p><p>An important issue with the PDP Bill is that a lot is left to the discretion of the DPA. Many aspects of the compliance are thus ambiguous at present. The complete picture of the actual obligations for a specific industry and the flexibility allowed will emerge only once the DPA is in place and commences issuing guidance documents, codes of practice, etc. To effectively do this,</p><p>The discretionary power of the DPA should be reduced by introducing more definite terms in the law to guide it, say with the determination of exemptions or the defining of timelines for data breach notifications. A streamlining of norms at an industry level will also become essential. This can be via the setting up of a Task Force to review and align current financial laws with the PDP Bill, as recommended by the Steering Committee on Fintech Related Issues. This can also be done by allowing of industry-created but DPAI approved codes of practice. These will be essential steps, not only for the financial sector, but also for other highly regulated industries such The second recommendation of the Steering Committee, that certain obligations of the DPA be handed to other sectoral regulators to discharge, also needs to be implemented for a more balanced sharing of power and responsibility.</p><p>Asheeta Regidi heads Fintech Policy at Cashfree and is a certified privacy professional.</p><p>Edited by Aditi Agrawal</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0052752765</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YM7-52G1-DXMP-K0XM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2916\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 8, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Some characterized the bipartisan questioning as a brutal beating, but others reported that not much new was accomplished. What can we learn? What were the impacts? How do these regulatory issues affect state and local governments? Most important, what can and should be done next by public and private sector leaders and their partners? These are a few of the items I explore in this blog, with the help of long-time state government policy expert Andris Ozols \u2013 who worked for many years with me in Michigan Government before his retirement a few years ago. Andris was also a significant contributor to my recent blog efforts on elections security. Background On The Congressional Hearings First, the media coverage of the testimony was widespread before, during and after the virtual event. Here are a few headlines and relevant excerpts:   Washington Post: Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google grilled on Capitol Hill over their market power Excerpt: \u201cThe leaders of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google took a brutal political lashing Wednesday as Democrats and Republicans confronted the executives for wielding their market power to crush competitors and amass data, customers and sky-high profits. The rare interrogation played out over the course of a nearly six-hour hearing, with lawmakers on the House\u2019s top antitrust subcommittee coming armed with millions of documents, hundreds of hours of interviews and in some cases the once-private messages of Silicon Valley\u2019s elite chiefs. They said it showed some in the tech sector had become too big and powerful, threatening rivals, consumers and, in some cases, even democracy itself. \u2026\u201d NPR.org: Heads Of Amazon, Apple, Facebook And Google Testify On Big Tech's Power Excerpt: \u201cRep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., the subcommittee chairman, spent all of his first five-minute block of questions on Google \u2014 the company at most immediate risk of antitrust action. The Department of Justice is reportedly preparing to sue the company over its advertising business, and could be joined by state attorneys general who have also been investigating Google. Cicilline pressed CEO Pichai on whether Google's business model presents a conflict of interest, because it has an incentive to give search results that keep users on its own site rather than anywhere else on the Internet. \u2026\u201d New York Times: Lawmakers, United in Their Ire, Lash Out at Big Tech\u2019s Leaders Excerpt: \u201cThe chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, four tech giants worth nearly $5 trillion combined, faced withering questions from Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike on Wednesday for the tactics and market dominance that had made their enterprises successful. For more than five hours, the 15 members of an antitrust panel in the House lobbed questions and repeatedly interrupted and talked over Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google. \u2026\u201d Forbes: Why Big Tech Should Regulate Itself Excerpt: \u201cBig Tech faces two main options. They can go on acting as if nothing is amiss and hope that government action will take a long time to become a reality. Or they can take proactive steps to recognize the legitimacy of the issues and regulate themselves with a commitment to reengage with \u2018acting honorably\u2019 and \u2018doing no evil\u2019. The latter course of action will be the smarter and less painful one. \u2026\u201d Fox News: Big Tech backlash: Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon CEOs grilled on Capitol Hill Excerpt: \u201cHouse lawmakers on Wednesday grilled the heads of some of the world's largest tech companies - with Democrats questioning whether the companies violated U.S. antitrust laws and stole from competitors, while Republicans slammed them over alleged censorship and bias against conservatives. \u2026\u201d BBC News (UK spelling) - Big Tech: What comes next for the US giants? Excerpt: \u201cIt's highly unlikely though that anything much will happen before the US elections in November. As well as the presidential vote, all the seats in the House of Representatives are up for grabs, as well as about a third of the Senate. And so we reach a fork in the road for Big Tech in America. A Republican win would probably see the tech giants scrutinised further over how they police free speech. Section 230 - which gives social media companies immunity from prosecution for what is published on their platforms - would probably be looked at. If the Democrats win, expect more regulation in an attempt to inject more competition into the tech industry. \u2026\u201d State and Local Direct Impacts of Regulatory Issues Direct impact issues are issues that are part of the federal review, litigation and hearing agendas and state Attorney General related agendas. Contested IT related issues involve direct business practices, platforms, hardware, software, services at variance with state and local government public values and ethics, policies, strategies, standards and agreements including accuracy, operations, outputs or outcomes. Emphasis is placed on: State legal requirements; state and gubernatorial priorities; action and decisions needed for this decision cycle; potential for maximum effects on outcomes; facilitating integration, collaboration among governments; involving the greatest range of state and local government services and customers. 1 - Direct effects of federal regulatory issues. Key issues identified in federal big tech, and related hearings include: Limiting options in services, decrease in control or discretion in managing services, decreased trust in government protection of security and privacy, accuracy and truthfulness of information. 2 - State and local regulatory issues.  Key issues addressed in state Attorney General initiatives also include: Limiting options in services, decrease in control or discretion in managing services, decreased trust in government protection of security and privacy, accuracy and truthfulness of information.  Collaborative state initiatives announced last week for New York and California are accelerating the process and provide new models for state and local initiatives. This article from The Guardian (UK) is entitled, \u201cNew York unveils landmark antitrust bill that makes it easier to sue tech giants.\u201d \u201cNew York State is introducing a bill that would make it easier to sue big tech companies for alleged abuses of their monopoly powers. New York is America\u2019s financial center and one of its most important tech hubs. If successfully passed, the law could serve as a model for future legislation across the country. It also comes as a federal committee is conducting an anti-trust investigation into tech giants amid concerns that their unmatched market power is suppressing competition. Also, The New York Attorney General's office will join the California Attorney General's office and the Federal Trade Commission's investigation into Amazon's online marketplace.\u201d 3 \u2013 State, local and federal regulatory roles and balance. Balance in roles and authority in regulations is a policy and legal point of contention among levels of government and also determines how the regulatory issues are prioritized. This includes topic like what stakeholders need to be involved and timing for action. One of the NGA chairs priority issues for 2020 \u2013 2021 will be federalism issues and questions of balance of roles and authority. 4 - State and local stakeholders and collaboration. States have established public and private sector collaborative networks (cite examples), but the current issues call for reinforcing relationships and strengthening ones with NGA, fiscal officers (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nasbo.org/home\">https://www.nasbo.org/home</url> ), procurement National Association of State Procurement Officials - NASPO ,  auditors NASACT , legislators (National Conference of State Legislatures) and their associations. Also, the perspectives of federal Congressional and Executive assessment sources such as GAO, GSA, CBO and public policy administrators would be helpful, including ASPA. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aspanet.org/ASPA\">https://www.aspanet.org/ASPA</url>/ Indirect Impacts: Information, Procurement, Smart, Digital Government and Public Sector Policy and Procedural Issues Indirect issues are those resulting from direct IT services such as hardware, software, services, outputs serving as IT inputs that support or enable other functions, processes, programs or services. In addition to processes and services, these may also affect policies, standards, decision-making, customer values, perceptions, satisfaction and trust. 1 \u2013 Information Control and Management. Information and information management is a foundational issue, the wizard behind the curtain. Ownership, control, accuracy, misinformation and information management plays a central role in a number of the support platforms for smart, digital government - such as internet of things, mobile and location aware services, cloud, integrated and autonomous AI. 2 \u2013 Procurement. Procurement management is the gateway to public / private relationships, partnerships, standards, performance, accountability, policy and value alignment, etc. Includes RFIs, RFSs, RFPs and contracts. National Association of State Procurement Officials - NASPO is a crucial partner on this issue and NASCIO has a strong established relationship. 3 \u2013 Smart, Digital Government. Smart, digital government and communities and cities are vital constructs describing the connection, integration of technologies to transform how governments, citizens and businesses interact. Some of the regulatory issues can impact on smart government priorities; timing and scheduling; platforms; information ownership; privacy; security; accuracy and reliability; processes; state and local government control; public trust and others. While many roadmaps for smart governments and communities address the role of regulations, not all of them do, and the pandemic as well as the overlap of the flu and hurricane seasons will further accentuate the risks. In general state and local assessments, policies, standards, plans and roadmaps do not consistently address the role of regulations or the consequences of not complying. However, there are sufficient examples or models such as the NGA work on smart transportation and energy (Cite titles and URL;s) that can serve as models. 4 - Key State and Local Service Sectors. There are differential regulatory effects on service sectors and realignment of priorities and solutions. For example, differential effect of selected platforms on IT supported health and education services, distance learning and work, election processes, security, disaster management and recovery. 5 \u2013 Key 2020 \u2013 2021 Events and Decision Points. The juxtaposition of the pandemic, hurricane season, pending flu season in context of elections, economic disruptions a revenue and budget short-falls are altering priorities, reducing funding allocation levels, stressing state and local service capabilities and calls for modifications in disaster and management and recovery approaches and the supporting platforms in which Big Tech is involved. Recommendations for Collaborative Action The public sector IT community needs to work together in both recognizing the benefits of Big Tech and integrator services as well as addressing and resolving adverse effects.  This needs to involve both the public and private sector communities and build upon existing networks and public private partnership models. The following recommendations address both the three-month cycle before the election, the three months after the election, and reference issues for potential future action. The next five or six month period covers the front end of most state and local government assessment, design and development cycles and also includes a number of state and local association and support group working sessions and planned deliverables that could include a regulatory issue perspective. The following four groups share a collaborative history are illustrative of potential opportunities and next steps regarding non-profits supporting state and local governments: National Governors Association (NGA) - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nga.org\">https://www.nga.org</url>/ Follow up to federalism issue after the Summer 2020 virtual session can include both infrastructure and regulatory issues from an IT perspective The Smart Transportation and Smart Energy roadmap sections on regulations, from the Smart Community and State Initiative can be one of the inputs in developing shared templates. National Association of State Chief Information Officers (NASCIO) \u2013 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nascio.org\">www.nascio.org</url> Incorporate regulatory issues into the next brief in the \u201cCIO as Broker\u201d management series. Pose the regulatory issues as one of the priority options in the next priority assessment. Modify next survey design to address regulatory issues. Consider having a virtual collaborative forum on regulatory issues and impacts at the 2020 fall virtual conference in October. Center for Digital Government \u2013 (CDG) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.govtech.com/cdg/about/\">https://www.govtech.com/cdg/about/</url> Incorporate an assessment on regulatory issues in the 2020 DSS survey assessment within the scope of available data. Build upon \u201cNavigating the Next Normal: A resource guide for state and local IT leaders during the COVID-19 recovery and beyond\u201d to further assess role and considerations for regulatory issues. Public Technology Institute (PTI) / CompTIA <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pti.org\">https://www.pti.org</url>/ Expand regulatory assessments through the local government survey series. Consider doing a local government regulatory assessment and recommendations jointly with CDG, NACo and NLC. Recommended Collaborative Actions 1 \u2013 Advocacy on Federal Hearing Report. Coordinate state and local advocacy on the pending federal hearing report and recommendations as well as follow-up with the executive branch and Congress. 2 \u2013 Potential IT Related Advocacy and Potential Participation State AG Initiatives. Develop a coordinated and collaborative state and local review of AG initiatives from an IT perspective and recommendations, including the New York and California proposed actions. The federal hearings and NY initiatives are fulcrums for state and local IT related actions and may serve as models for selected state actions. 3 \u2013 Enhance Role of Regulations in State and Local IT Policies, Strategies, Operations, Roadmaps and Advocacy. Collectively develop templates for addressing regulations in state and local policy and procedural guidelines, including procurement, operational and performance management, audits and others. 4 \u2013 Conduct an Assessment and Recommendations of IT and Regulatory Effect and Support Capabilities for Pandemic Effects and Election Processes. Conduct a collaborative assessment of the capabilities and opportunities of IT support for the pandemic and election process, other pending emergencies and potential interactions with the regulatory issues. Develop recommendations for state leadership, NGA, NCSL and federal government. 5 \u2013 Develop a Forum for IT Stakeholder Collaboration on Regulatory Issues. Identify scope of potential stakeholders for supporting recommendations and further action, and develop a forum for organizing a state, local, federal and private sector collaborative. This forum can be a Web based forum, perhaps hosted as part of the NASCIO virtual fall session.  Final Thoughts Back in 2018, Deloitte Consulting wrote this: \u201cRegulations or absence of regulations can also alter or limit both direct government operations as well as stakeholder, customer benefits, and limit development or innovation options.  As new business models and services emerge, such as ridesharing services and initial coin offerings, government agencies are challenged with creating or modifying regulations, enforcing them, and communicating them to the public at a previously undreamed-of pace. And they must do this while working within legacy frameworks and attempting to foster innovation.\u201d Here is another excellent piece by Deloitte on regulation and cybersecurity: National security and technology regulation. I also think it worth reviewing these biggest takeaways from the Washington Post on the antitrust hearings. One thing is clear: we\u2019ll be back to topic many times in the coming years, and the issues are not going away. CNBC\u2019s expert analysts believe these companies will never be broken-up due to the desire to compete with companies from China and elsewhere, but also say there is no doubt that more regulation is coming. Time to do your homework and get ready for more in 2021 and beyond - whoever wins the upcoming election.   Looking for the latest gov tech news as it happens?

Adam Schiff, the incoming chairman of the House intelligence committee. \u201cThe bigger pardon question may come down the road as the next president has to determine whether to pardon <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person>\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Rep. <person><nameText>Jerry Nadler, </nameText></person>the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, described the details in prosecutors\u2019 filings Friday in the case of Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, as evidence that Trump was \u201cat the center of a massive fraud.\u201d</p><p> \u201cThey would be impeachable offenses,\u201d Nadler said.</p><p> In the filings, prosecutors in New York for the first time link Trump to a federal crime of illegal payments to buy the silence of two women during the 2016 campaign. Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office also laid out previously undisclosed contacts between Trump associates and Russian intermediaries and suggested the Kremlin aimed early on to influence Trump and his Republican campaign by playing to both his political and personal business interests.</p><p> Trump has denied wrongdoing and has compared the investigations to a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d</p><p> Nadler, D-N.Y., said it was too early to say whether Congress would pursue impeachment proceedings based on the illegal payments alone because lawmakers would need to weigh the gravity of the offense to justify \u201coverturning\u201d the 2016 election. Nadler and other lawmakers said Sunday they would await additional details from Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference and possible coordination with the Trump campaign to determine the extent of Trump\u2019s misconduct.</p><p> Regarding the illegal payments, \u201cwhether they are important enough to justify an impeachment is a different question, but certainly they\u2019d be impeachable offenses because even though they were committed before the president became president, they were committed in the service of fraudulently obtaining the office,\u201d Nadler said.</p><p> Mueller has not said when he will complete a report of any findings, and it isn\u2019t clear that any such report would be made available to Congress. That would be up to the attorney general. Trump on Friday said he would nominate former Attorney General William Barr to the post to succeed Jeff Sessions.</p><p> Nadler indicated that Democrats, who will control the House in January, will step up their own investigations. He said Congress, the Justice Department and the special counsel need to dig deeper into the allegations, which include questions about whether Trump lied about his business arrangements with Russians and about possible obstruction of justice.</p><p> \u201cThe new Congress will not try to shield the president,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will try to get to the bottom of this, in order to serve the American people and to stop this massive conspiracy  this massive fraud on the American people.\u201d</p><p> Schiff, D-Calif., also stressed a need to wait \u201cuntil we see the full picture.\u201d He has previously indicated his panel would seek to look into the Trump family\u2019s business ties with Russia.</p><p> \u201cI think we also need to see this as a part of a broader pattern of potential misconduct by the president, and it\u2019s that broad pattern, I think, that will lead us to a conclusion about whether it rises to the level to warrant removal from office,\u201d Schiff said.</p><p> In the legal filings, the Justice Department stopped short of accusing Trump of directly committing a crime. But it said Trump told Cohen to make illegal payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, both of whom claimed to have had affairs with Trump more than a decade ago.</p><p> In separate filings, Mueller\u2019s team detail how Cohen spoke to a Russian who \u201cclaimed to be a \u2018trusted person\u2019 in the Russian Federation who could offer the campaign \u2018political synergy\u2019 and \u2018synergy on a government level.\u2019\u201d Cohen said he never followed up on that meeting. Mueller\u2019s team also said former campaign chairman Paul Manafort lied to them about his contacts with a Russian associate and Trump administration officials, including in 2018.</p><p> Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida called the latest filings \u201crelevant\u201d in judging Trump\u2019s fitness for office but said lawmakers need more information to render judgment. He also warned the White House about considering a pardon for Manafort, saying such a step could trigger congressional debate about limiting a president\u2019s pardon powers.</p><p> Such a move would be \u201ca terrible mistake,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cPardons should be used judiciously. They\u2019re used for cases with extraordinary circumstances.\u201d</p><p> Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine and a member of the Senate intelligence committee, cautioned against a rush to impeachment, which he said citizens could interpret as \u201cpolitical revenge and a coup against the president.\u201d</p><p> \u201cThe best way to solve a problem like this, to me, is elections,\u201d King said. \u201cI\u2019m a conservative when it comes to impeachment. I think it\u2019s a last resort and only when the evidence is clear of a really substantial legal violation. We may get there, but we\u2019re not there now.\u201d</p><p> Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut urged Mueller to \u201cshow his cards soon\u201d so that Congress can make a determination early next year on whether to act on impeachment.</p><p> \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: We have reached a new level in the investigation,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for Congress to get all of the underlying facts and data and evidence that the special counsel has.\u201d</p><p> Nadler spoke on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday, Rubio was on CNN and ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d and Schiff appeared on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Murphy spoke on ABC, and King was on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d</p><p> Why Huawei arrest deepens conflict between US and China</p><p> By PAUL WISEMAN and FRANK BAJAK</p><p>Associated Press</p><p> Friday, December 7</p><p> WASHINGTON (AP)  The arrest of a prominent Chinese telecommunications executive has driven home why it will be so hard for the Trump administration to resolve its deepening conflict with China.</p><p> The arrest of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer, has heightened skepticism over the trade truce that Presidents <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and Xi Jinping reached last weekend in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Stock markets tumbled Thursday on fears that the 90-day cease-fire won\u2019t last, but regained their equilibrium in Europe and Asia on Friday.</p><p> A bail hearing for Meng, who faces possible extradition to the United States after her arrest in Vancouver, Canada, last weekend, was set for later Friday.</p><p>Huawei has been a subject of U.S. national security concerns for years and Meng\u2019s case echoes well beyond tariffs or market access. Washington and Beijing are locked in a clash between the world\u2019s two largest economies for economic and political dominance for decades to come.</p><p> \u201cIt\u2019s a much broader issue than just a trade dispute,\u201d said Amanda DeBusk, chair of the international trade practice at Dechert LLP. \u201cIt pulls in: Who is going to be the world leader essentially.\u201d</p><p> Meng was detained on the same day that Trump and Xi met at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina and agreed to a cease-fire in their trade war. The Globe and Mail newspaper, citing law enforcement sources, reported she is suspected of trying to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran.</p><p>Huawei is the world\u2019s biggest supplier of network gear used by phone and internet companies and long has been seen as a front for spying by the Chinese military or security services. A U.S. National Security Agency cybersecurity adviser, Rob Joyce, last month accused Beijing of violating a 2015 agreement with the U.S. to halt electronic theft of intellectual property.</p><p> Other nations are increasingly being forced to choose between Chinese and U.S. suppliers for next-generation \u201c5G\u201d wireless technology. U.S. critics are lobbying other countries not to buy the equipment from Huawei, arguing that the company may be working stealthily for Beijing\u2019s spymasters.</p><p> \u201cThere is ample evidence to suggest that no major Chinese company is independent of the Chinese government and Communist Party  and Huawei, which China\u2019s government and military tout as a \u2018national champion\u2019 is no exception,\u201d Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., wrote in October to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. They urged him to keep Huawei off Canada\u2019s next-generation network.</p><p> Still, a senior Japanese official cast doubt Friday over reports that his country was considering blocking Huawei and its biggest Chinese rival, ZTE Corp., from government procurement contracts. He said there had been no decision. Australia, New Zealand and Britain are among the countries that have moved to limit the Chinese companies\u2019 involvement in their next-generation telecoms networks.</p><p> In a sign Meng\u2019s case might not derail the Trump-Xi truce, Beijing protested Meng\u2019s arrest but said talks with the Trump administration would go ahead. Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said China is confident it can reach a deal during the 90 days that Trump agreed to suspend a scheduled increase in U.S. import taxes on $200 billion worth of Chinese products.</p><p> Some analysts say China has deployed predatory tactics in its drive to overtake America\u2019s dominance in technology and global economic leadership, such as forcing American and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market and engaging in cyber-theft.</p><p> Washington also regards Beijing\u2019s ambitious long-term development plan, \u201cMade in China 2025,\u201d as a scheme to dominate such fields as robotics and electric vehicles by unfairly subsidizing Chinese companies and discriminating against foreign competitors.</p><p> Priscilla Moriuchi, a former East Asia specialist at National Security Agency now with the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, said both ZTE and Huawei are wedded to China\u2019s military and political leadership.</p><p> \u201cThe threat from these companies lies in their access to critical internet backbone infrastructure,\u201d she said.</p><p> The Trump administration has tightened regulations on high-tech exports to China and made it harder for Chinese firms to invest in U.S. companies or to buy American technology in cutting-edge areas like robotics, artificial intelligence and virtual reality.</p><p> Earlier this year, the United States nearly drove Huawei\u2019s biggest Chinese rival, ZTE Corp., out of business for selling equipment to North Korea and Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. But Trump issued a reprieve, perhaps partly because U.S. tech companies, major suppliers to ZTE, would also have been scorched. ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, change its board and management and to let American regulators monitor its operations.</p><p> The U.S. and Chinese tech industries depend on each other so much for components that \u201cit is very hard to decouple the two without punishing U.S. companies, without shooting ourselves in the foot,\u201d said Adam Segal, cyberspace analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p><p> Dean Garfield, president of the U.S. Information Technology Industry Council trade group, said innovation by U.S. companies often depends utterly on product development and testing by Chinese partners and component suppliers.</p><p> Still, the pushback against Huawei and ZTE is limiting their reach into the world\u2019s richest markets. Nearly a year ago, AT&amp;T pulled out of a deal to sell Huawei smartphones. Barred from use by U.S. government agencies and contractors, they\u2019re mostly locked out of the American market.</p><p> Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, doubts that China will change its tech policies since it needs innovative technologies to keep its economy growing as its labor force ages and it confronts a huge stockpile of debt.</p><p> \u201cWe\u2019re not going to deal that away in 90 days,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a way out of this.\u201d</p><p> Likewise, Rod Hunter, an international economic official in President George W. Bush\u2019s White House and a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie, said, \u201cI\u2019m skeptical that the Chinese are going to want to say \u2018uncle.\u2019\u201d U.S. and Chinese officials are \u201ctrying to tackle a problem that is going to take years, maybe a decade, to resolve.\u201d</p><p> Bajak reported from Boston.

They have lost their stored grain and all their belongings. I don\u2019t know how they will get by.</p><p> These are the words of Riana*, a young woman from Bevoahazo, a tiny village in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. Bevoahazo sits on the edge of Ranomafana National Park in a UNESCO world heritage site teeming with endangered and endemic species. Security in the area has been deteriorating over the last few years but things have escalated recently.</p><p> On November 24, 50 men raided the village stealing stores of rice \u2013 vital food reserves for local people who are mostly subsistence farmers \u2013 and injuring anyone who tried to defend their property. A few days later the local police chief, Heritiana Emilson Rambeloson, who had come to the area with a small team to investigate, was shot dead.</p><p> I spent two years living in Bevoahazo in the early 2000s while researching the sustainability of crayfish harvesting. I have spoken to friends from the village who are are currently staying in the nearby town of Ranomafana for safety, and researchers in the area to get a better understanding of what is happening.</p><p> Bandits and biodiversity</p><p> Patricia Wright, a professor of anthropology, has spent more than 30 years working in Ranomafana. She directs the Centre Valbio, an internationally renowned conservation research centre situated on the edge of the forest. She said:</p><p> The security situation is at crisis point. This is leading to real human suffering in one of the most important places for biodiversity on the planet. The [murdered policeman] was smart, dedicated to his job and was interested in wildlife and the importance of the forest. A genuine friend. We will miss him.</p><p> The recent death comes just months after a member of Valbio staff was killed by bandits. Jean Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Razafindraibe was killed when armed men raided his village close to the park entrance in June 2018.</p><p> Ranomafana National Park was established by the Malagasy government to protect its globally important biodiversity. As part of the Forests of Atsinanana it is home to a number of critically endangered endemic lemurs such as the golden bamboo lemur and the black-and-white ruffed lemur.</p><p> Ranomafana is a popular tourist spot in Madagascar with stunning scenery, rare wildlife and the friendly, sleepy town nearby. So far the insecurity hasn\u2019t influenced tourism. As Wright says:</p><p> The bandits steer clear of tourists, but the villagers are living a life of fear.</p><p> Gold mining\u2019s dark influence</p><p> Miners panning for gold illegally in the forest interior are a source of the insecurity. This has been an ongoing issue for many years but has become much more difficult for the park authorities to control. The miners pollute rivers, clear the rare swamp forest and hunt endangered wildlife for meat.</p><p> The situation is complicated. Armed cattle thieves known as dahalo are causing havoc in many areas of Madagascar. A recent estimate suggests they have caused 4,000 deaths in the last five years alone.</p><p> In 2017, the mayor of the neighbouring town of Ambalakindresy, Elys\u00e9 Ars\u00e8ne Ratsimbazafy, was shot dead in what is widely believed to have been a hit. He had run for election on a platform of ridding the town of the bandits and had cooperated with efforts to get the miners expelled from the national park interior.</p><p> Mar Cabeza, a professor of biology at the University of Helsinki, returned from the area a few days ago. She said:</p><p> The gold mining has escalated in recent years and differs greatly from previous subsistence-related threats. The widespread fear has negatively affected both research and conservation management.</p><p> One of Cabeza\u2019s PhD students, Marketta Vuola, was meant to conduct research in the attacked villages recently, but was warned of the danger and moved to another village. Vuola told me:</p><p> News spread fast, with all villages in the region being afraid. We spent last night hiding, with our day packs ready to escape to the forest.</p><p> There has been a robust response to the recent series of attacks. The district quickly sent reinforcements of 80 police. This will hopefully reassure the local population, allowing people to return to their village, and will reduce the immediate threat.</p><p> This reassurance is essential as my old friend Koto* told me over the phone:</p><p> People need to be able to get back home to tend their crops; if they can\u2019t do this they will suffer even more.</p><p> However the rise in insecurity reflects a wider problem of respect for the rule of law in Madagascar. Jonah Ratsimbazafy, a professor of paleontology at the University of Antananarivo in Madagascar, said:</p><p> If you focus on what is happening, then you will lose your hope for Madagascar. We must focus on the solutions. Good governance is crucial in order to develop the economy of Madagascar and for saving the irreplaceable biodiversity.</p><p> Madagascar will elect a new president on December 19. People in Bevoahazo, and throughout Madagascar, are hoping that the new government can bring the change so desperately needed.</p><p> * Names changed to protect identities.</p><p> GOP House leader notes gap of distrust as Google CEO grilled</p><p> By MARCY GORDON</p><p>AP Business Writer</p><p> Tuesday, December 11</p><p> WASHINGTON (AP)  House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy kicked off a congressional grilling of Google CEO Sundar Pichai by noting a \u201cwidening gap of distrust\u201d between tech companies and the American people.</p><p> McCarthy, a California Republican, asked whether tech companies are \u201cserving as instruments of freedom or instruments of control\u201d in the U.S. and beyond.</p><p> Pichai is facing the Republican-majority House Judiciary Committee before Democrats take control of the House in January. Lawmakers are asking him about alleged bias in the company\u2019s search results, as well as its reported plans to launch a censored search engine in China.</p><p> Pichai\u2019s appearance comes after he angered members of a Senate panel in September by declining their invitation to testify about foreign governments\u2019 manipulation of online services to sway U.S. elections. Pichai\u2019s no-show at that hearing was marked by an empty chair for Google alongside the Facebook and Twitter executives who did appear.</p><p> Pichai went to Washington later in September to mend fences, meeting with some two dozen Republicans and indicating he also planned to meet with Democrats. He took part last week in a White House meeting with other tech industry executives that focused mainly on getting government and businesses working more closely on accelerating emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.</p><p> In October, Google announced it was shutting down its long-shunned Plus social network following its disclosure of a flaw discovered in March that could have exposed some personal information of as many as 500,000 people. The company deliberately avoided disclosing the privacy lapse at the time, in part to avoid drawing regulators\u2019 scrutiny and damaging its reputation, according to a Wall Street Journal report citing anonymous individuals and documents.</p><p> Lawmakers want Google to explain its failure to reveal the breach.</p><p> On Monday, the company said it was accelerating its plans to shutter Plus after discovering a privacy flaw that inadvertently exposed the names, email addresses, ages and other personal information of 52.5 million users last month. The service will now go dark in April instead of August, as previously announced.</p><p> \u201cWe work hard to ensure the integrity of our products, and we\u2019ve put a number of checks and balances in place to ensure they continue to live up to our standards,\u201d Pichai said in his opening statement prepared for Tuesday\u2019s hearing.</p><p> Lawmakers are also concerned by recent reports that Google is poised to re-enter China with a search engine generating censored results to comply with the demands of that country\u2019s Communist government.</p><p> President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has accused Google of rigging the results of its dominant search engine to suppress conservative viewpoints and highlight coverage from media that he says distribute \u201cfake news.\u201d That\u2019s another area of potential questions to Pichai by committee members.</p><p> The company has denied any political bias, and there\u2019s no evidence of an anti-conservative tilt. Pichai said in his written testimony that \u201cI lead this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way. To do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests.\u201d</p><p>Google has good reason to communicate with lawmakers and policymakers, and to seek to weigh in on thorny issues. Trump and some lawmakers have raised the possibility of asking regulators to investigate whether Google  which handles nearly two of every three online searches in the U.S.  has abused its clout as a major gateway to the internet to stifle competition.</p><p> And momentum is building in Congress for legislation to put stricter limits and privacy protections around the big tech companies\u2019 collection of data. With the Democrats having captured control of the House in the midterm elections, and poised to take over as the majority running the Judiciary Committee next month, tougher legislation could be in the offing.</p><p> Pichai, a former engineer, took the helm of Google in 2015 in a major restructuring that made Google a division of conglomerate Alphabet Inc.  whose businesses include Waymo, a self-driving technology development company. Bolstering the dominance of its search engine, Google\u2019s Android operating system runs most of the world\u2019s smartphones, and its other services  including Gmail, YouTube, online ads and the Chrome web browser  are widely used.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOH-121929179</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289A92EA5CDD23 NWBKOH2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V03-M4K1-DXVP-V1PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3822\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 AIM Media Midwest Operating, LLC<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It takes about 19 minutes to hear, and less than half that to read. Trump's letter will surely go down in history as a benchmark in the battle for We the People versus Big-Government politicians in both parties, their Deep-State apparatchiks, Big-Tech posers, their servile Big Media, and elitist Left-Wing academicians. It looks like We the People finally have one of our own in the White House. No wonder so many fearful guardians of the status quo are working so hard to remove him from office. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/380300245\">https://player.vimeo.com/video/380300245</url>[1]From the White House, Washington DC, December 17, 2019 To: The Honorable Nancy PelosiSpeaker of the House of RepresentativesWashington, D.C. 20515 Dear Madam Speaker: I write to express my strongest and most powerful protest against the partisan impeachment crusade being pursued by the Democrats in the House of Representatives. This impeachment represents an unprecedented and unconstitutional abuse of power by Democrat Lawmakers, unequaled in nearly two and a half centuries of American legislative history. The Articles of Impeachment introduced by the House Judiciary Committee are not recognizable under any standard of Constitutional theory, interpretation, or jurisprudence. They include no crimes, no misdemeanors, and no offenses whatsoever. You have cheapened the importance of the very ugly word, impeachment! By proceeding with your invalid impeachment, you are violating your oaths of office, you are breaking your allegiance to the Constitution, and you are declaring open war on American Democracy. You dare to invoke the Founding Fathers in pursuit of this election-nullification scheme\u2014yet your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for America's founding and your egregious conduct threatens to destroy that which our Founders pledged their very lives to build. Even worse than offending the Founding Fathers, you are offending Americans of faith by continually saying 'I pray for the President,' when you know this statement is not true, unless it is meant in a negative sense. It is a terrible thing you are doing, but you will have to live with it, not I! Your first claim, 'Abuse of Power,' is a completely disingenuous, meritless, and baseless invention of your imagination. You know that I had a totally innocent conversation with the President of Ukraine. I then had a second conversation that has been misquoted, mischaracterized, and fraudulently misrepresented. Fortunately, there was a transcript of the conversation taken, and you know from the transcript (which was immediately made available) that the paragraph in question was perfect. I said to President Zelensky: 'I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.' I said do us a favor, not me, and our country, not a campaign. I then mentioned the Attorney General of the United States. Every time I talk with a foreign leader, I put America's interests first, just as I did with President Zelensky. You are turning a policy disagreement between two branches of government into an impeachable offense\u2014it is no more legitimate than the Executive Branch charging members of Congress with crimes for the lawful exercise of legislative power. You know full well that Vice President Biden used his office and $1 billion dollars of U.S. aid money to coerce Ukraine into firing the prosecutor who was digging into the company paying his son millions of dollars. You know this because Biden bragged about it on video. Biden openly stated: 'I said, 'I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars'I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.' Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.' Even Joe Biden admitted just days ago in an interview with NPR that it 'looked bad.' Now you are trying to impeach me by falsely accusing me of doing what Joe Biden has admitted he actually did. President Zelensky has repeatedly declared that I did nothing wrong, and that there was No Pressure. He further emphasized that it was a 'good phone call,' that 'I don't feel pressure,' and explicitly stressed that 'nobody pushed me.' The Ukrainian Foreign Minister stated very clearly: 'I have never seen a direct link between investigations and security assistance.' He also said there was 'No Pressure.' Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a supporter of Ukraine who met privately with President Zelensky, has said: 'At no time during this meetingwas there any mention by Zelensky or any Ukrainian that they were feeling pressure to do anything in return for the military aid.' Many meetings have been held between representatives of Ukraine and our country. Never once did Ukraine complain about pressure being applied\u2014not once! Ambassador Sondland testified that I told him: 'No quid pro quo. I want nothing. I want nothing. I want President Zelensky to do the right thing, do what he ran on.' The second claim, so-called 'Obstruction of Congress,' is preposterous and dangerous. House Democrats are trying to impeach the duly elected President of the United States for asserting Constitutionally based privileges that have been asserted on a bipartisan basis by administrations of both political parties throughout our Nation's history. Under that standard, every American president would have been impeached many times over. As liberal law professor Jonathan Turley warned when addressing Congressional Democrats: 'I can't emphasize this enoughif you impeach a president, if you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it is an abuse of power. It's your abuse of power. You're doing precisely what you're criticizing the President for doing.' Everyone, you included, knows what is really happening. Your chosen candidate lost the election in 2016, in an Electoral College landslide (306-227), and you and your party have never recovered from this defeat. You have developed a full-fledged case of what many in the media call Trump Derangement Syndrome and sadly, you will never get over it! You are unwilling and unable to accept the verdict issued at the ballot box during the great Election of 2016. So you have spent three straight years attempting to overturn the will of the American people and nullify their votes. You view democracy as your enemy! Speaker Pelosi, you admitted just last week at a public forum that your party's impeachment effort has been going on for 'two and a half years,' long before you ever heard about a phone call with Ukraine. Nineteen minutes after I took the oath of office, the Washington Post published a story headlined, 'The Campaign to Impeach President Trump Has Begun.' Less than three months after my inauguration, Representative Maxine Waters stated, 'I'm going to fight every day until he's impeached.' House Democrats introduced the first impeachment resolution against me within months of my inauguration, for what will be regarded as one of our country's best decisions, the firing of James Comey (see Inspector General Reports)\u2014who the world now knows is one of the dirtiest cops our Nation has ever seen. A ranting and raving Congresswoman, Rashida Tlaib, declared just hours after she was sworn into office, 'We're gonna go in there and we're gonna impeach the motherf****r.' Representative Al Green said in May, 'I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get re-elected.' Again, you and your allies said, and did, all of these things long before you ever heard of President Zelensky or anything related to Ukraine. As you know very well, this impeachment drive has nothing to do with Ukraine, or the totally appropriate conversation I had with its new president. It only has to do with your attempt to undo the election of 2016 and steal the election of 2020! Congressman Adam Schiff cheated and lied all the way up to the present day, even going so far as to fraudulently make up, out of thin air, my conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine and read this fantasy language to Congress as though it were said by me. His shameless lies and deceptions, dating all the way back to the Russia Hoax, is one of the main reasons we are here today. You and your party are desperate to distract from America's extraordinary economy, incredible jobs boom, record stock market, soaring confidence, and flourishing citizens. Your party simply cannot compete with our record: 7 million new jobs; the lowest-ever unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans; a rebuilt military; a completely reformed VA with Choice and Accountability for our great veterans; more than 170 new federal judges and two Supreme Court Justices; historic tax and regulation cuts; the elimination of the individual mandate; the first decline in prescription drug prices in half a century; the first new branch of the United States Military since 1947, the Space Force; strong protection of the Second Amendment; criminal justice reform; a defeated ISIS caliphate and the killing of the world's number one terrorist leader, al-Baghdadi; the replacement of the disastrous NAFTA trade deal with the wonderful USMCA (Mexico and Canada); a breakthrough Phase One trade deal with China; massive new trade deals with Japan and South Korea; withdrawal from the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal; cancellation of the unfair and costly Paris Climate Accord; becoming the world's top energy producer; recognition of Israel's capital, opening the American Embassy in Jerusalem, and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights; a colossal reduction in illegal border crossings, the ending of Catch-and-Release, and the building of the Southern Border Wall\u2014and that is just the beginning, there is so much more. You cannot defend your extreme policies\u2014open borders, mass migration, high crime, crippling taxes, socialized healthcare, destruction of American energy, late-term taxpayer-funded abortion, elimination of the Second Amendment, radical far-left theories of law and justice, and constant partisan obstruction of both common sense and common good. There is nothing I would rather do than stop referring to your party as the Do-Nothing Democrats. Unfortunately, I don't know that you will ever give me a chance to do so. After three years of unfair and unwarranted investigations, 45 million dollars spent, 18 angry Democrat prosecutors, the entire force of the FBI, headed by leadership now proven to be totally incompetent and corrupt, you have found NOTHING! Few people in high position could have endured or passed this test. You do not know, nor do you care, the great damage and hurt you have inflicted upon wonderful and loving members of my family. You conducted a fake investigation upon the democratically elected President of the United States, and you are doing it yet again. There are not many people who could have taken the punishment inflicted during this period of time, and yet done so much for the success of America and its citizens. But instead of putting our country first, you have decided to disgrace our country still further. You completely failed with the Mueller report because there was nothing to find, so you decided to take the next hoax that came along, the phone call with Ukraine\u2014even though it was a perfect call. And by the way, when I speak to foreign countries, there are many people, with permission, listening to the call on both sides of the conversation. You are the ones interfering in America's elections. You are the ones subverting America's Democracy. You are the ones Obstructing Justice. You are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our Republic for your own selfish personal, political, and partisan gain. Before the Impeachment Hoax, it was the Russian Witch Hunt. Against all evidence, and regardless of the truth, you and your deputies claimed that my campaign colluded with the Russians\u2014a grave, malicious, and slanderous lie, a falsehood like no other. You forced our Nation through turmoil and torment over a wholly fabricated story, illegally purchased from a foreign spy by Hillary Clinton and the DNC in order to assault our democracy. Yet, when the monstrous lie was debunked and this Democrat conspiracy dissolved into dust, you did not apologize. You did not recant. You did not ask to be forgiven. You showed no remorse, no capacity for self-reflection. Instead, you pursued your next libelous and vicious crusade\u2014you engineered an attempt to frame and defame an innocent person. All of this was motivated by personal political calculation. Your Speakership and your party are held hostage by your most deranged and radical representatives of the far left. Each one of your members lives in fear of a socialist primary challenger\u2014this is what is driving impeachment. Look at Congressman Nadler's challenger. Look at yourself and others. Do not take our country down with your party. If you truly cared about freedom and liberty for our Nation, then you would be devoting your vast investigative resources to exposing the full truth concerning the FBI's horrifying abuses of power before, during, and after the 2016 election\u2014including the use of spies against my campaign, the submission of false evidence to a FISA court, and the concealment of exculpatory evidence in order to frame the innocent. The FBI has great and honorable people, but the leadership was inept and corrupt. I would think that you would personally be appalled by these revelations, because in your press conference the day you announced impeachment, you tied the impeachment effort directly to the completely discredited Russia Hoax, declaring twice that 'all roads lead to Putin,' when you know that is an abject lie. I have been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever even thought to be. Any member of Congress who votes in support of impeachment\u2014against every shred of truth, fact, evidence, and legal principle\u2014is showing how deeply they revile the voters and how truly they detest America's Constitutional order. Our Founders feared the tribalization of partisan politics, and you are bringing their worst fears to life. Worse still, I have been deprived of basic Constitutional Due Process from the beginning of this impeachment scam right up until the present. I have been denied the most fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution, including the right to present evidence, to have my own counsel present, to confront accusers, and to call and cross-examine witnesses, like the so-called whistleblower who started this entire hoax with a false report of the phone call that bears no relationship to the actual phone call that was made. Once I presented the transcribed call, which surprised and shocked the fraudsters (they never thought that such evidence would be presented), the so-called whistleblower, and the second whistleblower, disappeared because they got caught, their report was a fraud, and they were no longer going to be made available to us. In other words, once the phone call was made public, your whole plot blew up, but that didn't stop you from continuing. More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials. You and others on your committees have long said impeachment must be bipartisan\u2014it is not. You said it was very divisive\u2014it certainly is, even far more than you ever thought possible\u2014and it will only get worse! This is nothing more than an illegal, partisan attempted coup that will, based on recent sentiment, badly fail at the voting booth. You are not just after me, as President, you are after the entire Republican Party. But because of this colossal injustice, our party is more united than it has ever been before. History will judge you harshly as you proceed with this impeachment charade. Your legacy will be that of turning the House of Representatives from a revered legislative body into a Star Chamber of partisan persecution. Perhaps most insulting of all is your false display of solemnity. You apparently have so little respect for the American People that you expect them to believe that you are approaching this impeachment somberly, reservedly, and reluctantly. No intelligent person believes what you are saying. Since the moment I won the election, the Democrat Party has been possessed by Impeachment Fever. There is no reticence. This is not a somber affair. You are making a mockery of impeachment and you are scarcely concealing your hatred of me, of the Republican Party, and tens of millions of patriotic Americans. The voters are wise, and they are seeing straight through this empty, hollow, and dangerous game you are playing. I have no doubt the American people will hold you and the Democrats fully responsible in the upcoming 2020 election. They will not soon forgive your perversion of justice and abuse of power. There is far too much that needs to be done to improve the lives of our citizens. It is time for you and the highly partisan Democrats in Congress to immediately cease this impeachment fantasy and get back to work for the American People. While I have no expectation that you will do so, I write this letter to you for the purpose of history and to put my thoughts on a permanent and indelible record. One hundred years from now, when people look back at this affair, I want them to understand it, and learn from it, so that it can never happen to another President again. Sincerely yours, DONALD J.
